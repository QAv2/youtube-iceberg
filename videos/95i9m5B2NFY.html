            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>welcome to APAC it&#x27;s June 10th and I&#x27;m your moderator Tim Ventura first I&#x27;d like to thank everyone for joining us on this call along with everyone watching us on YouTube

will provide news headlines on their top stories and we&#x27;ll be finishing off the event with a panel discussion of today&#x27;s topics so a couple of quick updates before we begin we have a lot of changes and there are many many things going on as many of you know we closed Apec after a two-year conference Series in January 2023. we brought it back by popular demand people have been asking us and there is so much going on that we just had to start doing these again we do have a few changes though we are trying to do webinars webinars through stream yard every month and open discussion through zoom two weeks after each webinar this lets us keep the presentations free of distractions and gives our open discussion sessions the flexibility to focus on a wider variety of topics Apec is open it&#x27;s inclusive and for over two years we have been the community center for warp drive gravity control and UAP UFO reverse engineering physics the bleeding edge lives here so if you&#x27;re watching us today and you still haven&#x27;t registered for the conference visit altrepulsion.com now and register today&#x27;s event uses stream yard we&#x27;re broadcasting through the alt propulsion YouTube channel you can ask questions using the live chat feature on the right hand side of the YouTube page we will ask them to our presenters Depending on time constraints you can always view conference replays details and speaker info on our website again all propulsion.com I also want to encourage you to check out our Media Partners these are conference supporters helping us promote APAC they cover many of the same topics that we do on their channels after the lab updates I&#x27;m going to invite our Media Partners on to talk about their latest stories again there is so much going on in this community it&#x27;s amazing right now so please check out the Media Partners on our website and our Lab Partners and these have been with us since the beginning APAC is always represented a mixture of theory and design along with Hands-On experimentation and Engineering we are now listing our Lab Partners on the alt propulsion website and after our presentations we&#x27;ll be doing brief updates from them on their latest progress and our Lab Partners are going to have a much larger role in the open mic session coming up in two weeks so without any further Ado I want to introduce our first Speaker Dr Michael G Anderson the lead pulsed power scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Labs we&#x27;ll be discussing his design for a warp reactor con concept wonderful Michael can you hear me I hear you can you hear me yes I can let me add I believe it&#x27;s called slide one let me add this to the stream okay and you should be able to scroll through that all right well thank you Tim and the Apec members for giving me this opportunity to present at this year&#x27;s webinar and and your space space time igniting introduction so let&#x27;s go ahead and go and uh greetings everyone I&#x27;m going to turn off my my cam just because of bandwidth concerns um but okay and I&#x27;ll remove mine as well and we will we&#x27;ll start rolling now all right so on behalf of my team I would like to thank you for attending our warp reactor concept presentation also please be advised that a version of this talk and companion paper are scheduled to be presented at the 2023 IEEE pulse power conference later this month and respective longer Journal articles were submitted to the pre preprint online physics archive and physical review accelerator and beams along with the version I&#x27;ve uploaded here just for completeness uh full full disclaimer all errors and conjectures are mine and mine alone please do not hold my esteemed colleagues accountable for my mistakes and outrageous claims so our agenda will be as follows I will initially introduce my team warp colleagues then provide our motivation and Novelty of the warp reactor along with its strategic importance I will then go over relevant warp physics pulse power technology and overall reactor concept we will then review the warp machine metrics and operation scenarios followed by modeling and simulation results for Target parameters and finally conclude with the summary and question q a session if space-time permits so presently team warp consists of six primary individuals with over a hundred years of combined education and professional experience in pulse power plasma and accelerator physics r d from field reverse configurations and charged particle beams for driving controlled thermonuclear Fusion to lightning EMP simulators directed energy weapons and Next Generation accelerator technology for Flash X-ray and neutron radiography Dynamic object interrogation techniques and combined magnetic and inertial fusion devices I am the principal investigator with expertise in the pulse power based accelerator and plasma physics Dr William steigar is our resident distinguished scientist with expertise and pulse power modeling and simulation Dr Anthony link leads our multi-physics modeling and simulation group Mr James Kurt Walters leads our pulse power design and engineering team Mr Enrique Anaya is our lead controls and Diagnostics technician and last but not least Mr Donald Max is our pulse power assembly and operations technician so the warp reactor concept promises orders of magnitude increase of intense ion beam energies and respective radiation yields at a fraction of the size and cost over existing z-pinch class accelerators allowing the economically viable study of new relativistic high energy density or red physics regimes for probing the intersection between general relativity and Quantum field Theory for instance warp unroot and Casimir effects along with game-changing direct applications from rep rated magnetized liner inertial Fusion or mag lift devices for energy production and advanced propulsion to multi-pulse compact flash X-ray and neutron radiography sources for assessing our nation&#x27;s aging nuclear weapons stockpile of particular interest to this conference may be my following conjectures on how we may be able to enhance space-time curvature coupling via One the multi-layer red plasma and charged particle ring confinement of terahertz radiation to create plasma ring metamaterial effects two as methyl acceleration Beyond unru threshold of the red plasma and charged particle rings to generate light and frost like Vortex layers which create space-time phase transition and three implosion beyond the Casimir threshold of the red plasma and charged particle rings to generate internal negative energy densities which also provides additional confinement mechanism to the generated 5000 or more Tesla magnetic fields in order to prevent plasma ring metamaterial rapid disassembly warp achieves this dramatic performance boost by using a novel warp core which injects two tubular IM beams from opposite ends of a double-barreled dense plasma Focus or DPF head through magnetic cusps to form rotating iron rings which merge near the mid plane of the device and are subsequently radially compressed and as mutually accelerated up to a thousand times the initial ion beam energies during the properly timed DPF plasma liner implosion two DPF and iron ring marks generators or irmgs heads with embedded reflex triodes are implemented to dramatically reduce the size and cost of the drivers and increase iron ring capture efficiency along with the added benefits of favorable magnetic field line curvature throughout the implosion process due to the higher velocity Shear stabilized pinch flows near each gun muzzle and greater tuning capability for properly timing the implosion and iron beam generation injection compression of the two colliding subsequently merged iron Rings onto a solid or high energy density plasma Target orp directly aligns with the doe and the nnsa missions and core competencies as an economically viable and climate-friendly rep rated mag lift device for nuclear fusion energy production as well as a multi-pulse complex compact flash x-ray Neutron source for assessing our aging nuclear weapons stockpile in addition to developing the Next Generation pulse power architectures this strategic initiative will help to Benchmark present high performance Computing simulation and data science with respect to more disruptive and imaginative ultra-intense plasma beam configurations finally warp success would fortify ll&#x27;s place at the Forefront of the subsequent relativistic high energy density physics Revolution and AKA space-time metric engineering the physics behind the charged particle ring radial compression and as Mutual acceleration in the warp core is as follows DPF plasma liner driven magnetic flux compression creates a magnetic wave which causes charged particle rings to radially compress via the lorentz force and due to the conservation of canonical angular momentum and adiabatic flux conservation condition the charged particle ring as muthal velocities scale as the initial ring radius to the final radius for a gamma equal to one and therefore the final charged particle ring energy scales of this as the initial ring energy times the square of the initial ring radius to the final ring radius or as the initial ring energy times the ratio of the final to initial magnetic field amplitudes for relativistic charged particle motion and pulsed magnetic fields gamma varies due to the curl of the electric field which is equal to the change in the magnetic field with time the principal formulas used in the warp reactor conceptual models and simulations are provided here for quick reference which are the standard plasma physics equations for the number of fusion generated neutrons plasma to Magnetic pressure total Fusion Energy plasma energy brimster lung and synchrotron radiation scientific and Engineering gains Fusion Energy for sale magnetic reconnection time scales and plasma and particle beam propagation modes in addition to the standard relativistic formulas we also introduce a modified Einstein field equation with a naive quantum gravity addition that may be accessible by the warp reactor for verification or invalidation of the theory along with figures of Merit such as space-time curvature gravitational potential and frame dragging effects okay GMU Nu is the Einstein curvature tensor and T mu Nu is the energy momentum tensor 8 Pi G divided by C to the fourth is the energy momentum to curvature coupling constant in vacuum and without quantum gravity effects s captures the sarfati plasma metamateral effects a captures the Anderson unru Casimir threshold effects and according to Sutherland t-hat is the energy momentum operator PSI and PSI star are the initial and final conjugate wave functions respectively and the braquette of F and I are the final and initial boundary conditions with respect to the figures of Merit m is the ring Mass R is the is the ring radius I is the ring moment of inertia and the small Omega is the ring angular velocity and I apologize there looks like there&#x27;s some mess up here but I can I can send a PDF that has the the corrected values here it&#x27;s also in the paper uh the the warp reactor utilizes tried and true Shiva star-like Tempest marks modules to drive its dual dense plasma Focus head and state-of-the-art impedance matched marks generators or linear Transformer drivers for rapid rate rep rate operations to drive the dual charge particle beam ring reflex triodes shown here is a slide is a side view of the full-scale warp reactor which is about 60 feet long and about 30 feet in diameter shown here is an end on view of the warp reactor showing the asmutally symmetric Tempest modules with flexible high voltage coaxial cables connections to the central core shown here is a cross-sectional view of the warp reactor which consists primarily of 40 Tempest modules and two iron ring marks generators and a central warp core which I will go into more detail in the following slides 40 Tempest marks modules Drive the Dual DPF heads each module is a more robust version of the Shiva star design with an upgraded 1.2 Mega amp rail Gap switch a seismically rated welded frame capacitor assembly along with the modified high voltage output header for the flexible High current coaxial cable connections each tempus module is primarily comprised of four super duty rail Gap switches aluminum parallel plate transmission lines and 24 high energy density capacitors with the total energy stored per module of 260 kilojoules and therefore for total of 40 module Tempest system of greater than 10 megajoules capable of delivering 60 Mega amps to the dense plasma Focus loads two iron ring marks generators Drive the Dual reflex triodes heads for single pulse operation each irmg is a 30 stage impedance match marks generator or IMG on steroids or a linear Transformer driver an LTD for Rapid ret rate operation the IMG version consists primarily of 30 segmented coaxial return spools a continuous tapered inner high voltage stock coronatoroid and 40 bricks per stage with each brick being comprised of two capacitors and a high performance spark gap switch each irmg is capable of producing a megavolt a mega amp and 100 nanosecond pulse to The Reflex triode with the total energy storage for the two irmg system of two megajoules depicted here is a cross-sectional view of the novel warp core it&#x27;s roughly a meter long end to end and roughly a half a meter in diameter the relatively large red white and blue squares situated around the grounded vacuum chamber represent the B insulation the B seed and the B cusp pulse magnets whereas the small blue squares next to the magnets and internal light blue rectangles are the annular DPF and irmg puff valves respectively The Tempest modules attached to the warp core at the DPF collection plate on the left and right end of the device whereas the iron ring marks generators connect to the the two back ends of the Dual reflex triodes through the irmg post post hole convolutes finally the primary warp core and most novel Central components consist of the coaxial dual DPF and irmg heads with embedded reflex triodes this table the upper and lower tables show the major pulse power parameters and DPF plasma liner and ion beam ring metrics along with order of magnitude comparisons with one of the largest ion beam accelerators in recent times pbfa2 the warp X prototype is a 1 10 scale version of the full-scale reactor which can deliver up to five Mega amps in less than three microseconds into a DPF plasma liner whereas the four stage prototype version of the iron ring marks generators can generate initial iron beam energies and currents of up to 400 KV and 200 kilo amps respectively the bottom table provides a comparison of plasma liner beam and iron ring parameters between pbf82 and z and the warp devices with the 60 Mega amp warp reactor machine showing orders of magnitude increase in imbeam energy at the gev level and currents at the 20 Mega amp level at implosion stagnation with the 25 acceleration efficiency shown here are cross sections of the warp core at different phases during operations phase one begins with the creation of the B insulation B seed and B cusp magnetic fields to ensure full B field diffusion through the metal structures along with gas injection via the DPF and irmg annular puff valves and subsequent firing of the Tempest modules to initiate dual DPF plasmoid generation lift off and rundown phase two occurs as the two dpfs begin their run-in sequence and the irmgs are fired to produce the Dual tubular ion beams phase three is when the DPS return currents have merged and the Dual actually directed ion beams have passed through their respective B cusp fields to begin co-rotating and merged iron rings in the embedded B seed field phase four is the DPF plasma liner implosion sequence which provides the necessary flux compression and subsequent iron ring pinch and as muthal acceleration and finally phase five is the implosion stagnation phase and relativistic high energy density ring and Target interaction sequence for Fusion energy production Advanced propulsion superflash x-ray Neutron generation and accessing the new red physics regimes so here I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s probably going to play nope um we could probably jump out or let&#x27;s see if I can pull the movie in it won&#x27;t let me Tim [Music] foreign thank you [Music] so thanks Tim we can go back to the to the presentation um sorry that didn&#x27;t work out as well as I thought it would but uh anyway so next up we have uh to help Benchmark uh our warp reactors plasma liner implosion simulations we compared them to the semi-analytical model for magnetized liner inertial Fusion outlined by Dr McBride and at the University of Michigan and Dr  from Sandia which can be used to reproduce the general 1D behavior of the mag lift machines this model accounts for several key aspects of magliff including the preheat of the fuel pulse power driven liner implosion liner compressibility with an analytical equation of State viscosity internal magnetic pressure ohmic heating adiabatic compression and heating of the fuel radiative losses and fuel opacities magnetic flux compression with thermoelectric losses magnetize electron and iron thermal conduction losses end losses enhanced losses due to containment or contaminant mixes deuterium deuterium and deuterium tritium primary Fusion reactions for different fuel ratios and finally magnetize alpha particle fuel Heating furthermore in order to facilitate the comparisons between our multi-physic simulations and semi-analytical models we have created a simplified version of the mag lift model in Mathematica for quickly optimizing warp reactor performance in addition to the multi-physics models and simulations we of course have 3D CAD engineering models with Associated finite element analysis for electrical and mechanical stresses along with circuit models and simulations for the Tempest system the irmgs both the single pulse IMG and the rep rated LTD varieties and warp core Dynamic loads due to Resource and computational constraints this simulation was performed for a mini warp core in the Chicago particle in cell code in hybrid kinetic mode where the electrons are treated as inertialist fluid using mhd equations for the electron response while the ions are treated as kinetic particles the top right figure is a graph of the RB Theta or radially enclosed current whereas the bottom right image is a graph of the respective plasma density at a specific time and both as functions of radial and axial positions in centimeters the left figure again is a movie which I&#x27;ll have Tim if you can pull the warp simulation into the into view of the of the Dual DPF plasma generation run down interaction and eventual implosion phase and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s it so we can go back to the presentation Tim thank you so this table is meant to capture the magnetic reconnection occurs on sub microsecond time scales with respect to the dense plasma Focus plasmoids characteristics as they propagate through their respective because field regions and just over a microsecond time scale for the plasmoids to collide with one another at the midplane of the warp core this slide shows the various DPF and imbeam propagation mechanisms the top left figure is the propagation criteria for Collective mode while the bottom left figure captures the dense plasma Focus diamagnetic drift mode for this particular parameter regime the middle table shows the I am being propagates in the collective mode unless the polarization electric field is shorted by background electrons finally the right table displays the reflex triode and initial ion beam parameters along with final compression and accelerations of particular interest for accessing the new red regime and space-time metric engineering the electron ring mode of operation may be capable of reaching final compression radius and accelerations of sub microns scale and greater than 10 to the 23 meters per second squared the left table on this slide captures the major iron compression and acceleration metrics while the right side displays the overall fusion and radiation parameters of particular note is the final iron ring major radius at final implosion stagnation reaches the millimeter scale and at gev level as Mutual energies for both for all protons deuterons and tritons with respect to the fusion and radiation parameters the peak X-ray and DT Fusion Neutron yield reach 3.5 megajoules and 6.6 10 to the 18 neutrons per pulse respectively with an overall scientific gain of greater than 19. in addition to the Fusion Energy and x-ray Neutron radiation applications the warp reactor is also primed for accessing new relativistic high energy density regimes the 60 Mega amp DPF plasma liner with embedded gev level iron Rings appear capable of reaching thousands of Tesla and subsequently multi-terropascal pressures those are the pressures that are found deep inside Jupiter due to the dramatic compression and acceleration of the charged particle Rings the plasma liner Target interactions may even begin to generate significant plasma metamaterial unru and dynamic Casimir effects not to mention copious amounts of synchrotron radiation from electron ring modes of operations furthermore once the charged particle Rings become relativistic during the final moments of the implosion phase the decrease in ring radius saturates as the relativistic mass increases in other words flux compression shifts from ring velocity to ring mass or enhance space-time coupling finally the warp reactor may also provide a means for accessing the quantum gravity domain for verification or invalidation of various proposed theories by probing for any space-time curvature or frame frame dragging effects of particular interest to this conference is that warp may be capable of reaching s and a fields of greater than 10 to the 31 and therefore significant space-time curvature and frame dragging effects the plasma frequencies can be greater than 10 to the 15 radians per second plasma relative permittivities of of 10 to the 16 or greater and energy momentum of greater than 10 to the 17. foreign so in conclusion we envisioned the warp reactor as a more compact modular and economically viable Magneto inertial Fusion device for energy production Advanced propulsion and or super radiant flash x-rays Neutron source for dynamic radiographic applications along with providing access to the new relativistic high energy density physics regimes the warp device would fulfill the immediate need for an intermediate level machine for z-pinch beam and pulse power flow studies along with added benefit of recruiting the next generation of red plasma and accelerator scientists and engineers and technicians finally warp would be an ideal platform for prototyping novel pulse power architectures for continuous rep rate nuclear fusion and radiographic movie operations thereby enabling us to continue our collaborations across the doe and DOD complexes along with forging new Private Industry Partners through our crata and strategic partnership programs below is a list of present and possible future collaborators and if you&#x27;re at all interested please reach out because there&#x27;s much to be done to reiterate my conjectures of the enhanced space-time curvature coupling mechanism we have one the multi-layer red plasma and charged particle Rings confined terahertz radiation to create plasma ring meta material effects via the sarfati scale scalar field and number two as methyl acceleration beyond the unroof threshold of the red plasma and charged particle rings generate light and frost like Vortex layers which create space-time phase transition and three implosion beyond the Casimir threshold of the red plasma and charged particle Rings generate internal negative energy density which also provides additional confinement mechanism to the greater than 5000 Tesla magnetic fields in order to prevent plasma ring metamaterial rapid disassembly via the Anderson scalar field finally I leave you with the following experiment I call a twisted compression of the air infest paradox imagine you were one of a multitude of Elementary charged particles which make up a rotating high energy density charge current neutralized particle ring embedded within an axial seed magnetic field that is radially compressed towards zero radius and as mutually accelerated to ultra relativistic velocity during sufficient flux compression according to you and a nearby inertial Observer what happens to the local space-time surrounding said ring vortex at the end of the implosion phase so thank you again for your attendance and attention also a plethora of references can be found at the end of this slide package and I can open it up now looks like we have time for any questions of course that I can answer in this forum thank you okay uh Michael it&#x27;s Tim again and let me see it so and again let me apologize I&#x27;m still getting used to this software uh although I really love stream yard to be honest the more I use this the the more I like it um and if so uh do you think you could turn your camera back on I was gonna ask about that um wonderful presentation so uh normally we we clap let me let me try and bring folks in here uh we have let me see we have I&#x27;ll add Mark to the stream I will add if it&#x27;s okay let me add Gary I will add David and I&#x27;ll add Jared and then I will uh let me let me remove the slideshow okay so everybody uh I guess let&#x27;s let&#x27;s give clap for Dr Michael G Anderson and again please forgive me I&#x27;m still getting used to all these new controls um do you guys have any questions I think that everybody is muted out but you guys can unmute yourselves if you have questions and I can take them from chat also I&#x27;m monitoring so uh here&#x27;s the private chat uh Gary I think you had a question right yeah I was wondering you know given your internet relativistic regime and you presented the Einstein&#x27;s general field equations uh whether you considered this device as a possible high frequency gravity gravitational wave a generator or Source object yeah yes that is a definite possibility um since since things are moving at relativistic speed and and in a circular fashion we definitely would be producing gravitational waves I I thought since probably yeah because you need a quadrupole moment and the third derivative of a quadruple moment it looks like you&#x27;re going to be generating one so oh yeah very interesting to to monitor that thank you yeah thank you wonderful and Gary thank you um so let me go into I&#x27;m I&#x27;m in the chat here so uh let me see uh gantic had a question uh he wondered if there have been many calculations on the stress tolerances on parts that would go into this yes there have there have been and that that&#x27;s through the finite element analysis and those stresses are mainly the magnetic stresses and the current stresses that are on the actual magnetic field coils and the vacuum chamber themselves along with the dense plasma Focus heads uh they they receive a significant impulse during this this operation um I should I should caveat all this that you know we&#x27;ve been we&#x27;ve been running dense plasma Focus experiments for the last uh six or seven years here at Lawrence Livermore National Lab in the the four Mega amp up to the four Mega amp regime and uh you know that that plasma is traveling fast enough and it pinches with enough force that it does punch punch uh dents inside the copper plates at the back end so those are things that need to be taken into account for sure ah okay uh let me see uh a person named The Killers and wondered what kind of gas you use with the ion density beam so we would be using deuterium and tritium type gases but there&#x27;s also the the option to use even heavier elements but initially it would be a deuterium deuterium beam oh okay sorry I&#x27;m just jumping around here and the chat keeps moving up so the question&#x27;s like as I read them they&#x27;re they&#x27;re leaving uh so Robert Lawson had asked if there&#x27;s a smaller scale version that you guys could build to demonstrate any of these principles absolutely yeah there&#x27;s definitely some smaller scale experiments that were actually doing now which we call both the mini and the micro DPF versions um just just to ensure that we haven&#x27;t missed anything so that&#x27;s a good point you know we are we are doing prototypes of smaller devices also ah okay and let me see it looks like uh so we actually we have chance Glenn Dr chance Glenn as well as uh Greg hodgin in our audience which is really exciting they&#x27;re from The zc Institute chance was asking um how we&#x27;re overcoming the negative energy density requirements as suggested by yellowcubierre yeah so that that is taken into account uh in the electron ring mode of operation where we can use the 5000 or greater Tesla magnetic fields on a relativistic ion uh electron sorry electron ring and compress that down below the the sub Micron scale to get a dynamic Casimir effect and so an internal negative energy density within that tubular type annular ring okay uh let me see and I&#x27;m trying to go through here um Charlotte Livingston had wondered about timing issues in this complicated pulse power device yeah the timing issues aren&#x27;t so dramatic as they are in the in let&#x27;s say the nif machine of the of the laser type I ICF type devices um here here things are happening on relatively long time scales for the types of switches and and controls that we&#x27;re using and and when I say relatively long time scales I&#x27;m talking about nanosecond time skills rather than picosecond or femtosecond like nif okay and uh let me see uh memes of Destruction had asked simply how do we avoid blowing ourselves up yeah [Laughter] don&#x27;t don&#x27;t uh don&#x27;t build uh a device much larger than the one that I&#x27;m for uh proposing well you know it is interesting right that&#x27;s one of the challenges with power devices like this is like stabilizing and when you know as you increase those energy densities okay I was just think about like Teslas right where the catch fire on the road and those batteries just burn and burn and burn so yeah so there&#x27;s definitely other types of uh Concepts that you know instead of just producing you know in the 10 megajoule range of of fusion energy production uh they&#x27;re talking about gigajoules which every time you fire that type of device the the load section has to be replaced so here here we&#x27;re hoping that we can build it strong enough and that we can actually have a rep rate type device ah okay um well again you know uh Mark or David Jared Gary if you guys want to jump in with questions go for it yeah I had a question uh would this be useful for space propulsion uh yes absolutely uh if we can start to to modify uh the space-time metric using this type of device um it&#x27;s definitely in the advanced or alt propulsion scenario but you could also just use it as a fusion rocket right I&#x27;m also how big do you envision the warp field being because if the field is inside the device then you might have shear and uh problems like that yeah well uh when we come up with the the the actual good good theory uh quantum gravity Theory then I can answer that question so initially we need to to do the experiment and see do we see any kind of uh space-time curvature or frame dragging effects to begin with so uh memes of Destruction had said uh it sounds like it&#x27;s mostly an engineering problem to solve rather than being kind of a fundamental physics issue I guess to build the device absolutely and you know we built uh we built the dense plasma Focus um we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve built the iron iron ring marks generators um now the the plan is to put it all together yeah this is so exciting and again Michael it is such an honor to have you here to present for us you know I so absolutely wonderful to have you here today yeah um just scrolling through questions uh Charlotte Livingston uh outed herself she said it&#x27;s actually George Hathaway using Charlotte&#x27;s computer so that&#x27;s okay yeah the magic of Internet anonymity and actually yeah we should thank George George just sent a bunch of components over to Mark&#x27;s lab so for those uh let me see it&#x27;s all right if I ask a question Tim yeah go for it Jared Jump On In excellent presentation I was wondering if you could uh just expound a little more on what you mean by plasma metamaterials does that mean that the plasma is taking on new you know geometric shapes and you&#x27;re getting weird types of permeabilities permittivities and what&#x27;s going on when you say that that&#x27;s exactly correct so it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s not just a single plasma ring or tube that&#x27;s compressing uh from the magnetic forces it&#x27;s it&#x27;s also it&#x27;s a multi-layer uh plasma and iron ring combination so that any any of the electron ring generated uh synchrotron radiation which is going to be a significant pulse will be captured inside those layers and that&#x27;s that terahertz kind of interaction between the meta The Meta materials or the multi-layer plasma iron ring material wonderful and I&#x27;m just scrolling through questions and again if if anyone has any uh if anyone has any additional questions um oh so Michael Boyd was asking how much does the warp module weigh the warp the Corp core itself it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in the tons it&#x27;s a significant chunk of metal ah okay uh let me see um Dr Michael do you do you expect anything to be coming out of it in order to produce this propulsion or is this uh you know a non-Newtonian Force initially this is this is you know this is just a prototype right and we&#x27;re trying to actually diagnose if we do see well first of all it&#x27;s a fusion device it&#x27;s an x-ray and neutron generation device but it&#x27;s also this this new relativistic high energy density regime where we&#x27;re trying to look for any space-time curvature or frame dragging effects um eventually you could you could fire this and not have a double double-ended type configuration but you&#x27;re just firing from one side so that you could have some kind of propulsion output Simon claray had asked uh he was wondering what kind of CAD software were using since that kind of fem is not easy yeah so we use several different soft uh software packages at Livermore primarily it&#x27;s Creo but we also use SolidWorks and uh uh let&#x27;s see Creo SolidWorks are really the primary ones okay well you know I guess as a corollary too I should ask and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m not sure if you guys are or if you&#x27;re open to it or not but um we have tons of people in our community who are open and interested to contributing to projects and so I&#x27;m not sure if like you need help along those lines or if you&#x27;re open to it or anything like that um I guess we probably should give out do you have a website that people can go to uh uh I I don&#x27;t and the lab doesn&#x27;t um with respect to the the warp uh reactor concept we have reached out to uh private companies um and I I can say now that uh we&#x27;re working with zc Institute um uh trying to get uh a creta uh finally uh signed off on um and so but we&#x27;re open for for help from anyone and and everyone so please reach out um you can you can reach out to to my uh Gmail address which is doctor.michael.g.anderson gmail.com um and uh you know I I can speak with you about you know possible opportunities um there&#x27;s also the I&#x27;m not sure that you&#x27;re going to be able to provide uh the group uh the actual uh Journal article that was released uh for for unlimited distribution Tim I did upload it to this uh stream yard I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to be available you know if you&#x27;re able to provide me with the link I can actually add that onto the conference page and I&#x27;m more than happy to um and actually I can upload these one of the other things that we&#x27;ve changed is I I have Google Drive and I have sections set up for each conference so I after the conference I can just go through with you and ensure that all of those are uploaded to Google Drive um yeah and again one of the things that I found and I I&#x27;m not trying to be pushy at all but um people in this conference for instance Mark has set up an elaborate 3D printing system right and uh he&#x27;s actually getting involved with Vapor dap as well as is possible several other things so um yeah the folks in this community are I&#x27;ve just been overwhelmed with how much they want to contribute and how much engineering knowledge there is you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s spread out and it&#x27;s diverse but you know there&#x27;s the desire and and definitely the capability so yeah absolutely welcome uh so let me scroll down um yeah Michael Boyd asked what&#x27;s the input power what do you expect the uh you know joules in versus out so it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s greater than a 10 megajoule machine it&#x27;s it&#x27;s up it&#x27;s up around 12 megajoules that is going in you know 10 mega joules of it&#x27;s going in on the microsecond time scale uh and two Mega joules is going in on the 100 nanosecond time scale would you be if it&#x27;s a warp field would we be measuring thrust in Newtons or would this be proportional to the weight of the device or area uh you know I haven&#x27;t thought too much about that type of a measurement what what we&#x27;re what we&#x27;re looking at now is to see if uh let&#x27;s say uh Jude white type of interferometer something that we can actually see a laser beams being deflected that&#x27;s close or near this this this pinched ring and and to see if there&#x27;s any kind of rotation on that on that beam itself okay how would you differentiate between light changing and the interference from The Flash uh the the flash when you say flash yeah if you have a fusion reaction going on next to a laser interferometer those are very sensitive devices oh sure yeah the laser the interferometer wouldn&#x27;t be close to the machine it would it would be piped in okay uh let me see and then greetings from The zc Institute and I guess so Michael you&#x27;re working with zc Institute and then just going through here uh Paul was asking if you need help with websites funding social media along those lines so all the above all the above yeah well you know this is an exciting time all of this all of this is moving forward so uh you know um let me see I&#x27;m just again scrolling scrolling through here Morning Bird Foundation says that he&#x27;s working on a interferometer and uh I think that&#x27;s chance Klein right yeah yeah I think that&#x27;s chance and Jeremiah mentioned that he has one as well we have one over here as well very nice yeah okay and yeah again let me put that out there if anyone else has anyone else has chats uh you can ask questions in chat um okay and I&#x27;m scrolling up here so Dr Anderson you&#x27;re you&#x27;re saying that you don&#x27;t really have any good ballpark for what kind of thrust or you know propulsion this might be able to produce uh I don&#x27;t want to say on on this this call so early early up somebody had asked um is is this they they said is this like a steam engine right basically because even though it&#x27;s super complicated at the core it is it like a steam engine uh if you&#x27;re using uh deuterium deuterium or deuterium tritium mix as the the fusion type fuel then yes it&#x27;s just basically a steam engine at the very end of this thing but if you&#x27;re using uh proton Boron or some other type of a neutronic uh fuel then you can actually do direct energy conversion oh that is exciting that is exciting yeah and that&#x27;s a worthwhile question I used to go to the the ismps safe conference right and yeah I got to see lots and lots of reactors and even when it comes to stuff like steam there were a lot of Innovations going on like the Sterling cycle at that for me those are really interesting the Sterling cycle converters um but but direct energy conversion is definitely a big part now I guess another thing that I should ask is um have you have you encountered any issues with um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not using the right word potential decay of the shielding over time from the fusion reactions uh we we haven&#x27;t got to that point yet those those are great problems to have right first we need to actually build the Prototype and and and see what we&#x27;re getting and and then work from there but there are people working on that lithium blanket wall to make sure that they can uh that the other components have a long life and that was why I&#x27;d asked um I I did an interview a while back with a fellow who&#x27;d worked on I believe it was a GE reactor Fusion reactor right and and one of the challenges that they had even with their experiments was over time he&#x27;d said um you know even though the energy is so much cleaner than traditional fission those reactions just break down they were breaking down the lining of the chamber and we had real issues with that oh yeah so anything polyethylene you know neutrons love to to deposit their energy and that and there becomes a neutron embrellment issues with with all the different components but those would be great great problems to have so for space app oh go for it Mark oh yeah I was going to ask if uh you&#x27;re familiar with the work being done in uh near Seattle by helion energy oh yeah I know helium very very well okay I built uh the colliding Tori Fusion reactor back when I was at tri-off energy and uh it was a it was a helion energy type device but on steroids and that was back in 2012 what&#x27;s your what&#x27;s your opinion on them is that similar in any way to the warp drive that you&#x27;re talking about here uh no I mean there the the densities that they&#x27;re dealing with are are much lower than the densities that this would like by orders of magnitude ah okay uh so let me see just scrolling back through and we&#x27;ve got about five minutes left and again thank you thank you so much for your time um so gigantic had asked he works with graphene he&#x27;s wondering if graphene polymer layers might be able to assist with this uh we&#x27;re open to anything um you know we&#x27;re we love to we&#x27;re I&#x27;m an experimentalist so you know I if I don&#x27;t believe it unless it I see it so um if if you&#x27;re willing to put it in the machine and and you don&#x27;t worry about it you know turning into vapor or something else then I say we try it and and then uh let me see um actually this is kind of a deceptively deceptively simple question from Austin he he was asking are these devices not classified or just too complicated for anyone to understand uh they&#x27;re not classified at this at this stage which you know I&#x27;m I I&#x27;m I can&#x27;t believe it I think it&#x27;s because maybe nobody understands it yet but uh we&#x27;ll see what happens in the in the near future here well right now the the papers and the and the presentations are are unlimited distribution yeah I you know when I used to go to stay if I&#x27;d wondered that as well I yeah I saw all of these incredibly detailed nuclear reactor designs and I thought it&#x27;s it&#x27;s amazing but none of this material is classified but um you know but it&#x27;s I it is so I guess rarified scientifically and intellectually speaking right that you know so yeah you&#x27;re not going to build it I think in your garage um yeah uh so I let me scroll back up to Greg Greg had asked if you could use a beryllium or Borum to absorb neutrons and gamma radiation which would lead to Neutron capture in the production of carbon or some other elements you could definitely do Boron capture Boron Neutron capture yeah okay um and let me see um and um I have a question uh what Dr Michael what kind of budget would you need to uh run this preliminary test so right now we&#x27;re looking at something on the order of like a three a 36 month year program um you know we&#x27;ve got lots of parts of the equipment so we could probably get it done you know under 10 million dollars um but if you if you wanted to build the warp reactor now you&#x27;re talking you know 150 million or more and this would be done through Lawrence Livermore or in a side project uh this would be done through Livermore and and uh our strategic partners are through a krata yeah yeah which sounds like a lot of money but when you look at what goes into scientific projects in general right like I mean even NASA Rockets which are incredibly conventional you know it&#x27;s just a drop in the bucket so oh it sure is yeah yeah yeah I I mean personally I&#x27;m all you know these types of large machines are are normally uh going in the in the billions of dollars um and that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s why there this is this is you know such a an economically viable option is you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an order of magnitude less than that so yeah yeah um so let me see uh exotic propulsion written that Boron based hdp HDPE and borevated pvdf are already available and could be used as strange radiation mediators I guess well never never heard of it okay okay uh Dr Anderson you mentioned how it might be useful as a directive energy weapon um if you go a little more into detail how it might be used as that I never said that don&#x27;t don&#x27;t quote me that I said that I did say directed uh directed energy conversion ah okay yeah let&#x27;s not go into the weapon side because yeah no no weapons today yeah okay well it so it looks like we&#x27;re at the top of the hour so everyone let&#x27;s give Dr Michael G Anderson another big hand thank you so much thank you so much for presenting it is truly an honor to have you with us today yeah thank you all and uh hopefully we can collaborate on on future programs wonderful wonderful so our our next speaker is let me see uh David Perez and it looks like he is coming online now um so Michael let me remove you from the stream and I will bring Michael on and again thank you so much for presenting for us sir so uh David actually just called me he&#x27;s having connection issues okay I I can try let me try adding him uh David it looks like you&#x27;re all set David can you hear us David can you hear us okay hello can you hear me can you hear us yes hello yeah you don&#x27;t have Mike but it sounds like you don&#x27;t have your audience choppy I can hear you sometimes but then you go out and in and out and in um I&#x27;m right next to the router here and now it&#x27;s telling me to wait page okay I think he&#x27;s having connection issues um do you want to give another moment and and if it doesn&#x27;t come together we could try and go straight to Gary yeah it seems like that was a connection error he tried calling me on the phone see if he reconnects or we can go to Gary and and circle back yeah and this is this is a good time for my dad lecture to always use a wired connection because Wi-Fi is still not quite there okay uh Tim He also mentioned that he sent it over the slides to you to upload them to the Stream ah okay I see what looks like a B-52 bomber there yeah and David are you able to uh are you able to hear us okay oops okay it looks it looks like he is dropping out again foreign okay um so I I think what we should probably do is I think we should probably go right to Gary&#x27;s presentation if if that&#x27;s okay and we could try with David again later David I think he&#x27;s having real connection issues maybe if he turns off his camera and just gives us a voice you know because use up the bandwidth properly David do you want to try turning off your camera we can get that one shot and then we&#x27;ll probably move on to Gary okay well I think okay let me see yeah so why why don&#x27;t we do this I will I&#x27;ll remove David from the stream and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s still there he&#x27;s just in the background um and why don&#x27;t we go to why don&#x27;t we go to Gary&#x27;s presentation Gary are you okay going an hour early and I think we need to upload yours as well do you have that uploaded said to you some time ago but I haven&#x27;t uploaded it to this um ah okay the studio uh can I just share my screen or do we need to upload it um if it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a PowerPoint right so we need to share your screen I think so we can share the screen well uh or do you want me to send it send a copy to you you need I think you need to upload it but I think I can probably upload it for you so okay and so uh where do I upload it there okay um there should be a button so if you go into present there&#x27;s a present button and then slides and then from your computer uh okay wonderful sorry about that I no that is that is the the one difference between this and zoom that&#x27;s the one difference is that with PowerPoints you you need to upload them otherwise it runs into a cluster of permissions issues that are tied to the browser ah gotcha okay so then I can then I click on it is that what uh let me see once it&#x27;s uploaded uh it looks like it is there we go add to stream okay and I will remove myself and you should be able to scroll through that and if you have your additional I know you have a lot of additional materials in there um but we can upload those separately or if they&#x27;re in there we can go through them and if you want to do web pages you can actually show web pages without doing anything those are very easy because it&#x27;s tied to the browser again okay all right let me I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll need um to upload them right now but if they&#x27;re available publicly on your web page later on yes if you could post this to your web page then because I really wanted people to look through it and make up their own minds rather than you know me trying to change Minds it&#x27;s better to look to the material themselves absolutely and I&#x27;ve got all of that on the alt propulsion site and I will put a link in chat right now okay well let me remove myself and and you know feel free to get started and Gary thank you so much thank you okay thank you Tim for giving me a chance to to go over this material again um I had done a previous version of this on how UAP investigations were related high frequency gravity waves so I simply updated that uh based on some new information from Russ coldheart who wrote uh the book in plain sight and recently interviewed um a fellow by the name of David grush this disclosure happened after I put together this briefing I finished the update on May 31st and the Disclosure by David Rush occurred on on June 5th so uh basically what he disclosed is that there are crash remains uh of uaps there&#x27;s a crash investigation program in the government uh so what are we to make of that so uh I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll take you through this material and we&#x27;ll back up a little bit in time uh to before most of us were born to right up to current events and take a little journey through history here to see in the light of David gresh&#x27;s disclosure uh if we if we go back and we look at some of the what was Roswell mythology uh does that change our view of this material so I&#x27;ll go over um a little bit of the ancient history in Roswell on uaps uh The Fallout after Roswell um Project Blue Book a little bit uh and then Jack fillet&#x27;s invisible College uh we&#x27;ll go through more recent events of a series of of government entities that are looking into uaps uh this whole disclosure debates about uh how much to disclose or whether we should disclose uh and then uh the next steps so of course if you read Von Donegan uh in search of the ancient gods uh he makes the strong case that uh UFOs uaps have always been with us they also show up in in art across the world so I&#x27;ve shown some examples of this uh so there is that question lingering you know we don&#x27;t have hard evidence from from ancient history but there has been a stream of Investigations in this area and I I definitely recommend Von Dan again if if you are interested in the sort of the ancient artifacts uh so what I&#x27;ve labeled uh exhibits exhibit a b c and so on those those are the links that uh at the end of this presentation you can use to uh to investigate for yourself some of these uh some of this literature and some of these artifacts uh there&#x27;s a very interesting memo uh that came to light in the 80s and it appeared to be a briefing sheet for then president-elect Eisenhower and the briefing sheet was to describe to him to read him into operation Majestic 12. uh so named because they&#x27;re originally 12 members of an investigation team this was a team of Crash Investigation people uh the FBI has determined the document is bogus they they even have a copy of this on their website this labeled bogus I find that labeling very distracting so for for my exhibit a I downloaded a version of it from the uh Reagan Presidential Library that was attached to a series of uh Freedom of Information Act uh requests associated with this document they they declined uh saying that some of the presidential commissions are not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests because they&#x27;re not an agency of the government uh but it was had some interesting content uh it seemed to confirm the Raj will crash number one it said that the disc was likely short-range reconnaissance craft because they couldn&#x27;t find any stores any provisions um for what were apparently for small human-like beings that ejected somehow from the craft before the craft uh crashed all four had been dead had been a week and they had been decomposed and subject to Predators uh so that but the remains were kept and investigated according to this memo uh and the memo also stated that the biological and evolutionary processes responsible for their development apparently has been quite different in other words they looked something like us but not entirely like us yeah so so that&#x27;s where uh this Majestic 12 concept came from uh also magic is a short short version of it or mj-12 these are all referring to the same um operation crash investigation operation around the same time um that this crash was discovered a June of 47 there was uh now considered Declassified and Oppenheimer Einstein memo addressing the possibility of confronting intelligent beings from somewhere else uh the the memo seem to focus on the notion that they were from a different planet or a different solar system that in other words that they were extraterrestrial we we don&#x27;t know for sure whether that&#x27;s true but it&#x27;s it was an interesting conjecture and it it went through how would we respond to that I find the timing of this interesting because this is this is synchronized almost exactly with uh the Roswell crash and the Roswell investigation so it could be that it was just in the air uh that could have been reading um reports uh from um Washington state that was that occurred a few months before and decided hey let&#x27;s get together and write this memo that seems unlikely to me um so this is another interesting exhibit to look through uh if you want to go back and look at some of the historical records on okay this this happened almost at the same time as the alleged rajwa crash and that&#x27;s not the only coincidence uh the Roswell incident June July uh 47 of the Oppenheimer memo on Oppenheimer Einstein memo 47 June uh then the formation of the Air Force in the formation of the CIA a few months later and September of 47.</p>
<p>all these all these might have been coincidental but uh I find it I find it interesting that a crash of a weather balloon would send such Panic into the government that we would decide oh Army Air corps has to be its own Branch now and we need to formalize uh our intelligence apparatus under the CIA so an interesting coincidence to say the least so what has been going on since uh is mj-12 a real thing uh we don&#x27;t know uh there are stories and about Royal uh Cosmic mad jobs magiops Ultra clearances cue clearances cleared for weird uh we don&#x27;t know how much that is fact or fiction but it is an interesting series of parallels to the white world which had also been investigating UFOs I think to some extent simply to dismiss dismiss them uh project sign project garage strain into Project Blue Book and then concluded with the content committee and that was the end as of the 60s 70s now there&#x27;s been a renewal of that because of some of the disclosures from F-18 videos uh the floor sightings and so on so uh this was prop a probable or possible split uh in the intelligence apparatus and inside of our government to provide extra secrecy around what what I Loosely call the phenomenon of phenomenon being the UAP phenomenon simply called the phenomenon uh and um at the same time uh in parallel uh other other journalists other activists other investigators such as Jack filet and other independent researchers have been doing their own work um and they they did not take a break like the US government seemed to uh and uh there&#x27;s a fantastic book by Jack fillet uh capturing this work called The Invisible College which even though it came out um almost you know 50 years ago now it&#x27;s still just as fresher read as ever because he really takes a different slant on the phenomenon he talks about useful propositions the reason they&#x27;re not called UFOs anymore for instance they&#x27;re neither flying nor there are they objects they&#x27;ve been seen throughout history they&#x27;re not necessarily from space uh there are psychic effects quite often associated with them and the the real problem here is that human contact is under their control it&#x27;s under the control of the phenomenon it&#x27;s not under our control we need to flip that around that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s so so exciting what&#x27;s happening at Skinwalker Ranch where they&#x27;re approaching the phenomenon on their terms not on the phenomenons terms so I think that&#x27;s a huge step forward and I really applaud the work of uh of the of the crew at skimarker Ranch strangeness categories was the other important concept the Jack fillet I think these are still used today that Jack fillet created uh seeing something you&#x27;d understand the light that&#x27;s that strangeness one seeing something that&#x27;s uh more active more kinetic like a flaming object that&#x27;s strangest level two if you know for sure it&#x27;s a craft but it&#x27;s unknown that&#x27;s the strangeness level three if you witness an actual Landing of The Craft that&#x27;s considered stage four if you witness some occupy occupant that&#x27;s stage five of strangeness experiencing some psychic illumination or vision is a six and experiencing like lost time or reality Gap is is strange as seven so those I think those categories are still being used today and systematically we should go through uh some of the databases on these encounters and try to categorize them uh because I think it&#x27;d be interesting from a science point of view to see you know how that has shifted with with the course of time uh the other the other thing to consider here which I&#x27;ve included is Exhibit C is that uh this phenomenon may not be extraterrestrial it may be from instead of a different XYZ coordinate it might be time travelers on the T coordinate it could be from a different dimension interdimensionals we would call that uh it could be from a different fractal Universe if you if you&#x27;re a reader of David maker so we don&#x27;t really know uh where where these phenomenon are coming from uh whether there&#x27;s portals to other universes or so on uh all we know is you know it hits the strangeness factors for sure so what has been going on more lately more lately uh there has been a restart of white World UAP investigations especially really at the behest of the Navy the Navy uh has improved their censor Suites on the f-18s used to use just Radars now with these Advanced targeting flurs they have infrared and visual capabilities that are that are powerful enough and with enough uh smart intelligence that they can spot these objects that they couldn&#x27;t normally have have tractor spotted uh and so so the Navy has been pushing for this there&#x27;s been a series of organizations um dedicated to the study of uaps I&#x27;ll talk about atip a little bit uh and we&#x27;ll talk about that the era or the AAR should be Ro um I think it&#x27;s aaro office uh UAP task force uh was another recent one and so we&#x27;ll go over those a little bit too there&#x27;s also sibling organizations that are looking into it I have I think exhibit e was was created uh was was the creation I think of of the atip let&#x27;s see if I can I can&#x27;t really Zoom no that was uip task force okay uh so there&#x27;s also um it feels like there&#x27;s a bit of a tug of war here uh I do know a lot of people that want more uh disclosure I recently had the honor of giving a talk at uh the funeral of Bob Baker who who had worked on Project Blue Book and had been a lifelong advocate for looking more into more systematically into this topic Paul Murad will go over uh him a little bit how pot Hoff is of course uh well known as discussing this area as as is former employee Eric Davis so so we&#x27;ll go over those people a little bit also uh presumably there&#x27;s someone on the other side not so anxious to disclose these would be people who would be in charge of the crash remains uh and they were mentioned in Ross coldheart&#x27;s excellently researched book in plain sight so I&#x27;ll I will be quoting uh Ross on on some of that uh so let&#x27;s go through um and I know Tim Ventura is very familiar with these people as well Paul Morad for many years hosted um a conference on Advanced propulsion uh State uh space technology applications International Forum it was an open Forum but you quite often brought some very interesting stories pictures videos uh he never came empty-handed and one in particular I found fascinating that was mentioned separately in Ross Colter&#x27;s book was an encounter of an Atlas missile launch out of Vandenberg that apparently if you look at the if you look at the video apparently encountered a UFO or UAP a classically shaped disc shaped thing that directed energy at the atlas rocket and knocked it off course so uh this the story I was reminded of that story because it was it appeared also in Ross coldheart&#x27;s book and so without mentioning Paul Murad by name it was it was it was discussing more of what happened to the the person that took the took the film uh the generals immediately uh thought he had doctored it somehow he was like no I haven&#x27;t doctored it it almost looks cartoonish when you watch it so I thought that was quite a fascinating video at the time I didn&#x27;t know what to make of it but Paul had a lot of material like this uh at his fingertips uh Bob Baker uh did work on Project Blue Book he his his day job for many years was space navigation he he was high up at Lockheed and uh he he retired two or three times uh I had not met him until 20 years ago after his retirement but he was still active in high frequency gravitational waves which which may or may not be a related field uh but that&#x27;s that&#x27;s how I initially met him is a well-known researcher in this area I hear he&#x27;s pictured with Lou Elizondo uh and his former employee Eric Davis he&#x27;s also been associated with kit green uh showing in the lower right another researcher of the UAP phenomenon I met all of these gentlemen with the exception of Lou Elizondo uh when I was working on high frequency gravitational waves they were very interested in the gravitational wave uh generation because that may be one of the one of the things that helps Propel these uaps we have seen a high frequency signal like microwave style signals which might be Emi emanating from them uh in in the lower microwave region so does that mean that they&#x27;re using uh gravity waves in the microwave region we don&#x27;t know Eric Davis has done so many appearances on television he should have his own TV channel he&#x27;s he&#x27;s a well-known uh advocate for disclosure and he became indirectly pulled into the Limelight we&#x27;ll talk about that a little in a little bit when one of his uh meeting notes was disclosed inadvertently uh very surprisingly uh and not by him so uh we&#x27;ll talk about that a little more in a bit oh here it is uh so yeah the ewd knows uh Eric W Davis uh met with Admiral Wilson who&#x27;s directing the Dr associate director I think at the time of Defense intelligence agency and Admiral Wilson was a bit unhappy with some of the stonewalling he was getting from the uap-back engineering programs uh and so he went he discussed this with Eric about strategizing what to do about this so these are very fascinating notes um there will be a link at the end to what what I&#x27;m calling exhibit d do you like Delta uh and these these were not uh to be made public these were for his use and for his boss halpad house use uh however Hal had given a copy to the the astronaut Edgar Mitchell it wound up in Edgar Mitchell&#x27;s archive and when Edgar Mitchell passed away uh what and why did he give it to Edgar Mission because Edgar had been had been on the board of Bigelow uh of the Bigelow Enterprise portion of a Bigelow Enterprise that was looking into uaps and was it Skinwalker Ranch before the current team was who by the way so was Eric Davis Eric Davis also worked for Bigelow uh and so in any case Hal had provided this to Edgar because uh they had been um because Edgar had been on the board um of of Bigelow that though when he passed it was in his archive it wound up with some reporters James Rainey who turned it over to Grant Cameron who um subsequently released it in 2019. uh and so um even during the interview Wilson said you know if if this is ever released I&#x27;m going to deny that we ever had this talk and he has in fact just about and denied uh that he met with Eric Davis or that he said any of these things but it does seem to assert there&#x27;s a concerted uh UAP uh back engineering program and a cover-up of that program within the government to the extent where it&#x27;s not uh acknowledged to the gang of eight in Congress which of course would be illegal if that&#x27;s the case so Russ coldheart uh recently wrote the book in plain sight and he he had a extensive section on someone named Tom Delong you if you are a Blink 182 fan you will recognize him as a kind of a rock star like literally a rock star uh this fellow had been very interested in this area and had reached out to some of the folks at um on on uh allegedly on this crash retrieval program allegedly uh it involved part small portions of Skunk Works and small portions of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base uh and the oversight pretty much stopped there uh because it was presumably and this is something that appears in Ross&#x27;s book a so-called a special Access program a sap program there are a certain small subset of sap programs that are unacknowledged that the government doesn&#x27;t talk about you know without a classified skiff and sadly unfortunately uh it seems to be the case that some of these unacknowledged sap programs are wavered what does waivered means it means waivered from oversight which of course is a very dangerous situation and that&#x27;s not something you would really want to do and it&#x27;s probably not legal and it&#x27;s certainly not ethical uh supposedly this uh this program was controlled by a bigoted access list in other words billeted that there was a very tight control of access somewhere between four and eight hundred bullets grand total are granted on this program according to Ross cold Parts reporting the program is unacknowledged a normal oversight has been waived and so there are a number of people that should be informed um not I suspect not all presidents have been informed of this and not not all gang of eight Congressmen have been informed that should be informed so this this is um doesn&#x27;t qualify as a legal accusation but it is reporting uh from Ross and so far as I know these gentlemen have not uh reached out to Ross and said please take our names out of your book this isn&#x27;t true uh so I guess more to come on as Congress investigates uh this alleged program uh so what else is going on that we have we have occasional additional Revelations from some of the people closer to UAP remnants or alleged UAP Remnant investigations including some meta material uh artifacts that were added to Gary Nolan and this material had an anomalous isotope mix not found in our solar system uh we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from a parallel Dimension or a different solar system or where it&#x27;s from um presumably someone would have to go to a lot of work to alter an isotope mix uh in in a material sample Gary doesn&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s the Practical answer and so that that material investigation is ongoing there is also uh Eric Davis who is continuing to make interesting uh Revelations uh one of them is that uap&#x27;s sometimes sometimes now seem to be using mimicry that they want to appear like something else because they know our our sensors are getting better and better uh for instance going to going at lengths to appear to be meteors when they streak to Earth and then suddenly not not moving like a meteor anymore uh so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s an interesting um tidbit uh and then Chris melon uh Christopher melon is is another disclosure uh person I don&#x27;t know him personally but he he has been pushing uh Congress for more open investigations of this and he has claim is that the phenomena can manipulate both physical and cognitive environments in other words Jack fillet may have been right that there&#x27;s a second component to these uh to these encounters with the phenomenon uh and so I think that&#x27;s that&#x27;s an interesting angle here so we have to ask ourselves um if there is a crash retrieval program and it&#x27;s been shielded from the public who are they really working for who who does the secrecy benefit uh the secrecy does it really benefit investigators worldwide it doesn&#x27;t really benefit science because science would want more people to work on it not less it really only benefits the phenomenon so my argument is that if there&#x27;s undue secrecy around the phenomenon it&#x27;s benefiting the phenomena these people are not working for us they&#x27;re working for the phenomenon so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s something that we need to change and that the aaro is is working towards that towards that goal aaro being the anomaly the all domain anomaly resolution office so it should be aaro and we&#x27;ll have to correct that previous slide uh the UAP task force was focused mostly on these Naval encounters uh so they&#x27;re not going to the same investigative links as the aaro but one of the UAP task force per people um was this a gentleman by the name of David grush and he has gone to Congress uh the gang of eight uh with some of this material on this undisclosed program so presumably uh we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll see we&#x27;ll see more details on how they resolve the situation where these people who think they&#x27;re benefiting us are really benefiting the phenomenon instead science is taking this seriously more seriously since the atip program more seriously since cyp task force and so I have included a preliminary analysis here as exhibit f they&#x27;re recommending a UAP r d technical roadmap to to look at more r d on on this uh there was uh the atip program uh was unacknowledged for some time it&#x27;s been acknowledged now as of 2017. uh but it was providing for funding for a number of science areas that could be applied to UAP research for instance gravitational research space-time metric three times sorry metric engineering traversable wormholes these I know for sure are some of the things that Eric Davis had been working on amended materials and gravitational wave communication so that&#x27;s that was certainly an interest area of mine and that&#x27;s how this investigation has touched my work uh to the Stars Academy was formed it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a civilian organization that is structured as a public benefit corporation uh to the Stars Academy kind of acts as an intermediary between the mainstream press and these communities of Interest so I think they&#x27;re they&#x27;re sort of the public go between um that um how France for instance on on their board for some time and we&#x27;ll see if they continue yeah uh the motivation for the science is how how are these things working um it doesn&#x27;t seem like they follow their standard laws of aerodynamics uh Jack serfati is a researcher in this area that&#x27;s heavily into the gravitational aspect of it and general relativity aspect of it we heard in the prior talk about this um the Einstein&#x27;s field equations which basically means the shape of space-time is affected by the mass and energy and the movement of the mass and energy in that space time it&#x27;s the curvature in other words of space is affected by the mass and energy in that space and there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a scalar factor in the middle of that that that makes the makes the connection very weak I need to move a lot of mass and energy for a little bit of warp in space-time and so uh we heard we heard from the prior talk that you can adjust that with metamaterials and sarfati has called it an S term there may also be an a term for Anderson so we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll have to see uh if he&#x27;s able to fund that experiment and and and improve that connection but it is certainly a lot of theoretical work happening in this area and so this was taken from some of sarfati&#x27;s theoretical work uh and he&#x27;s basing this on real physics uh he he combined this um Medina energy momentum tensor paper with this uh Solitaire warp drive paper uh in a way that um got him his s term so this this is ongoing um physics work that&#x27;s happening in this area uh we also recently had an aaro Hearing in the Senate this was in April of this year where uh another UAP uh disclosure was made the so-called mosul sphere which was spotted by nmq9 drone uh and it and it kind of just sort of floated by uh so we don&#x27;t know if it was maneuvering the piece of the tape I saw it didn&#x27;t maneuver but presumably these spheres have have been observed to make unusual Maneuvers that could not be made by a weather balloon for instance uh and so uh they also uh indicated that there&#x27;s been a change of law in the 2023 um defense Appropriations bill that protects whistleblowers that are working on undisclosed UAP programs to come forward so of course this was that that law passed late last year and so that was the law that that gave uh David gresh some shade and allowed him to to come forward with his disclosures and he was interviewed about this on June 5th and he there&#x27;s going to be a documentary about it uh tomorrow Sunday June 11th at 9 00 a.m eastern time so uh presumably we&#x27;ll hear more about this uh tomorrow morning it doesn&#x27;t say on YouTube what venue that&#x27;s occurring in might be news Nation because news Nation broke the uh broke the story uh even though it was reported by um let&#x27;s see it was reported by Leslie Keane and Ralph Blumenthal who typically are associated with New York Times New York Times didn&#x27;t take a bite at the sample they took a pass uh some news Nation picked it up this on the heels also of NASA at UAP um independent study team so what&#x27;s NASA doing with the UAP independent study team it&#x27;s a good question I don&#x27;t have the answer for you it was formed about nine months ago as my understanding uh they didn&#x27;t have much appetite for analyzing old NASA data I don&#x27;t know quite why that was whether there was obfuscation uh but uh that that was not there in their Charter their Charter was really to determine uh what the NASA&#x27;s role be going forward not not rear view mirror looking but forward looking uh and is there going to be a useful role for NASA can NASA do something that the aaro cannot do the arrow is going to be the primary investigators for instance they gave the example the FAA example of if someone comes to the FAA with a pilot comes with a UAP report now that the FAA turns that over to the aaro for disposition so that&#x27;s already being covered by the aaro what&#x27;s not being covered is whole scale Mass collection activity that is unclassified we may be having intelligence Community tools that could be leveraged but those aren&#x27;t those are not going to be unclassified because they they would reveal sources and methods but NASA as a public agency has a has a role in in doing some kind of mass collection and so for instance the idea was kicked around cell phones are not really well set up for for UAP capture but if the cell phone data also had not just had the visuals but had the metadata in an app and that metadata for instance the GPS coordinates uh the magnometer can they can they measure the magnetic field to some extent with a regular cell phone if all this metadata is attached to the setting at the same time in this in a sort of a public app people could download this app and when they see something they could record it to their phones and then send it in for observation send it in for analysis that&#x27;s one potential role for NASA uh NASA also has a lot of international Partnerships with other space agencies and so they could coordinate some kind of international effort to to build uh purpose Purpose Driven uh reconnaissance equipment um so that that was an interesting idea they did have the FAA on and the FAA was very clear that their sensors are not set up uh because of the slow revisit rate sometimes these Radars sweep only a couple times a minute they&#x27;re set up for aircraft they&#x27;re they&#x27;re all of their radar is gated for aircraft detection is not gated for anything doing non-air non-aero Maneuvers so uh the FAA basically said hey our sensors are no good for what you&#x27;re trying to do here uh so that we would need a more purpose-built uh sensor Suite in order to start truly tracking these and getting real science on them so NASA also has a science focus and so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what they really focused on is hey how could we bring science to this investigation going forward they did uh unfortunately the only example they gave of analyzing um a UAP was was one called the go fast uh and that seemed to be a case of Parallax that wasn&#x27;t actually going fast it was only going like 40 miles an hour it&#x27;s just that the jet was going fast so against the background the object looked like it was moving fast uh and they presented that as one example by where science you have to be careful with these sightings because you need to apply the science and if you apply the science you may find that that there was a prosaic explanation there wasn&#x27;t anything anomalous at all uh Scott Kelly was on the board uh on this independent study team uh and he basically during the Q a they were like what&#x27;s NASA covering up and he was like Hey at Johnson at least the Johnson Space Center at the astronaut office I never even heard any talk about uaps so you tend to throw cold water on on the notion that NASA&#x27;s covering up or hiding anything next steps um I think this this last bullet is already covered we did pass legal protection for whistleblowers into law and provide a clear Direction with how they could come forth uh they go to the aaro office is how they do it uh now this little tricky so they could probably improve their intake process uh but the the National Defense authorization Act passed in December of last year provides for this now for UAP whistleblowers uh so Congress is is earning their pay and the administration is going along let&#x27;s let&#x27;s keep these hearings going and and keep active uh at this so that we can you know hopefully shed some light on is there is there not a crash retrieval program suggested reading I&#x27;m going to suggest uh the invisible College by Jack filet it covers a good job it does a good job of covering why we believe there&#x27;s a Psy aspect to this phenomenon uh so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really does feel like yeah they&#x27;re messing with us I mean that yeah we have to fight back by figuring them out but don&#x27;t assume they&#x27;re necessarily extraterrestrial uh we don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re coming from in plain sight is another great book that was it was only two years old um I&#x27;ve corresponded with Ross um to some extent on the on the gravitational wave portions of his book and he he makes the case that yes there there are programs that are hiding something we they&#x27;re not going to go willingly they&#x27;ve been in power for too long this has been going on for at least 75 years we need to fight back by speaking up and providing uh whistleblower protection and I think that&#x27;s happening now but don&#x27;t assume they&#x27;re going to go willingly uh so both both great reads uh and Ross&#x27;s book is coming out in the summer in the US in a big way um so look for that release uh if if you&#x27;re supporting your local bookstores uh in the meantime if you need it right away you can buy it on Amazon but it&#x27;s going to be more expensive because it&#x27;s coming from Australia uh there&#x27;s also a fantastic uh documentary that came out on the whole phenomenon uh this has footage uh let&#x27;s discussions from uh Christopher melon uh with discussions um of of other people who have been close to the close to the study of the phenomenon this is free on Pluto TV I included a screen snap of the other places you can get it but I know for sure the Pluto TV app is free on a smart TV or on your phone even so you can you can watch this documentary for free so I highly recommend um that um that as a great documentary if you only want to watch one thing and of course I have to give a shout out for Skinwalker Ranch because I think changing it around so that it&#x27;s not the phenomenon meeting us on there on his terms but we&#x27;re we&#x27;re pushing back and we&#x27;re finding a way to meet the phenomenon on our terms so I really I really appreciate and enjoy uh the work they&#x27;re doing on on that ranch uh and investigating the phenomenon there I did want to dedicate it to Bob Baker he recently passed and um his his widow Bonnie invited me to the funeral um thank you Bonnie for that she also gave me permission to dedicate this talk to him which was wonderful he&#x27;s been a disclosure advocate for his whole life he helped us navigate to the Moon he&#x27;s a gravitational expert and his work certainly lives on these are links uh Tim if you if you publish this to your web page I checked these links this morning and they&#x27;re all active and they&#x27;re all working so thank you so much for posting these I think it&#x27;s really helpful for people to make up their own minds on this and don&#x27;t take my word for it or anybody else&#x27;s word for it but look through this material on the on I will warn you on the Majestic 12 briefing uh because I got it from the Reagan Library it&#x27;s sandwiched in with a bunch of other semi-relevant or not relevant material uh so you gotta kind of scroll to the middle of it I think it&#x27;s Pages 17 to 22 out of a 55 page PDF but I wanted it there out in public for anybody to look at without having to go to the Reagan library and sift through their website I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s more helpful uh the Oppenheimer Einstein memo will be will be posted out there too they called it relationships with inhabitants of celestial bodies who knows whether they&#x27;re from from a Celestial body or not Ultra terrestrials uh is there it describes all the various options for whether the ETS are really interdimensionals or or people who have been living here in some parallel universe or underwater underground who knows uh so he really delineates all those various theories very well in that paper uh Eric Davis&#x27;s notes with his meeting with Admiral Wilson are posted for your perusal exhibit E I was I was struggling trying to remember which phase of UAP investigation task force this was it it was the aoi MSG I think that lasted a number of months before they renamed it again uh hopefully we&#x27;ll get more consistency with the arrow office then uh than we had with pass with past investigative offices and then finally the preliminary assessment uh from the UAP task force is exhibit half so please do enjoy those at your leisure and I think that that gives us about 15 minutes for um for Q a wonderful Gary thank you so much thank you absolutely so much let me bring Jared in there I will uh let me see and you know what uh it looks like Dr Anderson and David are still with us they can bring themselves in if they&#x27;d like because I think they might be having issues but let&#x27;s let&#x27;s start with this uh and and Mark is actually rolling with the comments he&#x27;s Marcus discovered new features um so thank you Mark um so I guess first things first Gary let&#x27;s give you an enormous Applause enormous Applause I know you&#x27;ve been working on this I had this stuff laying around so it&#x27;s better to share it than to just hide it away well so I mean if if I could if I could start with you know how have and I asked you this in an interview earlier but I I think that what&#x27;s happening with David Grouch just highlights this how how have your perceptions or beliefs or opinions changed over the last few years well I&#x27;ll give you just one example that Roswell Majestic 12 memo I dismissed as a as a fabrication and now I&#x27;m I&#x27;m looking back at it thinking you know it&#x27;s consistent with with the with the stories that David grish has been hearing on this long-term 75-year long crash retrieval uh program so um you know it&#x27;s it tends you want to rev you want to look at these things all over again uh and so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s for me it&#x27;s it&#x27;s shifted my thinking to to looking back at some of this material and saying wait a minute I dismissed this maybe I dismissed it too quickly yeah well I mean the reason I asked that is I&#x27;m I&#x27;m in the same boat I&#x27;m reeling from all of this information and I guess the the part that gets me is there&#x27;s so much credibility attached to it right it&#x27;s the things that I&#x27;ve dismissed time and time and time again now I&#x27;m like wait a minute well you know I&#x27;m seeing Bruce cornett&#x27;s comment and that was another area I I had dismissed is like this doesn&#x27;t make any sense why would they bother to hide but uh Eric Davis has also uncovered uh sent some some apparently some real um sensor data showing that they are using camouflage so so that&#x27;s another area I had dismissed so now I have to revisit uh my belief system and that&#x27;s part of the journey here it&#x27;s partly an internal Journey on what&#x27;s what&#x27;s your belief system uh and then it&#x27;s it&#x27;s okay once you once you&#x27;ve shifted that what do you want to see change in your Society you know for instance opening up the program the crash retrieval program and the third phase of it is then how do you take that knowledge and go out and reconnect with the phenomenon on our on our basis versus its basis that&#x27;s why I call it a Jihad uh Muslims will recognize those three steps as as a Jihad it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a struggle it&#x27;s a journey and it starts from the inside and it goes to society and it goes to the outside world uh and I&#x27;m not a jihadist I feel like I&#x27;m I&#x27;m at this phase because of David I&#x27;m I&#x27;m more like an Undertaker or maybe funeral director for the program yeah well you know so Zed was asking is the U.S military actively engaged in trying to shoot these craft down I I mean other than what happened in February there there have been um stories about attempted shootdowns they normally don&#x27;t go very well uh there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a story that the Italians tried to shoot one down over the Mediterranean and they got they got their aircraft is what aircraft or a helicopter I can&#x27;t remember now but their air vehicle was damaged and it it was it had to crash land so uh so yeah that doesn&#x27;t go well there&#x27;s also a story out of Russia that a Russian fighter pilot was was ordered to take shots at one and his his vehicle was destroyed and he died so you know don&#x27;t necessarily assume they&#x27;re friendly but let me ask I mean since we have Mark and Jared on with us um and again uh if Michael or David if you guys have any questions you&#x27;re in the in the the waiting area there you know feel free to add yourselves in and ask but uh looks like Jared has something and then Mark if you have anything just jump in yeah actually at that Arrow conference in uh Washington DC we drove down there and what did you really do you attended in person okay yeah I intended in person and uh our group you know Falcon space and friends were actually made up half of the uh uh of the public that attended okay and uh that&#x27;s great one thing that he said that was pretty um alarming was that even if he determines that it was extraterrestrial there would be no Public Announcement it would go through channels meaning this would be this would be an inter you know uh uh it would be a memo it would be an email uh stream going out to different uh departments that&#x27;s disappointing remember that by the way aliens exist you know that&#x27;s as far as I&#x27;m going to take it he doesn&#x27;t want the job he wants to turn UAP into somebody else&#x27;s problem yeah the the impression certainly the impression he gave at the aaro hearing was this this is a job he doesn&#x27;t really want yeah that was certainly an impression Sean we&#x27;re talking about Sean Kilpatrick right yes well to be honest does anybody want that job I mean I don&#x27;t know that I would professional punching bag right just everybody and their brother you know yeah he was a little more forthcoming uh at the NASA briefing because he was part of the the NASA briefing too uh and they depend upon him for for a lot of the data uh that they received so he was a little more forthcoming there but certainly the the prior one you know not so much yeah yeah Jared go for it sir yeah your awesome presentation I love all the updates um I was wondering if you might be willing to uh extrapolate and speculate a little bit on kind of how we see the progression of this slow roll disclosure playing out right we had the initial like soft disclosure from Greer in 2001 and then 2017 rolls around it explodes and goes quiet for a few years and then every December or June we get like big tidbits at very convenient times for public um you know awareness I think with the David Rush disclosure still unfolding I think it&#x27;s really going to be um it&#x27;s really going to be hard to not respond to that I mean people are people are going to want to know more about the crash retrieval program after his Revelation right so that would probably be the next shoe to drop I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re gonna see you know alien bodies anytime soon right but uh maybe small fragments of Crash recovery uh material might come to light uh that would be my guess I think there&#x27;s some that is already in circulation uh that so so more might be publicly revealed in terms of oh yeah we we forgot there&#x27;s a closet with that stuff in it or there&#x27;s a hanger with with some stuff in it and so we we should actually look more at that but I I suspect they won&#x27;t uh disclose the the science behind some of this uh directly to the public because it may have National Security implications so I I expect yes we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll probably hear more about uh recovery material but in terms of investigating how it works or what it does that&#x27;s going to be a tougher Gap because they&#x27;ll be on a national security angle that that&#x27;s a trump card they can pull yeah well let me let me quickly thank Mark Mark thank you for handling comments Mark is co-hosting or or I&#x27;m co-hosting and Mark as the host I&#x27;m not sure which way it goes but I think Michael had something to ask yeah yeah so uh I mean my concern with all of this is it looks a lot like there&#x27;s a possible loophole here where you could use itar along with like these uh special access things to put something in Shell companies and bring it off world or bring it to some other country uh like exactly the opposite of what you would want from normal itar so uh have has that been investigated at all you know I I would be speculating so we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes uh but you can certainly imagine a scenario where somebody actors in order to save their career or or in order to save their little niche of the world start hiding evidence right well evidence so I I hope that doesn&#x27;t happen I hope that there&#x27;s a thorough investigation and I I hope that you know ultimately we get some disclosure but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s tough if people have been breaking the law for so many years it&#x27;s going to be tough to get them to admit that right uh somebody had asked in comments about uh the upcoming Greer presentation do you have any thoughts or hopes or anything about that the documentary tomorrow yeah I don&#x27;t know a lot about it I know that uh Ross goldthart who wrote the book in plain sight uh was the interviewer for him uh and so he&#x27;s going to be associated with this documentary uh and uh I I know the release time is to Sunday June 11th 9 A.M eastern time that&#x27;s okay so that yeah that is the one tomorrow and then I&#x27;m not sure if you were aware though Stephen Greer also has an event planned for next week oh for next week okay okay yeah and I&#x27;ll send you the info for that yeah yeah I&#x27;d be you know if you could post that web page or whatever sure okay um yeah and again any other questions uh Michael or Mark or Jared did you guys have more questions okay I had just just one last one um also taking the National Security angle um so a lot of this they often talk about how all this Tech is so you know far Advanced there&#x27;s an asymmetric Warfare capability from this whichever country gets their hands on this instantly wins right and I was wondering if you&#x27;ve looked into any of the um International uh incidents and and how those may play a role in any of the timings of any of these disclosures yeah I mean so if you&#x27;ve if you&#x27;ve listened to the interview um of this David grush he he hits on this uh I don&#x27;t know if it was in the main interview or or a side interview that all three superpowers have crash retrieval programs and probably more countries than just those three so uh it is true that like whoever gets their first wins doesn&#x27;t look like anybody has made any breakthroughs uh or we&#x27;d be seeing them right we&#x27;d be seeing them if if Russia or China I&#x27;m sure Russia is really anxious right now to develop a new weapon because they have this uh this UK Ukrainian issue going it&#x27;s ongoing and China has this the island of Taiwan that they&#x27;re anxious to to um Force back into the country so that those are those are two uh issues that you would imagine if they had any advanced capabilities they would use them under those circumstances and yet they don&#x27;t so so far at least it&#x27;s it appears that even if they have their own crash retrieval programs they haven&#x27;t been able to unwind uh unwind them the the issue that we have in this country with the undue secrecy is if it&#x27;s really only at 400 to 800 billets that&#x27;s not enough people to make any progress especially out of those four to eight hundred if only 12 of them are scientists uh like like Lazar for instance if if that another thing I have to revisit now is babazar uh after this disclosure if if that&#x27;s the case we have very small number of people looking at this we&#x27;re never going to get ahead so I think that the National Security push that I see as is getting the stuff out there and to a much broader audience at admitting that there&#x27;s crash retrieval material getting getting it into the hands of real scientists in a big way so that we do so we do get a chance to be the first country uh to be able to capitalize on any technology gains that could come out of this or derive from this so for me the national National Security argument is get it out there you know or we might lose the race well you know one other question that I should ask also Gary is I mean this and this goes to your background because you haven&#x27;t been involved with Advanced propulsion conferences right so miter 2003 I believe the specific conference right with Tony Robbins yeah I mean they were better times I love that we did have discussions in international forums with people from all over the world we did get together I mean I I was at a conference in the second minor conference in 2000 seven was hosted by halputoff at his facility Earth Tech and we had you know Chinese there we had Russians there we had Americans there we had Europeans there everybody had come together and they were all working on high frequency gravitational waves trying to figure out how can we make them and how can we detect them um so that those were happier times unfortunately um the the Russian individuals who were part of that have passed away uh and um the the Chinese contingent isn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t talking to us right now so we don&#x27;t that effort on coordination and working together has kind of Fallen apart which is kind of a shame right so I hopefully at least from The High Frequency gravitational wave point of view it&#x27;ll get picked back up again um by an International Group associated with CERN in Europe and they they can do it in a very in a non-political way and so that at least that aspect of the research can go on under the auspices of CERN yeah now do you think that this UAP issue as it as it grows in transparency do you think that this has the opportunity to unite various Nations and groups I mean I hope so I I don&#x27;t want to be Pollyanna about it though so uh time will tell how the politics plays out uh but we&#x27;ll hope for the best wonderful well we&#x27;re we are at the top of the hour Gary uh let me thank you again so much true honor and absolutely amazing presentation again appreciate your efforts on getting the material out yeah and all of this is in Google Drive people can get this from the event page so let&#x27;s give Gary another big hand Gary thank you so much sir thank you so much okay so uh I&#x27;m going to remove Gary now and let&#x27;s try and bring in uh uh and you know what it looks like uh David Perez is not with us again yeah so he&#x27;s gonna try logging in from a different computer I sent them over the link um that was about five minutes ago let&#x27;s see okay we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll give him a sec and see if he&#x27;s able to if we have a moment I I arrived late so I didn&#x27;t get to ask Michael Anderson some questions is he still around um he he may be it says device not connected so I think he may be here but I don&#x27;t think he has his mic and camera on oh well um we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll see I guess if he&#x27;s listening he can add himself in but I think he needs to enable those so okay yeah well again Gary&#x27;s presentation was just absolutely enormous and there have been so many changes um while we wait for for David I guess I I mean I could read through some of the stuff I&#x27;ve been following the story um and oops oh 30 there&#x27;s David okay let&#x27;s let&#x27;s see if we can bring David in there we go and David can you hear us okay all right there we go Mike we&#x27;re trying to uh you can hear us yeah I I can&#x27;t hear you so let me let me remove everybody else from from the the screen there and in I&#x27;m going to but I&#x27;m gonna upload your slides now all right thank you and this is in PDF format and it should be there in just a sec and I believe after I remove myself from the feed you should be able to control this so David thank you so much for your patience and thank you for presenting for us today okay there we go and feel free to start all right uh I I need to ask you to execute our video that we sent you yes would you like me to play that first or um at this point because of all the technical issues that we&#x27;ve had um yeah let&#x27;s just go ahead and and do this it has audio with it so let&#x27;s just start off with this it was an experiment that we did yesterday uh we filmed it and we were repairing an engine and just testing it and we had the camera on it and the it really went very well so we were uh quickly cut the the the video and put it into a presentation mode and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to see here in just a couple of seconds okay so let me let me share this then and uh uh give me just a sec oops okay sorry about that foreign let me let me uh stop sharing this okay and let me ask everyone to bear with us just a moment that was just something that we can do here there we go share screen my apologies okay [Music] oh this video is showing our June 9th 2023 experiment this is a scale experiment with Drive model number 17. we use 1500 watts of power and a 30 second test the drive weight is 1.543 pounds which is 700 grams we had 12 millimeters of displacement downwards the force measured was 4.66 Newtons or 475 grams the purpose of this experiment was to replicate the results from a previous experiment with a scale showing direct Force results this first video is showing 18 seconds where we start at 750 grams and then increase the weight until it gets to 1175 grams the full displacement will be seen in the following picture this picture just shows where we started and where we finished and the total amount of newtons that were produced 4.66 475 grams were shown displaced on the scale and this was over 18 seconds at 1500 watts this scene has three videos captured from three different cameras during the run and shown at real time in the top left we have the up close video of the scale in the bottom left we have the full picture of the engine and in the bottom right we have the camera that I&#x27;m holding from the very back of the lab thank you foreign here we will show the full scene one more time just in double speed in this scene we have the full wide view in the background and then the close-up shot of the scale and these are synced together and this will be playing in real time thanks for watching our video follow us on Facebook Twitter or YouTube check out our website at QED dash n e okay wonderful wonderful okay let me put your I&#x27;ll put your pitch down here yeah if you move your mouse over those I believe that you should be able to manipulate those let me remove myself from it I think that you should be able to okay okay all right got it let&#x27;s see here well I apologize for any of this uh technical issues that we have here but um essentially the uh let&#x27;s talk about the video first and we&#x27;ll figure out this uh slide remote presentation here um if that is true then it&#x27;s not a USB it&#x27;s on this side I don&#x27;t have an extra we don&#x27;t have a mouse okay uh Tim is this something that you could possibly hit the slide if I say next yeah absolutely absolutely yeah just let me know when you say next slide all right thank you okay next slide first off our goals are are fairly simple we want to go to space with this engine um it&#x27;s got enough power right now and you&#x27;ll see him and slides down uh into the batch of this uh slides in the future here uh that currently the technology that we have if it was mounted up onto a microsat we could get to Mars in less than 18 days with the current power ratios and things that we have currently going on and that&#x27;s pretty significant it&#x27;s an accumulative acceleration and if this will be available after the Apec for you to review at your leisure to look at it again but you&#x27;ll notice as the needle goes up it accelerates very quickly it&#x27;s an accumulative acceleration and as the uh we reached 1500 watts of power and there&#x27;s no propellant here it&#x27;s just DC volts 48 volts with linear amplifiers that convert it up into up to 2 400 watts of power and for these particular tests we always run about 30 seconds on them and that standardizes our our testing our plots and things that we use on our graphs which have ultimately given us a exponential curve with our plots and a x squared number of like nine 0.999 so the the curve fix really well onto the plot datas that we have collected over the past years Model 17 as I was mentioning was uh was a repair so I wanted to test it and that&#x27;s why we had the video camera on it to see what was going to happen anyway the results were very good uh the um the Restriction of the movement of the engine was actually due to the scale itself the tongue or that piece that hangs down where the motor hangs from can be extended for that 700 475 grams of force that could actually be extended uh 12 millimeters so our linear displacement in that particular case was 12 millimeters as a result of the limitations of the scale itself so that kind of in a nutshell is the explanation a little bit more onto the the video and why we made it multiple scenes so that everybody can verify there&#x27;s you know nothing up my sleeves you know here it is there it is in the Faraday cage and there it is going down and so our goals again are very simple we&#x27;re looking at going to space initially to put these engines as station keeping Motors on satellites and the cost of an ion drive engine and perspective is like about 40 million dollars and with this type of Technology the cost would be more than half off of that initial price and there are no moving parts and therefore the duration of time the the duty cycle or life cycle of the engine would be far more extensive than just a few years with ion drive technology and plus you don&#x27;t have to use the Exotic Xeon gas and the whole thing is run electrically um there is software controls during testing I usually manually control everything I mix the fields create the warp field and then bring it up to power so all that&#x27;s done within the 30 second time period and so what&#x27;s pretty remarkable about it if we compared this against an ion drive engine you wouldn&#x27;t see any movement whatsoever you could put a a Kleenex in front of the ion drive and you won&#x27;t even see it move uh for example to get it up to full speed and ion drive on a vehicle say headed to Pluto it takes well over four years to get it up to 25 000 miles an hour and then slingshottered around Saturn or Jupiter and the the whole the whole idea of this thing they got it up to um 50 000 miles an hour which was the face fastest spacecraft ever deployed by humans but in regards to this it&#x27;s an accumulative acceleration so the time period with chemical Rocket Motors to get to Mars is more like um less than 18 days with it like I said the the current forces that we can generate with the motor now you saw the motor in an inverted position pointed in downward Direction it does not thrust it pulls so that&#x27;s the distinction uh different they have any other kind of engine that you would see is that this actually compresses the fabric of space that has redshift in the frequency into the motor it has it can pull uh free-flowing objects on the other side of a solid object we run an experiment called the Cavendish experiment uh next slide please and we run that experiment where we&#x27;re actually pulling a a torsion bar and it&#x27;s in put inside of a wooden in class case and from out to 140 centimeters we can influence the pull through the fabric of space the compression of the fabric is space through the solid object which influenced the free-flowing object of the torsion bar itself so it&#x27;s lightweight it doesn&#x27;t require fuel has many many advantages here and plus the fact that um any direction that you point this engine or manipulating the fields you can direct a spacecraft and or wherever the engine is pointed that&#x27;s the direction it&#x27;s going to go next slide please now a lot of people have always used and talked about alcubier and his accomplishments it was great Theory uh what we&#x27;ve actually empirically found out it&#x27;s not entirely true the compression in the front doesn&#x27;t equal the compression in the back and the bubble is actually it compressed in the front but it gradually dissipates to the back of the engine we also found out that the engine actually has a cooling Factor it um it will cool the ambient air within the cavity of the V shape which will show you an image of that shortly um to the 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit so it almost acts like a Pelletier diode in one sense is that has a cooling effect and in your previous presentation you saw the uaps that have a cold spot around the outside of their crap and we experience the same type of cooling Factor we use thermal infrared cameras to capture that and in some of the published papers that we have on our website you can see the images that we have included within the papers if you so desire to go to the QED Dash any website next and how do we come up with this well being a meteorologist I teach physics I teach astronomy I have 10 different science subjects that I teach at four different universities and during my 22 years of teaching I&#x27;ve been investigating these accounts from Pilots and anecdotal as most people would consider these pilot reports are pretty accurate they may not know what had happened to them but they certainly knew what happened to their aircraft and in the case the more famous case of all of them is Bruce gernon&#x27;s Case in 1970 where he gets wrapped up in a bunch of thunderstorms around Bimini Island and two final thunderstorms are building up to the west of him and he sees a a tunnel a soccer hole as they would refer to it and what he does is he takes his aircraft because he can&#x27;t fly below it the thunderstorm nor can he fly above it and the bottom line here is that he sees blue sky on the other side of the of the sucker hole so he flies his aircraft which is extremely dangerous to do this and as he penetrates into the tunnel he exits out within just a matter of seconds and the girth of these thunderstorms out into the 20 degrees north latitude region off of Miami uh these thunderstorms rage up to 78 000 feet 80 000 feet with no problem at all the amount of energy in these storms are absolutely tremendous and I don&#x27;t know if anybody realizes this or has heard the new breakthroughs in thunderstorm analysis is that and on matter is actually generated Within These large uh girthy thunderstorms of like 32 miles and wide so this tunnel was very long but he exited out of this thing just within seconds he ended up in Miami Beach or uh yeah in Miami Beach in just about a second from leaving the cloud and radar approach picked him up he has he was encapsulated with some ionized air around his aircraft and he asked approach control where am I I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m at I was over Bimini Island and they said we don&#x27;t have any aircraft at Bimini Island we only have an aircraft here at applying on the south part of Miami Beach and then the ionized air cleared from his uh windscreen and he was over land he then proceeded to flew to West Palm Beach where he landed and the whole thing next flight please next line and um let&#x27;s go to the next slide um so he landed at West Palm Beach a whole flight took 47 minutes it usually takes like 50 57 minutes and the the idea here you actually traveled extra mileage 260 miles versus 240 from Andros Island to West Palm Beach and he&#x27;s made this trip over 14 times they were doing they were working out negotiations to build a resort down in Andros Island there&#x27;s the problem with Andrew silent is there&#x27;s no fuel so whatever you fly in with that&#x27;s what you fly out with upon refueling he actually ended up with nine extra gallons of fuel on board the the craft where atypically um would take on a full load and actually ended up with nine extra gallons that accounts for that 100 miles of Journey that he would have had to take but he actually had a non-sustainable local space board bubble and the type of power that we&#x27;re talking about inside these thunderstorms are such that if we make a comparison to the thunderstorm to a 13 kiloton Atomic weapon the the thunderstorms produced 7.3 times 10 to the 15th watts of power and a 78 000 foot thunderstorm and those are the calculations that I&#x27;ve made with the girth and all the other potential energy that you have to figure in with that and the um comparison to a 13 kiloton weapons 10 to the seventh so that&#x27;s a hundred million times more powerful the thunderstorm I.E that&#x27;s why can we go one slide back and I.E that is why antimatter is actually generated within the thunderstorm and this was detected back in uh in 2007 there was speculation that thunderstorms could produce anti-matter or positrons and as we Advanced more uh with the data collection from NASA uh it was discovered that these thunderstorms were producing tremendous amounts of gamma rays and during that time period the Fermi spacecraft was deployed to space looking for anti-matter in the universe in our galaxy well they did find pockets of it but they kept getting this annoying amount of gamma rays which is an aftermath of positron annihilation and each time that annihilates it&#x27;s over a half million electron volts so there&#x27;s more than ample amounts of energy in these clouds and the fact that two clouds were side by side as they were growing their fields overlapped and they generated the suffer hole at ten thousand feet where he flew into and then exited and ended up at 10 000 feet over Miami Beach which also was another Distortion of el cupier&#x27;s theory of point A to B with war bubble it actually warp bubbles are influenced by the mass of the Earth so if you go to space you have to be able to account for all the mass around you and navigate a straight line it&#x27;s going to require a different kind of complex navigation system on board which super computer AI could do and utilizing lots of red dwarfs as navigation buoys because and since the beginning of time or the beginning of our universe no red dwarf has ever been known to burn out so it&#x27;s a kind of a permanent buoy in in space that we could triangulate on to navigate so that solves several other problems okay next slide next slide okay so Within These thunderstorms the engine evolution is directly related to the pilot reports and also work done by Earl Williams from MIT where he had taken just inordinate amounts of upper air data and was analyzing it and came up to the conclusion is that thunderstorms actually are too pieces of a dipole plus minus dipole and an inverted dipole minus plus and that&#x27;s how these thunderstorms actually work they we have current flow out the top goes back down into the land and then up to the bottom of the thunderstorm it&#x27;s a lot different when everybody perceives even the textbooks haven&#x27;t really caught up to this yet and so this is referred to as a triple field next slide please this is a a artist rendering of this aircraft going into what he described as the sucker hole and it began to rotate around the aircraft which was indicative of the fields that are crossed the cross fields of thunderstorms and these tripol fields next next slide please this is the date of the 47 minutes 75 minute typical uh flight time for his aircraft uh 20 28 minutes differential in time 80 gallons of fuel typically 38 gallons used in the round trip but actually he went 250 miles versus 210 because he had to get around thunderstorms and make his way uh to the Bimini Island region he only when he landed and this is something that&#x27;s very unique about this pilot is that he is very antsy about his aircraft it was brand new off the production line and he always keeps the Tank&#x27;s fault because you never know when he&#x27;s going to have to go out so immediately upon landing and I have his refueling copy of his refueling statement uh 29 gallons on that day and that means that he didn&#x27;t use nine gallons of fuel which he should have expended during this trip now in order to make that 200 and uh 50 mile trip he would have had it gone from takeoff to Landing 319 miles an hour and there&#x27;s no low-level jet winds down in that region that amassed to that kind of speed I do a lot of well as a meteorologist I have access to all kinds of archive upper air charts from the surface all the way up and it does not occur and it did not occur on that particular day either so next slide please so something happened and so we have other instances of Pilots reporting similar activity and in the um 106 air transportation group uh Lieutenant Colonel Hopkins Hopkins uh was a very high Precision Navigator they were going from kwajalein to Guam usually takes six and a half hours they did the flight in five and if you see the picture there that&#x27;s a modified B-29 uh strata the strata Cruiser or in this case the c97 it&#x27;s a lumbering 210 220 miles per hour and six and a half hours and then go less than and take off an hour and a half go 300 miles downrange they were in thunderstorm activity and they got caught up into a tunnel and they got vectored down down range and this has happened to other Pilots as well we&#x27;ll go over that at this point but next slide next line the same things happen to these Pilots even in the tiger moth and during World War II um flying officer O&#x27;Brien and this um tiger moth aircraft by wing airplane one from North London got caught up in the in an afternoon thunderstorm and I was doing radar testing and tracking and I got thrown all the way up to Northern England he flew back refueled reported what happened there was some damage on his aircraft due to the thunderstorm and uh nobody believed him he wrote it up and later on after some TV programs that we had done in the past his relatives sent us his letter that he wrote up for his family and where he documents the fact that he he saw a hole in the thunderstorm sucker hole flew the airplane in and he was whisked within a like a second or so with the engine still running open cockpit and he was encapsulated within a non-sustainable local Spaceport bubble that&#x27;s the conclusion that I&#x27;ve derived and so to prove that next line next line we were going to fly a a UAV into a thunderstorm during the December time frame to reenact the forecasting parameters that Bruce gernin had experienced and this is a very good time of year because as it happens the time frames that we see these things occur around the world are in just the early December time frame which is makes it very interesting um but nonetheless these things will happen anywhere in the world so there&#x27;s a natural phenomenon going on here of generating local space War bubbles next slide please so the fact that we had it all set up people began to back up they said it was too dangerous I decided to take it into the lab and within the thunderstorm itself you have a variety of different HF HF bhf UHF and up into the gigahertz frequencies throughout the thunderstorm the base is low HF mid-range is VHF higher range is the UHF and gigahertz range to the tops of the thunderstorms and uh what I did was um built to essentially thunderstorms with their plus minus minus plus configurations of the tripol fields and using an interferometer and with a laser being in the split next slide please generated a fringe pattern and The Fringe pattern and we then produced was system on system off and we discovered that we were compressing a laser beam when the system was on we took 149 shots of this of turning the system on and off at about 25 watts of power or no I&#x27;m sorry it was uh at 10 watts of power and um so we saw this relationship of the shrinkage of the compression of the laser beam and we began to suspect that we were actually creating an artificial uh work bubble in this particular case compressing the fabric of space next slide in another experiment in addition to the redshift experiment that we conducted of the frequency measurements into the motor of what actually generates the frequencies that go into the motor which related to the VHF frequency is the middle of all over the cloud um we also did this experiment of ferrous and non-ferrous material a glass wood case and then we position the one of our smaller variant engines these are etched onto a board and we use 25 and 100 watts of power in varying examinations and tests but the bottom line here was that the pulling ratio no matter what you did had the same curvature pattern whether it was ferrous or non-ferrous material which then at 140 centimeters to still get responses out to that distance was quite I believe very remarkable which also then indicated to us is that something is really going on it&#x27;s not charging of the air it&#x27;s uh with ferrous or non-ferrous material it is a compression of the fabric of space going through solid objects next slide so as I&#x27;ve already kind of already hit this I guess some of the space-time metric conditions that we have already met with this the development of the triple Fields next slide please we use the fractal technology with this and you may not be familiar with fractals I mean if you look at your cell phone you have fractal antennas inside they&#x27;re not by any stretch these type of fractal antennas that were displayed on the previous slide but these are modified Koch curves that are attenuated to the proper frequency within the center core of the thunderstorm and that frequency was selected and utilized in the development of these triple fields or the resultant fractals and so essentially what you&#x27;re seeing there is one of our v-shaped engines our four triple fields and each triple field acts as a thunderstorm and you know as a simulation of the Thunder of the energy of what a thunderstorm can produce and then we also have is the support equipment we have our linear amplifiers they&#x27;re all custom made we have a throttle control the system works on battery has been working on battery power for the last uh six years so it is ready for space deployment in that respect is that we do operate on battery power and the whole system does in in that respect and that we also have a manual throttle and it can also be computerized the little screen of icons that you&#x27;re seeing on the display screen there is there it can be software controlled as well you can set limitations Within the scope of the power inputs and outputs and duration of time that you want to engage the engine you can pulse it you&#x27;re going to go total duty cycle on it if you want and everything is controlled by the throttles that I have there so you can go from zero up to max power of whatever is available on the system at that time during testing we also have a a clock there as for seconds so we can monitor our runs we also have display screens on the cameras that go on to our meters so that we can see reflected power if there is any uh all the forward power going into the engine so there&#x27;s a lot of preparation that goes into setting one of these things up takes a couple hours to run a test because everything has to you know as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s got to be we have to write down all the data the information what&#x27;s the temperature pressure or humidity all this type of factors before the cameras uh and then the cameras have to be all set up and focused everything has to be tuned up and then we engage yeah term just like Star Trek right um the warp doesn&#x27;t quite work what everybody thinks it does from unfortunately science fiction has kind of ruined the the real concept of how things are actually done next slide please you literally have to build a field with this and these are the various components that we have within the system itself it&#x27;s um working with VHF is a very very difficult it&#x27;s a very touchy exacting conditions for VHF however uh we&#x27;re looking into utilizing other frequencies but this is the one that we started with because we were mimicking thunderstorm activity and that&#x27;s what gave us our initial results next slide there&#x27;s a that&#x27;s Model 17 that you&#x27;re seeing right there that&#x27;s one that you saw into that video those were a times 600 cables they&#x27;re very semi-rigid cables but the motor actually lifted that about a year ago and uh we were met we managed to lift 3.4 pounds it went up a couple millimeters and it it lifted its harness in itself and that was at 1650 watts of power next slide please so you have compression in the front but it gradually expands to the rear next slide and the way this whole thing works is we have the four triple fields and we have the arrays on either side and the energy the propagation of the signal comes out in perpendicular fashion and there&#x27;s a crossover point and the V can be adjusted so we we go somewhere between 50 to 70 degrees of openings and run various tests at those openings and what we discovered is that um when the fields cross they will create a an internal lobe which then compresses or goes in a downward Direction next slide please and what you&#x27;re seeing right here is the first actual warp bubble field generated by an artificially induced warp drive engine and where the triple Fields exist on either end of the of the motor it&#x27;s approximately two foot in length and the red zones there that&#x27;s where the Mac flux or the gravitational data sensors that we used in this a native fruit accelerometer captured thousands and thousands of points and we then made a screen mesh of the data at four inches above and four inches below the motor and we first did the front end because we&#x27;re curious as to what&#x27;s really going on here can we really see uh the compression of the fabric space and you can and the end result is on the back side of it generating the field it gradually dissipates it&#x27;s so it&#x27;s not an alcubier concept here so um I believe that the proof is in the development of this particular engine where we pretty much have uh verified that it is compressing the fabric of space that does influence stuff and it does do a cumulative acceleration but the back end of the motor is a the warp field dissipates gradually which would be somewhat similar to what an ion drive does in respect to Once An ionized particle comes out through the thrust the Thruster of the nozzle it then becomes unionized and goes back into becoming just a regular element of Xeon gas next slide please so we also discovered was not only that we could influence the mag flux data data that we collected but the accelerometer we also affected gravity here and the the chart onto the right side of the screen of the various color representations and this and I and I have to emphasize here what you&#x27;re looking at occurred at 10 watts of power that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so remarkable about these images is they were created using just 10 watts of power and with just 10 watts we&#x27;re able to affect 0.7 what was that safe I think it&#x27;s 0.75 meters per second squared and if you&#x27;re familiar with gravity dosing in the um in space and microgravity you can grow plants in that environment double that go to 20 watts of power and go to 1.4 uh gravity doses or meters per second squared and guess what as an astronaut you&#x27;re going to be adhered to the floorboards of the spacecraft so one of our other proposals is the generation of artificial gravity now you&#x27;re all going to be saying to yourself how can you have warp bubbles within warp bubbles within warp bubbles you can and actually instead of generating one large warp bubble our concept is to generate multiple War bubbles around the craft which then combine into a larger one and by varying those fields you have full axial control of The Craft already done experiments hanging multiple engines down increasing the work fields on one to the other and it will always turn to the strong side of the field so you can turn you can go up you can go down you go backwards whatever direction that you need to go and the other thing that we&#x27;ve discovered too is that you can vary when you get down to individual tripole fields that you vary the amount of power going into those you control and manipulate the fields so future engines that we&#x27;re going to be working on are going to have tripol linear accelerator linear amplifiers that are going to be directly attached to the individual triple fields and then individually control so there&#x27;ll be a quad control throttle that you&#x27;ll be able to manipulate kind of like that Sioux City uh airliner that uh flew with just the engines their uh control surfaces were damaged by a turbine fan blade that sliced through them and they managed the lands of aircraft that they did crash on on Landing but a lot of people survived that crash but they manipulated the engines to go up go down turn to the left go to the right this is a similar like process would be more exacting obviously um to control a spacecraft or to control the station keeping of a satellite in space to keep it over the nadir over the Earth because right now they go into like a little small figure rate configuration burning the ion drive engines like oh something we&#x27;re about 14 to 18 hours a day to keep them on station so there&#x27;s that much drag in space that you&#x27;ve got to constantly manipulate to keep yourself over your central point on Earth so you can have Direct Communications up and down next slide please this is the uh the cooling effect of the of the warp engine um we actually detected a four and a half degree uh Fahrenheit Cooling the engine off engine on and that was uh again a revelation um of information and the fact of being able to manipulate the fields referringing intensities we also have engines that have variable slides on them that we can manipulate the fractal spacing and we can also manipulate the vertical orientation of the arrays we can actually generate more power by offsetting the arrays to one from one to the other the engines that we&#x27;re testing right now it&#x27;s more for everybody wants to see the thing lift off the ground and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been focusing our attention on is to minimize the amount of power maximize the amount of pulling power of the engine and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re focused on right now I know all the other things that we&#x27;ve have discovered over the last 12 years but we&#x27;re trying to finalize less power more work output next and these are some of the um comparisons between Model 17 and some of the other known NASA em Drive the NASA the uh the dawn ion drive engine NASA&#x27;s next ion drive engine and what we find interesting there is that you know in a very short order of time you know with 1500 watts of power that we can generate 15 Newtons of force the experiment that you just saw there that was um the physical maneuvering of the scale of the pulling on the scale and you saw the results there we typically make our calculations on distance travel and whatnot over this duration of time how far did the thing go up how much weight was it lifting at the time and those are related calculations but the difference is even into NASA&#x27;s next ion drive they&#x27;re using over 6 000 watts of power and they&#x27;re only generating 0.417 Newtons of force um and that&#x27;s like well what can I tell you or 0.237 Newtons of force versus uh what is it 41 I&#x27;m going to look at this closer uh 4170 seconds and within in this particular case of this particular experiment that we did 20 seconds 15 Newtons 1500 watts you can see the advantage right there within the comparison is that it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of wattage to generate Newtons of force that would super exceed um whatever has been put out there into space and that&#x27;s why we think this is more than a viable candidate more than a viable option for future space travel one of the limitations next slide please one of the limitations going to space is getting to point a and b in a reasonable Logistics time I mean to take 10 months worth of the logistics of food takes like close to 5 000 calories a day to feed an astronaut it&#x27;s cold up there and they don&#x27;t have extensive eating in these crafts but um bottom line is they&#x27;re also floating around and I got to do exercises and they have atrophy of their muscles and everything else any other appendages you put these smaller engines into the floorboards and run them at 10 to 20 watts of power and we&#x27;ve run biologic tests on there there&#x27;s no effects and no harm on this we&#x27;ve even taken control groups of special lab flies and we have gone to the second generation to see for mutations social behavior differences of the the group of flies and how they act and all this aren&#x27;t any difference and we expose these into some heavy heavy wattage of power and for well in excess of several minutes and we also measured out radiation from this and it came out to me one and a half uh micro RADS so in the background radiation that we experience here on Earth it&#x27;s anywhere between 12 to 25 micro Rands during the Fukushima meltdown we had over 85 micro RADS in the atmosphere right right over Omaha I have a monitoring station here that I keep track of stuff like that and uh so the engine output it&#x27;s one and a half micro RADS it&#x27;s nothing Chernobyl to date still has 1500 micro RADS a thousand micro RADS is one rad of radiation so Chernobyl is still very very uh Radioactive so in comparison this is nothing um and this is why we make it again a very good candidate to create artificial gravity within the context of a spacecraft next slide I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the time here that we got um oh we&#x27;re almost uh out of time but I have a fusion reactor that if you&#x27;re going to have a spacecraft you&#x27;re going to have to have power for these engines and so I designed a actual engine a a fusion reactor and I know you&#x27;ve already had some people discussing their versions of effusion reactant reactor and this is a a slightly different kind of reactor in that it represents next slide a protostar it&#x27;s the only time in nature that you can have Fusion going on at the same time is that you&#x27;re ejecting heavier particles that are in the fusion process during the homologous collapse of the gases within the nebula you end up with in these counter rotating fields and using nature as a you know it&#x27;s already done all this stuff and if you can mimic it well then you can build it that&#x27;s what happened with the warp drive engine and mimicked what a thunderstorm did so I went on with the same kind of characteristics teaching astronomy of a protostar next line and so the actual reaction uh in this inertial electrostatic confinement system we use high high voltage to the center core to confine the deuterium gas and one of the problems with a small fusar reactor has always been as PT Farnsworth experience he got his to go for about 30 seconds before it conked out and used up all the fuel but the the issue was he didn&#x27;t he never figured out a way how to refuel it how to actually stop the process and re and clean it and refuel it and then go on to the next run was the limitation next slide so it utilizing a protostar activity this is the only time in nature that you can draw fuel in at the same time that you&#x27;re doing Fusion and then expand that heavier Elements which then create a usually a confinement area around the core of a star once it becomes cocooned and it becomes a main sequence star so the life cycle of the star is committed in the beginning the birth the mid-level life and then the actual the the burnout of the star utilizing all of its fuel next slide and so what I did was um my design uses counter rotating magnetic fields and we use a Electro carbon slugs within the side of the reactor next slide and this is the diagram here of how all this would be put together next slide and then there&#x27;s an image of the actual reactor of what it would look like with the counter rotating fields on left and right sides of the the main sphere or the reactor um and also the power supplies that would then create the core 20 000 volt bolts of electricity the 600 volt electricity grid to the outside of the thermal blanket within the reactor itself next line and this would be using deuterium gas next line and those are the the rendering of the carbon wheels that would absorb the heavier particles that are generated through the fusion process and this allows then the reactor to be sustainable and utilizing deuterium gas next slide please and those are the energy equations next slide so you basically have created a small star within a oh about a 15 inch sphere we use deuterium gas about 29 liters of it and the idea here is the generate enough power to run the Port drives next slide and we would draw the electricity off a Thermal electric generation Pelletier diodes space is real cold and uh reactors hot and cool them down with the pelletiers and we&#x27;ll do a passive electrical generation and we would be able to sustain a reactor for about a year and allow us to go around in space next slide and that&#x27;s what we need it for Bluebird or an equivalent spacecraft that will take passengers and uh our crew to explore space to go from point A to B and Rapid succession next and here we are in the Milky Way galaxy we&#x27;re about Midway of that that&#x27;s about 750 light years thick we&#x27;re in the middle of it 1500 light years thick over 200 000 light years wide this is what we think it is a spiral galaxy some claim it&#x27;s a barred Galaxy whatnot but in order to exit out of the Galaxy and look back you&#x27;re gonna have to go at a thousand times faster than light for well over a year to do that and what I&#x27;m getting at is that we&#x27;re going to be somewhat confined even if we evolve this technology into being able to go faster than light getting around within the solar system will be ideal but we&#x27;re going to be limited within probably the context of about a thousand light years around us local space as we would be confined in so thoughts of grandeur of going to other galaxies and stuff at least within the foreseeable 50 years or maybe less I don&#x27;t know it depends on how fast we evolve this stuff that&#x27;s going to be our limitation even though it&#x27;s a highly Advanced to what we have right now but we&#x27;re going to still be confined within the Milky Way next slide and that&#x27;s uh 3.3 billion miles to Pluto and it took project Horizon 10 years and with one of our engines we could get there in 126 days pretty fast very fast it&#x27;s over 600 000 kilometers an hour okay um I guess we&#x27;re kind of finished there and I guess we&#x27;ll take some questions whatever time we have left wonderful David thank you so much let me let me bring in let me see I want to bring Mark in I&#x27;ll bring Jared and I&#x27;ll bring Michael in and um let me see we have Brian Sinclair as well with us so actually I don&#x27;t think that we have enough time for questions um but I what we do need to do is definitely applaud thank you so much David that was a brilliant presentation I I didn&#x27;t realize you&#x27;re going to go through the fusion reactor as well so that was kind of a twofer and um let me apologize for the technical challenges I know some of those were on your end but I I am so honored and Overjoyed that you were able to get things working so that you could do this presentation because that&#x27;s absolutely amazing all last minute wonderful wonderful can we just ask him about the uh the term warp drive because a lot of people in the comments are having problems with that that uh that they think you need special uh negative matter or stuff that we Element 115 in order to create a warp field um why are we calling this a work field you don&#x27;t need exotic energy to create warp bubbles I&#x27;ve demonstrated that and with my research in the relationship of thunderstorms and how they can create War bubbles themselves with copious amounts of unbridled energy it doesn&#x27;t require uh this exotic stuff that everybody&#x27;s been preaching the demonstration is I thought was clearly demonstrated in the video that we took of there&#x27;s no moving Parts there&#x27;s nothing what are you gonna how are you going to account for what that thing does we&#x27;ve shown all the different experiments that demonstrate redshift going through solid objects to influence objects on the other side uh we&#x27;ve done everything here to demonstrate doesn&#x27;t require exotic energy and I wouldn&#x27;t have a few I mean there&#x27;s a few improvements I would ask I would think of for those experiments maybe but yeah well yeah well it and so uh let me see and Mark&#x27;s putting some comments up right now so again we we are at the top of the hour I should mention David um I so and I can during our panel discussion I can play the video again but I also put a link to the video in the Google Drive and that&#x27;s linked from the conference page and I also put your presentation up there um and so again thank you so much for your time today it is truly a pleasure and an honor to have you with us my pleasure I hope you enjoyed it um thank you that&#x27;s what&#x27;s coming in the future right there wonderful thank you David great job okay so um everyone again you know and I just removed him but yeah again tremendous tremendous presentation by David Perez you know he presented I think last year and this is so much it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s a better presentation it&#x27;s more focused I think he explained he covered a lot of the same Concepts but expanded on those and elaborated on those and just adding in the fusion reactor was wonderful so let&#x27;s go into lab time and this is this is you guys this is your stuff um Mark you&#x27;re you&#x27;re this is your thing what where are we at man well uh first thing I wanted to show uh David Perez was uh we actually got this came in from Russia or actually from Kazakhstan recently this is a amplifier that I was hoping to help him with uh producing more power for his uh well next level of experiments because they&#x27;re they&#x27;re sort of limited on power hour at 1500 watts because that&#x27;s what the state of the art is is able to do with um solid state devices but with uh vacuum tubes we found several that can produce up to like 4 000 Watts um at the frequencies that he&#x27;s running at so that&#x27;s what this is we got two of them so probably able to go up to like six or seven thousand uh watts of power uh once that&#x27;s hooked up properly uh we&#x27;ve been pretty busy over the last couple of months uh you know while Apec was was quite we were still working um some of the projects that we&#x27;ve been working on here I&#x27;ll be presenting I I don&#x27;t think we have time for everything um but uh let me just go and dive right into it so one of the first things we did was this project over here it&#x27;s we call it the um it&#x27;s called the gravity plating experiment and this was based off of a guy who claimed that he was part of the secret space program and he saw some gravity playing stuff while he was on series um and I tried to turn it into an experiment he said there was these metal uh these are hexagonal shaped um boxes they were actually a little bit smaller than this that were in the floor that were that were creating this artificial gravity and um uh we presumed that it was made out of iron and the thought the thought process was is that transferring current through iron um being at the iron is uh ferrous and when you when you pass a current you create a magnetic field and the magnetic field is then shorted out by the same iron that it&#x27;s passing through uh maybe there&#x27;s a resonance point where you can create uh you can convert electromagnetic energy directly into gravity and apparently the the shape was important as well so one of the first things we did when we built this uh welded altogether was we tried impulsing it with a large capacitor bank that we had and um I&#x27;m going to show you the video of that right now here it&#x27;s loading up so this was uh the capacitor bank that we got from George Hathaway lab uh ten thousand I think it fired at around seven and a half thousand volts uh and you&#x27;re watching the slow speed camera of of that firing uh the results of this experiment were inconclusive at best um the amount of movement that we saw in in the air could have moved anything so it wasn&#x27;t necessarily uh gravity pulses but you do see um you know the weights on the other side moving uh more research needs to be done into this um to see if there&#x27;s actually any result um I and I did not find any resonance you know just with a pulse that was just one big bang um and uh we had like these copper plates at the end over here to uh to finalize the contact point and that moved as well so there was probably air flows created as well um in a later experiment we did this using an arc welder and uh varied the frequency and we did see some small movement on a portion bar um in that case uh but um it wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t very significant in the amount of power being used was not a lot um so that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re holding with this experiment and uh it&#x27;s speeded up you can see some of the Sparks there just slowly they&#x27;re slowly flowing away this is at like a couple like 20 or 30 000 frames a second on our high speed camera um how do I remove this okay um foreign some other experiments we had going on was this uh this device uh was dreamed up between a conversation between chat GPT and Todd deciado and well he wanted to we want to see what this is whether you can use sound this is a speaker here to create thrust now sound is a movement it&#x27;s a longitudinal wave it&#x27;s moving in and out or it&#x27;s like a pressure wave so it&#x27;s not actually pushing anything it&#x27;s pushing and pulling equal and opposite but if you have a a tuned cavity like we have over here um and the way this uh cavity was made on our we got a spin lathe and this was tuned the the cavity was made so that the uh the resonance point would come up just above that hole right over there and when we turned it on we did see 0.03 Newtons of thrust um that was enough to get the whole thing swinging um in a later iteration we cut a hole on the other side and put this buzzer on it and that doesn&#x27;t work uh it needs to be with the speaker and tunes properly for that to work um so we did see a couple a couple of grams of thrust uh with this device um so that was that was pretty promising another thing um that we&#x27;ve tried and I do have the slow motion uh video footage for this as well but I haven&#x27;t uploaded it yet so I&#x27;m not familiar with a um a hollaback array of magnets so you have a magnet facing this way and then that way and then that way and what ends up happening is the overall magnetic field is stronger on one side than it is on the other um this is a coil that follows that same principle and we impulse it uh what&#x27;s been happening with this is um if we put in more than a couple joules of power the thing just breaks apart so um it needs to be reinforced much better uh and there are a couple slow motion videos of the thing basically just falling apart um another experiment that we&#x27;re working on over here um again we have more UFO light discs so in the center there&#x27;s going to be a smaller saucer that we already have built it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s right behind me and we&#x27;re going to have them spaced out equally with these little spacers over here so that there&#x27;s a uh a chamber um uh in inside it&#x27;s like a double layered Hull now if anyone here is familiar with the uh Salvador Pious patent that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re trying to replicate with this we&#x27;re going to be inserting RF energy or microwaves through that hole over there um and we&#x27;re going to be polarizing the uh the two separate hulls um uh to a different DC voltage and measuring the entire apparatus for weight loss so outside Hall would be probably ground and the inside would be negative or vice versa and we&#x27;ll measure this entire thing for for weight loss according to his uh patent this is the Salvador Pious patent when he was um working with the Navy that RF um an RF cavity that has a uh a potential across the two sides of the RF cavity would would create a um a weight loss or a inertial mass shielding effect which is something similar to you know what we&#x27;re doing with the alpha experiment um the only way to do that the only way to have an RF cavity with a potential cross set is to have two hulls you have either a ball on the inside and the ball on the outside or in this case we&#x27;re going to have basically a saucer shape on the inside it&#x27;s also shape on the outside with us with the space in between being even on all sides that&#x27;s our RF uh waveguide and the high voltage potentials is across the two hulls so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s another experiment that we&#x27;re working on uh with the alzathon experiment uh We&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve come a long way with our setup um Todd the Seattle helped out and we automated the magnetic field so that it can sweep automatically so I don&#x27;t have to sit there turning a knob anymore and uh you know possibly um ruining the data by you know touching stuff or breathing on stuff because it the equipment is pretty sensitive so we&#x27;re able to just push a button and leave um leave the whole setup to run for the next two hours another thing we got is a a new signal generator which is going to allow us to not only do pulses of RF energy but it will allow us to do amplitude modulation frequency modulation and pulsing and combination of all three simultaneously um and uh in one of the later variations we&#x27;re planning on doing is uh as soon as we lock on to the electrons uh laramore frequency will during during the five millisecond pulse will be changing the frequency ever so slightly um several but just by about a kilohertz so it&#x27;s nine and a half gigahertz carrier frequency and that&#x27;s going to be rising by one kilohertz over the course of five milliseconds and then there&#x27;s gonna be a five millisecond shut off which would then allow the electrons or more frequency to transfer orientation to the core this is for the dynamic nuclear orientation experiment that we have going on over here um with the uh with the alzathon experiment um also with that experiment we have something else going on there&#x27;s a um when Professor Earl was down here from uh Albany State University he suggested that we try um casting metal inside of a magnetic field and that is easier said than done because uh any casting equipment that you use needs to be non-ferrous because if you have a ferrous casting and you stick inside a magnetic field you&#x27;re not actually casting in a magnetic field you&#x27;re casting the the magnetic field lines will go through the uh the iron or whatever it is metal on the side so uh we made these uh little discs out of a type of plastic that is specifically meant for casting and this is going to be covered by a ceramic coat uh and then we&#x27;ll be burning out the plastic and the the ceramic uh coat on top of it will then be used as a casting method for it um so that that&#x27;s something that should be happening in the next week or so uh We&#x27;ve made a whole bunch of these and these plates are going to uh each one is going to represent one casting mold to be able to try different Metals different combinations of metals and the idea is by cooling it off inside of the magnetic field going from a liquid state to a solid state inside the magnetic field will have a pre-polarization of the uh of the atoms and that will make them more susceptible to Dynamic nuclear orientation um one other thing that uh that we had going on was um and this uh Michael and I were talking about and I&#x27;m going to try to replicate it again but uh when we were at we were at a UFO Fair uh uh giving live demonstrations of superconductors um which aren&#x27;t by the way anti-gravity as far as I can tell um something very strange happened that I&#x27;ve never seen this before so I&#x27;m going to try to replicate it but I&#x27;ve never seen it before and we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll see if it happens again so basically what we had happened was the superconductor it was actually this one or one of these uh I had it hanging below a magnet over here and it was like tilted slightly and it was turning as it warmed up uh the the superconductor instead of falling down grows up towards the magnet and then fell down which is kind of strange because you&#x27;d expect it as it&#x27;s warming up to lose its um its flux pinning abilities and just slowly to fall down back into the beaker uh Jeremiah had some some explanations for it and uh Michael Perrone also had different explanations for a Todd so I couldn&#x27;t really come to a uh an agreement exactly what was happening I&#x27;m gonna try to replicate it again today and uh we&#x27;ll see if we can get that same result and uh see what happens we do have some some liquid nitrogen left over from the uh from the fair here and we&#x27;ll give this a shot that&#x27;s that&#x27;s liquid nitrogen for you over there I&#x27;m going to place the magnet inside actually probably better do it this way okay now the superconductor is cooling down I have the magnet on top I have the magnet below it actually um now as it as it goes through its uh critical um temperature it will start to become super conducting and oh no we&#x27;re not there yet hold on one second uh Tom can get some more looking at you in please balance all this yeah get a little more foreign a couple more seconds Ariana so that&#x27;s the super conductor cooling down right now um I think it should be in its critical State already I can just hold the uh camera hold the camera yeah that&#x27;s the view so yep it is quantly locked right now we got flux pinning going on there now yeah this is this is the situation that we had now let&#x27;s see what happens as it warms up magnet is pretty cold oh it did the same thing this time too look it it pulled up towards the magnet and then it fell down there we go now yeah the exact same thing just happened right now um okay right now it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pinned to it it is a perfect diamagnetic material right now because it lost its pinning so everything now it just wants to fly away from it I&#x27;m gonna have to warm it up in order to get to do a repeat of that so at least we&#x27;re able to replicate it from there yeah so the gist of this effect is as it goes up through its transition temperature the amount of pinned flux lines actually increases and the only way that that can happen is if it goes towards the magnet simple enough um Jeremiah had a different explanation that that uh some of the pin lines could have been from the uh could have been the from the uh close could have been pinned closer to the magnet and some of them were pinned farther away so as it warms up uh the ones that were pinned farther away actually disappear and the ones that are left are the ones that are pinned closer to the magnet whatever so Tim do we have uh do we still have uh Michael Anderson and uh the other guy there we could ask some questions sorry about that so Michael had to leave he he did have to leave for the day um but you know what so Mark is if if that&#x27;s everything should we could do other Lab Partners then should we go okay Michael yeah or Brian you know what let me actually if it&#x27;s okay let me go to Brian Sinclair who has been patiently and quietly waiting if that&#x27;s okay let me put let me put Michael on solo mode there hello thank you and yeah go ahead Michael or Brian I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m sorry all right can you hear me all right yep all right Perfect all right uh yeah this this year has been pretty exciting we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve had a lot of things going on um starting right with the first of the year when we actually had our first sustained and repeatable thrust from the the Trammell engine um that was uh that was the biggest breakthrough uh since we started this project a few years ago um it&#x27;s uh it will sustain it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s repeatable it happens every single time um the particu this this motor uh I&#x27;m calling this version one at this point because uh we are starting a second version um version one is going to be more or less a museum piece at this point it&#x27;s going to be a study item um I know what I would like to do to get some more power out of it but uh it&#x27;s not built to withstand what I want to do to it so we actually we actually started a version two um just a few weeks ago uh I did go and get a milling machine for our shop and we are making the parts as precise as possible uh we&#x27;re we&#x27;re in pretty good shape there I I know Ross was going to be on as well but I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on there I can&#x27;t get a hold of him right at the moment um so I I don&#x27;t know you know there&#x27;s not a whole lot more going on than that uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot and yet it&#x27;s really not a lot um I do have the travel here behind me let me get the camera moved around just a little bit here so that we can see it a little bit better and uh I have changed up the motor on this it&#x27;s uh we&#x27;re actually using a uh a starter from a car because that way I&#x27;ve got good solid repeatable uh RPMs I don&#x27;t have to worry about you know the the motor not having as much strength as it should or as it gets hot except they tend to get a little weak this one it it&#x27;ll overpower anything I&#x27;m I&#x27;m throwing at it at this point I do have it right now hanging um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not actually on anything these these are just there in case something was to break we don&#x27;t have a humongous crash uh and and what we&#x27;re doing for a speed controller right now is actually a carbon pile load tester so it&#x27;s a carbon pile resistor uh it&#x27;s capable of outputting upwards of 800 amps this doesn&#x27;t ever draw that much but I thought maybe everybody would like to see a real quick demonstration um as you see we&#x27;re we&#x27;re free floating over here is a turn it up there it&#x27;s going to get a little noisy I&#x27;m not sure how much noise canceling is going to happen here so hang on one second and we just lost a connection that&#x27;s all but and when I lost the connection it was the weight of the connection that we lost along with that there we go and just how it was hanging okay so let&#x27;s try it one more time foreign [Music] yeah when it when it when it dropped it uh it messed with the with the pivot Points here but uh anyway yeah it was It was obviously on the move when uh when the cable came off of it I do have a solenoid on here so that I can I can start it and slam it really hard uh at full speed with no ramp up but uh that is more for uh test purposes than anything else I don&#x27;t like to demonstrate it that way only because it&#x27;s going to tear itself apart um as far as anything else going on in the lab that&#x27;s pretty much been it we uh the the new machine this one weighs somewhere right around 320 pounds 330 pounds probably with this motor on it um the new machine is going to be made primarily out of aluminum the rotating components are going to be mostly aluminum the framework is going to be 99 aluminum um so we&#x27;re we&#x27;re going for as much lightweight material as we possibly can and uh that one we&#x27;re we&#x27;re hoping to be able to take it out in the real world and and do some real world testing um I guess that&#x27;s pretty much it uh I I don&#x27;t know too much more if anybody&#x27;s got any questions or you&#x27;re certainly welcome to ask well Brian no thank you thank you so much that&#x27;s awesome that&#x27;s awesome so Roth just popped in but let me let me if it&#x27;s okay let me go to Michael Perrone first and again Brian thank you so much for sharing that you&#x27;re welcome so Michael what do you have for updates and I know you&#x27;ve been working on a ton of stuff as well oops and you&#x27;re muted sir thank you uh the biggest update is we&#x27;re working a replication of Daniel Sheehan&#x27;s work from a while back with the uh ways to avoid I wouldn&#x27;t say violate but avoid the second law of thermodynamics um and uh I mean yeah we&#x27;ll get into that at some later date but so far it&#x27;s uh results seem promising but it&#x27;s a little early um yeah I mean I had a bunch of questions about the vem drive if that fellow&#x27;s still around might as well or not uh yeah I think all of our presenters I think all of our presenters are gone for the day unfortunately but oh well um yeah yeah so that&#x27;s the big thing yeah yeah that&#x27;s the big thing is uh um replications of Dan shian&#x27;s work uh based on blottislav kepex uh book challenges to the second law of thermodynamics um the underlying principle is simple enough when you derive thermodynamics from statistical mechanics you have some additional assumptions like ergonicity which are not completely generally true there are some systems where that&#x27;s not necessarily the case for uh for example mesoscopic systems where things don&#x27;t average out to a boltzmann distribution so you basically wherever uh statistical standard statistical assumptions wherever they don&#x27;t apply uh you have room to get around the standard thermodynamics because it&#x27;s built upon statistics to begin with um anyway um that&#x27;s the gist of it for now but not much more to say on that yet okay okay so we&#x27;ll go back there so let me you know what let me bring Ross in here so I think and Jared did you have experiments that you wanted to share you you have lab stuff or or do you uh I&#x27;ve been improving upon the gravel flyer but I don&#x27;t think I got anything that&#x27;s really worth sharing on top of that yet um okay I would say though that I&#x27;ve also been uh kind of working with Charles as well as another individual nearby me and um Charles has some excellent experiments we should go all check out his channel uh Charlie see on YouTube and and see some of the stuff he&#x27;s been doing with some um high voltage electrostatic lift uh experiments okay and and then you know what if we have time we should probably come back to chat GPT but let me let me go to Ross really quick okay so there there is Ross Small it has been a long time sir let me put you on solo layout so what Ross what do you have um so basically um you know we can&#x27;t disclose everything about that the internal engine um but early on like well first I want to mention that this whole thing started with Mike marsden&#x27;s Mach 1 um his name is Mike Marsden spelled m-a-r-s-d-e-n Mike Marsden his full name is Michael John Marsden and he created an invention called he calls it the Mach 1. which he says stands for the macroscopic version of the inner Quantum workings of matter so he just shortened it to Mac Quan and then one was the first invention he&#x27;d made and he also later made it back one two probably I don&#x27;t even know what he&#x27;s up to now um but I still correspond with him but um this was all based off of his theories um so basically this is the way he explains how it works it&#x27;s the conversion of angular acceleration and angular deceleration only into linear acceleration so we know linear acceleration is thrust that&#x27;s ultimately what you&#x27;re trying to do um so how you do that is this let me show you you have a machine like this you have to have this shape an X shape so these are like we call these sliders or shuttles they slide back and forth and but when this whole thing is rotating when this whole thing is put into a frame I don&#x27;t have it in a frame I just have it outside of the frame this is basically what Brian Sinclair has is this a drum a hidden drum not exactly like this but sort of you know the same kind of concept um but you have to basically have this x shape and that&#x27;s where the conversion comes because these sliders are actually like lit quite literally sliding linear back and forth but when this whole thing is rotating inside of a frame from that reference frame if they appear to be rotating in a circle actually because this is your mounts right here these little bolt holes is where you mount weight how do you wait so this side we call the the real weighted side and then so you see how that&#x27;s at the top we call that the top Hemisphere and then you spin it around there&#x27;s two inverse opposite sliders that are down here in the bottom hemisphere and this this is where you would have your fake Mass your your we call it virtual mass and let me show you how we basically how I initially did it let me shoot so on this side you would not have this solid metal rod here you would actually have this thing we call these sprinkles and there&#x27;s literally a spring hidden inside of the pole so basically as this is spinning around this spring is basically pushing outwards kind of mimicking as though there&#x27;s a two heavy weights spinning around in a circle but there&#x27;s not on this side there&#x27;s not there it&#x27;s just empty it&#x27;s just but the Springs are pushing out giving the fake appearance of centripetal force but there&#x27;s not really centripetal force here it&#x27;s just a trick in then in the center what how they&#x27;re connected is is I think you can see it there are these braided stainless steel wires that was the initial way I did it but we call them the parallel tethers that&#x27;s the parallel tethers that connect them together they stay parallel all the time and that&#x27;s where the conversion comes it&#x27;s um he calls it Mass displacement but let me um let me see if I can put the camera in an angle to where I can show you all the um linear tethers moving foreign so that should give you a good angle of the inside of this thing that&#x27;s kind of what&#x27;s going on here there&#x27;s these linear tethers um but I might actually undo the tethers real quick just to kind of show you what it looks like when the sliders are moving back and forth let me just take the headers off foreign [Music] tether off you get the second [Music] [Music] foreign so this is basically what it looks like when this the shuttles are going back and forth I want to kind of show you what it looks like [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] um foreign so as you can see basically they&#x27;re linear sliders that slide back and forth but in this um you know this rotate this Hub would rotate on a frame on bearings so as as it&#x27;s stationary you could see you know these sliders are clearly just going back and forth but when you get this whole drum spinning from the outside it looks like it&#x27;s just they&#x27;re spinning around in a circle they don&#x27;t um look like they&#x27;re going back and forth but they really are um you know so it&#x27;s basically you have to create this weird situation where you you could it&#x27;s like a converter like you convert it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not just acceleration or you know or deceleration it&#x27;s both so it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s like a wave format so it&#x27;s acceleration for 90 degrees of the turn then you sell then sudden deceleration for 90 degrees been sudden acceleration for 90 degrees been sudden deceleration for 90 degrees so basically um you know he figured out how to do it with acceleration just alone but the problem is obviously if you keep accelerating a disk eventually gets so fast it just explodes you know so this way it&#x27;s accelerating and decelerating so you you can just you have it at this kind of average speed it&#x27;s never it&#x27;s never truly going like a certain RPM exactly it&#x27;s literally changing speed four times per rotate actually it&#x27;s eight times per rotation because you got to remember those those sub these shuttles are you know on half one half hemisphere so when this whole thing spins it&#x27;s actually doing it eight times instead of four times so every time this whole drone spins it&#x27;s actually accelerating and decelerating eight times publication so we&#x27;re talking about like but you know microscopic difference it&#x27;s not like a huge difference in speed it&#x27;s just a very minute tiny difference of speed but that&#x27;s enough um you know to get converted down those linear covers and the Springs are what do it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the orientation the way it changes but um as you as you see it was pretty difficult for me to spin it with even with the tethers not connected but then when you connect with others it makes it even harder but then when you put a spring you know when you have an actual spring in there when you have a spring pole then it gets really hard to spin the thing and this was the my original spring a very powerful you know spring that I used originally um but basically we have all so many different um types of Springs that we&#x27;re experimenting with stronger weaker um you know changing the speed of the whole thing and but this is more of just a test piece to kind of like show you like what you know the theory behind it what&#x27;s actually kind of going on in there but not giving it away completely because this is not this machine wouldn&#x27;t work this is just a a a um a theoretical test kind of toy to kind of show you um this shuttle you know what we call the shuttles or the sliders parallel tethers um and that kind of stuff the attachment points for the weights um but yeah I guess that&#x27;s that&#x27;s it um you know that&#x27;s um I was good one on um but you know this this kind of is a good um demonstration to kind of show you but not give it away Tim Tim you&#x27;re muted okay sorry about that I owe you an apology Ross I hit remove from stream instead of removed from solo layout that was that was my fault so let me apologize for goofing on that um well thank you thank you for demonstrating that for us I mean that&#x27;s I saw that actually on another Channel and that takes us to the Media Partners thing which we&#x27;ll come to in a few minutes I guess but um so again this is kind of our lab section I&#x27;m really excited I mean we there are so many experiments going on like Mark kind of gave us an overview of some of the things he&#x27;s working on he has a ton of projects and he has even more stuff that&#x27;s kind of like underway with parts on order he&#x27;s waiting for things to come in he&#x27;s waiting for things to be finished um that we have other experimenters as well uh and so just you know there are so many lab experiments going on right now this is just kind of a small view um if it&#x27;s okay you know what I I want to show you guys uh I&#x27;m going to go back to our research Labs page and let me share this screen very quickly okay so in terms of research labs this is something that I added to the Apec website um you can see Ted Pittman&#x27;s device there so again Falcon space right that is Mark&#x27;s team and that&#x27;s a growing team warp drive Tech that is Todd deciado and Todd is doing work with Mark as well uh Saint Claire Tech it&#x27;s Brian Sinclair and Ross and they are both working on similar projects join the technicians Jeremiah pop and he has been working with a number of people he&#x27;s been working with the hover coil as well lately spaceflex technology I think this is a tentative name I&#x27;m not sure this is Mike Gamble&#x27;s Organization for those of you who are regulars you know Mike Mike has done many presentations at APAC he is also doing inertial propulsion devices and um this is original Butler Labs Drew from sunny Florida who has presented many many times but the thing I wanted to show you scrolling down and you can see Ross lost former device there is I also have a growing list of these are organizations that have appeared on APAC if you are one of these and you&#x27;re not on that list let me know and I&#x27;ll add you if you&#x27;re doing experiments If You&#x27;re Building Things um and if you know of others you know maybe that we&#x27;ve missed in the past we&#x27;ve had so many people present um again just let me let me know there so I&#x27;ll stop sharing that one and Mac for screen so I think is this it for our Labs or or do you guys have more Mark do you have more to you want to run us through some more stuff oh yeah there&#x27;s uh something else that I forgot so uh George Hathaway uh from up in uh Canada actually sent us an epr machine uh which is uh back over there this is an actual epr machine uh it&#x27;s the variant E3 and um this was the actual machine that he ran the alzapon experiment on uh way back in the 2000s I think 2002 and he included the uh the notebook with the paperwork so big thank you to George Hathaway uh for that uh we also got the we got a lot of stuff from George actually that and also we got the uh um nitrogen laser came in the same package so we&#x27;re gonna have a lot of experiments going on with some of the equipment that uh George has donated to us so big thank you to George thank you awesome awesome thank you thank you so much okay oops oh and that&#x27;s overlapping there we go still getting used to it still getting used to stream yard so can I show the GPT thing yeah yeah Jared could you do that could you show us yeah let me put you on solo layout and you are getting a little bit of background noise but okay it could be because we&#x27;re all unmuted I I think it&#x27;s Jared&#x27;s mic I think he has something going in the room could be a fan maybe or there we go all right so y&#x27;all can see that I believe um so we&#x27;ve been working on getting uh GPT tied in with this library of like 18 gigabytes worth of anti-gravity type of documents um and this is the the most primitive version of it yet um you can search for a term and it lets you search through the library uh and as we scale this up we&#x27;re going to be implementing GPT like answers with it where you can do more than just single keyword Search terms you can actually ask it questions so you can do your research based off of the collected knowledge that we have here um this is very similar to something that was just unveiled this last week by Kurt jamungle over on theories of everything uh he was interviewing uh John Greenwald Jr over there at The Black Vault and uh uh the Black Bolt is 3.2 million documents it&#x27;s insane the amount of documents that uh he has foyer requested but um what theories of everything decide to do was pretty much the same thing we&#x27;re doing you can GPT question and answer form all 3.2 million documents and it will give you the Snippets out of those documents the one difference between ours and this one is this one doesn&#x27;t actually tell you what document it came from whereas ours you can at least trace it back to the original documents so uh it&#x27;s really exciting being able to leverage these new technologies to be able to like supercharge our research efforts oh okay and that was everything okay well let me let me bring let me bring everybody back in um so I think guys I mean let me see do you think that&#x27;s it for now or that may be it for our yeah do we have um Media Partners in ready yet yeah yeah well let me give you a hand I am going to give you a hand for hard work and diligence and actually building things right which is I mean none of this none of these pretty posters behind me matter unless people actually build things otherwise it&#x27;s just pretty posters behind me so you know thank all of you and thank everybody out there for getting involved and Building Things and doing Hands-On work right I mean scientific theory is is fun and useful and all that but you know unless people construct things um and if you are constructing something and you want to present at the next conference other than the open uh discussion one uh reach out to Tim or I um and uh we&#x27;ll be able to discuss it to get you into the stream yard yeah and I&#x27;m going to put let me see alternative propulsion at gmail.com right I think that&#x27;s I&#x27;ll put your email in there so folks can reach out directly to you and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s going out there so alternative propulsion gmail.com if you want to reach Mark at Falcon space and he is the master of time and space and machinery and tooling and many other things look at yes see look at the humility look at the humility not not not quite so but and I I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m so pleased and honored that you guys are all building things um that&#x27;s that&#x27;s amazing that&#x27;s how this actually moves forward otherwise it&#x27;s just analyzing UFO videos and you know doing math so okay well we&#x27;re a few minutes before the top of the hour but Steve ellswick is with us so what I want to do now is I&#x27;ll take everybody out and I am going to let me see I&#x27;m gonna go to Steve we will put him on okay Steve Media Partners okay uh so Steve this in this part of it and what I will do is run through all of our Media Partners let me thank you for helping us promote this conference but I also wanted to ask what are some of the top stories and topics that are open to you and I think we should also help promote the Tesla Tech conference which has a lot of overlap with what we&#x27;re doing and you have been doing it forever so should I put your flyer up let me put the uh put the extraordinary conference up there okay uh this is our conference coming up in August uh the 2023 experience technology conference uh from August 9 to 13th um I just got back from the contact in the desert that was in Indian Wells it&#x27;s very well very well attended only about they only had like a couple thousand people there instead of the uh five thousand they had in 2019 so uh it&#x27;s just a lot of people not used to seeing that many people but ours is nowhere near that big but um I just pleased to see a lot of people get started to get out again and go into these things the importance about our conference is that it&#x27;s all about people and we&#x27;re trying to get people to meet people and and uh we also provide people a place for people to bring out their investors and that and actually demonstrate them in public you know um we do not do an online conference um it kind of defeats the uh the purpose of uh of the what we&#x27;re trying to achieve and that is getting people there uh this year we have a a lot of Hardware I like to point out Ralph see that&#x27;s gonna be there and he has about six different inventions I will be demonstrating and we&#x27;ll actually be setting them in an entire Spa there for people to try all this stuff out and everything um and uh we try to uh cover a wide gamut of of issues from uh Health to Alternative Energy to love anti-gravity and and it was just a conceptual stuff so we try to run the gamut uh without live conferences where people can come and actually touch and see things a lot of stuff that we do is unbelievable um we&#x27;re starting to use the term disruptive in our in our title there like if you notice on the things this is extraordinary disruptive technology topics feature everything we do is basically disruptive it was the status quo um well you got that tripling these other organizations that that kind of push that forward but worth the disruptors we&#x27;re the people out there who take the status quo and totally destroy it you know For Better or For Worse you know um and now what you see coming is in the past we focused on tests and everything and they had this field called radionics you know and uh that was what we call woo-woo stuff you know it gets kind of way out there but now it&#x27;s starting to come more and more of the Forefront in terms of quantum mechanics and Quantum science and now they got a new term called Quantum quantum entanglement and I believe that would be what is known as the old lady Alex now a lot of the stuff that we have on our on our website at testatech that info is the link to our channel YouTube channel and we have all the Global Science conferences in the past and Global Science was pretty heavily in the radius and that so uh you&#x27;re going to find stuff on our channel that you&#x27;re not going to find anywhere else a lot of the stuff that we have on our channel uh as from Members Only um for one reason if you put things behind the paywall YouTube and the census tend to stay away from you you know but the minute you bring out in the public you know and make a free public thing then all of a sudden you start seeing them come out of the woodwork and start slamming you and they uh can even uh pull your account for a while I&#x27;ve had that done to me three times already you know I just gotta stay you know be careful what I put in the public and when I put in the members only uh our last three conferences are for most part members only I am going to try to get about two or three of people in the public from uh more recent conferences um over concerts are recorded at this point um I don&#x27;t know uh I can say we cover the white gamuts you know we have a well an old favorite of mine is Jeff Hayes he he will be coming Jeff is coming out with a new book and he he does the test of turbine I don&#x27;t know if any of you are pretty much Jeff the guy is very um she&#x27;s a lot better speaker than I am and he&#x27;s done a lot of research into the area of tests of turbines uh which could be uh one of the key factors in our research you know um the test of turbine is the only turban in the world which you can operate over solid material you know in our past magazines extraordinary uh technology magazine we&#x27;ve even had our studies that we published studies that have done but he saw us as a as a combustible material and the advantage of just the terms and no damage whatsoever you take a regular turbine you throw that stuff in there it&#x27;s going to destroy it probably within the first first five minutes you know running something like that but so yeah so uh that kind of Technology could be the salvation of things like uh um well the coal industry you know because you can if you run powdered uh sawdust through it you can run powder coil through it you know and eliminate some of the uh steps that you have to take but even more important is uh David Pantone with the geek technology it was was geek you&#x27;re you&#x27;re taken and you&#x27;re unlocking the carbon allow the hydrocarbons you know and so you don&#x27;t get the carbon monoxide or the carbon dioxide that you normally get when you&#x27;re locking the oxygen into the hydrocarbon or into the carbon so uh yeah it&#x27;s a very promising technique and you can hook one of these devices on the back end of a test of turbine and you and you can have a pen that&#x27;s spewing out oxygen as opposed to um uh the carbon dioxide and the carbon monoxide in the global warming which are coming uh my next issue of our magazine I&#x27;m working I&#x27;m going to be covering this this global warming up phenomenon we&#x27;re seeing um currently and I know that we and the people at this conference are are holding the keys to some of the solutions for this you know we can&#x27;t be a fossil fuel based uh uh Society forever it&#x27;s time to move onward and forward and onward um that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m heading with with our technology uh hydrogen is playing a more important part uh we&#x27;re starting to look into uh nanocarbons and the way they can be used to generate electricity you know just from the fibers itself we look at Water snacker technology which uh and once you&#x27;re you&#x27;re using scalar technology to uh manipulate the structure of the water or the air or even the batteries now when you run this stuff through a lot of stuff you know 20 years ago when ice got started here um it was total fantasy land and everything I think we&#x27;re well beyond that at this point uh what was uh a really cute for in the past is now the hot topics now uh you want some good source material we have it um I encourage all of you to come to the conference you know and uh and learn things you know like I well Richard Blankenship he&#x27;s coming in there with tetrionics you know which is kind of like a using a triangular based uh concept of math you know so uh if you get a chance you know um come out there and learn more about tetrionics you know they&#x27;re the grammar to the math you know advances mathematics is a language then patriotics is the grammar yeah well Steve if it&#x27;s okay I just wanted to jump in and yeah I would definitely recommend that you know people learn more about Tesla Tech also you have a channel you&#x27;ve talked about your channel a little bit that&#x27;s something uh you know what let me see we should we should actually do you think that you might be able to uh put that up on the screen we could see Steve&#x27;s Place see the YouTube channel um I don&#x27;t know you&#x27;d have to be able to get too much ground I don&#x27;t have that available um you know what here let me give a look up really quick but uh you know I&#x27;ve done some of this work on these on these uh Technologies myself uh probably the the one I found the most fascinating was the chipper motor which we built back in I lived in Stanfield you know that was back in around 19 98 you know and maybe 1999 that&#x27;s why I met here from and he had this motor which is a motor generator and we put that thing together and um and we had a 10 times output three amps in 30 amps out and I could never believe that that would ever work out and and that&#x27;s a come I&#x27;m looking at a lot of stuff you know when we put that that thing worked for three weeks and it stopped working Kepler went on to build bigger ones with these other people who did not want me to be in fog you know uh with the research because they&#x27;re trying to capture easy but um it&#x27;s Kipping more and more with that um he kept running to the three-week problem and instead of transfer away this thing only worked for three weeks the people who were backing at that time just wanted to calm a fraud you know which I know he wasn&#x27;t a fraud uh this stuff really works the problem is a lot of stuff is anomaly and that&#x27;s what the whole tester field is based on anomalies when Tesla was building his Tesla causing that he didn&#x27;t want to uh well like the engineers are trying to give any Anonymous option like the high points you know like doing me but he&#x27;s trying to certainly get that big swing you know well you want to as an engineer you want to dampen that get rid of it okay uh that&#x27;s what Engineers do but that&#x27;s not what tested that he tried to amplify that and that&#x27;s where your free energy stuff comes into you know by amplifying the transients and if you ever listen to uh a Tesla coil uh a spark speaker like we know we have a uh a spark on your Tesla coil um being driven by a by music like say box the best because there&#x27;s a lot of transients so when you see that coming out there and all of a sudden you hear that real tinny tinny sounds you know but it fills the whole room up you know but there is is it does it because the transients if you were to dampen that waveform and make it your typical sine wave uh you don&#x27;t get those kind of facts so all the free energy stuff that we&#x27;re doing you know and probably even in the end of gravity is the seven degree at transient effects and we just got to figure a way ways of harnessing them you know um that&#x27;s what capacity is doing some somewhere ways you know if you ever put a capacitor um like if they used to have like these electronic junkyards you know you go in there and you have these big huge capacity they use on our Power Systems and we&#x27;re talking your your line systems outside the white power houses you take it and if you don&#x27;t have a thing shorten out together you could walk past that thing and Get Zapped you know uh with a pretty good Arc you know could even kill you you know um that&#x27;s because as a collector of transient energy you know and the whole the whole thing is for transient now if Chip is more than that it was a motor generator it used a a 12 volt alternator we had a a dead 12 volt battery it was we first measures like nine volts and we had a 12 volt 3 amp uh motor you know to drive the thing it was a motor generation never working I was always pull the battery back down lower but when Kip was uh doing his measurements and that hooked this thing up he was uh dragging these wires out and then come back together together again and it was like a big bundle of wires there you know and uh oh geez this guy&#x27;s a uh the sloppiest wiring guys team because you only need to go that far uh about that far and so you know it was a waste to me it&#x27;s a waste but when he saw that thing going and it could just barely go he gets in there and starts moving those wires apart and all of a sudden it snaps as it starts taking off charge that battery in about two hours to 14 votes and we put a to keep it from blowing up we put in a an inverter and a 100 watt light bulb and top strong thing move faster but they only worked for three weeks and stopped working not from over here because it was very cold until all of a sudden uh on the third week it something happened and all of a sudden everything got hot real fast and then it died within about 10 minutes so anyway uh if any one of you are interested in getting the plans for that contact me still a test to take that info and I&#x27;ll send you uh the PDF you know of those plans then you can try it yourself and see if you could do it very few people have ever been able to replicate it you know but uh just like I said dropping off that Stephen just to take that number and I&#x27;ll send yada those plans awesome well Steve it sounds like you&#x27;re kind of closing things up let me let me say thank you thank you so much thank you for helping us to promote the Apec conference and thank you for I thank you for letting us crash the conference and do reporting on it for the last two years and uh you know and and thank you for doing the service that you do for over 20 years now I mean you&#x27;ve been helping educate people you&#x27;ve been helping to share Tesla&#x27;s Legacy I guess it&#x27;s not 20.</p>
<p>it&#x27;s like 30 30 years now right it&#x27;s about 40. yeah so I mean what you&#x27;re doing is amazing and absolutely amazing so I&#x27;ll remove that but Steve thank you yet again we put links to all of that and uh you know it so in again in about a month when we do another conference I&#x27;d love to have you back and just share news updates with us about what your latest is what&#x27;s going on and how things are going um and so what I&#x27;d like to do now actually I&#x27;m just going to go to solo feed and I will present my screen and uh so Steve let me thank you one more time sir well thank you thanks for having me okay so in terms of Media Partners Tesla Tech again has been awesome forever forever so thank you so much what what I want to do now is I want to share the rest of our Media Partners this list May grow and change over time again this is on the alt propulsion website um this is in the media page this is some of the media that we&#x27;ve done guys this is your conference this is your media and this is your achievement uh this article in Popular Mechanics this was about Apec this was when Roger Sawyer talked about the EM drive and this is not the only time that this conference has been featured NASA DARPA MIT scientists meet to discuss anti-gravity Tech in futurism.com again that was about this conference and this is your conference we are the open Community voice for merging propulsion so uh Alien scientist you guys all know about his channel I&#x27;m just I&#x27;ll click through and then click back really quick um this is Mr Jeremy riss uh Alien scientist has 112 000 subscribers they are all well deserved and hard earned he has 437 videos so my personal experience here with Jeremy was in the mid-2000s when I was doing reporting in American anti-gravity on all sorts of emerging propulsion Concepts this guy came onto the scene and YouTube and back then there you know it was it was still kind of this emerging platform and he starts putting together these videos with some of the most difficult things that I had written about he condense it into like this two minute video and I watched the video and it would make sense and it would be brilliant and compelling and he would just like go through this and I would be like oh my God this is 20 pages of material and he just condensed it down to like two minutes and it makes complete sense so that person was Jeremy riss and he is still at it 15 something years later right and so again there&#x27;s no surprise why he has 112 000 subscribers so he is on youtube.com alien scientist I&#x27;m going to paste that into chat for you guys oh you you can&#x27;t even see that screen can you okay it popped open in a new window let&#x27;s do this there 112 000 subscribers alien scientist okay so um I am really really proud to have him as a media partner with us and help promote the conference which he has been doing since the very beginning alien scientist at utope and I&#x27;ll copy that link I&#x27;m gonna drop that into chat okay so now I want to go I&#x27;m going to go back into my open tab uh I&#x27;m going to have to paste these in because I think they open an induced tab crypto Alchemist this is Mr Bernie konkin Bernie has also been part of the Apec conference since the very beginning um Bernie has he has large awnings he&#x27;s got 8 000 subscribers Bernie also works with and collaborates with a number of other people and they are all basically getting the word out there about these emerging Technologies Bernie has had us on his channel many many times as you can see here we&#x27;ve got tons and tons of videos there you can see we we did an Apec promo back in the day um he has kind of a mixture of art science technology futurism and he&#x27;s got his own unique style and people love it people love what Bernie is doing so Bernie thank you so much again crypto Alchemist let me paste this one in and I will paste this into the public chat there okay and I got a couple more to run through and these are again my my favorites here um Professor Simon Holland okay uh so I&#x27;m gonna copy this link address I&#x27;ll paste this one in so Simon Holland has been doing he&#x27;s a former British film and television editor he&#x27;s actually helped make documentaries and movies and many other things like that um Simon has started covering the Apec conference he is also heavy into covering the UAP story and you can see how to photograph a UFO here personal ideas about the David grush objects in orbit I mean he&#x27;s got so many videos on that lots and lots on UAP but he also has you can see he&#x27;s talking about HARP here ionospheric heaters um you know I mean you know the steam engine um there&#x27;s just tons and tons and tons of material I did an interview with Simon on my channel a little while ago and he is a brilliant individual he&#x27;s doing wonderful science and again it&#x27;s no surprise that he has a hundred thousand subscribers you know and he&#x27;s done over 800 videos in his videos they are very well edited again that is his uh that is his professional background so he has a lot of experience there so I want to thank Simon for being a media partner and again please check out his site and subscribe you will not be disappointed um I also want to talk about let me see generation Zed okay so uh again Die Hard APAC fans will remember Dave Dave Zedd or Dave Rossi I believe um he has been doing he&#x27;s got 31 000 subscribers he has been focused on UAP emerging propulsion he&#x27;s talked a lot about the pis devices um he has talked a lot about breakthrough Technologies um he also gets into you know like apertures of Consciousness tuning forks I mean other esoteric phenomena so if you&#x27;re interested in a lot of these topics his website is or his his YouTube channel is a big one and it is definitely worth subscribing to uh so I want to get generation Zed here I&#x27;m going to put paste this into chat um he is wonderful thoughtful informative he digs down into stories he tries to understand the science and technology and he tries to explain that and that is not always easy to do so Dave said everybody um let&#x27;s paste that one in foreign and we just spent a few minutes Tesla Tech I will show you guys actually this goes to Steve&#x27;s channel uh so again we just went through Tesla Tech um if you want mine is more in here as a placeholder than anything else but I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;ll copy a link Tim Ventura interviews so I moderate APAC um after hours I do one-on-one interviews I do them with a lot of individuals like this I&#x27;ve interviewed Steve in the past I&#x27;ve interviewed Simon Holland um I&#x27;ve interviewed folks like Gary Stevenson who spoke today in Jack sarfati and many others I don&#x27;t have nearly as many subscribers as our Media Partners do and and that&#x27;s okay I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not doing it for the ratings what I&#x27;m doing is to try and showcase the people behind this that&#x27;s really what gets me excited about it is what drives the people doing emerging science so typically I&#x27;ll take a topic and I I will find subject matter experts who can speak effectively about it and and I&#x27;ll just try and drill down so I&#x27;ll paste my link in here odds are you&#x27;ve already seen my channel it&#x27;s been a little quiet lately but as uh well especially as the UFO whistleblower story picks up I suspect that I will be more engaged there lately I have been focusing a lot more on getting the Apec conference up and running and perfected again and I&#x27;ll tell you what guys I am so Overjoyed to get aipac working and up to speed and we have amazing presenters an amazing audience and I want to thank everybody who&#x27;s involved I also want to give special thanks to Mark Sokol for helping today for kicking butt with experiments and Mark is actually the person who pushed us into stream yard this was something we were looking at and and Mark was the one who said you know what pull the trigger go with stream yard you know I&#x27;ve used this I love it it works great it&#x27;s a little bit different it&#x27;s got its share of quirks but I&#x27;ll tell you what there&#x27;s this fluidity to using it that Zoom just doesn&#x27;t have that being said um from a media perspective this might be a good time to point out that uh let me go back in here I want to go to our Open Mic session Okay so on the Apec website I will just share this very quickly this is our schedule it&#x27;s on the events tab if you hunt around on our website it&#x27;s on one of the drop downs you can see our upcoming events schedule so we have an open mic coming up on June 24th I will email everybody about that you can also see our full annual event calendar and this is something that you can add those events so right now I&#x27;m not going to click on this because I think it may pop open in a new window this is a tool that we use called add event it lets you basically view upcoming calendar events and add them to your own calendar regardless of the type of calendar you use it&#x27;s very slick tool um I have added all of the open mic through the end of the year and I will be adding the July 8th Apec webinar very soon we&#x27;re still organizing that one and getting it together but if you want to add these to your calendar these are locked in June 24th is the next one and the and all of this is moving forward then so let me stop sharing okay and I think for today that was it so let&#x27;s go to panel discussion we&#x27;ll open things up foreign other folks that I will invite to our panel so the time being we&#x27;ve got four people here okay I&#x27;m gonna let me see okay I&#x27;m gonna stop sharing so guys I guess this is open discussion and I will add some more in uh uh so what what topics do we have to cover guys uh David Grouch and uh there was also the the Ivo launch that&#x27;s coming up in uh two days uh June 12th we have our first anti-gravity style propulsion system being tested in space um that&#x27;s a big one that hasn&#x27;t been talked about yet Ivo uh I think it&#x27;s unlimited.com uh we could pull up that website right now let me see the website yeah I think Dave groosh is the big story did you hear about how Dave Bruce tweeted that he wants to disavow himself very loudly of any relation or connection to Greer yeah yeah I saw that that was kind of funny right that was great it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s so typical of our uh of this field that uh anyone who&#x27;s at a big name just Greer pounces on him and says oh I made that happen um but if I can I would like to share a screen over here so we can talk about the uh let me see present share screen okay and I just invited uh Michael Boyd and Bernie they were asking they were asking Michael to ask if he could come in earlier so if he&#x27;s if he receives this we&#x27;ll chit chat with him uh let me see it looks like uh Bruce cornette Bruce should we invite Bruce in sure sure bring them on um so Ivo limited is uh that I know of that is uh putting a satellite in space for the sole purpose of testing a an alternative propulsion concept uh propulsion device um and it will be taking off on June 12th in two days this Monday with Transporter eight mission from uh Vandenberg in California um and uh this is their website some promos about what they can do a lot of money got pumped into them recently Rogue systems is behind it and uh they don&#x27;t really talk a lot about what the technology is but uh me and Tim have talked to them and they did promise to get on with our next Apec conference and do a presentation as soon as they have more data on their device and see whether it works or not yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s interesting how all this is happening at once isn&#x27;t it I mean Dave groosh and uh you know what we we actually have Gary McKinnon here with us today there&#x27;s there&#x27;s Gary&#x27;s comment right there two days from now yep I should ask let me see I should ask Gary if he wants to hop on with us so um this is their their drive system it looks like um those those things look like battery connections of sorts um apparently only uses one watt of energy and it makes a couple millimeters of thrust uh here you see the inventor alongside uh one of the investors um and uh they have a lot of momentum behind them uh one of the guys from one of the chief financial officers from Dr Pepper got involved as well and let&#x27;s see what every time I check their website something something else is new there uh again there&#x27;s not much information on their website of exactly what their propulsion system works off of but uh we can imagine that it&#x27;s something that we&#x27;ve talked about on APAC um because we&#x27;ve talked about a lot of different things but here are some people who are doing something with it and I just want to see if anything comes of it yeah well so Mark do you think we&#x27;ll have news in like two days from these guys um probably in a week uh two days is during the launch I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know how quickly they&#x27;re going to be able to get any measurable results but uh they&#x27;re sending up a small satellite it&#x27;s a cubesat and the only purpose of the satellite is to change its or its orbit so if it&#x27;s able to change its orbit it has no propulsion system on board other than this Quantum Drive which has nothing nothing shooting out the other side if this actually works it will change in orbit then we&#x27;d know that this thing worked and I see Michael Boyd just uh is joining us right now is Michael joining us yeah this is open discussion time so we&#x27;ll we&#x27;re just inviting we&#x27;re inviting some folks in we do have limits we have limits in stream mode about how many folks can be on at once oops looks like Michael is still connecting and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s why we have to be careful for this one so the open mic is the old that&#x27;s the not old but it&#x27;s the other Zoom format and it&#x27;s more open it&#x27;s more flat and it&#x27;s moderated right but it&#x27;s and again we&#x27;re doing that one on June 24th and that one is not subject focused it&#x27;s more just mellow you know yeah and I I already saw uh our good friend from the from our chat group what was his name uh Phil Bouchard plans to be there yeah so you know with hope and Michael Phil Phil is actually getting involved with actual experiment now he has a signal generator and an elf coil and um he has an experiment that will last about 12 years with a very very low frequency and uh I have no clue how he&#x27;s going to be able to uh sit there and stare at it for 12 years but um I don&#x27;t know yeah well so in terms of Elf stuff the one that I&#x27;m most familiar with is frandy aquino&#x27;s device right and Steve Burns was one of the subject matter experts there Jeremy you might remember this from from the old days because D Kino was big in like 2000 to like 2005 I think he kept making headlines then um and his thing was he was looking at a variety of frequencies down to these were sub one Hertz right so like 1 12 Hertz I think something like that it was it was like one Hertz to 112 Hertz or something so oops it looks like Michael is still trying but he still haven&#x27;t he&#x27;s still having Tech issues um and so with with d Aquino uh one of the things that I saw in chat was they were talking about how to build antennas if I remember right they talked about using a heavy iron core for D kinos and it had something to do with finding you know finding the correct wavelength and finding the correct uh material for that that elf and it turned out that basically what they were talking about was like kind of like an iron Cannonball type thing and then I think they were talking about a transmitter that was kind of buried in the middle of it so okay this is another thing that&#x27;s happening is uh the national Press Club uh Stephen Greer is going for a second one of his uh disclosure events um I think it&#x27;s around 500 to see it in person the price may have gone up um if you want to actually sit there in the room and uh it&#x27;s going to be taking place uh in two days from now around the exact same time as the launch of uh transporter eight with uh ivos um and a gravity propulsion thing um this is another another big story that&#x27;s happening uh if you want to watch it live on uh media I think he&#x27;s charging 150 or something like that but uh for all of us um you know who don&#x27;t want to waste money on that uh probably be able to watch it later for free you know after the fact and uh learn learn what it is that he he is so interested in sharing with the world we that we don&#x27;t already know about but it feels like there&#x27;s momentum building towards a disclosure moment and people are coming around to the fact that this is real people are starting to pay attention um and the the goal I believe is to slowly change people&#x27;s mind rather than have them uh you know have their entire fabric of reality change in an instant because that can drive people nuts isn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t one of the really big things that is supposed to come out of this is he supposed to drop like a five terabyte or some multi-terabyte drive with a bunch of stuff on it I hope you you mean you mean Greer Greer&#x27;s Greer&#x27;s talking about that yeah he&#x27;s going to do a huge data drop at the same time that he does this and I heard that like it was somebody else&#x27;s repository that he&#x27;s like look what I collected but he&#x27;s gonna drop it and I want to be our database thank you once he drops it though it&#x27;ll be really interesting to see if anybody jumps on it and does the same thing that The Black Vault did that we&#x27;re doing right when you can take all that data logical step right and then if we can take all three of those and get all of the UFO data in the world and just keep collecting it into one single Library that&#x27;s what I want to do I want to take all the Black Vault stuff all of our database and then all of Greer&#x27;s database in this new thing and we should make a website called like the ultimate Black Vault and make it like charge people for searches or something because it costs a lot of money to set all this AI infrastructure up with the chat GPT software and the searches and stuff so the searches will no longer be free because of the massive amount of computing power that all that takes and the size of that database and and what we&#x27;re going to have to build to to um analyze and and use that as a data body but man this is a you got the right idea man and I&#x27;ve had this idea since I saw like the Black Bolt uh go on Theory of Everything with Kurt and I reached out to Kurt and I&#x27;m like man this is like the next thing this is going to be huge this is what this needs to happen yeah well and so one of the things that that I should mention is Dave groosh has actually come to Apec in the past and he has said good things about it um and I&#x27;m excited that&#x27;s that&#x27;s all I want to say about it right now I I would just say that I I&#x27;m a friend of a friend is uh friends with him and says that that he has been to aipac in the past and he knows about it and he has said good things about it you know and again that&#x27;s that this is not I mean this isn&#x27;t the Tim show this this isn&#x27;t the the mark hour this is all of us together this is this is our community and it has been since what the 50s or or more you know another thing um we have is well going back to the 50s now going back 20 years even uh a lot of these documents were weren&#x27;t digitized everything was done with paper so the majority of the documents are all paper actually um my friend Michael schrat has the one of the largest Archives of all the documents it&#x27;s it&#x27;s way bigger than me the um the amount of collection that The Black Vault has even um Michael has warehouses full of UFO documents going back you know into the 50s and 40s um it would be an Alexandria type project to digitize all those documents but we&#x27;ve been in conversation with him and actually he&#x27;s talking with Greer right now about a a a project to digitize and scan all the all those files and documents and and put it on an archive or or some or do something with it we need to make it obviously that the amount of money that the in like time that this is going to take it won&#x27;t be free at first um we&#x27;ll have to pay for it so future Generations will have access to it maybe but uh we can we can definitely get something like that started where we could have a massive UFO database and a scientific database and just regular government document database so it would just be a massively searchable um database I think this is where the future is going with a lot of these things and it&#x27;s certainly Jeremy you were with me when I gave uh when I gave him one of those SD cards with the uh with the whole um database that we had the project Mark of our database so shrat has that and it&#x27;s probably going to be added to the uh the upload that uh Greer is to be putting out um so more people will will be have having access to this information but again the information itself is useless without application right yeah well and and I think that&#x27;s what makes research efforts like this so valuable but you know one of the things that&#x27;s exciting to me is seeing all of this moving forward and seeing this community develop and evolve I mean honestly you know it&#x27;s I I mean I I&#x27;m a little bit older than you guys but when I got started it was like digging through card catalogs in Dusty libraries looking for bits and pieces and you know like I used to take like five bucks of photocopier coins with me so that I could photocopy it and bring it home and stick it in a big box you know and and so like when you think about project merkova think about how much you know and I I think it was Sean has done a lot of that right he&#x27;s done a lot of that archiving of it um think about how much of that data is in there and this is stuff that all of us have like photocopied and then scanned and then it&#x27;s made it in there right so you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s community history and and it&#x27;s the history of people&#x27;s lives and their successes and their challenges so yeah absolutely yeah a lot a lot of good stuff on the horizon with this database and and um ai ai stuff but again yeah I don&#x27;t know how much of it&#x27;s going to help us build a actual Appliance officer in our lab but uh yeah so and I&#x27;m hoping that this whole David brush thing so or groosh whatever however you pronounce it um I&#x27;m hoping that if this is you know all true and there&#x27;s more whistleblowers involved with reverse engineering programs I hope that those people come forward and I&#x27;ve been making a lot of posts lately you know trying trying to capitalize on that or get people&#x27;s interests you know like we have the community we have the platform that it&#x27;s a perfect place for these people I know if I was one of those people I wouldn&#x27;t trust the mainstream media with my story or going out you know to the mainstream media but um the community and what we&#x27;ve the platform that we&#x27;ve set up here with APAP is absolutely perfect for disclosure and this is this is part of my vision five years ago to create something like this one available so that when the scientists and other people were all ready to come forward hopefully emboldened by you know a David Bruce type figure you know to kind of put this all out in the mainstream and say Hey you know like it&#x27;s time it&#x27;s okay where everybody&#x27;s doing it you know kind of idea um get these people to come out and blow the whistle on this stuff because the humanity deserves to know the truth and if you can get a cheat sheet on you know the technology we need to build flying saucers that would be uh super helpful so you know my I guess what I&#x27;ve seen so far is my my perception is the last person the last whistleblower that was as big as Grouch or or comparable to Grouch was Bob Lazar back in the 1980s and in lazar&#x27;s case um you know he did have an ID card and he had some credentials that he presented as being authentic that were rapidly questioned um he didn&#x27;t have people to back him up he didn&#x27;t have a lot of those things uh to my eyes Dave groosh is probably a hundred or a thousand times more credible I mean he&#x27;s actually done all the jobs that he said his resumes correct as he&#x27;s presented it he has the credentials he has the experience he&#x27;s done all those things he actually contributed to helping write The Whistleblower protection uh language that went into the law and so um whatever saying that Corso was arguably whistleblower too yeah you know um with Corso yes and and Corso was also validated as having worked there right so you know um so yeah I I think that Dave Grouch is I I think that this is a major milestone um you know even if they come forward and say oh we can&#x27;t verify this and that the other thing we have no idea what&#x27;s going on I think he&#x27;s a major Milestone and I think that he could be the focus point that just drives so much anger and resentment about the lives that it may drive change I mean I&#x27;m just hoping that whoever told him this or is the first hand witness to all this stuff will come forward um that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what we really need right now this is you know this isn&#x27;t some kind of big Psy Opera gimmick I&#x27;m always worried about that with the media and stuff but you know I the important thing is that um I guess people are starting to take this a little more serious now and look into it I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of new subscribers a lot of new followers on Twitter in the last month um especially since this this stuff started happening in the news it&#x27;s really gotten a lot of popularity it&#x27;s got people you know that&#x27;s what happened with me I was just wanted to look up everything to do with you know reverse engineering alien technology and stuff and you know when people start looking they&#x27;re looking for those that kind of information hopefully they find this Channel and we can save them a lot of time and frustration their research yeah you know one of the things that I would I would suggest to folks and this is something I&#x27;m trying to like I&#x27;m trying to take my own advice on this right is is um you know for the last like year I&#x27;ve been putting together these ideas on UAP and like one of those is okay these are Von Neumann probes they&#x27;re machine intelligence they&#x27;re this that and the other thing you know and I&#x27;ve never I I because I&#x27;m I&#x27;ve been wrong enough not to cling to these things as truth but um but one of the things that I&#x27;ve had to do lately is start to kind of let those ideas go what what he is saying is closer to the the you know the the traditional story right The Gray Man the you know little beings the forefinger six fingers whatever it is um if that&#x27;s the case a lot of the assumptions I&#x27;ve made over the last year are mistaken and I&#x27;m happy to I&#x27;m happy to change those I&#x27;m happy to drop them but I guess the thing that I would suggest to other folks is this is a really great time to just keep an open mind and just stay flexible because these stories are changing rapidly you know and I&#x27;m speaking only for myself like I don&#x27;t know what I think the truth is I&#x27;m going to wait and see what he says tomorrow and see if I can kind of start to point myself the right direction but maybe maybe we can&#x27;t maybe none of us can for a while I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using him as my compass at all because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like we have to you know we have to rely on science at the end of the day to give us the real answers and to test these hypotheses um you know when these types of things can&#x27;t give answers because it&#x27;s like oh well my you know someone I worked with said this um yeah maybe the stories aren&#x27;t changing some stories are changing but you have to always keep an open mind because even if this guy Rush turns out to be you know a total fraud it doesn&#x27;t mean that these programs don&#x27;t exist or this isn&#x27;t going on um there is a lack of evidence for this sort of thing which we need to look for but um we can&#x27;t just we can&#x27;t hang the entire fate of disclosure on the validity of this one person&#x27;s testimony it does yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a true and if I could mention really quick they&#x27;ve said speaking of Arrow people have asked about what happens with arrow Arrow has reported that even despite this Cruise story they continue getting reports they&#x27;re that that&#x27;s they haven&#x27;t just stopped they haven&#x27;t just given up they&#x27;re basically they&#x27;re doing what Congress told them to do as much as it may pain them to do it I guess and I again I can understand that&#x27;s not a hot seat that you&#x27;d probably want to be in you know but Mark you&#x27;re going to play the Las Vegas thing yeah it depends what your motive is but his motive is not to come out and say aliens are real his motive is to hide in a bunker and uh leave it to somebody else 911 body camera video showing police following up on a call from this Las Vegas family saying they saw aliens in their backyard on April 30th people in California Nevada and Utah reported seeing a green flash streaking across the sky as that officer mentioned one of his Partners even said they saw it 40 minutes later this family called 9-1-1 saying there were 10 foot tall beings with big eyes in their yard police aren&#x27;t saying anymore about this only that the department has closed the case calling it unfounded hello I&#x27;m Mark Brown get more great ABC 7 content okay yeah and we should probably keep the volume off as much as we can because I&#x27;m not splitting these up into segments and so if we get copyright strikes it&#x27;ll affect the whole thing but yeah and so uh I think Mark you probably saw this I think everybody&#x27;s seen it they actually caught the fireball on the police body cam right yeah whatever it was they caught it and then uh there&#x27;s a circle in the backyard uh indentation their backyard is pretty large actually it&#x27;s more of a they have trucks there that they&#x27;re repairing so it&#x27;s more you know in in Vegas they have lots of space um and apparently they landed there and they&#x27;re shipped or whatever and there was these 10 foot beings and uh the the kid who who was talking about is actually more like a teenager um he went started a YouTube channel and posted a video uh just to document what he saw and what he heard there was a video that shows the alien but like far in the background and um people have uh edited that to zoom in a bit but you can&#x27;t really see much it&#x27;s more more just their word and the the uh the physical evidence that&#x27;s on the ground and uh yeah what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas so I don&#x27;t know yeah well and I I just read actually I don&#x27;t know if this is true or not but I just read that that indentation somebody looked on Google Maps and it appears that that indentation has been there for a long time so so if that&#x27;s the case it&#x27;s just his word but you know that that could be mistaken I mean the the downstairs yeah yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard to tell somebody somebody on the reddits ended up analyzing um one of the body cam put it as a cell phone footages and yeah you can see uh right behind the fence as they&#x27;re walking by this fence you can see like a shadow of a head way above the fence and behind it you can see like something moving behind the fence with my fingers and the whole thing looks really weird I&#x27;m super skeptical until I saw that video and then you see this weird like shadow of a head like just appear and then kind of disappear at the same time that you seem like the legs moving underneath between the festivals there&#x27;s something going on with this whole thing and might be pixels or artifacts too man so I just I I again all we can rely on is the scientific intelligence and and uh an actionable intelligence to move forward because even if that is alien slanted in someone&#x27;s backyard until we can figure out how their craft flies and the science involved and it&#x27;s all uh so open for debunking by the mick West&#x27;s out there and to say oh no it didn&#x27;t happen I can&#x27;t believe it oh yeah well so one of the things that I should mention guys is in terms of Apec we&#x27;ve almost doubled the size of our mailing list over the last month um you know we have thousands of people registered and not everybody shows up all at once that&#x27;s just not how our community works but um but I I do want to invite everybody to Apec open mic and that&#x27;s June 24th right and we&#x27;re gonna send out links to that if you go to our website um you know you can you can view that in the calendar and I&#x27;ll do a little bit of work there to make those links easier to get to as well um so you know the open mic is the classic open disclosure the discussion that we did in the past and and so everybody is welcome so it looks like we&#x27;ve got about 15 minutes before five um we didn&#x27;t really have any timeline for this discussion do you guys want to wrap up the conference for today or or do you have anything more to talk about um I&#x27;m good yeah I think we covered the main topics of what what has happened a lot of things are happening in in terms of UFO disclosure and yeah it&#x27;s this Ivo launch is pretty big so uh we&#x27;re gonna be watching that yeah yeah we&#x27;re gonna have a lot to follow up on a lot to follow up on well can I can I get what this is my last thing here yeah go for it Jared uh David Perez&#x27;s thing like I&#x27;m I&#x27;m still my jaw has still just dropped from that that he was getting four or five Newtons with 1500 watts well and and that we got that on camera and then we get to see the inner workings of that to be able to see electromagnetic propellantless propulsion in action at such low power levels I mean that that&#x27;s like this whole conferences entire existence you know right we&#x27;re yeah I felt like we should have had a longer q a for that because that was really that was the meat and potatoes of this entire conference today that was the that was the best presentation for sure yeah I well I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m excited you know what I I love the warp reactor though I think that especially because it&#x27;s Fusion Energy generation right and that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s incredibly important for you know space space Power um you know and what Gary is doing is also incredibly valuable because he&#x27;s helping to document this this UAP Legacy so okay well guys why don&#x27;t we close things down for today then I I think Mark I think you had that there enjoy your weekend um you know I I think that is the yeah enjoy your weekend my friends Bright Days Ahead I think we could probably end this note on in this conference on that note because you know what tomorrow no matter what happens we&#x27;ll at least know more and I think the next couple of weeks are going to be anything but normal we&#x27;ll end things like that guys it has been a pleasure and an honor and I am so pleased to get aipac up and running again so hope to see everybody on June 24th yes right days ahead indeed let&#x27;s let&#x27;s uh no matter what happens tomorrow again you just remember that people like corso and others have talked about this for years and you know we&#x27;ve talked to scientists too and another list of Lords other people for about all the research that&#x27;s going on into you know meta materials causing principles photonic circuits and quantum entanglement Technologies quantum computers all that kind of stuff there&#x27;s more going on behind the scenes than is going on in front of this game it&#x27;s always just remember that and yes stay stay positive and keep the hope alive are we going to open this up to uh no I think we should probably just wrap things up for today I think close it close it up on a high note so guys it has been a wonderful day thank you everyone else and and June 10th 2023 APAC over and out okay</p>
