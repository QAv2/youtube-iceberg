            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Welcome back. The truth is out there and it might be right here in the cabinets and halls of the United States Department of Defense. A bipartisan group of lawmakers is now calling on the disclosure of all classified intelligence on unidentified aerial phenomena and whether they arrived from out of this world. &gt;&gt; They haven&#x27;t been totally transparent with with the information they do have. Um there if it&#x27;s not a UFO, then is it a weapon system? If you don&#x27;t give people a clear answer, and sometimes the clearest answer you can give is I don&#x27;t know, some will be suspicious of that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And joining us now is a longtime civil rights attorney and UFO expert, Danny Sheen. He is the founder of the new Paradigm Institute, a nonprofit lobbying Congress to declassify all these documents, and the attorney for a former Department of Defense whistleblower named Luis Alzando, who has disseminated some of this information. So, uh, Danny Sheen, thanks for being here. Welcome to Chicago. I know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you, Paris. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve been uh meeting with some lawmakers here and you&#x27;re calling on Congress to pass the bipartisan UAP Disclosure Act. If they do pass it, what were what will we find? Well, what what we&#x27;re going to find out is that the there is an element deep within the Defense Department and the operations director to the Central Intelligence Agency that has been committing perjury to Congress uh lying, denying the fact that they have recovered a nonhuman uh origin extraterrestrial spacecraft and the bodies that they&#x27;ve now DNA tested and know to be nonhuman. You&#x27;re saying because you represent some whistleblowers. You&#x27;re saying that they have uh disclosed to you that this evidence exists, these documents exist, that these phenomena have come indeed from out of this world with actual alien species &gt;&gt; that they know they&#x27;re nonhuman.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Do they describe what those species are or look like? &gt;&gt; That Well, actually, not yet to the uh to the public. Uh we&#x27;ve gotten this information out. Uh but the fact of the matter is that if we get this bill passed and we&#x27;re getting in the process this in the first week of September, we&#x27;re hoping as soon as they come back from their summer break that there the Senate is going to pass a 64page bill that mandates that all of the information that is 25 years old or more that&#x27;s basically anything before 2000 basically has to be immediately publicly released to the to the people. Okay. uh and anything else is going to be submitted to a nine-person panel to be appointed by the president.</p>
<p>And that panel is not only to go through it and decide what else to release right away, but they&#x27;re going to set up a seven-year program uh called the the UAP controlled disclosure campaign plan to release all of this information over the next seven-year period so that we can adjust our economic systems, our uh geopolitical structures, our domestic political structures to try to accommodate the fact that we now are aware of the fact that there&#x27;s an extra for terrestrial civilization surrounding us. &gt;&gt; So this law is set up to that if we do confirm this evidence that uh the American people, the world population will learn about this uh in a measured fashion. Um, does this include some of those uh space or those craft that were captured by US Air Force pilots uh that seem to descend from the atmosphere to the sea, you know, within seconds uh defying the laws of gravity and physics? &gt;&gt; 7/10 of 1 second. &gt;&gt; 710 of 1 second &gt;&gt; from 80,000 ft uh in stopping instantaneously at at the surface of the ocean. 6,000 G&#x27;s of uh of centrifugal force on them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And I think these are some of the videos that some of those pilots had caught. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the tic tac. &gt;&gt; They were on Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the Tik Tok. Uh and those were picked up by the F-18 Super Hornet gun cameras uh on them.</p>
<p>Uh they have myriad other photographs of them, up close photographs taken right out of the cockpit of some of these craft. uh and that they&#x27;ve now, as I say, recovered the craft and they&#x27;ve recovered the bodies that they&#x27;ve DNA tested and have now confirmed that they are non-human. &gt;&gt; So, this is you&#x27;re just to say the defense department is keeping this secret from everybody. They have and they have lied to the public. Um &gt;&gt; and and to Congress, &gt;&gt; I mean, could we theoretically say that those uh those craft uh were secret defense department programs from contractors testing out new technology? some some kind of them have been because they&#x27;ve been engaged in a back engineering program.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve had these craft for some time and they&#x27;ve been engaged in back engineering the technology trying to replicate some of these uh and so there appear to be some craft that have been backgineered and constructed and that are being flown by US Air Force personnel uh in a deep secret program. But the reality is that there are a major number of other craft that are not ours. They&#x27;re not Soviet or they&#x27;re not Russian and they&#x27;re not Chinese. Uh, and so they&#x27;re from somewhere else. But now that they&#x27;ve recovered the bodies, uh, and they&#x27;ve actually DNA tested them, they know that they&#x27;re non-human.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. So, all right. Say this gets confirmed. What you&#x27;re saying, what your whistleblowers have told you that worked at the Defense Department, how long do you think that they were here? &gt;&gt; Well, they&#x27;ve been here basically the a lot of the sightings started right around the dropping of the first atomic bombs uh, in 1945. That&#x27;s when they began showing up around White Sands in the Yuckah Flats and they&#x27;ve been spotted since then.</p>
<p>Uh and that they&#x27;ve been the the first crash retrieval was recovered in 1947. Okay. So, they&#x27;ve been here since then. &gt;&gt; Uh and there&#x27;s all kinds of evidence indicating they&#x27;ve been here periodically earlier because some of these star systems where they come from are six billion years older than our solar system. And if we bring in the laws of physics again, they there is no uh known way that any matter can travel faster than light.</p>
<p>And they would probably have to to get here. So is there some do we have to question all physics if if these folks &gt;&gt; or whatever they are traveled from billions and billions and billions of years away? &gt;&gt; Yeah, they we clearly had well they&#x27;ve already started to question most of the Newtonian cartisian worldview. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know what that is, but okay. It&#x27;s the normal materialist worldview that that for example, I had these conversations with Carl Sean when he was still alive. Oh, I&#x27;m sure that there are billions and billions of star systems where there&#x27;s life, but they&#x27;ll never be able to get here and we&#x27;ll never be able to get there because you can&#x27;t propel a material vehicle faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is they transport in a different way. uh they they don&#x27;t necessarily have to travel at any particular speed that they they can in fact move from one point to another uh instantaneously. &gt;&gt; Right. Well, all right. So, that&#x27;s &gt;&gt; how&#x27;s that how does that happen? &gt;&gt; Let me get back to what I know is politics and to the the department of defense has denied this.</p>
<p>Uh lawmakers will be skeptical. So, to all of those skeptics, you say what and and will this testimony come out this fall in these hearings? Well, it&#x27;s not clear that we&#x27;re we&#x27;re having a a public hearing on September 9th. Uh the House Oversight Committees uh special task force on disclosure uh is convening. Uh there are some of the witnesses that we know uh have been in the physical presence of these craft uh and have been in with their own eyes have laid eyes on the extraterrestrial beings. We know that because we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve listened to them.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re on recorded tape for that. Okay? And so if we can get them to be witnesses here on September 9th under oath, it will come out under oath. &gt;&gt; Under oath. All right. You know, hold that thought um because we uh we have to take a break here.</p>
<p>And so for you viewers that want to hear more of this, let&#x27;s well, you can go to our website. We&#x27;re going to continue this conversation on digital, but for now, some final thoughts right after the break. All right, everybody. We&#x27;re back here with more of our conversation with longtime attorney Danny Shien, UFO expert, founder of the New Paradigm Institute, uh representing some whistleblowers from the Department of Defense who have uh testified to you that they have um experienced uh unidentified aerial phenomena that the government is hiding that came from not of this world with beings that are not human. Uh so so again they haven&#x27;t described though what exactly did they describe the objects that they saw? Did they describe the propulsion or how they were uh in the different dynamics of these objects? &gt;&gt; Yes, they have.</p>
<p>They they&#x27;ve communicated it to the Senate Intelligence Committee staff under oath. Uh it&#x27;s detailed. The Senate Intelligence Committee staff know it. The members of the Senate Intelligence Committee know about it. The Senate Intelligence Committee people have been deeply involved in drafting this 64-page bill uh that they&#x27;ve now they&#x27;re getting ready to pass it again and hand it over to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>And so it&#x27;s in the House. The last time it was passed by the Senate, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Michael Turner happens to come from the Congressional District where the Wright Patterson Air Force Base is &gt;&gt; a Republican from Ohio. &gt;&gt; Yeah. 10th district where they&#x27;re harboring one of the craft uh and they&#x27;re working at back engineering it and the private aerospace corporations that are involved in it want to get a patent on it and they want to be able to be able to get money by licensing it back to the government whereas the government is the one that recovered it. &gt;&gt; Uh so we&#x27;re opposing that.</p>
<p>So basically what you&#x27;re saying, okay, the Senate passed this disclosure bill, but you&#x27;re saying uh this evidence the government is keeping it uh and and and possibly uh has tried to study the technology and replicate it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, they have done that. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re backineering it and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on right now. Uh and they&#x27;re attempting to make a weapon system out of it.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s and they&#x27;re concealing the whole thing on the grounds. Oh, this is an delicate &gt;&gt; sounds like a pretty, you know, there&#x27;s the Epstein scandal and that&#x27;s pretty bad. This sounds like a pretty big uh scandal if this is indeed what what the secrets that have been kept from the American public that the defense department has denied &gt;&gt; and and that President Trump has promised over and over again that he&#x27;ll reveal if he was elected again just like the Epstein stuff and they&#x27;re not doing it yet, you know. So what we&#x27;re saying is look, if you&#x27;re all upset about the Epstein stuff, way do you get a load of this? &gt;&gt; Uh let me ask you this though. If your your clients are getting ready to testify, are you afraid of some kind of intimidation then uh that might stop them? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve been we&#x27;ve been we drafted in fact at the request of the House, we drafted a 15-page bill an enhanced UFO whistleblower protection statute which we&#x27;re asking the House to pass as well so that we can protect the people against recrimination.</p>
<p>Uh because some of the people are still most of the people are still active people working in the United States Defense Department. uh and they&#x27;re coming forward saying that they&#x27;re all upset about the fact that other people are committing perjury. &gt;&gt; What high level officials do you think uh in the past and present have had knowledge of this? &gt;&gt; Well, uh for example, uh Jay Stratton has knowledge of it. He was the head of the United States Pentagon advanced weapons uh special access program. He knows all about it.</p>
<p>Uh and uh &gt;&gt; and is he going to testify? Well, we&#x27;re trying to get him to testify, you know, and uh what he&#x27;s saying is, well, there&#x27;s not adequate protections in place that they could retaliate against him. He could never get another promotion. He, you know, they may interfere in trying to withhold his his uh pension, you know, that they can do all kinds of things which the present law doesn&#x27;t adequately protect them against. &gt;&gt; So, this is what you&#x27;re trying to get into the bill here to that&#x27;s exactly to get people comfort comfortable come forward. Let&#x27;s ask the more esoteric question.</p>
<p>Um, if this does come out, we see the proof of it. Um, is humanity ready to handle this? &gt;&gt; Well, that, uh, I mean, the fact is you could, you can ask an average fifth fifth grader in the country, what do you think a UFO looks like? And they&#x27;ll draw you one. And I say, what do you think an ET person looks like? And they&#x27;ll draw you one. So, there&#x27;s a process that&#x27;s under been underway for some time of of leaking out information. So people are the the the significant majority of people in the country believe that UFOs are real.</p>
<p>Uh and a substantial percentage of them believe that they&#x27;re extraterrestrial. So there&#x27;s already a certain kind of consciousness in the American people about this. The problem is is that they&#x27;ve been being lied to over and over again by the government by not the whole government but by this secret element deep inside the department. &gt;&gt; But this raises the question of of security. I mean, if if if that is proven, uh, wouldn&#x27;t there be a we&#x27;ve all seen the movies, a panic? Uh, uh, what if what what do they want to do with us? What if what if what if what if we can&#x27;t trust whatever we find? &gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s a the the the evidence is very very minimal that there&#x27;d be any kind of widespread panic on the part of anybody.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, because there the information has been around for so long. We&#x27;ve had people testifying about some of these programs already. It&#x27;s been on the front page of the New York Times, these videos that people have now. So, that that&#x27;s not a a realistic fear right now. The the challenge is how do we adjust our economic structures? How do we how do we uh reorganize our geopolitical structures on our planet to deal with with these people? Uh how do we deal how do we deal with the impact on our knowledge of science? H how do we I mean they&#x27;re still they&#x27;re still teaching Newtonian cartisian materialist worldview at the university level in in physics classes.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s a lot of changes that need to get made. The new paradigm institute is a 501c3 public interest organization that is demanding not only that the government begin programs to try to figure out how to adjust all of these things, but we&#x27;re going forward and taking information from experts on how to do it ourselves. to play to play devil&#x27;s advocate. You you will have physicists uh scientists out there saying um that the Newtonian cart whatever it is that you describe to me holds up and that this is not possible and that none none of this is true and that no one could travel here faster than light and and uh so on and so on and so on. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What about those skeptics and these will be scientists at laboratories at the Argon and Fermy that will say this. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not going to last long. I can tell you, you know, on once once you have the evidence out on the table, uh, and the videotape showing them doing these things, uh, they&#x27;re going to they right now they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve tracked on radar these moving in the atmosphere from over 80,000 ft in outer space down to the surface. I said, in 7/10 of 1 second. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s no America.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no worldly thing that can do that. &gt;&gt; There there&#x27;s no physics that&#x27;ll do that. There&#x27;s nothing that can stop like that on a dime like that and not completely disintegrate uh pursuant to the present operative laws of physics. So they can see it right with their own eyes that it&#x27;s happening. Uh you know I I talked to General Bthoon who was the first first full general in the United States Air Force that was commissioned and he was on a craft with with scientists and in a big UFO came right up in front of them just like that.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve talked to him in detail about it and all the scientists were off on one side of the plane looking at this thing out the window and uh he came back into the cockpit or into the passenger side and there was one scientist standing with his back turned to the window and his arms fold and he said he said are you okay and he said yes I&#x27;m fine and and and General Bthoon said did you see that out there he said I&#x27;m a scientist I don&#x27;t believe in those things I&#x27;m not looking &gt;&gt; wow &gt;&gt; okay and so that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking at uh that there are people that are just so insistent that it can&#x27;t be true based on anything we&#x27;ve been told already. And they are going to be really upset, that they&#x27;ve been being lied to, that this information has been being concealed from them that we&#x27;ve had now for decades. Uh, and that they&#x27;re just staying in the back rooms trying to figure out how to build a delivery system that can deliver a hydrogen bomb from our from US soil into Russia or China in two minutes, you know. and then and they&#x27;re hiding it from us, saying, &quot;Oh, if you try to probe into this, you&#x27;re looking at one of our most sensitive weapon systems.&quot; &gt;&gt; So, the two prongs of this are the uh bombshell uh discovery that could be made about extraterrestrial life forms and b the use from the US government to try and take the technology to build weapons of war with it. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And those two those are two big things to lie about. &gt;&gt; Those are two big things to &gt;&gt; I mean, this would be the scandal of the century. I&#x27;m just saying &gt;&gt; more than the century as it turns out. I mean to disco to discover that there&#x27;s an extraterrestrial civilization of nonhuman beings and they&#x27;re coming and going from our planet and there are elements inside the defense department and intelligence agencies that have known this. &gt;&gt; Why? How about other governments? &gt;&gt; Chinese government.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The Chinese the Chinese government know this and so do the the Russians. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh I hope these hearings happen. Danny Sheen. &gt;&gt; Oh, they will happen.</p>
<p>Well, I hope I hope these whistleblowers do testify to all these things. And uh uh this Danny Sheen from the New Paradigm Institute. Um sure to get some feedback and uh we do appreciate you being here talking with us. Best of luck. Best of luck on all this.</p>
<p>We will keep we&#x27;ll keep following this. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Paris. You bet.</p>
