            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>reportedly an object that is not in this country that is so large it cannot be moved uh that they&#x27;ve built an entire building around it and that&#x27;s one of the locations that I&#x27; I&#x27;m requesting to to get to. It&#x27;s going to be very it&#x27;s going to involve a lot to get to make that happen but that may be the uh final destination. So that is the claim and it was made by a Republican member of Congress that there is reportedly this object in another country that&#x27;s so big it can&#x27;t be moved and a massive structure has been built around it to hide its location. But several questions remain. What is this? When did it get here? And why is it being kept a secret? Our next guests are both trying to get those answers.</p>
<p>Missouri Congressman Eric Berles, who sits on the Congressional Oversight Committee investigating UAPs and is trying to get permission to visit this alleged site, is with us alongside the founder of the Disclosure Project, Dr. Steven Greer. It&#x27;s great to have you both here. Congressman, what do we know about what this thing really is? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know that I have any hard evidence of what it really is. I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve had al allegations from both inside and outside of the federal government that there is this object that is that exists in another country.</p>
<p>Um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not going to mention the country because I have I&#x27;ve heard of it inside of a closed setting and and so and I want to protect my classification level, but um others may say that. I can tell you that it&#x27;s not in the facility that&#x27;s been widely reported in the news. Um um so but but I have been receiving reports both inside and outside of people that have worked in the federal government that there is the potential that this exists. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um Dr.</p>
<p>Greer, you have said publicly that this is outside Soul, South Korea. Is that accurate? &gt;&gt; One of them, now remember, I&#x27;ve debriefed almost 800 whistleblowers who&#x27;ve had direct involvement with this. One of them was with the Pentagon for about eight years as a very senior investigator and had baseline clearance across 18 uh black project unagnowledged special access projects. He specifically knew of the one in the mountains outside Soul uh South Korea. It was so huge they had to build a structure around it and he was read into this in between 2002 and 2010.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Um so it had been there for some time now. I also know there are others that have been brought down in other locations and if they&#x27;re over a certain size they&#x27;re very very hard to move. Imagine if they&#x27;re bigger than a football field and you&#x27;re not going to put that on a semi. So it becomes logistically impossible to move it.</p>
<p>Uh and then in the United States we know where there are some others such as near Fort Sil Oklahoma. There&#x27;s a smaller one. They had they built a skiff a facility around that one. We have its location. So, um I know that the congressman can speak, you know, uh to what he&#x27;s limited, but but because I&#x27;m a a private citizen, I can discuss these.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Congressman, are you referring to the location in South Korea? &gt;&gt; Um I can&#x27;t be specific to that location. Um but it but there are wide reports. What I can say is that I that I&#x27;ve seen I&#x27;ve seen articles that have pointed to a specific building and and from what I&#x27;ve been told that is not the facility. &gt;&gt; Wait, can you explain why we can&#x27;t? You&#x27;re trying to get permission, I assume, from our government and another government or somebody with another country to go visit whatever this thing is. Maybe it&#x27;s a spaceship, maybe it&#x27;s nothing.</p>
<p>Why can&#x27;t we talk about where it is? I don&#x27;t get that. again because because of the information was gathered inside of a classified setting on my behalf. What I can tell you is I have been explo trying to get access to even locations that reportedly have craft that that are being reverse engineered that are even close to Washington DC and having I&#x27;m having a difficult time getting access to even those facilities that are just within a few miles from from my office in Washington DC. So to try to attempt to go to another country and get permission for at that level is is going to be somewhat insurmountable, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m not going to continue to try. &gt;&gt; It it seems like the White House is at least on some level behind disclosure.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll see where it goes um throughout the next three years. Why is there so much resistance to your request, Congressman? &gt;&gt; A lot of it is turf. You have all of the different agencies that protect their their information and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s guarded like it&#x27;s some kind of commodity. You have committees that protect the their turf as well. So if you&#x27;re not on the right committee um you then oftentimes you&#x27;re turned down and and um sometimes there&#x27;s there&#x27;s multiple committees that have jurisdiction over a topic and they they love turning each other down.</p>
<p>So the the very nature and the difficulty of the red tape system within within um the bureaucracy of Congress is is something that&#x27;s very difficult to navigate. &gt;&gt; Dr. Greer, why can&#x27;t this thing be moved? We can move mountains as a society. Why can&#x27;t we move this thing? &gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s it was my understanding it was way too large to move. And remember, you just any idea how large? &gt;&gt; Hundreds of feet.</p>
<p>And some of them have been in the thousands of feet across. And are we talking about a spaceship? &gt;&gt; Yes, definitely. Um, in this case, the one I&#x27;m referring to, and there are some others. And the other problem is you can&#x27;t just chop them up because I know people who have been on crash retrieval teams with an acetylene torch, a high-powered laser, a diamond tip saw. You cannot cut through that material.</p>
<p>It is so specialized and it&#x27;s so hard. &gt;&gt; How long has it been here, Dr. Greer? Sorry to cut you off. How long has it been here? Do we have any idea? &gt;&gt; He didn&#x27;t know that. this particular whistleblower.</p>
<p>So, I don&#x27;t know it. He indicated it had been there for quite some time. &gt;&gt; Congressman, if you are able to visit this space ship, what do you do with that information when you get back? Well, look, if if I come under any any hard evidence, whether it&#x27;s physical or um video evidence that is absolutely definitive, you know, while I&#x27;m going to do what I can to protect our national security and our and our nation&#x27;s interest, I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this in this universe. That is something that no government has the right to withhold from its people. &gt;&gt; I think a lot of people agree with that.</p>
<p>Um, and then this weekend, Barack Obama out of nowhere said this. Take a look. &gt;&gt; Are aliens real? &gt;&gt; Uh, they&#x27;re real, but I haven&#x27;t seen them. And and and uh they&#x27;re not being kept in uh what is it? &gt;&gt; Area 51. &gt;&gt; Area 51.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no underground uh facility. Unless there&#x27;s this enormous conspiracy and they they hid it from the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; Dr. Greer, did you believe him? Well, this is the briefing document that was given to him in 2009. It was actually given to John Podesta, who was his senior adviser at the time and then later ran Hillary&#x27;s campaign.</p>
<p>And uh it had great detail in it. Now, how much of it got to him directly? I never met with Mr. Obama directly. He did indicate that he knew there was something there, but he was never read into it. Meaning, this is what I discovered when I briefed the first president, CI director I briefed.</p>
<p>and which was Bill Clinton in 1993. &gt;&gt; They were desperate to find information on this and they were blocked. I think the public and the media need to acknowledge that there are some criminal elements to the secrecy that&#x27;s gone on for at least since the late 1950s. And so I think Mr. Obama never was fully read into it and that&#x27;s why he says I didn&#x27;t see anything.</p>
<p>Right. &gt;&gt; But was he given information? Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um Dr. Steven Greer, Congressman Eric Burlson, appreciate you being with us.</p>
<p>Congressman, um we appreciate you coming on and we appreciate the fact that you&#x27;re trying to do this. Um please keep us posted. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you.</p>
