            <p>ke towns in brown used a high voltage and electromagnetic field to create a lift effect this allowed an object to move at high speeds free of the force of gravity Brown made a flying saucer as with many other promising inventions developed during the Cold War years the national secrecy act prevented scientists like tet towns and Brown from commercializing or even publicizing any technology which could potentially be interpreted as having a military application now anti-gravity or anti gravitic technology was popular in the 1950s the United States and Canadian governments were both working on anti-g gravitic technology they farmed this workout to well-known aerospace companies like locky Martin conve Bell and leer the research was actually out in the open and created a buzz people were excited about the new G engines and how this technology would revolutionize traveling they talked about how everyone could have a flying car airplanes wouldn&#x27;t need any fuel to fly this is what</p>
