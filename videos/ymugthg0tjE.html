            <p>does the inertia change in proportion to changes in Mass the reason that I wrote that down was really in relation to um Fran deo&#x27;s research and he believes that these aren&#x27;t equal that they just tend to appear equal to us in our frame of reference well according to our understanding and our experience U we did not make any difference between uh gravitational and inertial mass so we think that they are equal also in case uh with the uh impulses the impulses are too short in time to make uh to notice any difference and we didn&#x27;t make any special experiments just uh to distinguish uh gravitational and inertial Ms [Music]</p>
