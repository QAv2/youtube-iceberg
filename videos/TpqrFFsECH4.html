            <p>you welcome to evolving ideas i&#x27;m elaine smitha we have in studio with me today lieutenant colonel thomas e bearden who is a retired military i need to say that um and he is president of the american association of distinguished scientists and nuclear engineer he&#x27;s also president and ceo of seatac inc welcome doctor not this is not doctor it&#x27;s not doctor it&#x27;s lieutenant colonel bearden thank you so much for coming thank you elaine it&#x27;s a pleasure to be here well uh free energy is what we&#x27;re going to be talking about you come with a vast knowledge in that realm and i&#x27;m eager to bring your knowledge to my viewers so we need to start off with what is free energy well it&#x27;s really simple we&#x27;re talking about let me give you a comparison it&#x27;s easier with a comparison suppose you wanted to power a meal and you had a nice river with a nice fault in it sitting out there beside the mill it would be nice if you would take a gate and make it where it would swing out into the river and divert some of the water on the high part bring that down in the ditch across the wheel a water wheel attached to the and the river wouldn&#x27;t miss a little bit of water and it would furnish you some power to power your meal and your meal would run and it would grind the corn and grind the other stuff that meals do and meanwhile you&#x27;d be taking the power directly from nature you wouldn&#x27;t be burning any hydrocarbon fuels you wouldn&#x27;t be polluting the biosphere or any of those things it turns out that in electromagnetics there are such rivers of energy many many rivers of energy very few of which we&#x27;re trying to actually tap in the fashion we would tap the river to power the meal so the free energy the term free energy loosely means we&#x27;re trying to go after the energy flow that&#x27;s already in nature or that we can make occur in nature very easily and then we wish to extract a little bit of this energy flow and power our devices our circuits our motors our heaters to heat our homes and hopefully the motors to run our cars and get rid of the pollution of the planet so basically we&#x27;re trying to tap energy flows that are already there and so this is um also known not only as free energy but alternative energy or alternate energies and um but it&#x27;s not really free is it it&#x27;s not free in that you have to make the water wheel when you make the meal and you have to dig the ditch right so it&#x27;s going to cost you a little bit but then we use the term over unity yeah a little bit and you get out lots so what we&#x27;re really talking about is that for a very small expenditure of work that we have to do energy we have to furnish to do some work what we hope to do is get back much more energy to do much more work for us very cleanly and so that we call over unity we put in a little bit we get a lot back now this is not a new concept this has been going on for a long time hasn&#x27;t of course you know everybody that ever put a sail on a sailboat is using a free energy system he&#x27;s tapping the energy in the wind everyone that we&#x27;ve had water mills for you know centuries we&#x27;ve had windmills uh look at holland for example the windmill that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s right uh we&#x27;re playing with other alternative forms where we&#x27;re trying to tap the wind and the ocean and those have not proven too successful the most successful today we&#x27;ve had of the conventional alternative over unity systems would be your hydroelectric power where you actually dam rivers and tap the energy flowing in the stream now nikola tesla was involved with this wasn&#x27;t he yes tesla once in his later life he built a free energy device which he used to power an automobile one of the old arrow pierce arrow cars his nephew who rode in the car with him on a test drive is still alive so he remembers the drive very well but he did actually power an automobile with energy taken directly from empty space from the vacuum by the way today i&#x27;m happy to report that in the last two years the u.s patent office has officially recognized the vacuum as a source of energy it&#x27;s been known for 50 years in physics but only in the last two years has the u.s patent office recognized it officially as a source of energy and they have actually issued some patents now for extracting energy from the vacuum really okay i think that would lead us to the next step is what&#x27;s a vacuum how is it used and the misunderstandings about force and force-free energy well conventionally we&#x27;re taught that the empty space is just inert like this it&#x27;s just an emptiness sitting there with nothing going on well we know today and we&#x27;ve known for many many years you know five decades we&#x27;ve really known experimentally as well that that&#x27;s not true in in fact it&#x27;s filled with enormous energy but the energy is not organized it&#x27;s going every which way but it is enormous energy and in fact it is so much energy there is so much energy in space empty space the vacuum that is mind-boggling for example wheeler made a calculation showing that uh one cubic centimeter which is about the size of the tip of your little finger has enough energy in it that if you were to condense it into mass you would have more mass than is in the observable universe seen by the largest telescope so there&#x27;s no shortage of energy no the problem is in getting the energy out and collecting it and using it i know when i did an interview with john hutchison a few years ago he said there&#x27;s said we have enough energy right in this much space he said to run the universe you know that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s all compressed it&#x27;s right here and and he&#x27;s definitely working with energetic forces and what he&#x27;s doing yes he is and we used a little clip from something that you had said about him on that show um and i uh so anyway so explain this vacuum because i&#x27;ve seen you you have some charts on that that demonstrate that but can you verbally explain that there are two ways of looking at energetic processes one is to look at them with vibrations and waves and the other is to look at them with particles that are moving one we would call a flux a lot of particles moving in different directions and another we would call waves we would call vibrations excuse me so the if we look with the particle view the vacuum then would be a vast series of incredibly dense little particles forming and unforming all the time i&#x27;m gonna wash out on you here&#x27;s to have some water anyway we have what we call virtual particle it only appears out of nothing disappears back into nothing very rapidly you can&#x27;t grab one individually but lots of them if they get in line and hit something they make the forces of nature and that&#x27;s the particle view so in that view the vacuum is an incredibly in intense flux of virtual particles bombarding everything in the world but each little particle hits so lightly you don&#x27;t know it but if they line up you can get any amount of force or power you wish to from the vacuum flux if we take the wave view we find that from everything that moves in the universe it puts out electromagnetic waves from all over the universe and at each and every little region of space there is an incredible number of waves passing through from all particles in the universe and the total interference of all of these waves is extremely dynamic incredible numbers of them and so you have all this interferometry going all the time and that&#x27;s called the zero point energy of the vacuum you can never get anything less than that energetic from a wave viewpoint oh i&#x27;m glad to hear you mention the zero point because i think a lot of people are confused about what that means it means that if i have some process that i&#x27;ve built on top of that when i stop everything that i&#x27;m doing on top of all of these uh boiling cauldron that is the actual empty space the zero point energy when i get through with what i do and reach the zero there we still have all this other energy boiling around there is a bit of energy in the actual fabric of space that you cannot get below that now you you talk a lot about phase conjugation and uh does that that relates to the organization of these in the um well phase conjugation is a process which was known theoretically for some time but we really only got going in it uh very well in about 1972 and really not very much then until the latter 70s specifically after the russians showed the work to lawrence livermore laboratory in 1972. face conjugation is a very strange way that we can make in response to another wave but it has a memory so to speak the phase conjugate wave will back up exactly like a crawfish along the trail the path through space the other wave took no matter how tortuous so it&#x27;s going this way and then it has the memory and it comes back we put we have an object we call a mirror that&#x27;s going to do the reflection don&#x27;t think about shiny it&#x27;s not shiny it&#x27;s just non-linear material and in comes a wave and what is going to happen is another wave is going to be produced that everywhere in space this other wave occupied this wave will precisely superpose back along this all along the path it will go backwards and we that is a time reverse wave we can&#x27;t see time so we see it as if it were going backwards in space but it is a time reverse wave it&#x27;s moving backwards in its time now does that have something to do with what we were earlier talking about with the vacuum yes it does because in the vacuum you&#x27;re getting everything you&#x27;re getting everything you could possibly get and then some the interesting thing if you look at what&#x27;s called ghost forms momentarily like watching your tv when it&#x27;s bubbling away momentarily you can see a little image or a little outline as if the bubbles got together just right yes well the vacuum does the same thing so momentarily there is uh the formation for example of a gold atom or the formation of something looks very like tom bearden you know they don&#x27;t need much of that but anything you wish to name there&#x27;s a momentary shadowy formation of the particles and everything to make that it&#x27;s not very much probability but it is not zero and when you have so many actions going on i like to use the term the density of reality in that sense almost anything you can think of is real but we&#x27;re talking about how dense is it normally it&#x27;s so thin that it is of no consequence but we know from paul dirac that if you add energy to one of those forms anything that&#x27;s sitting there hidden in the vacuum if you add energy into that form you can in fact materialize it you can lift electrons for example right out of the direct sea and you have a real electron borne out of so-called nothingness really but you had to add energy to do that so what kind of energy would we use well if we wanted to form things like that we&#x27;re doing it the other way around in the energy processes we&#x27;re talking about what we wish to do is we wish the vacuum to furnish the energy exactly and we want to trick it into furnishing it in some form or direction that we can use so our problem is to make it directional and make it have form and substance so that we can use it and here we&#x27;re very fortunate we come to one of the great contradictions of electromagnetics and electromagnetics as taught from the universities they really teach that all the charges of the universe are perpetual motion machines they don&#x27;t use the term but they teach it that way because each charge pours out energy and according to them it makes the energy right out of nothing which violates the master conservation of energy law you can&#x27;t do that nature doesn&#x27;t do that but what happens they say in classical electrodynamics is that it pours out all the energy that makes the fields and potentials from it that reach to infinity in each direction all across the universe and it keeps on doing that day after day year after year month after month uh century after century which makes it perpetually so if you want a source of energy yes classical electrodynamics already says that every charge in the universe makes energy out of nothing and pours it out for you freely forever quantum mechanics and particle physics of course have corrected that we&#x27;ve known the correction for 40 years both experimentally and theoretically what really happens is the particle is absorbing all these particles little tiny particle bombardments from empty space the flux of space re-radiating back some of that but some of it it acts like more or less like don&#x27;t press the analogy too far like an old spinning wheel it forms a big enough form that when that form comes off the particle and is radiated away it will grab any other particle and generate a force and translate it so it turns some of the energy from this virtual state and knits it together and makes it in hole-sized clumps that are now real energy and will move real systems really every charge does that every charge does that now is there a way to rephrase what you&#x27;ve just said so that say a teenager could really understand could you go through that if i have a gate in the river and the gate remains closed all the particles of water that strike the gate reflect back into the river but if i open the gate some of the particles strike the bank and then some of them strike where the gate was and they go on through and they get gated out in the ditch that&#x27;s going to run the water wheel so the charge itself because of its spin and a couple other factors actually does some gating it gets the energy from one form into another changes the form of it into something we can use and so every charge in the universe is already a little free energy system all we have to do is learn how to use them correctly you&#x27;ve said that a lot of the information in physics and and uh so forth has that they are teaching is obsolete and in and not accurate electrodynamics has many inaccuracies i have one slide with 32 major errors in classical electrodynamics and that&#x27;s nothing new it&#x27;s quite well known in foundations physics i&#x27;ve added possibly a few myself but most of them i collected from other scientists who worked in the area for many years and listed the arrows one of the things i just mentioned it assumes the creation of energy out of nothing which is false we know that it takes it from the vacuum so what this tells us is we do not have to go discover how to tap the vacuum for energy and extract the energy the little charges already do it we have the magic thing tapping the energy and giving it to us the magic gate in the river we have to learn how to apply it correctly which we do not do another thing they did is maxwell&#x27;s equations have always at the very beginning included systems which put out more energy than you have to put in because they allow for this extraction and putting out of energy excess energy that was an embarrassment because that&#x27;s called asymmetric and scientists love symmetry it makes equations very hard to solve so they did what they call re-gauge the equations what they did they changed the equations to where they didn&#x27;t show that they excluded that type of system that does that they only kept those systems which don&#x27;t do that which is a small subset of maxwell&#x27;s systems and the set type of systems that they kept are have been forced into local equilibrium in other words they assume the energy has changed freely twice in the system two free forces have occurred that would do work for you except they only chose the ones that are equal and opposite so they fight one another to draw so they chose to introduce totally ad hoc and totally arbitrarily additional stress in the system right out of nowhere and to change the energy system twice right out of nowhere and convert it to a system which cannot put out more energy than you put into it and thereby they discarded far more systems than they kept and teach in school but it made the equations easy to solve and so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re using yeah so we&#x27;re still recycling the ignorance aren&#x27;t we well that was done by lorentz uh well over a hundred years ago and what&#x27;s happened is it&#x27;s not diabolical it got locked in when there were probably only three dozen electro dynamicists in the whole world and everybody just kept putting it in the textbooks and teaching it and most professors these days don&#x27;t really realize what they&#x27;re doing when they re-gauge the equations although you can go to jackson classical electrodynamics he shows exactly how they do it but nobody ever tells you what&#x27;s happening to the system when you do that they say it&#x27;s the same system it is not now there was a thing about uh james clerk maxwell and heavyside do you want to expect well what we&#x27;re calling heavy uh maxwell&#x27;s equations aren&#x27;t maxwell&#x27;s equations anyway maxwell&#x27;s equations are 20 quaternion and quaternion-like equations in 20 unknowns you can do all sorts of things in that kind of electrodynamics his original electrodynamics you can&#x27;t do and what we teach today is maxwell&#x27;s equations uh oliver heavyside took a look at that maxwell&#x27;s book was published in 1873 the definitive paper was during the american civil war in 1864. and quite old we&#x27;re talking something 100 and something years old right exactly heavyside took a look at that and he said my goodness uh you know the electricians we have today that&#x27;s what they called an electrical engineer and they really were about like a house electrician to wire your house up they were not at all the collegiate electrodynamicists you expect to find today and heavyside my goodness these fellows will never learn that kind of mathematics it&#x27;s far too complex so we&#x27;ve got to have a simplification so he is the major leading figure who cut the equations down to basically four equations and four unknowns now at one time i rescinded that i don&#x27;t resist it anymore i think he did the right thing and the reason was if he had not done that to give them something they could get a hold of get in their minds understand start to build telegraph lines was their big problem for example uh understand how signals went down a wire and so forth if he had not done that he was quite correct they would have been another 70 years getting off of square one really so i i admire him for doing it i think he did the right thing but what i don&#x27;t admire is the fact that they continue to teach those equations and without telling all the young students that those are highly modified adapted equations and they are a tiny subset of the real theory now that having been said there are today after sleeping for a hundred years electrodynamics is finally beginning to wake up again there are now some younger fellows real mathematical techniques and ability and great scientific ability who are chewing into electrodynamics and turning it back towards the higher algebras like maxwell used even going to clifford algebra they&#x27;re giving us waves that travel faster than the speed of light to travel slower than the speed of light that have all kinds of energy in the way of up to infinite energy so electrodynamics is beginning to explode you can go on the internet and go to the los alamos national laboratory site download papers by rodrika sanlu and you will find this exploding electrodynamics now you said something about oh gosh i should have written it down but um you said something about uh the the speed of light now people i think the general populist sort of thinks that the speed of light is the maximum degree of speed that there is but that&#x27;s not true that&#x27;s not true the broiler waves for example since their very inception have always traveled faster than speed light slowest they can travel as a speed of light [Music] many other things like in the what&#x27;s called the coulomb gauge the standard old garden variety potential common voltage would travel faster than the speed of light so the question is how to get it in a coulomb gauge but these are quite well known they&#x27;re just not used for example there&#x27;s a thing called quantum tunneling and nymphs for example and his colleagues have transmitted down a waveguide through a barrier at 4.7 times the speed of light mozart&#x27;s 40th symphony and thank you very kindly you can identify the music the music is nice it is mozart&#x27;s 40th symphony so this answers the question for all time you can&#x27;t transmit uh intelligent information of course you can of course you can other scientists have done it not quite so fast but faster in the speed of light so now there&#x27;s a replicated experiments in the hard literature showing that yes you can transmit signals faster than the speed of light by the way speed of light is a very simple thing it really represents in relativity a rotation at 90 degrees that&#x27;s all it represents and if you say we can&#x27;t go faster in the speed of light really all you&#x27;re saying is we can&#x27;t rotate past 90 degrees well if you use only four dimensions so you only got one 90 degree angle that&#x27;s as far as you go there aren&#x27;t any other to turn to but if you add a few more dimensions you can turn and turn and turn forever and there&#x27;s no limit to the speed interesting and when you&#x27;re talking about other dimensions that means the dimension is uh mathematically it&#x27;s just a degree of freedom where something can change okay and it&#x27;s not really that fundamental it happens that in the world we normally observe because of the processes we use to observe and detect in the physical processes we really only detect in three dimensions we don&#x27;t even detect time look at a clock you don&#x27;t see time you see the spatial positioning of the hands that&#x27;s right and after that changes you infer by the change the spatial change you infer the time that lapsed you never measured the time directly at all there is no such thing as a true clock in the entire universe so how do they measure time they measure it by inferring it very precisely from the spatial measurements it&#x27;s like an intuitive thing it doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t measure it very precisely you can but you measure it from spatial processes and you infer it you do not detect it directly that really uh you know we&#x27;re talking about the electromagnetic fields that spectrum the visible light spectrum is a very narrow band yes it&#x27;s just one little actually visible light is very interesting because if you take a harmonic interval that means twice the frequency the infrared at one frequency if you freeze there and you go back up to the ultraviolet far after violet you have the exact double frequency twice that frequency that&#x27;s called a harmonic or a harmonic interval so the so-called visible spectrum really feels is what&#x27;s in between that interval aha and it&#x27;s just one little interval in a vast number of these harmonic intervals both below that and above it so it&#x27;s just one little speck of reality but a very useful spec because our eyes use that and we have all kinds of reactions with matter in that and everything but light also goes down to where you can&#x27;t see it we can build special instruments and pick up the low infrared or the high ultraviolet and so forth it goes on higher than that and gives us gamma radiation and things like that goes lower and we can even go down the sound type light radiation at any frequency you wish in theory it doesn&#x27;t have much of a limit in frequency either on the low end or the high end for practical purposes with what you can do with your equipment you can build of course uh you don&#x27;t get too far beyond the uh upper part of the light spectrum you can get on off into gamma radiation and some other radiation that&#x27;s about as far as you go with equipment that you build now how does hyperdimensional physics work with free energy well the hyper dimensions a set of dimensions is a way to model something it&#x27;s a model or a description of processes basically is what you&#x27;re talking about and you make a lot of assumptions well first you take an algebra and you take a set of coordinates and all of this stuff and you frame a set of operations like setting up a chess board and setting up the operations that are going to be allowed and then what you do you find a set of physical phenomena and you try to put correspondences between these phenomena and this chess board and you come up with a very special chess game which is a mathematical model of the processes you&#x27;re studying it&#x27;s never perfect but if you get a good enough description then this math model allows you to make predictions you can design equipment from that and with just a little bit of tailoring the equipment will work in the area that you&#x27;re studying so the whole progress of science is based on producing accurate models accurate enough to use and engineer and predict phenomena which is going to happen we like to be able to predict when a comet&#x27;s going to come around again then this kind of things and because lots and lots of scientists have built these models on a special kind of chess board that they set up the model does make uh you know a legitimate prediction and we can turn our telescopes and lo and behold here comes the comet mm-hmm now when you&#x27;re talking about um free energy you have made the statement that we&#x27;re killing our source yes can you explain as we just explained uh the charges themselves once normally the charges occur in equal and opposite you know you&#x27;ve got about as many positive charges as you have negative charges all mixed together and so the net result you&#x27;re going to get out of that is nothing it&#x27;s not going to give you any free energy but if you separate the charges you move the positive charges over to one end you move the negative charges over to the other end you have what&#x27;s called a dipole two poles two two different charges at each end that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about well now the charges at this end are producing energy and the charge is this end of producing energy so now i&#x27;ve got a very useful energy producing critter and it sits there from now until the end of time as long as it stays apart in that fashion and according to even standard electrodynamics it pours out energy they say it creates out of nothing we know from particle physics it takes it from the vacuum that having been said suppose i have a battery and i&#x27;m powering a a system that&#x27;s connected to it a couple of wires leads out to some resistors and a motor or two and a lighter two and a fan the two and this kind of thing it turns out the battery doesn&#x27;t furnish any energy to the circuit certainly doesn&#x27;t furnish any power you can&#x27;t furnish power to a circuit what the power is created in the particular component that scatters the energy so the whole business that electrical engineers use about furnishing power is oxymoron it contradicts itself so what we have is the dipole as long as it stays separated will pour the energy down the circuit now strangely enough uh we know that the energy fields all the circuit all space around that wire out to an infinite radius in all directions so actually the dipoles extract enormous energy from the vacuum and pour out enormous energy but the circuit doesn&#x27;t catch all that the little surface charges in the wires going down to the circuit from the poles of the battery gets struck by the little bitty sheath of flow that strikes right there on the surface and gets intercepted and diverged into the wire to power the electrons all the rest of it misses just roars off into space and is never collected never used uh a nominal circuit a little simple thing a little simple battery power and a little simple flashlight light or something produces about 10 to the 13th times as much energy as the circuit actually intercepts and collects and uses so in the first place we are terribly terribly terribly inefficient at collecting and using energy which is where we should be putting our effort because there are ways to increase that it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way and some of them are even known in the literature but nobody everybody&#x27;s using the single pass stuff where you only collect a little of it and says therefore you can&#x27;t power very much and you got to keep doing a lot of work now what does the battery do doesn&#x27;t furnish anything to the circuit because the way we build it the top part of this circuit has greater flux on it to push the electrons and so the electrons get forced down with extra potential on them and they scatter this energy in the resistor that would be heat the resistor is producing heat to work for us maybe we&#x27;ve got a heater in the corner but when it gets down to the bottom line it doesn&#x27;t have any excess energy left on the electrons they&#x27;re just so to speak for our purposes dead rocks waiting to be pushed just so much inert things that have got to be forced against resistance back up through the dipole so what do we do we build a closed circuit we pump all the spin electrons back up through the dipole and knock those charges every which way so we destroy the separation of charges that was furnishing all the free energy from the vacuum we just knock them apart uh-huh then the battery has to use chemical energy it has through its chemistry it has to again furnish separated charges do some work to force the charges back apart so we restore the pump that we open the gate in the river again so the water will flow freely and then we knock it apart again it furnishes some more energy when it runs out of chemical energy we had to stop and recharge the battery but the system was always a free energy system okay so say i&#x27;ve got a battery and i&#x27;ve got i&#x27;ve got connections hooked up to what you would call the dipoles is that correct that&#x27;s right i got a positive and a negative charge and i&#x27;ve got this hooked up say to the fan all right now how where in this circuitry am i collecting the energy you&#x27;re collecting it right there in that separation of charges where you&#x27;ve got a whole bunch of positive charges on one end okay where where my connection is on the positive right right at that connection right at that connection and right at the other connection on the bottom though the terminal right there which has all these positive charges collected in it is going to be pouring out energy that it takes right out of the vacuum so how would we contain the energy at those collector points in order to have that constantly recycling so the battery doesn&#x27;t well what we have to do with the basic requirement is we must not have to take half the energy half of it went to the resistor if there were no other lawsuits i need you to put this in real simple terms okay because those of us who don&#x27;t have a technical understanding of um you know of all of this we need to to really simply put here this isn&#x27;t simple the first requirement is i must not kick apart the dipole okay that means i must not i must do one of two things either i must not ram the spin electrons back up through the dipole the wrong way it&#x27;s trying to push them the other way and knock the dipole apart or i must trick this dipole and trick those electrons so that they wish to move of their own volition from the bottom line up to the top of voluntary movement now both ways can be done one way to do it is don&#x27;t even have a circle just surge the current back and forth that was uh tesla&#x27;s favorite way in his magnifying transmitter he went from the top to the bottom he didn&#x27;t actually have a close loop so he didn&#x27;t knock his dipoles apart it was a matter of timing from then on the thing that we&#x27;re working on in c-tec we have discovered a process that we call bridging and the idea is if we can cause a little time reversal zone right where that dipole is which means time reversal we&#x27;re going this way over here means the video tape runs backwards now let&#x27;s talk about a time reversal zone okay when we took physics and we took electricity in school they taught us that two like charges repel and the two unlike charges attract that&#x27;s true as long as time is running forward but it&#x27;s not true when time reverses it&#x27;s exactly the opposite like attracts like right so if i can get a little time reversal zone in here which i can do with phase conjugation if i get it just right that&#x27;s this when the electron gets to the bottom he says i&#x27;m supposed to fall down back to this position i can&#x27;t play the game anymore not playing the ram it up through the the dipole right forcibly he&#x27;s playing fall down the stairs he thinks he&#x27;s falling down the stairs freely right and so the electrons will appear against way we see from outside we see it moving against the voltage now it&#x27;s called a negative resistor that&#x27;s like swimming uphill that&#x27;s right it&#x27;s like the water flows uphill of its own voltage which it will do if time runs backwards right take a videotape of water running downhill run the tape backwards the water&#x27;s running uphill that&#x27;s right and when we do time reversal that&#x27;s exactly what happens so our problem now is to trick this thing so that the water runs uphill in that little point only and from there on it runs normally if we can do that we can furnish just a tiny bit of energy from the left to a component where the trickery occurs on the right we can circulate the current through the load on the right and we can do it with very little cost to us on the left and that&#x27;s called a bridge we have one component that will make that bridge it&#x27;s not in production yet it is the fogel semiconductor and when that semiconductor hopefully gets in production hopefully about mid 19 then we&#x27;ll be able to do exactly what we just said in the interim i might add that it appears that a very fine scientist dr chong at university of buffalo has in fact come up with a true negative resistor which would be doing this thing i just talked about because dr chung has reported at a conference that she has some carbon filament cross-filament material she is one of the world experts in smart materials where the materials is used as electronics yeah it&#x27;s very good uh to explain what smart smart materials are the material itself the little pieces of the material electronic circuits very intelligent actions and so she is one of the world experts in that probably a leading expert in the united states and so she has reported and the paper i understand has been written and is now in the referee process for publication excellent describing this resistor which in my interpretation does exactly that and so if so professor chung has in fact come up with a very practical component which will eventually be be capable of being mass produced very cheaply and it will in fact give us that magic bridge which means that we can produce over unity systems practically there&#x27;s a lot of opposition to this isn&#x27;t that yes the conventional folks who have never thought of time reversing the right side of a transformer for example the secondary are very much an objection to that because if you apply normal electrodynamics to it where you don&#x27;t have the time reversal it doesn&#x27;t work it couldn&#x27;t work even in theory it couldn&#x27;t work well you see this is the problem we have people discussing something from a different model in the model that they are saying this cannot work in it cannot work in that moment but all that says is you&#x27;ve got to be using a different model where it can work now dr chung is obviously not using that conventional model she&#x27;s using a model where the time reversal does occur and if that occurs then she jolly well can get the electrons to flow against the emf or against the voltage as far as we would see it from outside as far as they see it they&#x27;re flowing downhill all the time and you can build a bridge and you can build a true over unity system a negative resistor and i think we&#x27;ll see them coming out of the university of buffalo i think they hold the patent on this they&#x27;re uh they have filed a patent and i think you will see devices coming out of the university of buffalo under the work of professor cho interesting but there&#x27;s that&#x27;s not the only place this is happening either though is it no there are several we&#x27;ve known processes for many years it&#x27;s just nobody has accented it that do produce more energy out than you put in uh to say that this is impossible is ridiculous because it&#x27;s already in the literature and has been for 50 years andy stokes emission for example is defined as a case where into the material you put some energy and the material puts out more than you put in does it every time any hour of the day a week any month or year whatever you wish to we&#x27;ll always do that it&#x27;s called anti-stokes emission the only problem they have is you say where did you get the extra energy and they say well we think it came from the internal energy of the molecule blah blah blah and you say well i apply the conservation energy over to the molecule it didn&#x27;t collapse where did it get the excess energy to furnish and they say no no and they left it right there they didn&#x27;t chase the thing down to its conclusion but does it produce more energy yes indeed leticoff starting in 1967 and a lot of other scientists were showing papers in the literature in physics in the leading physics journals that showed a thing which they had to call negative absorption to even get it through the sensors really or negative resonance absorption what that really means is excess emission it means again you put in some energy it gives you a lot back a lot more energy now recently i say recently last few years uh dr lawandi uh has had and his colleagues have had a very formidable paper in nature and rawandi has a beautiful example of that and i&#x27;d like to describe that okay great because can be done at any university for 20 bucks oh great it&#x27;s so simple you take a little glass or flask of water and you put a little bit of dye in there that fluoresces at to some radar some laser frequency right use a little weak laser very very weak laser and let&#x27;s say you fire one little laser pulse into this beaker full of water with a little dye in it you get a little warm red glow around where the baker strikes just a little red dot of light that&#x27;s all you get nothing not interesting at all i shined and i hit it with a laser post got a little little red glow pulse and that&#x27;s it then i do one change i reach in my pocket like the cajuns say wear carrot there all the time and i pull out some titanium dioxide particles now titanium dioxide is the main ingredient in white paint so it&#x27;s dirt cheap but these particles are sized through a filter screen carefully so that they their resonant frequency is at the same frequency or very near to this little laser i&#x27;m using in other words if the laser light hits the little particle it don&#x27;t just push it the little particle vibrates that&#x27;s all we&#x27;re talking about now i pour these little particles in the solution right out of my little test tube here my little vial and now i have the same thing i just had i have my little laser i have a little fluorescent dye in here i have the little particles and i now fire another pulse i don&#x27;t get just a little warm glow i get a tremendous blast of light that comes out of this thing fills a whole room wow and obviously has much more energy in it by far and it&#x27;s all coherent light it&#x27;s like a laser filling the entire room and that&#x27;s called lacing without population inversion luandi has several nice patents on it and several are nice descriptions of it so here&#x27;s another process that you can test in any university sophomore level certain junior level optical lab anywhere for 20 bucks all you got to do size the particles it&#x27;s that simple interesting and over unity processes do exist are known there are probably eight or ten more in the conventional literature that always put out more energy than you put in now my question is why aren&#x27;t we using these or adaptations of them as system exactly because if i&#x27;m putting out 20 times what i put in for example the resonance there can give you 18 times 20 is not a bad figure so we know we can get 18 or 20 times out what we stimulated it with well i could take even with a 50 prod process i could take two parts of that 20 and feed back in to run this gadget and the other 18 would be for free it&#x27;d be just like a heat pump the average heat pump on a home under ideal conditions has a cop put out over what you put in of about 4.0 it puts out four times as much energy as you got to take from the electric line now the reason you can&#x27;t do a free energy device where your home heat pump because you can&#x27;t keep the conditions ideal as it gets colder its efficiency goes down and you got to switch over onto the resistors now you don&#x27;t have cop4 you got it best cop1 actually would be about 0.9 and so you got to pour more energy into the thing to run the motor and blower and all that and you possibly can get out of it so that keeps you on the power line keeps the power meter on your house otherwise you could cut loose with your home heat pump i think people would like that well they would and if you build a real efficient heat pump you get in a lot of trouble there are indications from various people in england for example who have built in the past some fairly efficient heat pumps at low temperature and very slight differences and those people ran into enormous legal difficulties and scientific difficulties and personal difficulties and they just never got out anything that was able to get out anything that worked but they did build uh processes which were much more efficient as the temperature dropped so one of the things i would like to see is you know some high publicity from the newspapers and everything forced into that area and forced these fellows to work on high efficiency cool processes for heat pumps because there is one that you know everybody can understand it&#x27;s simple it&#x27;s cheap you got it in your home it&#x27;s already 4.0 so you could hold it at 2.0 that&#x27;s fine that&#x27;ll do the job but that would also get the power meter off your home and so that&#x27;s not likely in the near future but it is something that uh is known you can look at the textbook and see it&#x27;s 4.0 it&#x27;s not tom bearden talking you already got it working in your home they call that lowering your power bill by having these more modern heat pumps you got one that&#x27;s 4.0 now instead of 1.3 but they do exist they&#x27;re in there in all the homes and there&#x27;s no reason why we couldn&#x27;t pursue that line of endeavor to come up with something that would be very useful in the power industry do you think that if they came out with some applications of this over unity in less less restricted areas that you know smaller forays into smaller appliances and smaller things that maybe using their same modality of gradualism that we could really use you know progress in that on that vein i think we&#x27;re likely to i think you&#x27;re exactly right and where i think what&#x27;s going to drive it probably will be something like laptop computers where you really want a powerful little computer you want to be able to carry it with you everywhere you go we need to do everything well the computers are getting powerful enough but it&#x27;s the problem with the battery how to keep it powered you say you want to be able to use it when you&#x27;re out in the wilderness and not even near the power line exactly so the point is you&#x27;re going to carry a big battery with you if you&#x27;re going to use it all the time for a second wouldn&#x27;t you like to have a little device that would just power the thing so i think right now they&#x27;re just under a tremendous drive to get more efficient batteries and they&#x27;re getting more efficient better it&#x27;s steadily growing but i think in the future you will probably see one of the really free energy machines free energy little power systems to power really laptop computers and other similar machines it&#x27;s also if you went camping it&#x27;d be nice to have the thing to make coffee in the morning you say when you got up from the camp exactly exactly i just see that it&#x27;s starting off in a smaller format and gradually moving up now tell us about patterson cells the patterson cell is a variation of before i speak of that i need to lay the foundation for one thing okay i went through a process of one pass collection the energy went down the wire at almost the speed of light or essentially at the speed of light the little surface electrons only got one grab at it to divert like a board in a wind or like you holding your hand out the window in the car and diverting a little air from it it only got one strike at the flowing energy to divert it in there the rest of the energy then flowed on off it wasn&#x27;t collected and you never got another pass out right wasted and we said there was an enormous amount of energy that&#x27;s wasted there&#x27;s 10 to the 13th times an average little circuit that is missed yes enormous amounts for this tiny little bit we catch so a dumb country boy like me would say well suppose we could retro reflect that energy flow suppose we could bring it back again and let him have another pass of catching some more a little catcher&#x27;s mitt and then retro reflect it back again and catch a little more well obviously every time you hit him again he&#x27;ll catch a little more that&#x27;s the law for that&#x27;s already in in physics so he would catch more energy and to us where we calculate only from the single pass he would look like an over unity process the energy is there we&#x27;re describing really if we want to be very technical we&#x27;re describing an open system where the energy is coming from a free external source and we&#x27;re just getting more of it into the system catching more so there&#x27;s nothing in the laws of physics or thermodynamics is being opposed you&#x27;re not violating conservation of energy it&#x27;s catching more and using more so this would be the way to go would be to have this multi-pass multi-collection well it turns out when you do that you have to revise a thing in physics called the work energy theorem i&#x27;ve already done that so it&#x27;s already there and it&#x27;s in the literature basically it says you got more than one pass so you catch more energy than what you normally calculate for single pass that&#x27;s all it says now in materials there are some materials that will do this for you that any stokes emission is the type of materials that would do it and the thing i talked about with the little particles the little titanium dioxide particles to do the lewandi experiment yes the little particles are doing it when the laser pulse goes in the light gets broken up and reflected back and forth and it stays in and is being collected every time it hits anything and it makes lots of hits and lots of collections before it gets out before it finally escapes so the more hits you know instead of one hit we&#x27;ve got hit after hit after hit where it&#x27;s collecting energy the particles just accumulating so the little particles showed you they had the energy by giving you this huge blast of energy to show you how much they collected and they sit there and take a bow for you after their performance yeah they&#x27;re saying say hey look at me look at me so this is another way to do it do it with intensely retro reflecting or intensely scattering media is what they call it in physics and luandi of course has filed patents on one that will do this lacing without population inversion you don&#x27;t have to do all this crazy stuff you do in normal lacing well if we have one here that will do this and do it down at say infrared now we&#x27;re talking heat that&#x27;s right you see we&#x27;ve gotten away from the middle of the band and from the top end of the optical band that down to the bottom we&#x27;re not really that far from where the sail was working with lewande&#x27;s sail we just came down a little bit so we didn&#x27;t even have to go a full harmonic down to get down to the heat zone so if we can get it to work down in the infrared then we can have something that&#x27;ll produce heat and it&#x27;ll it&#x27;ll do exactly the same thing if it retroreflects it back and forth before it gets out it&#x27;ll collect and collect and collect and collect and give us lots of heat well patterson&#x27;s paracel will do that what he does is he coats the he has these little micro uh spheres of plastic and he coats them with palladium a cladding a palladium metal now palladium has a beautiful uh characteristic it loves hydrogen and so the palladium will scarf up all these hydrogen ions that are running around in the water and that&#x27;s by the way just free protons and it&#x27;ll scarf them up and fold it into its lattice it just loves to do that and we call that loading mm-hmm so the palladium will start to load itself and you say oh boy you give me a lot here to load up my plate because you put this solution in here and it&#x27;s got all these nice protons and boy am i going to gather them so he gathers in all the protons and fix it and when he does he starts to create some of these little time reversal zones but also the energy that patterson is putting in electrically starts to ricochet back and forth between the loaded palladium the loaded palladium starts to retro-reflect and what happens is the energy there you get more and more collections now instead of just one pass and so more and more heat starts to come out of this thing and it gradually grows as the process rises you run it for you know i think it&#x27;s some 12 or 13 hours in the good one that he had and it will gradually come up till it&#x27;s putting out somewhere between a thousand to twelve hundred to one well now when you cut the power off right continues to operate for another eight or ten hours as it gradually dies down and dissipates he had a problem he proved it conclusively he&#x27;s got a patent it&#x27;s been independently tested and verified by at least three universities and a couple of spooky government uh groups which i don&#x27;t even know who they are but they snuck in and did some tests some black black budgets whatever but it&#x27;s real it&#x27;s absolutely real uh you know if you don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s real you can go there and probably get with patterson and test one sure but the thing is it didn&#x27;t turn out too practical with a palladium because the ions the heavier ions in the solutions beat the palladium and so it beats the cladding gradually off there but it proves the principle so it was unstable so it but as the planting folded up and came unglued it broke up the geometry and stopped it now he has one now with just copper which won&#x27;t do that kind of loading and the efficiency goes way down but it&#x27;s still over unity i understand it&#x27;s anywhere like 1.2 to 2. which is certainly dramatically different from a thousand to one but it&#x27;s still more than one to one right and you can independently measure it so the point we&#x27;re talking about here now it&#x27;s merely a matter of development we&#x27;re talking about something already proven already established already recognized with the u.s patent office and a patent granted in fact several patents granted so what we should be doing is we should be having enormous resources focused on a paterson power cell for development exactly how can we keep the palladium on for example and get that thousand to one without it beating up things like this is what we should be doing and if we had a real good department of energy that&#x27;s what they&#x27;d be doing instead of all playing great big cyclotrons and accelerators and big nuclear processes this is where the action is uh 10 to the 13th is a very large number we can collect a little bit more out of that by multi-reflection and multi-collection then we don&#x27;t need all that other big mess and all the nuclear waste and all that we need a working model process like this and of course patterson has shown you the way to go luandi has shown you the way to go let a cough in russia has shown you the way to go since 1967. lilikov has a paper in one of our nice journals contemporary physics which summarizes things a nice summary article showing you this really is a true maxwell&#x27;s demon it&#x27;s like we had a little demon in there selecting all this stuff and giving you free energy wow now i understand that patterson cell is really valuable for say these nuclear power stations that it can take care of the waste that&#x27;s such a problem you you&#x27;ve just mentioned the thing i&#x27;m i&#x27;m awfully glad you mentioned it because it&#x27;s something i very much want to talk about i&#x27;ve spent in the last two and a half years particularly enormous amount of work on it if the work stands up then i believe that we have solved the cold fusion problem i had an if on that and you know it remains to be seen whether the work stands up but i want to explain to you what happens in cold fusion and why i think and why you can get over unity out of it and cold fusion is not really a fusion process at all but what we do it&#x27;s an electrolysis process it&#x27;s in water it&#x27;s very similar to the patterson cell which is really an outgrowth of that but we&#x27;re putting the electricity in and we&#x27;re getting heating and we have calorimeters and instruments measuring it now by the configuration of the experiment the scientists have not known about these time reversal regions they haven&#x27;t known about they haven&#x27;t known about that at all that&#x27;s my contribution oh wow that a time reversal region can form in a solution and you ought to take that into account and you ought to deliberately design to optimize the process because let&#x27;s speak about now suppose i get a little time reversal process to occur and it occurs as the palladium starts loading and it&#x27;s directly coordinated or correlated to the loading of the palladium when it gets sufficiently loaded to where you would expect time reversal zones to start occurring yes they&#x27;ll last and then the fluid moves and so then they collapse right but they&#x27;re forming and gradually decaying all the time in the fluid now once you have the palladium loaded and that is the correlation you don&#x27;t get the excess energy until the palladium loads if you load slow takes a long time to start getting hit through sure because they have to bind and get together before you get all that multi-reflection exactly and that is a phase conjugate reflection that&#x27;s what a time zone reversed is in this time reversal zone a very marvelous thing happens marvelous beyond belief remember i said they taught us only half the laws of electrodynamics about particles attracting and repelling now i have just invoked the missing half because my time now is reversed in this little zone i&#x27;m looking at it means that two like charges will draw together not repel each other right and what is floating around in that solution hydrogen ions which is just three protons so the protons will cluster together in clusters and they will form quasi nuclei now paulie exclusion principle says they can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t time reverse one proton or one neutron or one electron but you can do two or four or six but you can&#x27;t do one and you can&#x27;t do three right but you can do 2 4 6 8 like that so let&#x27;s look at the case where we have two of these hydrogen ions that is the protons have now drawn together that&#x27;s the same form as a nucleus that has one neutron and one proton we call that an isomer when you don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s a neutron or proton they&#x27;re always changing into one another anyway they just flip a quark and you turn a proton into a neutron flip it the other way you got a neutron again and they&#x27;re doing that all the time it&#x27;s a dance they go through so they don&#x27;t just stay a hard proton and a hard neutron at all they&#x27;re changing into one another all time so you got a dynamic process you can shift for one more neutron or one more proton right so we have these two protons together and we&#x27;re in a time reversal zone that&#x27;s a perfectly stable configuration at a certain strength of time reversal as that starts to decay because the fluid is moving and moving back out of that configuration suddenly this is an excited state it&#x27;s not a normal state well excited states decay they emit something or do something to change to balance the energy go to a lower energy state so what happens is one quark and one proton flips that makes a neutron and that is deuterium and that&#x27;s where the deuterium comes from here&#x27;s the part that has frightened all of the normal high energy physics okay we&#x27;re going to have to really scurry on this because it doesn&#x27;t need high energy physics it&#x27;s this is the electro nuclear reaction the use of time reversal zones and clustering and quark flipping that&#x27;s all it is and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening we&#x27;re chaining the nuclei now suppose we get four then we double it well i now have four protons stuck together if i flip two quarks which they will do as the thing decays it&#x27;ll flip one and that&#x27;s still an excited state the case further flip the other and that&#x27;s two neutrons and two protons that is a helium-4 nucleus and it&#x27;s what we call an alpha particle and in the august conference where i first presented any of this this year hal fox made an impassioned plea for anyone who could explain where all his alpha particles are coming from in his experiments because he doesn&#x27;t go in there with all these helium nuclei and he comes out with them well i already had a chart with the interaction on it which generates those uh particles really now at the same time we have charged up i&#x27;m just going to say this briefly and not go too far yeah because we&#x27;re we&#x27;re really at the end charge it with time when time decays it&#x27;s energy compacted by the factor c squared just like mass is it&#x27;s the equivalent of atomic energy wow when you charge a particle with time rather than energy and when it decays it charges very slowly and it decays very slowly coordinated again to the palladium loading when i start having some of this discharge it comes out and winds up as normal transverse waves and gives me excess energy and that is the excess heat that is occurring in the cold fusion experiments we also explained all the anomalies in the instruments that are occurring at china lake so we got a 100 fit to it doesn&#x27;t prove it but it&#x27;s the first requirement got to be consistent that&#x27;s wonderful but it will fuel the world now what&#x27;s the bottom line burn time okay burn time burn time and that and that&#x27;s going to be our ending that&#x27;s the last moment wonderful thank you so very much i&#x27;m sorry we didn&#x27;t start maybe a little earlier with that but it&#x27;s a real pleasure we did get a lot of that in so thank you so very much for being with me and to my viewers thank you very much for tuning in join me next time when we explore another avenue of</p>
