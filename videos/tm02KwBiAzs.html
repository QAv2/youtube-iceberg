            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, you might want to clench your butt cheeks right now because you probably heard the crazy story already of aliens being real. Now, just from President, ex-president of United States, Barack Obama, but also Donald J. Trump talking about aliens right now and saying that yeah, Obama was not supposed to disclose that he&#x27;s not allowed to. But yeah, I&#x27;m going to do it right now. And apparently, we&#x27;re getting some crazy stuff going around and they&#x27;re saying that this is no longer rumors.</p>
<p>fellas don&#x27;t like, don&#x27;t subscribe, but definitely share this video. And you might want to just stop rolling those fat doobies because they&#x27;re officially talking about disclosing the alien files, the UFO files. And apparently, we also got a representative, Eric Berles, talking about a UFO crash retrieval. You know, a couple of days ago, we covered the that crash UFO uh in South Korea. Apparently, there&#x27;s another one that happened in the recent timeline in United States of America.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;re going to start off with that because that I thought that was really, really interesting. And then you got Obama saying aliens are real. Now, President Trump talking about it. The daughter-in-law of Trump talking about it. Trump himself actually said what he said.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to get to all of it. Carolin-l and what if this video and this image that you&#x27;re seeing right now, what if this was not fake? I mean, we thought it was fake, right? Perhaps it was not because, you know, Area 51 scientist disappears after revealing the aliens are real. This happened like ages ago. So, we&#x27;re going to revisit that, too. And there&#x27;s just tons of clips to go over.</p>
<p>Needless to say, you&#x27;re going to get some tonight. Big pose on that one. But roll it. It&#x27;s reportedly an object that is not in this country that is so large it cannot be moved. Uh that they&#x27;ve built an entire building around it.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s one of the locations that I&#x27;m I&#x27;m requesting to to get to. It&#x27;s going to be very it&#x27;s going to involve a lot to get to make that happen. But that may be the uh final destination. So that is the claim and it was made by a Republican member of Congress that there is reportedly this object in another country that&#x27;s so big it can&#x27;t be moved and a massive structure has been built around it to hide its location. But several questions remain.</p>
<p>What is this? When did it get here and why is it being kept a secret? Our next guests are both trying to get those answers. Missouri Congressman Eric Burles who sits on the Congressional Oversight Committee investigating UAPs and is &gt;&gt; There we go. We got Dr. Steven Greer pulling up too. Whenever in doubt, just whip it out.</p>
<p>Big pose. But &gt;&gt; to get permission to visit this alleged site is with us alongside the founder of the disclosure project, Dr. Steven Greer. It&#x27;s great to have you both here. Congressman, what do we know about what this thing really is? &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know that I have any hard evidence of what it really is.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve had al allegations from both inside and outside of the federal government that there is this object that is that exists in another country. Um, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not going to mention the country because I have I&#x27;ve heard of it inside of a closed setting and and so and spoiler alert. Everybody is assuming it&#x27;s South Korea that apparently and I covered that in a video recently, right? So, these are just assumptions though. So, don&#x27;t take it for real for real. It&#x27;s really is like, ah, man, come on, man.</p>
<p>Just tell us where it crash landed and all that, but they&#x27;re not able to say that for one reason or the other. I guess they&#x27;re going to get into that. But he&#x27;s talking about South Korea 99% on it. &gt;&gt; And I want to protect my classification level, but um others may say that. I can tell you that it&#x27;s not in the facility that&#x27;s been widely reported in the news.</p>
<p>Um &gt;&gt; maybe not South Korea then. &gt;&gt; Um so but but I have been receiving reports both inside and outside of people that have worked in the federal government that there is the potential that this exists. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um Dr. Greer, you have said publicly that this is outside Soul, South Korea.</p>
<p>Is that accurate? &gt;&gt; One of them, now remember, I&#x27;ve debriefed almost 800 whistleblowers who&#x27;ve had direct involvement with this. One of them was with the Pentagon for about 8 years as a very senior investigator and had baseline clearance across 18 uh black project unagnowledged special access projects. He specifically knew of the one in the mountains outside Soul uh South Korea. It was so huge they had to build a structure around it. Dang.</p>
<p>And he was read into this in between 2002 and 2010. Okay. Um so it had been there for some time now. I also know there are others that have been brought down in other locations. And if they&#x27;re over a certain size, they&#x27;re very very hard to move.</p>
<p>Imagine if they&#x27;re bigger than a football field. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you&#x27;re not going to put that on a semi. So it becomes logistically impossible to move it. &gt;&gt; Uh and then in the United States, we know where there are some others such as near for Oklahoma.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a smaller one. They had they &gt;&gt; Oklahoma where? Okay, let me get the captions in so we get the &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; in the United States we know where there are some others such as airport still Oklahoma there&#x27;s a smaller &gt;&gt; okay I I don&#x27;t know where that is but if you&#x27;re in Oklahoma or you&#x27;re in the states you probably know where he&#x27;s talking about but that&#x27;s crazy Steven Greer Dr. JIM GREER NOT HOLDING BACK LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHILE EVERYBODY WAS HOLDING BACK. He&#x27;s like, &quot;Here you go. Just outside of Soul, South Korea, right?&quot; And that&#x27;s what we heard, right? People saying that it was so massive and you know, the experts went crazy.</p>
<p>The Reddit detectives, the internet detectives, they have found and we even had like the video. Let me see if I can found it. I actually showed that in one of the previous video, but while we&#x27;re on topic at hand, let me show you &gt;&gt; one. They had they built a skiff a facility around that one. We have its location.</p>
<p>So, um I know that the congressman can speak, you know, uh to what he&#x27;s limited, but but because I&#x27;m a private citizen, I can discuss these. &gt;&gt; Congressman, are you referring to the location in South Korea? &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s see. &gt;&gt; Um I can&#x27;t be specific to that location. Um but it but there are wide reports. What I can say is that I that I&#x27;ve seen I&#x27;ve seen articles that have pointed to a specific building and and from what I&#x27;ve been told that is not the facility.</p>
<p>Wait, can you explain why we can&#x27;t? You&#x27;re trying to get permission. &gt;&gt; So, they&#x27;re talking about like multiple different crash retrieval objects. That is insane. Okay, so let me just show you this. This is a video &gt;&gt; question some of that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now, even Ross Coldart was talking about it right now. Don&#x27;t take it for real. For real, though. This is what we think it is. But yeah, know it&#x27;s insane.</p>
<p>So, it is being said that this is a spaceship. Like, it crashed there and then they made the facility around it. Yeah. Um, and uh, you&#x27;re seeing the round shape, but uh, obviously like they made the facility on top of it uh, is what they&#x27;re saying. Like this is where it crash landed.</p>
<p>They could not move it. Makes sense though. And especially if it&#x27;s like that big, you&#x27;re not going to move it because if you try to move something that big, the public&#x27;s going to find out. Like everybody&#x27;s going to be like, &quot;OH, WHAT&#x27;S THE ALIENS? M ALIENS CALL THE POLICE CALL THIS THAT THE OTHER.&quot; People would go batshit crazy. So yeah, it is alleged.</p>
<p>Uh it&#x27;s alleged that this is where it crash landed. Insane if real, right? And you obviously we had we&#x27;ve heard Roswell crash back in the 47. That&#x27;s probably is the most uh believable case and one of the biggest case, right, about UFOs and all that, but let&#x27;s actually get back to it. &gt;&gt; Mission, I assume, from our government and another government or somebody with another country to go visit whatever this thing is. Maybe it&#x27;s a spaceship, maybe it&#x27;s nothing.</p>
<p>Why can&#x27;t we talk about where it is? I don&#x27;t get that. again because because of the information was gathered inside of a classified setting on my behalf. &gt;&gt; What I can tell you is I have been explo trying to get access to even locations that reportedly have craft that that are being reverse engineered that are even close to Washington DC and having I&#x27;m having a difficult time getting access to the even those facilities that are just within a few miles from from my office in Washington DC. So to try to attempt to go to another country and get permission at that level is is going to be somewhat insurmountable, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m not going to continue to try. &gt;&gt; It seems like the White House is at least on some level behind disclosure.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll see where it goes. &gt;&gt; And this happened uh wait for it, right? There&#x27;s tons of other stuff that I want to share with you. So this happened like 3 days ago. And 3 days later, bam, you know, we&#x27;re hearing and you know uh you probably heard this uh saying or not saying but a rumor. There was a UK filmmaker, right, director.</p>
<p>He came out, he came out just a couple of weeks ago saying that Donald Trump, president of the United States, is getting ready to drop a UFO disclosure speech on July the 8th. &gt;&gt; Oh &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s the date. And I covered that uh not necessarily by like making a dedicated video because I quite literally did not believe in that. I believe eventually we&#x27;ll have the disclosure, but to say that on July 8th, July 8th, I mean whenever you give a hard date, it doesn&#x27;t turn out to be legit. You know what I mean, right? But now everything that&#x27;s happening and everything that you&#x27;re about to see, yeah, that will that makes me believe.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;ll if this will make you believe or not, but that makes me believe, especially what just happened today makes me believe that yep, disclosure is happening. Maybe not even maybe not on July the 8th, maybe before, maybe later, but one thing is for certain, it is happening, fellas. And before I show you the next clip quickly though, got to take a second to shout out the homie Oneness for becoming a brand new member on the channel along with the homie Brian Timothy Brooks Drop Daniel. Also, shout out to the homie Jose for the two and the homie Greg for the 75. Uh thank you guys so much for your insane generosity, man.</p>
<p>You guys got to do none of it, man. But those of you that choose to uh thank you guys so much for all the love, man. The homie Ben and the homie uh Jod as well. Appreciate all the love, guys. your support uh is tremendous, helps the channel out tremendously.</p>
<p>All right, let&#x27;s get back to the content here. Boo Boo, check this. &gt;&gt; Um throughout the next 3 years, why is there so much resistance to your request, Congress? See where it goes. Um throughout the next three years, why is there so much resistance to your request, Congressman? &gt;&gt; A lot of it is turf. You have all of the different agencies that protect their their information, and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s guarded like it&#x27;s some kind of commodity.</p>
<p>you have committees that protect the their turf as well. So, if you&#x27;re not on the right committee, um then often times you&#x27;re turned down and and um sometimes there&#x27;s there&#x27;s multiple committees that have jurisdiction over a topic and they they love turning each other down. So, the very nature of the difficulty of the red tape system within within um the bureaucracy of Congress is is something that&#x27;s very difficult to navigate. &gt;&gt; Dr. Greer, why can&#x27;t this thing be moved? We can move mountains as a society.</p>
<p>Why can&#x27;t we? &gt;&gt; Yeah, apparently we made the pyramids, right? Yeah, we made the pyramids, right? Those 110 blocks, right, that we were ABLE TO MOVE. WHY CAN&#x27;T WE MOVE THIS THING? Let&#x27;s find out. &gt;&gt; Move this thing. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s it was my understanding it was way too large to move. And remember, you just any idea how large &gt;&gt; hundreds of feet and some of them have been in the thousands of feet across.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And are we talking about a spaceship? &gt;&gt; Yes, definitely. Um, in this case, the one I&#x27;m referring to and there&#x27;s some others. And the other problem is you can&#x27;t just chop them up because I know people who have been on crash retrieval teams with an acetylene torch, a high-owered laser, a diamond tip saw. You cannot cut through that material. It is so specialized and it&#x27;s so hard.</p>
<p>How &gt;&gt; long has it been here, Dr. Greer? Sorry to cut you off. How long has it been here? Do we have any idea? &gt;&gt; He didn&#x27;t know that this particular whistleblower. So, I don&#x27;t know it. He indicated it had been there for quite some time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. Congressman, if you are able to visit this space ship, what do you do with that information when you get back? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Well, look, if if I &gt;&gt; spill the beans, please spill the beans. come under any any hard evidence, whether it&#x27;s physical or um video evidence that is absolutely definitive. You know, while I&#x27;m going to do what I can to protect our national security and our and our nation&#x27;s interest, I will not hold &gt;&gt; we love you for it, but please don&#x27;t hold back &gt;&gt; back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this in this universe.</p>
<p>That is something that no government has the right to withhold from its people. &gt;&gt; I think a lot of people agree with that. Um and then this weekend, Barack Obama out of nowhere said this. Take a look. &gt;&gt; Yeah, which we saw.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Are aliens real? &gt;&gt; And this is going to transition us to what the hell just happened right after. Coming up, guys. You&#x27;re going to get some tonight. Don&#x27;t worry, man. I won&#x27;t lead you I won&#x27;t leave you hanging, man.</p>
<p>Come on, man. You&#x27;re going to get some. I got you. &gt;&gt; Uh they&#x27;re real, but I haven&#x27;t seen them. And and and uh they&#x27;re not being kept in uh what is it? Area 51.</p>
<p>There there&#x27;s no underground uh facility unless there&#x27;s this enormous conspiracy and they they hid it from the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; Dr. Greer, did you believe him? &gt;&gt; Well, this is the briefing document that was given to him in 2009. It was actually given to John Podesta who was a senior adviser at the time and then later ran Hillary&#x27;s campaign. And &gt;&gt; that we are so this is like one of those documents that presidents get as soon as they become president, right? Okay, let&#x27;s read it out cuz they ain&#x27;t going to uh that.</p>
<p>Okay, so it says that and I quote that we are not alone in the universe is now a scientific given who that we have been visited already by advanced civilizations plural whose interests here are likely ancient is controversial. Okay, what kind of controversial? However, in my discussions with European, Vatican, Canadian and other leaders around the world, a growing uh consensus exists that we have been visited and the time for disclosing this information is long past due. Oo, okay. Now, interesting. &gt;&gt; U it had great detail in it.</p>
<p>Now, how much of it got to him directly? I never met with Mr. Obama directly. He did indicate that he knew there was something there, but he was never read into it. meaning this is what I discovered when I briefed the first president CI director I briefed and which was Bill Clinton in 1993. &gt;&gt; They were desperate to find information on this and they were blocked.</p>
<p>I think the public and the media need to acknowledge that there are some criminal elements to the secrecy that&#x27;s going on for at least since the late 1950s. And so I think Mr. Obama never was fully read into it and that&#x27;s why he says I didn&#x27;t see anything but was he given information? Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um Dr.</p>
<p>Steven Greer, Congressman Eric Burlson, appreciate you being with us. Congressman. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess president. That&#x27;s the thing, right? A lot of people are now also, let me actually show you this. Okay, so a lot of people are also bringing this up.</p>
<p>Why? Now, a lot of people do believe that we&#x27;re not alone. A lot of people believe that we&#x27;re alone. A lot of people also believe that these might just be angels and demons. And maybe that&#x27;s what it is. Perhaps perhaps.</p>
<p>But I somebody as somebody who believes in God, you don&#x27;t have to if you don&#x27;t, but for me, right, like I believe in God. Uh and like mathematically speaking, the universe is so big, so many planets, so many galaxies, billions in fact. Uh you know, so mathematically speaking, it&#x27;s just impossible for us to be alone. I do believe that the devil is real. I believe that angels are probably real too, right? Uh and if they are, and if we&#x27;re real, and if you are able to watch this video and you&#x27;re real, I&#x27;m real.</p>
<p>And all of us are here. 8 billion of us currently probably going to grow, right? because we ain&#x27;t stopping anytime soon unless they drop a vitamin N on us. But uh but yeah, so 8 billion of us, so much uh so many different species here, right? Like animals, this that the other and this is just one planet. Do you really think God is that small and he cannot create like other beings, other intelligent life if they he if he can create us? Yeah. You know what I&#x27;m saying? Like I just Yeah.</p>
<p>So I I I believe that we&#x27;re not alone, right? So there is that. Uh but now uh oh Obama coming out he says that but then Trump is like yeah he leaked a classified information he shouldn&#x27;t have been doing that and then Trump drops this based on the tremendous interest shown I will be directing the secretary of war and other relevant departments and agencies and began the process of identifying and release government file government files relating okay so might be propaganda though might be false okay or might be a nothing burger relating to alien and extraterrestrial life unidentified aerial phenomena, UAP and unidentified flying objects, UFOs, and any and all other information connected to these highly complex but extremely interesting and important matters. God bless America. That&#x27;s what he said. This this is massive, guys.</p>
<p>This is massive. And a lot of people are also memeing this thing by saying that yeah, it&#x27;s because of the EP files. And make no mistake, probably why? Maybe that&#x27;s the reason why it&#x27;s coming up. You never know, right? Because the EP files massive. Okay? like everybody&#x27;s name is on it, right? It&#x27;s insane.</p>
<p>It is bashit crazy. Prince Andrew got arrested, too. So, insane times we&#x27;re living in. They&#x27;re talking about WW3 openly, uh, and all of this. It&#x27;s just nuts.</p>
<p>I I don&#x27;t think, you know what I&#x27;m saying? Like, if if you could say that we would have been having times like these like 20 years ago, 50 years ago, people wouldn&#x27;t have believed you, right? Like, in fact, people would call you loco if you believed in aliens. uh 50 years ago, TW, even I would say like 30 years ago. All right. Now, it&#x27;s popular. It&#x27;s kind of good to talk about it, right? So, maybe we&#x27;ll get the legit answer, but I guess best case scenario, they&#x27;re going to come out and say, &quot;Yep, we&#x27;re not alone and we&#x27;ve been visiting.</p>
<p>We have been visited and we&#x27;re learning about it.&quot; And we&#x27;ll reveal more in the future. Best case scenario. Worst case scenario, they&#x27;re going to say, &quot;Yeah, no, we&#x27;re we&#x27;re alone in the universe.&quot; Or whatever. I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re going to say, right? And uh it will be interesting. Now, let&#x27;s actually get to this timeline.</p>
<p>Okay, this is president&#x27;s daughter-in-law saying this. This is this is massive. So, this happened couple of days ago, right? Wait for it. Roll it. &gt;&gt; Do you think that he&#x27;s he&#x27;s about to make an announcement about UFOs? Because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, I I said this in my podcast, too. What&#x27;s funny is we&#x27;ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this cuz we&#x27;re like, &quot;Well, what do you know?&quot; Cuz Miranda, we all want to know about the UFOs or we all want to know what&#x27;s going on. And he played a little koi with us. And so that of course led us to believe, Eric and I were like, &quot;Oh my gosh, if he won&#x27;t even like fully tell us, &gt;&gt; maybe there&#x27;s more to it.&quot; And then I have just heard kind of around that I think he&#x27;s actually said I think my father-in-law has actually said it that there is some speech that he has that I guess at at the right time and I don&#x27;t know when the right time is he&#x27;s going to break out and and &gt;&gt; yeah so that&#x27;s what we heard right and we saw Obama saying aliens are real and then Uncle Donnie President Trump right you&#x27;re not supposed to do that and people are memeing and saying that well Obama just stole the spotlight, the limelight. Obama is now the first disclosure president and Trump wants to wanted to be the first disclosure president, but looks like Obama got the whiff off it AND HE&#x27;S LIKE, &quot;NAH, SORRY, Uncle Donnie.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to be the first one.&quot; So, &gt;&gt; talk about and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak. &gt;&gt; Yep. That is president&#x27;s daughter-in-law. Now, let&#x27;s see. So, after Obama said that, this is what Trump said.</p>
<p>Roll it. Barack Obama said that aliens are real. Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to Earth? &gt;&gt; Well, he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that. You know, information.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that. You know, &gt;&gt; the aliens are real. &gt;&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean, that &gt;&gt; in other words, that confirms it because what Obama said was aliens are real. And apparently according to Trump that is classified information and he&#x27;s not supposed to give that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh yeah. I mean you don&#x27;t necessarily need the government to confirm but uh you need the government to confirm.</p>
<p>I guess &gt;&gt; you made you made a big mistake. You took it out of class to write information. No, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. &gt;&gt; She&#x27;s just smiling in the back.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, Peter? Well, if the president can declassify anything that he wants to, so get him out of trouble. I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. &gt;&gt; I may get Obama out of trouble by declassifying.</p>
<p>And then right after this is the the post Trump made which I just read you guys. Insane timeline. Insane timeline. And yeah, let me just play this quickly here. So the sound might be copyrighted there, but this now notice also this is the body.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is the body of that alien. Yeah, sorry guys. I uh if I play the video will get copyrighted because of the background music. Uh so yeah, so apparently this guy claimed to be the Area 51 scientist. Uh I guess some believed this, some didn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Uh, and he was apparently he&#x27;s considered to be one of the first, if I&#x27;m if I&#x27;m not mistaken, the first, but I would say one of the first, I believe, one of the first to reveal that image of that alien. Uh, the feet, the alien toes right there. Insane, right? What if this was actually real, bro? What if this is how they look like or at least one of the species? Uh, we did not believe in it, I guess, then, but now everything that&#x27;s coming out, it&#x27;s kind of batshit crazy. Another factor is another thing to consider here is Obama said he&#x27;s not uh he never heard about like underground facilities are Area 51 and the aliens are not at Area 51 unless there&#x27;s a massive conspiracy. So he keeps that open.</p>
<p>He has let that open loophole right cuz it might be real and he doesn&#x27;t know which is very very possible as you heard from Dr. Steven Greer that he might have not been read into it because the president is a temporary employee. And you also got to factor in Bob Lazar. He&#x27;s considered appreciate to subscribe and welcome on and appreciate it, brother. Uh yeah, and uh Bob Lazar is considered to be one of the best whistleblowers of all time.</p>
<p>One of the most trustworthy, right? A lot of people believe in him that he&#x27;s like legit legit. He claimed to have worked at S4 at Area 51. He also claimed that at one point when he walked outside, he saw nine UFOs in the hangers lined up like tech lined up and you could have seen all of them if you were standing at one specific uh location. He also has claimed to go inside at least one of the UFOs and said that when he went inside it was an very ominous feeling and everything looked the same, right? No wires, nothing like that. So they were trying to learn and figure it out.</p>
<p>There were different compartments and everybody uh had like a you know one mate you know just just a group of two and they were not allowed to speak with another group. Okay. And there were commies as well there. They kicked him out right because apparently they found out something about the aliens and the UFOs and they didn&#x27;t wanted the commies finding out. So they kicked him out.</p>
<p>We heard that on the the Joe Rogan podcast. Uh yeah. So there were compartments right and uh Basar also claimed that he was read into this Zeta reticulized star system that the spe one of their species comes from that star system. So there were a whole lot of this and that uh that came out from Bob Lazar which was very very interesting and people believed in him uh and people believe in him and uh so basically the point is and then we had whistleblowers after word coming out saying that yep uh Area 51 got too big too quick. People heard about it.</p>
<p>Everybody knows or think they know about aliens being there. So they had to move them out to another location. So, aliens and UFOs are no longer at Area 51. That&#x27;s what we heard a couple of years ago because it got too big too quick. Uh, everybody found out.</p>
<p>So, perhaps it is true that they&#x27;re no longer there, but they used to be at one point if you want to believe Bob Lazar story. So, that happened. BUT NOW, MOVING ON. CHECK THIS OUT. ROLL IT.</p>
<p>Trump said in just the span of only days, we had those on the left and the right going on podcast talking about the existence of quote unquote aliens. I have been doing this for a long time. Well, before I had even gotten onto YouTube, even going back to when I can remember 03, 04, I was out there in the streets talking to people trying to tell people pretty much what I&#x27;m talking about today because there&#x27;s really nothing new under the sun. The reason why I didn&#x27;t make videos back then was because I have a lisp. I have a Jersey accent, so I was pronouncing words weird.</p>
<p>So, that was like the perfect storm of sounding bad on camera. But now, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t care. &gt;&gt; Yeah. For me, uh, the way I got into UFOs and all that was, uh, you know, the question that everybody have, are we alone in the universe or not? And I was making like gaming videos at the time. I still do now here and there, but it&#x27;s very much like limited because gaming is no longer the same for me, right? It&#x27;s not that good.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m still waiting for GTSX, so we&#x27;re going to get back to it. But I know a lot of you guys are here for the UFO content. You don&#x27;t care about gaming. Don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;re still going to do UFO content. But the way I got into it, questioning and secondly, Secure Team 10, bro, like he used to make UFO videos daily on a daily basis back in the days and he was probably the biggest channel at that time that was covering UFO content and yeah, it was very very interesting.</p>
<p>So I got into that because of uh Secure Team. I was I was making gaming videos on the on my channel though, but I was watching his content on UFOs and uh digging up and uh researching stuff on my own, too. So, but the reason why I bring that up happens to be because talking to people even back then, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, there are quite a few people out there that believe that the government, they are the ones behind this alien agenda and what we are led to believe are aliens are something a whole lot more. Flash forward to today, there is that aspect to it as well. For example, the TR3B, the Black Manta.</p>
<p>Apparently, that&#x27;s the reverse engineered UFO craft. Apparently, aliens are real. UFOs are real. But that craft that you see most of the time is basically us, the US military controlling it either by being inside it or controlling it like a drone. I guess one day we&#x27;ll know &gt;&gt; today.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;re seeing it play out in real time. And I still have people leaving me comments saying, &quot;Well, how can you not believe in aliens out of all these planets out there, all out of all these different stars? Something else has to exist.&quot; And I can get &gt;&gt; I mean, everybody got their beliefs, bro. You know, I believe that we&#x27;re not alone, but maybe you do believe that we&#x27;re alone, right? And people believe that it might be angels or demons. And you know, everybody got their faith. Everybody got their faith.</p>
<p>Simple as that. So, let&#x27;s find out. &gt;&gt; Get into the biblical stars. Something else has to exist. And I can get into the biblical aspect of it.</p>
<p>These same people will just roll their eyes. And I&#x27;m like, okay, well, if you don&#x27;t want to talk about the biblical aspect of it, well, just look at the timing. We have this clear ramp up of talks about UFOs and aliens not just from the media which is still owned and operated by the three-letter organization but also from the government as well just right before their 2031 world United Nations agenda where the World Economic Forum and the United Nations are coming together to have all these countries to follow one role one law. We have Larry the lizard &gt;&gt; plus THE LIZARD GET THE LIZARD PEOPLE plus the the the project blue balls project blue beam you got to factor in that too. I do believe aliens are real but are we going to get like the real alien disclosure? Uh for that one I guess guys we have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Gather to have all these countries to follow one rule one law. We have Larry the lizard king the current leader of the world economic forum constantly talking about the tokenization of all assets. Well, what do we hear just a few weeks ago, and this is coming from the United Kingdom, not the United States, that once Trump gives a speech and he goes ahead and reveals aliens that it&#x27;s going to &gt;&gt; UP UAP disclosure is likely to induce ontological shock. Okay, what does that on? Okay, good word. I mean, new word to me.</p>
<p>Uh, shock and provoke psychological responses with material consequences. She said, remember fellas, the dildo of consequences never comes with loop. going to go ahead and crash the economy that the bank and reveals aliens that it&#x27;s going to go ahead and crash the economy that the banks have to prepare. Flash forward. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we heard that, right? And he&#x27;s referring to the the Bank of England coming out and I made a video on it too and I saw a lot of you guys responses and a lot of you guys were also like, &quot;Hey, how is it going to uh crash the economy?&quot; Some of you believe it&#x27;s going to, some of you don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>The uh listen, we don&#x27;t know if it will crash the economy. And a lot of people were also saying that yeah like they they want to crash it on purpose. It&#x27;s not because of aliens because how can aliens crash our economy. No, totally makes sense, right? Valid point. Valid point.</p>
<p>Now the reason if it crashes, right? If it crashes, it&#x27;s probably going to be how Trump announces this thing or whoever comes out tomorrow and announces it uh and does a full disclosure on like a government level. the it&#x27;s going to really depend on the the the word choice. Okay, the if for example, right, if Trump comes out tomorrow and says that aliens are real, it&#x27;s fine. Nothing is good or I mean everything is fine. Everything is good.</p>
<p>Then nothing will happen to the stock market and to the our economy. Everything will be smooth. Everything will be fine. We&#x27;ll see certain stocks rise up like Lock Heed perhaps, right? Uh not a financial advice though, but you know Lockheed, Skunk Works, apparently they are known to be making weapons. Okay, they are also behind reverse engineering their UFO crafts and all that.</p>
<p>You probably heard the conspiracies and all that. So yeah, it&#x27;s likely that their stock will go up like crazy even if we have bad news. But if Trump, not a financial advice, I don&#x27;t know. Nobody knows what will happen. Okay, maybe it&#x27;s going to crash.</p>
<p>Okay, nobody knows. But if Trump comes out and says that, yeah, we&#x27;re uh it&#x27;s a national security, national threat, international threat, global threat, aliens are real, but uh yeah, it&#x27;s a threat and we&#x27;re, you know, working on new tech, this that the other so we can nuke them this that. So, I&#x27;m obviously exaggerating, but I guess you get the point. If something like that happens, chances are very high the stock market will crash for the limited time. Then it will get back up.</p>
<p>if nothing happens, uh, if it&#x27;s the end of the world, end of end end of the world kind of situation, then obviously it will crash and it won&#x27;t go it won&#x27;t go back up. But I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to get to that level, I don&#x27;t think Trump is going to announce it in that way. But Bank of England saying that just a couple of weeks ago is pretty wild. Everything that is unfolding, it seems like that everything is ramping up. I mean that&#x27;s the the that&#x27;s what we have been noticing ever since like 2017 when Pentagon confirmed those leaked UFO videos were legit ever since then it&#x27;s just like they&#x27;re ramping it up.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re ramping it up and now it&#x27;s so ramped up to the point where president the current president former presidents own like leftwing, rightwing, everybody&#x27;s talking. Everybody&#x27;s talking. EP files coming out. So that is massive too. Whistleblower whistleblowers going apehit.</p>
<p>Everybody&#x27;s talking about it. What the hell is going on? Exciting times, but also kind of like uh vulnerable times as well with the WW3 rumors rising, but they rise every time. Just a couple weeks later, we have all these sources now coming out talking about how Trump has a speech prepared to not just talk about but also disclose UFOs and aliens. How is that just a mere coincidence? Because you have to ask yourself, why would the revelation of UFOs and aliens crash the economy? That doesn&#x27;t make any sense whatsoever. Let&#x27;s just play with the idea that Trump has a speech prepared and he says that, &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;ve known about UFOs and aliens.</p>
<p>The government, they haven&#x27;t interacted with aliens. Why would that crash the economy unless they have a major event prepared a false flag involving these so-called aliens? &gt;&gt; Project Blue Beam. And yeah, like if for example, guys, like if we good point, valid point though. Why would it crash? Because if they do like a if Trump comes out and just just say aliens are real. Yeah, nothing will happen, bro.</p>
<p>Stocks won&#x27;t crash. Maybe Lockheed stock will actually go up because of the hype, the excitement, you know, and like that and other like war stocks or other like you know stocks like that, they might go up. But if we see little green men come down with their pew pews, ray guns and all that, wow, it will crash the stock market completely, bro. That would pretty much restart everything, including the economy. And this is where we get the tokenization of all assets.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&#x27;t doubt one bit too that they&#x27;re going to go ahead and come out and say that a lot of the people walking among us are not even human. They are aliens in disguise. And this is where the digital ID is going to come into play. In order to prove you&#x27;re fully human, you must comply with the digital ID. Now, before &gt;&gt; so many conspiracies, bro, you probably if you&#x27;re a conspiratorial nut, you&#x27;re hearing that and cuz like I&#x27;m hearing that and so many conspiracies are spawning in and we have seen so many conspiracies come true in the past 6 months.</p>
<p>Uh, even with the EP files, I don&#x27;t want to say his name because this is a UFO video. Uh, so I don&#x27;t want this video to get labeled with that stuff on YouTube. It&#x27;s very sensitive, right? So, uh, but I do cover that, but like this video ain&#x27;t about that. So, yeah. Right.</p>
<p>Um, crazy timeline. Holy holy smoke is ain&#x27;t no dang joke cuz one world government uh, you know, blue beam project blue balls 2030, you know, smart cities, right? One currency, uh, and all that. No, pretty nuts, man. pretty nuts. What are they going to do? False event.</p>
<p>2027, we also covered this. 2027 is the disclosure year. One of the XCI guy came out couple of months ago. Uh he said the same. We also had Jeremy Corbel saying that he heard this.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, take it as rumors, guys. Not confirmed. Nothing is confirmed, right? Take it as rumors. He he him saying that there&#x27;s apparently a fake. It&#x27;s all fake.</p>
<p>It is all fake. But they&#x27;re going to come out and tell you that there&#x27;s a UFO mother ship approaching Earth in 2027. Then we had the threeey atlas situation, but that came and went, right? Nothing really happened with that. Or maybe something happened, but as far as I&#x27;m as far as we know, they they said nothing on it. So, we had that, but apparently 2027 is the big year.</p>
<p>Maybe it is. &gt;&gt; Anybody says that sounds absolutely crazy now. Sounds like I&#x27;m going off the deep end. Hold on a second because Sam Alman actually has something like that to prove you&#x27;re a human called a world ID where you go ahead and scan your eyeball and you give them all this data and once they prove you&#x27;re a human then they&#x27;ll go ahead and give you this world coin a cryptocurrency where you can go ahead and buy and sell. Now, and I&#x27;ve spoken about this before, as of 2026, crazy enough, close to 18 million people have scanned their eyeballs and have a verified World ID.</p>
<p>And these orbs that you look into and scan your eyeball, they are expanding rapidly. Now, yes, just to clarify, this world ID is to prove you&#x27;re a human versus a computer versus an AI. But what if this is a test run? And with your world tokens, your world coins, you can sell them for digital dollars. You can buy digital gifts. you can exchange them for other currencies.</p>
<p>So, it definitely seems like one giant test run. And so many people are going to go ahead and comply. And for a couple years, I have been noticing they have been using news and media. &gt;&gt; Intelligent alien dinosaurs what could be hiding underground &gt;&gt; to sell the idea that these aliens are walking among us. Take for example this video from the very shady TMZ.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Have you ever heard of cryptoterrestrials? You know, everybody talks about um aliens coming from space &gt;&gt; and then disappearing. What if they&#x27;re actually living among us right now? &gt;&gt; Sounds like an old science fiction movie, but a study out of Harvard finds that aliens might be living among us. Harvard University&#x27;s human flourishing program speculates UFOs may be spaceships visiting alien friends planted on Earth. Planted right here on Earth, that is. Those aliens then are disguised as humans trying to fit in.</p>
<p>Yeah, man. Check this video out. We done a massive video on the new findings and the new stuff that is coming out. Uh we also got tons of UFO signing videos in this too.</p>
