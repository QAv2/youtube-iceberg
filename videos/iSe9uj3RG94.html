            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>whole thing yeah you know what we say in construction don&#x27;t you just do something even if it&#x27;s wrong you know i heard caulking pain make what it ain&#x27;t what do you call it what did you say you and paint and make it what it ain&#x27;t oh and paint yeah yeah i&#x27;m just you know just bad construction uh yeah no yeah yeah yeah so i&#x27;m here with alexei novitskiy you know i i think it&#x27;s interesting how you pronounce your pronounce your name well i mean the proper way is alex novitskiy alex say novitskiy yup saying like yeah you&#x27;re dealing with tennessee in here so you gotta really you know talk slow and i&#x27;m just kidding [Laughter] uh alex alexei and i need to remember russian right i like say not yep yep and then the nicknames like alyosha so like a lucia or lucious you know lucious would be easier but i mean that&#x27;s what everybody calls me basically oh really alicia that sounds uh exotic i like that i&#x27;ve had that since high school like high school soccer it was way easier to say for people but we we&#x27;re we&#x27;re here without our partner crime chris lato he was we were hoping he could be with us and he may be at some point in time but uh i tried to get all three of us together on this today it&#x27;s difficult you have people all over the world and you&#x27;re trying to get them together at one point in time it&#x27;s difficult but um we we had this idea or actually came all this whole idea came out of um lucious&#x27;s delicious book which i have you should buy this book and uh i always forget oh the infinite pool of ex i can&#x27;t read experiencing awareness well what happens is my eyes get used to this bright monitor and then i look at a dark book and i can&#x27;t see it that&#x27;s what happens when you do cad work your entire life your eyes feel bad but um so anyway what do you what would you say this is about i like i i named it magic squares and electro dramatic uh pulse pulse blimps right how would you describe this uh how would you summarize this video well i guess we&#x27;re gonna talk about magic squares and just you know theoretical ways to make them and what they could do right so i know and i won&#x27;t i want everybody to be patient with me because i&#x27;m kind of a geek geek when it comes to this kind i like getting into the little bit of the details so what i thought alexander doing was being patient with me and helping me lay this out uh on an actual size model that we could literally build right so let&#x27;s say i&#x27;m gonna say this is three quarter inch plywood okay so i&#x27;m looking do you think that that would be something i can get my hands on really easily and then i&#x27;m gonna make a group out of that oh yeah and i mean if you really had to you could you could make a box you know just kind of get a 2x4 and trim it up around the edge and then put another layer on top of that and then fill the whole thing with concrete if you even wanted to say that again if you wanted to build it up a little bit right because we want to stick some iron rods into this thing oh i was thinking i was thinking about drilling taking like a forstner bit you know would be and drilling the holes in it right but so this has got to be so the squares have to be six inches right because that&#x27;s four well we&#x27;re gonna need we&#x27;re gonna need to divide into four equal sections depending on however big you make it all right so that&#x27;s uh six inches i can hit mine and then so basically i need to actually go in here and edit this now while i was here with my my you know you always have this playing and your playing your vision hardly ever works out the way you think it&#x27;s going to work out right what i&#x27;ll happen is that you could talk about concepts or and help me think about dimensions while on doing it so people would be bored they probably want to hear more from you than than me but what i was going to do is put these squares on here so the magic square can you tell talk about the concept of the magic square how we have the these let&#x27;s see i have a model on my screen if you want to if that if you want me to pull that up real quick yeah i&#x27;m going to go back and i&#x27;ll while i&#x27;m drawing that and i&#x27;m uh i will add years to the stream what i did was i figured this would even be easier i just opened up my book the fifth dimension uh so what you see right now on the screen is basically just a peg board right and so this is kind of what tony&#x27;s drawing up right now um a simple 4x4 pegboard that you have iron rods sticking up in the middle of right and what we&#x27;re going to end up doing is wrapping these with a specific number of coils so that way when you run electricity through it basically the uniform you&#x27;re going to have non-uniform input because each each rod is going to have a different number of coils but on the outer edge you&#x27;re going to have a uniform output right so all those are going to add almost like throwing pebbles into water but electromagnetically and they&#x27;re going to add to make one uniform wave on the outside meanwhile making a vortex in the center so that&#x27;s kind of what we&#x27;re drawing up right now let me go back to mine just for a second yep this is what&#x27;s going to be fun about this we can go back and forth did we decide on that like a half inch uh rod and these could be could they like be like conduits in other words they could be hollow or do they need to be solid well i think solids the best and honestly i think um the bigger the better how big is the the grid the the entire size of your grid and this is these are four inch squares oh well that&#x27;s important what&#x27;s that i&#x27;m just thinking um you&#x27;d probably want it to be at least a fourth of the square so i know but how am i gonna get how am i gonna get two inch diameter rods though um you get those you know from the steel guys over at tampa bay steel that&#x27;s how we got that&#x27;s how we&#x27;re not talking about the kind it does don&#x27;t cost a million dollars hey you just get these rods and you you know but yeah i would i don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d want steel you probably want more like solid iron you know something that&#x27;s when i say steel i&#x27;m talking yeah i&#x27;m talking about iron yeah exactly solid iron rods so i&#x27;m pretty well but again i can cut uh i can cut steel or copper you can&#x27;t use copper there&#x27;s there&#x27;s um what&#x27;s what&#x27;s the word diamagnetic versus magnetic right and so you want your material to be magnetic oh so you don&#x27;t so the so you&#x27;re not just looking for something that&#x27;s um current can run through you&#x27;re no no well so diet i don&#x27;t know if you would if you could honestly i don&#x27;t know if you could use diet magnetic i think it would be safer using magnetic so going with the iron core instead of okay so i&#x27;m just going to go on faith that i can find a 2 inch basically metals that aren&#x27;t magnetic are diamagnetic and so they they create the opposite of the field that you&#x27;re trying to create so you&#x27;re right we might have to pour some kind of lightweight we might have to have an indention for these and then pour some kind of concrete around so we build that box up right we make it like a two foot or a foot tall box and well if that&#x27;s only four inches you know it depends how big the whole thing is right i mean well that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what we were yeah that&#x27;s what i was kind of getting to what kind of scale i&#x27;d like to make one that i can build easily to scale let&#x27;s imagine let&#x27;s imagine that&#x27;s four foot by four foot okay just just for drawing i&#x27;m not i&#x27;m not going to imagine it i&#x27;m going to make it okay so i&#x27;m not i&#x27;m not i&#x27;m going to make it four feet where is that connected to oh i know what it&#x27;s i don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s doing well because that would make it all right all i gotta do is scale this up by two it won&#x27;t be four feet right so each one of those squares represents one foot right yes so now i need to i need to get rid of this thing let&#x27;s see so that&#x27;s like a 12 inch let me explode this so i don&#x27;t have to deal with all that what&#x27;s that don&#x27;t want to do that what i&#x27;ve been seeing now that&#x27;s why i want you see that&#x27;s a good example of why i want to start out with the right scale because now that that thing turned into a four inch cylinder and i scaled it twice right so that&#x27;s right it doesn&#x27;t the rod diameter is important but it also you know all the factors are important so the bigger rod you have you know you could use a different current well you know so it all varies thinner rod you need more current i know but if i if i make this thing so that i have to use you know 480 volts or something i ain&#x27;t going to be able to do it that&#x27;s just a couple car batteries that&#x27;s 40 i said 480 volts that&#x27;s just a couple lemons all you need is a whole bunch of lemons yeah you know and you you wire them together you can do it now so now if we&#x27;re going to use one let&#x27;s see that would be there&#x27;s your that&#x27;s the size and then i&#x27;m going to bring them up 12. well they&#x27;re not going to be that long are they they&#x27;re not going to need to be that long well the biggest coil is 16 turns so it really has to do with the thickness of the diameter of the coils but that&#x27;s 16 is very general right that&#x27;s a 16 is a a relative ratio of number of turns so if instead of we use one if we use like six as our starting number we need to use six times 16 for the 16 spot right so it&#x27;s all relative as far as like number of turns so yeah again i&#x27;m trying to make something i can actually build right well within the affordable range right like kind of no that&#x27;s what i mean so yeah yeah exactly so right now it&#x27;s already pretty i mean what what&#x27;s affordable these days you know well i&#x27;m not too much iron frogs but we&#x27;re we&#x27;re just drawing here that you could probably go to an old rail road um site like an old junkyard and find railroad and get and get the track right that&#x27;s metal what&#x27;s that steel what are those made out of those are probably steel arms but those have that weird shape to them don&#x27;t you yeah i mean just it&#x27;s a weird shape now you got to deal with that so then what we would have is our coils let&#x27;s see let me get this over here i&#x27;m just going to bring this down and i&#x27;m going to kind of do some of this kind of rough just to show because i don&#x27;t you know i know people are going to get really bored if i if i do too much of this but what i probably should have done was make the coil after but i wanted i want to do i just wanted to demonstrate so this is going to be that i can show off these other concepts you know i i have them 3d printed so right behind me let me picture oh you want to do a screen share um i was just going to show okay i can make your i can make i can put you by yourself okay i&#x27;ll talk a little bit just for fun whatever see and then oh oh no okay good you lost me for a second though uh how do i put you by yourself uh we can do this or okay i think that&#x27;s as best i can do okay yeah let me uh go to full screen there okay so basically um what i have is a 3d printer and you saw that i like to draw up random magic squares and stuff like that and so these are just a couple um they are not working but actually i mean this one works so this is a magic square that you literally fill with water or any type of material okay so you can basically it naturally based off of the manifestation of the matter that&#x27;s going inside of it naturally creates its own waves so i was just thinking that maybe if you filled up some material with the proper ratios it could have some effect you know just an idea kind of messing around and then here&#x27;s another concept where basically i already printed a whole bunch of pegs and i wired this up i wrapped it up with the proper ratios you know um if you wanted to look at the numbers you have one and then you can see the one goes to the two goes to the three goes to the four and then the wires wrap around the back on this model but this is not working i would need to have some metal pegs coming through there in order to make this an actual little handheld size working magic square um but then to go through the natural manifestation of matter in the universe i went ahead and printed um a series of pyramids as well i don&#x27;t have my biggest one with me apparently but you can see this is four right four pyramids here and then this one is 16 pyramids and then this one is 30 uh 60 no 32 pyramids or 16 i don&#x27;t know i&#x27;d have to count but basically by stocking pyramids or stocking magic squares you can also have effects right so there would also be one more big pyramid up here um so just some things i didn&#x27;t know probably i don&#x27;t know one thing one thing that just occurred to me is we didn&#x27;t talk about the um some people may not understand that the the magic square the reason it&#x27;s magical is because of the numerology basically right i mean that came to me like it&#x27;s the whole like i studied astronomy in school but now i&#x27;m talking almost astrology i ran into magic squares based off of very you know sound mathematical principles now it&#x27;s going back to like that ancient stuff that you&#x27;re talking about i don&#x27;t mean like numerology as in magic i&#x27;m talking about numerology as in each like across they add it to be uh 34 and down they end up to be there so for that i have my book ready for a screen share let me do that okay let me go back here share screen window my books right there bam let me know when the book&#x27;s up on the screen yeah okay so basically the magic square that uh we&#x27;re mimicking here is this one that i have that i have um highlighted let me see there we go so basically you can see all the numbers that are added so it goes one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen by adding it in this fashion literally every vertical adds up to thirty four every horizontal as of 34 but this one&#x27;s even more special because every four corner sets adds up to 34. so on in this section i have them all color coded you can see every horizontal every vertical um and this square that i&#x27;m looking at right now it&#x27;s basically these two and these two add up to 34 the four in the middle out to 34 the four corners and then the two opposite crosses right here you have the two x&#x27;s and then the two diagonal sets add up to 34. um so that&#x27;s basically a perfect magic square meaning the only thing that still manifests within our physical reality is the switching pattern of one two three four five six seven eight nine ten which ends up so here i have them drawn out where you can see one two three four you can see five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen fifteen sixteen or 14 15 16. and so when you you kind of draw those all out they make this pattern and that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s left because everything is else is canceled out equaling the 34.</p>
<p>and so when you look at that going through time you see that it makes a scalar vortex right and so that&#x27;s essentially how infinite creations can be made from the concept of a magic square but what we&#x27;re doing right now is basically making an electromagnetically powered square which is something like this and so doing this you&#x27;re able to actually warp space-time it&#x27;s almost like having a bucket of water and you&#x27;re making a whirlpool with a bucket of water but you&#x27;re doing electromagnetically with the raw energy of experience and so therefore you can create energetic vortices that can stretch essentially the fabric of space-time and make potentially effects such as like time dilations um density control meaning like levitation effects and even potentially the telescoping of conscious experiences because each conscious harmonic is related to a different flow of space and so if you&#x27;re standing inside one of those literally your consciousness will be experiencing a different flow of space so that&#x27;s basically the concept behind magic squares and you know we&#x27;re really just literally unlocking um the potential behind them and when it comes to craft that have been made with magic squares in the past there was a man named john searle we&#x27;ve spoken about him in previous podcast and he basically used the concept of the magic square in order to make um the serial enter effect generator which was the power source for his flying disc so there there&#x27;s definitely something behind the magic squares let me and maybe one thing we could do to demonstrate this is let me pull up i&#x27;m showing that um let me move this little coil so what i did was i got i went ahead and put all the numbers the relative you know numbers in the corner of each uh quadrant or whatever yep and so what what you were talking about earlier is that the effect that the you were talking about how that that i wonder if it isn&#x27;t that is that the radius of it where it where it touches the corners i really think that depends on the amperage that we end up using right like how big and where they end up meeting it i think it is going to be similar to there and i think it has a lot to do with that one whenever we make that one is what everything else almost needs to match up to but the one needs to be outside of its own radius right because if you look at the two the two needs to be able to add to the corner as well almost so the furthest the two right so i think that i thought it was that the i thought that um well the 16 is going to have the largest radius right exactly 16 is going to have a huge one but then when you look at the opposite corner the 15 is right there as well as a 12. so the two like the 15 and the 12 are going to be able to mimic the effect of the 16 almost so this is what we were talking about earlier before we started is that we would have to know the radius of each of these um well all the rods would be the same and we and the i mean the radius of the electromagnetic uh field so so you have that equation that you found right for that yeah yeah i mean if you want to show that off real quick we can talk about that you know exactly that&#x27;s really what it comes down to i thought you you said you took a screenshot i took a photo on my cat with my camera because i remember it was h equals i times n over two pi r that&#x27;s what i remember in my head does that make sense h is equal to i times n over k and then h is also equal to i over 2 pi r but the one that we need is really the for the coil of wire which is like i times n divided by l where l is the length of your coil i is the current and n is the number of turns it&#x27;s a very simple um equation that&#x27;ll just give us a general idea what i should have done i think what i&#x27;m going to do i&#x27;m going to put my center points back on here and then we can draw we can get rid of the rods for a second and just draw some like dude like if we just took two squares and did the math on them and that was because l l is a constant in this equation right the the length of the well actually no l is not a constant l is changing in every one of them um but by the way that&#x27;s the length of the coil not the length of the rod right it&#x27;s the length of the coil so in this this equation it&#x27;s almost equivalent to the number of turns in a way because if we say that the coil length you know is directly uh related to the number of turns and we&#x27;re just kind of doing relationships and ratios the length is going to end up being the same though for almost every every it&#x27;s like uh just it ends up being a something we can almost just like toss out so what i was what i was going to do is um let me put this i&#x27;m going to delete this for a second so if we had if we just did one if we did a ratio one one would be an easy math problem right so if we did um let&#x27;s just say we had 12 volts or you know you could do 48 volts whatever because i want i want this to be something we can actually do right so i&#x27;m not looking at the equation what was it i times uh i times n i i times n divided by l is equal to h so i i is 48 times n was the number of coils one one and let&#x27;s make h equal to 34. what&#x27;s that let&#x27;s make h equal to 34. now that would be the the radius uh is that that&#x27;s the radius right right never mind never mind never mind um so for that one we have h equal to i over 2 pie r so basically you have 48 let&#x27;s see to i have to turn my iphone sideways to get that kind of math don&#x27;t worry okay let&#x27;s see you have 48 times well it&#x27;s just one in this case i&#x27;m not sure if this is what we&#x27;re looking for oh there it is squared 3.1415 thing that sounds like wait a minute that sounds like pi 3.14159 see we need them we need to we need a math quiz that&#x27;s why that&#x27;s that&#x27;s why i thought chris could help us hmm but then i then i&#x27;m saying what are what are the units um did i lose you again did you did i lose you again oh sorry no no i&#x27;m here i&#x27;m i&#x27;m staring at this thing right here i just don&#x27;t like how it&#x27;s because i think these are for different uh i&#x27;m not sure okay i&#x27;m sorry we had we had some technical difficulties before we started and i thought that happened again that was that was weird right i guess i guess what i&#x27;m trying to i&#x27;m trying to figure out is you know um it would be if we knew the math we could just draw you know this value and then we could draw this value and see how they over right i guess we could just it&#x27;s going to be relative right so if we just that&#x27;s what i was kind of getting at it&#x27;s all going to be relative in a way if we said one is one and then we said this would be 60. that doesn&#x27;t make any sense does it that would be 15.</p>
<p>oh i was going 1 times 4. i was saying one that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a six inch radius that&#x27;s one so you&#x27;re saying do one one one is the radius okay yeah so that&#x27;s one this is 15 but this is 14. i don&#x27;t want to lose my place here four exactly well that one no that&#x27;s funny that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s funny that ends up being there probably what i should have done was uh seven oh look eight oh look that one over that overlaps this one hey 10 11 yeah i don&#x27;t think i was trying to be too technical right i was trying to do the math on the current and all that but really like you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s going to be relative to you yeah i think it&#x27;s right now just for kind of for fun and for you know today or whatever we can just do this but this will give people a really good idea of what&#x27;s happening i just don&#x27;t like the equation in this one because it says h here but it doesn&#x27;t give me the radius on the coil of wire method it only gives me the radius on the straight conductor so i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s appropriate to use h equal to h for coil of wire you know using this well and we here in my point is this well it&#x27;s still going to be relative i was going to say i know there i know the electromagnetic field radius is going to be bigger but it does it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s still kind of relative isn&#x27;t it i mean so if we started here and then we went to here yeah and so what we need to do is add all of those i don&#x27;t think we made those big enough right like realistically well i just you i was that&#x27;s what i was wondering what are the units you know because i&#x27;m using you i&#x27;m using inches as units uh well like a magnetic force is typically done with like what a tesla or something i don&#x27;t exactly know off the top of my head yeah at this moment i&#x27;d have to look into it a little bit in my rod scale i turned them off what was the um the other thing that i had that that i was i thought was kind of neat was that let me go back to you now let me go back here um there&#x27;s vanessa kitty out in the youtube world what was the electro grab grabatic um blind thing what was that basically you can use electrogravitics to kind of like manipulate um the electric field that exists or like the the energy around an object uh basically that means you with electricity you can manipulate gravity um or like location rather because it&#x27;s not really manipulating gravity it&#x27;s more of like location manipulation is the way i think of it because you have that you know you have energy coming from the outside and if you create a lower voltage here versus a higher voltage here basically you have like a voltage potential and it it shifts the things and so let me just show you real quick what i&#x27;m talking about okay yeah i mean i&#x27;m just doing a simple google search here called lifter technology i&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called yeah and i&#x27;ll just go to these images alright so we can do a screen share at this point let&#x27;s see let me do a stop share do a new share for you all right can you see this page so basically a lifter in short is trying to find a good model but basically this is a really good idea right here where the bottom is really really thin foil and the top is like a thin wire right so the surface of these yeah i&#x27;ve seen these so it&#x27;s all about the surface area really like the surface area on the bottom side of the capacitor is way bigger than the top and as the flow of electrons goes from one side to the other it basically can create what they say like an ion wind at lower voltages within the atmosphere but what people in the you could say unknown physics world say is that when you hit a million volts you actually do create a thing where you start altering the manifestation of it like it creates like a glow and um so what kind of voltage they&#x27;re running through those that you see lift actually lift i forget off the top of my head this can you see this picture this is the best thing you know one of the best pictures that i&#x27;ve used that shows it so like literally you have thin aluminum sheet 200 millimeters you know main electrode negative thin copper wire positive pull 30 millimeter gap and then little bolsa wood legs and also with supports right because you don&#x27;t want any metal connecting the two you want those to be connected with balsa and then yeah bolsters like lightweight wood makes you know decent structures for like toys and stuff and um yeah then you run a current you know one you hook up one side and you hook up the other side and let&#x27;s see if he has more of that here just so you guys can see i&#x27;m at linus.org mirrorslash but here here he&#x27;s drawing up the whole thing you can copy if you if you copy the url i can put it in the chat i&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll keep it open that way we can do it okay yeah oh there that&#x27;s one that&#x27;s when i was wondering what kind of voltage is he running through exactly so here you can see your lifter is now ready for testing you need only to connect your hive voltage power supply hv i&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s high voltage 30 to 40 kilovolts you see it up here on the top no i can&#x27;t see oh 30 to 40 kilovolts yep holy cow yeah 30 000 volts 40 000 volts yeah so once you get to a million volts is when the thing actually starts doing like real electrogravitics at this point from what i understand you&#x27;re basically making the eye on wind so like when you look it up and people kind of always debunk the electro gravitics they say it&#x27;s ion wind it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re keeping their voltage under a million volts but like people like jon searle literally say like once you hit a million volts that&#x27;s when you get electrocutic um and that might just be what they&#x27;re saying i mean i&#x27;ve never gotten to a million volts on anything like this i did 6000 volts but i didn&#x27;t make it right one time and you know i felt that did you have you seen the uh you you reminded me of the the new the thruster technology they&#x27;re they&#x27;re going to be testing on the dart you know the the saddle the satellite they&#x27;re going to crash into the the the asteroid it&#x27;s an ion thruster did you i don&#x27;t know i haven&#x27;t seen that but i i um it might be somewhere i really don&#x27;t know they they&#x27;re creating you know with electricity they&#x27;re creating um the ion gas but uh i guess it&#x27;s uh is there hydrogen in there somewhere anyway it&#x27;s a solid they&#x27;re using solid fuels and they&#x27;re testing it for like smaller spacecraft you know like for the cubes you know right yeah anyway anyway sorry i need to get off i don&#x27;t even need to go down around the hole i just i haven&#x27;t looked into those when you sit on thruster i was like hey yeah i just read an article about that um yeah i mean that&#x27;s basically ion propulsion is what a lot of people say for the election for that system you know the one that i just showed you is basically ion propulsion so you know apparently they were using like xenon before but [Music] i guess it has to be carried in gas form or but the ion thrusters can be you know a solid type fuel but uh anyway that that&#x27;s interesting i i wonder where you would get a power supply like that i guess you can you can order one the ones that we were just looking at yeah yeah so um i found a power supply that wasn&#x27;t enough but it was close it came from one of those neon lights like i know i know yeah i know the neon lights i just never really thought about the power supply they&#x27;ve got like six thousand seven thousand volts in them that&#x27;s not i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really what you want more than that you know if you&#x27;re actually going to do it right so the idea behind this um if i go back to this the idea is that um basically these co the coils produce this select this field electromagnetic field right and and then neon transformer somebody in the comments um exactly the neon transformer that&#x27;s funny yeah yeah um i shocked myself and at that point you shocked yourself yeah i&#x27;ve shocked myself plenty of times doing electrical work without turning breakers off like a dummy but well i didn&#x27;t i had to wire straight into a lifter like what you guys just saw and i i don&#x27;t know if i was too close to it or it wasn&#x27;t grounded properly or wet but when i pulled the string on it i felt you know i felt the shock and i just unplugged the thing right away and kind of it&#x27;s like i&#x27;m good for feels good for now yeah i don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever done this if you&#x27;ve ever asked the question is this hot and then you grab it and yes that&#x27;s hot it&#x27;s kind of like that i did that a lot once like a dummy but uh i guess at some point these these electromagnetic fields interact with each other and you&#x27;re saying they create some kind of vortex well yeah i mean if you go back to that sketch you had going actually where you almost had them looking like little drops of water um that&#x27;s really the best way to to show it i think that we didn&#x27;t draw those rings big enough though honestly well let&#x27;s let me turn these uh rocks off i want i&#x27;m just trying to figure out what um what scale would you use when you say they&#x27;re not big enough um they&#x27;re still like this one&#x27;s still going to be 15 times bigger than that one right yeah but is it a so that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m wondering if this equation&#x27;s proper here because i don&#x27;t know if it goes off if it&#x27;s a linear um distance thing i think it&#x27;s more realistically i think it&#x27;s like r squared so the the force of the magnetic field should be like descending by r squared that&#x27;s why i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t know if i like this equation but yeah we&#x27;ll figure that out and maybe um maybe when chris gets to you know we can all get together again i&#x27;m just gonna pull out like my the magnet book you know and like actually like look into it a little more you know actually like you&#x27;re saying work out the details you&#x27;re trying um who was it here cal talweely is it tow wheelie or tawweely um he says he works in the electrical lighting oh feel neon shocks are not a joke yeah i guess they wouldn&#x27;t be because no they&#x27;re not like a plasma shark no that&#x27;s not a it&#x27;s not a joke so um what was i going to ask you though we were talking about because what&#x27;s funny here&#x27;s the funny part we haven&#x27;t shown this yet we were talking about making one big enough you could put a phone booth on top of it right so that i mean that&#x27;s the plan but i i feel like we need that we need this we need to test test this thing you know at some scale maybe it doesn&#x27;t work on a smaller scale you know honestly i really don&#x27;t know i think it comes down to in quotes playing with it a little bit yeah yeah yeah i don&#x27;t know that oh i&#x27;m just going to repeat what he said but it&#x27;s dirty language one of you one of your electrical guys out there in the chat what we&#x27;re trying to figure out is the the mathematical formula for these you know you&#x27;ve got your numeric values in each square right these add up for somebody who just just showed up that across this way adds up to 34 and down heads up to 34. so this is a magic square right in that respect it&#x27;s a magic square so did you did you basically come up with this idea alexa no no at the end of the day magic squares are are basically extremely ancient and they&#x27;re even the foundation of human language no i&#x27;m talking about with the coils with the the coils yeah but i mean i i think that the coils might have already been done somewhere else before i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a unique thought um well i had never seen it until i met you so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the only reason i was asking i&#x27;ve seen coils in a yard before which made me start thinking about it a little bit more you know so i just wonder uh we were talking about um you know you can you can take a battery and and have a big loop of wire and run it to the other end but if that loop is too short and there&#x27;s not enough resistance it&#x27;ll burn right yield the battery will overheat right you&#x27;ll have an over current so i wonder if if you started out with a length of wire and you came and you wrapped one here and then you went down to two and then three and then four i was just trying to give the concept to anybody that&#x27;s watching now four coils you know then you go where&#x27;s number five but none of these can really touch each other right because you would be shorting it like right you wouldn&#x27;t want the wires touching you know right so that&#x27;s why just get an idea if you haven&#x27;t made of concrete you can literally run the wires through the concrete base as well um something like you know i&#x27;m saying like web it through on the bottom the concrete&#x27;s so permanent though it&#x27;s scary because it&#x27;s like if it didn&#x27;t work you&#x27;re like oh man i screwed that up right now you&#x27;re right when you say that but yeah you could run it underneath or run it around um you know just like hold it with like hold the wires in place but eventually but eventually you&#x27;re gonna end up with you know the coil coming from number 16 and then you know then you&#x27;re gonna have a battery over here that&#x27;s where you put a flat a light bulb after six minutes oh oh so yeah so that&#x27;s your resistance is the light bulb yeah or something you could you could figure out some way to create a resistance in here besides just because that was my question to the to the electrical geniuses out there how much wire does it create how much wire does it take at a certain gauge to create enough resistance so that you don&#x27;t burn your battery uh you know shorting it out like that and then even um when you i mean yeah i mean you&#x27;d have to definitely figure that out but let&#x27;s see if one of those guys out there you have some electrical guys watching right you&#x27;re doing some electromagnetism you&#x27;re making a transformer with those coils not really not you&#x27;re not making a transformer because they&#x27;re individual coils i mean you&#x27;re making little tren you&#x27;re making 16 small transformers individual electromagnets yeah making a trend yeah you&#x27;d be making 16 individual little transformers uh two well i too willy two-way line i&#x27;m a german electrician but i think this stuff is out of my payday well you know this i think i&#x27;m finding out it&#x27;s it&#x27;s out of my opinion too just general insight here you know yeah it&#x27;s fun we&#x27;re doing we&#x27;re kind of doing this for fun but i would consider more electromagnets you know and what&#x27;s more important is to think of the magnetic field at a certain distance as you know as opposed to think of it as like a transformer just think of it as a giant electromagnet and then uh like each one&#x27;s almost like you know throwing a stone into the pond of electromagnetism that we live in electromagnetic magnets commercially yeah but we&#x27;re trying to build ones on she&#x27;s saying they&#x27;re commercially available well yeah but they&#x27;re not available let me show this here i&#x27;m going to show your um where&#x27;s my thing that they don&#x27;t you can&#x27;t buy them like this here let me show you how it&#x27;s wrapped yeah yeah so it&#x27;s wrapped in a unique pattern where like uh you know the top one is one loop and then it goes here if i can count it out so like this one two three four you know so it&#x27;s got a certain pattern to it i&#x27;m so bad in place and then 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. um yeah and it goes all the way up to six you&#x27;re doing that and then 13 14 15 16.</p>
<p>on the working model that would be bare conductors though right yeah well at least around where the rods are at every everywhere else you&#x27;d want to minimize any other type of like well that&#x27;s true you can leave the coat the insulation on the wire where they&#x27;re crossing right yeah definitely you wouldn&#x27;t want you would want as minimal interference from the wires in those sections you&#x27;d want to have these be like basically iron rods you want to have these be nice thick wires here&#x27;s you some real math okay here&#x27;s some real fun funky math because you know the that on dc current it um it loses its it loses strength over the length of the cable or y conductor right so then then the the distance between those i wonder how how that takes that&#x27;s where ac current would come in hand well that also plays into the thickness of your wire right the amount of resistance over the the distance so the thicker your wire the less resistance you have over distance transformers are wire coated yeah yeah they have to be and that&#x27;s kind of why that&#x27;s what i was asking about how do you keep from shorting out your battery um i guess you&#x27;d have to have some kind of diode it just came to me diode the word diode if you had a diode would that how would you keep we were talking about a device that would keep uh you would just need something to create some resistance like you were saying a light bulb or something yeah just put them i can put the light bulb right before one end of the battery i suppose yeah yeah and then um like we were saying too maybe just not sure if it&#x27;s better to have a constant current going through it or to constantly kind of like flicker the voltage through it i wonder if those power supplies like the one you saw there have the capability of doing that um you know in that photograph right for the lifter that would just be some type of you know step in between pretty simple so then if you build one of these and it works what what do we expect it to do it depends on which direction you&#x27;re pointing it um if it&#x27;s upside you know so basically it&#x27;s definitely away from me well okay so we&#x27;re talking about let me let me pull up this um this drawing from the book actually it&#x27;ll help let&#x27;s see bob marley says hi from ireland hello bob d bob marley it has to be the ghost of bob marley uh let&#x27;s see i&#x27;m from ireland uh in the where my family is from there county of clare bob marley i think bob marley was was he jamaican pretty sure or did he just pretend to be and he just seemed like a jamaican i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t know earth i&#x27;m gonna say he&#x27;s earthling oh let me add that to string okay so this is a rundown of that fifth dimension book and you were just talking about what do we expect to happen here and so the reason why we&#x27;re working with the magic square is because after you kind of look at all this information right here you could almost say that our universe i&#x27;m not saying that our experience of the universe is flat but i&#x27;m saying from a fifth dimensional aspect our universe is flat right and what we&#x27;re experiencing is a fourth dimension uh so if you call this center drawing here let me make this bigger so if you can consider this all of our universe or our perception so this is our perception orbiting a greater center with an acceleration towards center at light speed we&#x27;re flying tangential so basically our reality is being stretched into existence based off of our accelerated reference frame right the universe is expanding as a perception being stretched and crunched and so what we&#x27;re talking about is using the raw energy of experience right so that so this is happening here then this is your now moment and basically you can see energy is crunching as you approach a spot energy stretching as you leave everything reverts back to normal and so basically you have this happening for every single particle and every single wave of energy of light that we experience is literally obvious i want to ask you a question before i forget because every time we talk about this i forget to ask you this right why can&#x27;t it be both why can&#x27;t the physical because see my my thing is i think there&#x27;s a physical universe and then there&#x27;s a what we consider the what metaphysical universe um why can&#x27;t why can&#x27;t the universe the physical universe be expanding in react you know in its reality and then as we perceive it it&#x27;s also that partner we perceive expands it could be right because that would explain why you can sit with a telescope and measure the difference between galaxies we&#x27;ll see that they&#x27;re literally expanding i&#x27;m sorry but that so it&#x27;s hard it&#x27;s hard to describe what i was what i was trying to get at though is that this is pretty much what&#x27;s happening right here is like perception is being stretched based off of our accelerated reference frame and this is a function of distance away from the center of um this vortex of energy right here but so that&#x27;s as you get closer to center your universe would be stretching and expanding the the difference the distances between matter and light you know matter would be coming more dense like is what we see in black holes and the universe would be stretching more and more um but so what i was trying to say is that at the same time you have a natural order to things and there is um a fifth dimensional vortex of energy and so if our universe is some type of actual energy then there would be a strive towards the common velocity right so there would be a normal expansion within this fifth dimension but also we have the stretching of our perception so i&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s all stretching perception it could also be our universe expanding um as it orbits through the fluid of time trying to have like the edges have that same velocity right because at the boundary conditions velocities of fluids become wanna match so you would have like a natural stretching of the universe as it orbited through time but then as perception got closer and closer to the center you would also be undergoing a greater gravitational field which would also give you a bigger stretching of perception so i would say both things are actually happening that makes me feel better because i feel like that&#x27;s more practical i&#x27;m kind of you know i&#x27;m kind of a nuts and bolts guy you know i mean i feel like that&#x27;s more real like that&#x27;s probably the most practical way to look at it is that both occurring yeah did you see um you&#x27;re while you&#x27;re talking about the fifth dimension i was thinking about rather rather be squidding&#x27;s latest video about i don&#x27;t know if i caught that one he uh and i don&#x27;t know if we can look at it or not but he&#x27;s talking about uh part of our brain that may actually exist in the fifth dimension interesting and that might be able to operate or you know uh be aware of or well okay that i was thinking of very i don&#x27;t know if he talked about this but a very similar thing i&#x27;ve been thinking about is actually how there&#x27;s the reptilian part of the brain there&#x27;s the other part of the brain and i think that each one could be related to a certain time of animal evolution um and that humans what he&#x27;s saying is if we have some type of fifth dimensional organs which is probably the pineal gland i don&#x27;t know though what he i didn&#x27;t see his video but um if we do have fifth dimensional organs it&#x27;s one of the most advanced organs that beings have as far as animals on earth right is that related i mean i really couldn&#x27;t tell you i was gonna uh yeah i was gonna try to go to that one maybe that one part just to show um but so what we were talking about i guess is how what the magic squares do in this field of energy right is what we were getting at did you want to finish that real quick i was just going to show it to you right quick just if you don&#x27;t um just where&#x27;s rather me squinting here we go is that shawna oh here we go you want me to do the stop share it no you&#x27;ve got it it came up there it is yeah okay as it enables us to consider different possibilities simultaneously essentially upgrading our mental processing power instead of moving my arm there a little part of my brain all of our brains parts undetectable except through inference of brain activity exist in this dimension if toesies and peters are correct our brains evolved into this fourth dimension as it enables us to consider different possibilities simultaneously essentially so i didn&#x27;t want to play the whole video but she i thought that was interesting i i&#x27;d have to watch more of that to to properly comment yeah i know i&#x27;m bad about uh i&#x27;m bad about uh interjecting little bits of things and not having them totally explained well i i couldn&#x27;t really say much i know that there&#x27;s nanotubules that are associated with thoughts and that those are you know i didn&#x27;t see that video i would have to watch that to talk about it you know what i&#x27;m saying well and the reason it rank the reason it um it rang a bell in my brain is because of my dreams the way i the way i have the different dreams that i can tell that some are acting on a different like you know i have normal dreams then i have these other what i call events that seem to be acting in a different manner and whenever i see whenever i watch videos like that and i hear these things explained it makes a lot of sense to me because those dreams that i call events are um a lot more um i guess you they&#x27;re almost it&#x27;s it&#x27;s basically reality instead of drinking you know i can tell i can tell when i&#x27;m in a dream like a right and it&#x27;s not a lucky dream yeah it&#x27;s not a lucid dream though um it&#x27;s hard to it&#x27;s hard to explain because i&#x27;ve had lucid dreams right i&#x27;ve also had i&#x27;ve also had those experiences where you could see almost like photographs on the back of your eyelids you know color you know like uh that but um anyway anyway if you get a chance uh watch rather&#x27;s um video interesting and um he&#x27;s a really he&#x27;s a scientific you know he&#x27;s a he&#x27;s one of those you know guys that tries to have the science back at you know what he&#x27;s positing so it&#x27;s interesting but i guess so when you when you talk about you know or when other people talk about the fact that some people you know think that we create reality as we go you know or we&#x27;re or our own perception of realities created as we go right we have people who think that we&#x27;re actually creating um bits and pieces of the world around us as we go and i just think that the physical world exists and that there&#x27;s a that they&#x27;re that they the physical and what would we call not the spiritual what we call consciousness that level of reality exists uh it&#x27;s co-plainer you know what is that you know what i mean they they coexist they&#x27;re not it&#x27;s not one or the other you know people want to draw a line in the sand and say no it&#x27;s this or that it doesn&#x27;t have to it doesn&#x27;t have to be in this or that it can be a combination of things what&#x27;s very interesting is that our consciousness is connected to our bodies right and when we dream it&#x27;s like we have different bodies almost you know we&#x27;re in different places and almost even when you experience the fast gamma you have different almost in quotes bodies so it&#x27;s almost like there is the physical realm and then you could say that there&#x27;s metaphysical realms on both sides of those when it comes to conscious experience but that&#x27;s why i don&#x27;t necessarily a hundred percent agree with that because at the end of the day it really is perception and then energy equals reality right it&#x27;s like we have perception plus energy and then we get our reality i&#x27;m not saying that matter isn&#x27;t different than might i&#x27;m just saying that at the most fundamental principle uh matter and light are made of the same energy so we have you know perception and then we have relative emotions or happenings rather you know and then you have your physical that gets created i just feel like you have i feel like the universe is a stage and our consciousnesses are the actors that come and go on the stage that&#x27;s kind of how i feel and you know that&#x27;s the way i look at it i believe that the physic there is a physical universe that exists whether i do or not and it&#x27;s like uh it&#x27;s like the fabric of that we all it&#x27;s like the playground wheel it&#x27;s like the sandbox we all play in right right i mean i&#x27;ve got this open right here i can just so like as far as the way i you know basically what what i was getting as like you know you have basically our entire thing is a black hole of energy orbiting into a point right is what i&#x27;m saying and then you have the different rings of perception based off of your conscious harmonics um but what i was trying to say just now is that it&#x27;s more like we have the beta alpha state is more of that solid physical realm and so for this i&#x27;m going to show a different photo actually so basically okay so we have you just kind of remember this photo right now right that&#x27;s in the center and i&#x27;m going to open up a different um a different file real quick this will this will show you what i&#x27;m talking about where there&#x27;s the physical realm but your consciousness is kind of like i haven&#x27;t written this out fully so it&#x27;s hard for me to um to 100 properly show you&#x27;ll be able to see what i&#x27;m talking about so stop share share share screen bam [Music] so can you see this screen now yeah so basically you could almost say this this picture i use for a lot of different things but you could say if you wanted to relate this to our daily orbit of consciousness through density you could say that our bodies are in this constant laminar blue area like our physical body the physical realm that you&#x27;re talking about but then you have your consciousness is literally orbiting out here into dreamland and then when you&#x27;re inside these green lante the green area it&#x27;s more like um fast gamma versus land like near death experiences so basically consciousness kind of like goes into dreamland but your body stays in the nice orbit so you have realms of spirit almost like you&#x27;re saying like a spirit realm and then also a physical realm right that&#x27;s kind of like yeah and i like that model because it kind of you know we all like what we goes along with what we think right no i mean that&#x27;s how i would relate it to that and that&#x27;s absolutely yeah so i&#x27;m going to do a stop share and then another new share real quick just so you can see what i&#x27;m talking about again or other because you&#x27;ve already seen this with with the book um but this is i&#x27;m pulling out the book again and this is when i do the orbit of consciousness through identity and so if you relate you know your orbit of consciousness through density with that one physics of love drawing you see that how you&#x27;re like your delta your literally your consciousness goes into the delta realm but your body&#x27;s not manifesting there it&#x27;s your body&#x27;s physical um but then your consciousness kind of reattaches at the beta alpha harmonic distance right you see what i&#x27;m saying there does that make sense yeah i think so so like your consciousness has this orbit through density but not your body right right right right right right that&#x27;s an odd shaped orbit how did you come up with that it&#x27;s basically what they so it could have either been one big circle but you had to you have to switch through alpha and beta several times and so literally when i mapped and tried to keep it a smooth arcing path i had to wrap wrap through the center that&#x27;s interesting yeah and so then i came back out and then it&#x27;s like so it&#x27;s like big loop tight loop big loop tight loops it&#x27;s tic tac shaped right not only tic tac shape but i want to relate this to another screen share i&#x27;m going to pull this up real quick because people are gonna think this is pretty cool um at least i think it&#x27;s pretty cool but i&#x27;m gonna show a gyroscope processing um i&#x27;ll find the right video first though christmas lecture yeah this is actually like it&#x27;s i it blew my mind um when i let stopped see if it actually does the video i want to see it&#x27;ll take me a second i don&#x27;t know if you want to talk about something else real quick um but i&#x27;ll find this video pretty quick well i like this blending of sort of uh i don&#x27;t know what i hate to use the word spiritual world because i feel like that people they get too hung up on the word we need a word that is like the like let&#x27;s say a physical the physical part of consciousness instead of saying because like spirituality is it has too many connotations right to like on earth people think spiritual means you&#x27;re either you know a buddhist or a hindu or a you know whatever that that&#x27;s not the that&#x27;s not the spirit world that&#x27;s not the spirit world i&#x27;m talking about i&#x27;m just talking about the sort of the non-physical i&#x27;ve removed the word spirit from my books well not really i mean on the cover i have mind body spirit diagram but that&#x27;s because i think it&#x27;s important for people to understand that spirit is light state harmony like when you say light state harmony i feel like that makes more sense it&#x27;s literally like your electro your quantum electromagnetic state in relationship to the electromagnetic state of the incoming universe now what i mean is in your book puts it into context right when you&#x27;re having a conversation it&#x27;s hard to put in when you say spiritual it&#x27;s hard to put it into context without a wrong drawn-out discussion about it right there was a new word like uap i wish there was a new word for spiritual that we could just say okay let&#x27;s get past all of your preconceived notions about spirituality and then we have this word that you know we can talk about i see what you&#x27;re saying like uap is kind of a new term that uh because ufo was too woo right so yeah yeah or it was he had too much stigma or whatever patent yeah whatever but let me show you okay so right here you can see that this orbit right this erratic orbit on the computer screen so i&#x27;m going to still looking at it oh sorry yeah so i&#x27;m going to do a stop share i&#x27;m gonna show a new share um real quick so do you see youtube yes put it down all right so now this is a gyroscope processing on a string all right looking glass a sort of dream in which at the same time we followed faraday and tested it experiment by experiment did his quest really fail i wonder let me send you away with this experiment and faraday&#x27;s words all this is a dream nothing is too wonderful to be true so just watch watch the orbit tight loop big loop tight loop big loop so you&#x27;ve actually got two orbits there right you&#x27;ve got you&#x27;ve got the one that the sorry i couldn&#x27;t really hear you but do you see what i&#x27;m talking about there yeah i was asking it looked like you had an orbit that the overall assembly was doing and but then you had a local orbit the gyro was doing well that&#x27;s exactly what was that just something the way i perceived it that was something that that gyroscope was just doing where literally has one big orbit you know if you were to think look at what it just did from a bird&#x27;s eye view um it would have had one big orbit and then one tight orbit and then a big bit in a tight orbit that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what it was i was perceiving it as like two independent orbits like the gyro had an orbit but then the overall assembly had it and i didn&#x27;t i didn&#x27;t actually talk about that aspect of it in the book but you&#x27;re probably right there where like the the two synchronize and that&#x27;s where that that motion just now of the gyroscope literally has no momentum associated with it um and so that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s like the procession of a gyroscope is literally related to the manifestation of the matter that creates it um and you could so like the the way that the gyroscope is able to hold its position is because the energy is spent keeping it in that um right in that configuration you&#x27;re saying there&#x27;s no momentum but the momentum is is uh used keeping it vert or 90 degree you know perpendicular to vertical oh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where there&#x27;s a lot of lot of discrepancies when it comes to the physics behind spinning tops and gyroscopes yeah there&#x27;s not one good explanation for why a gyroscope rises when you force precession there&#x27;s not one good explanation why gyroscope literally shows no momentum if you if you stop at the procession right like the dude stands there and he goes over it like detail for detail and he&#x27;s like talking about oh no but then there&#x27;s momentum in the spinning of the tower well that&#x27;s just uh physicists making up terms then they don&#x27;t actually know what&#x27;s happening they&#x27;re the they&#x27;re really like how how can you explain the center of gravity rising i mean that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m just saying i&#x27;m just saying if you have a a mass that&#x27;s spinning then it has it has kinetic energy i guess right well yeah i mean that that&#x27;s again like what how what what what layer of physics are you using are you using that things have momentum or are things being manifested from the from the fifth dimension into our fourth dimension right like if you want to say think yeah it&#x27;s just momentum mv is mv that&#x27;s fine but that&#x27;s not really what&#x27;s happening like you have matter being manifested from the incoming light state and that the momentum is literally the past of the object in the future of the object and so that&#x27;s why it creates that end quotes momentum it&#x27;s the synchronization of the spinning in relationship to the quantum field that&#x27;s why i really do think you can map the entire quantum world by using different densities of gyroscopes because each one is being manifested from a different density of experience and will have a different rate of uh what what is the effect that gravity has on if you took that same gyroscope or that same uh example that he was using and do it on mars or the moon um are you saying would it process more or less that is a good question yeah i haven&#x27;t looked into that at all honestly it&#x27;s interesting the whole thing is interesting and it&#x27;s kind of funny how people do get into these uh sort of almost debates about the gyros they do and also the spinning top physics right like why does a spinning top want to always orientate itself to the direction of the force it&#x27;s just people try to say oh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pushing on the ground and the friction gets it to stand but that guy um eric lightweight he puts the the spinning top on a a piece of ice you know and then like he&#x27;s like there&#x27;s no friction it&#x27;s like how are you yeah and you&#x27;ve got people who take it to the instagram what if you look down there small if there&#x27;s no exactly the point how do you really ever prove it and i think that&#x27;s where it comes into over unity systems that are being developed right now have you heard about like over unity and how you can use gyroscopes and when you force so when you force precession so say a gyroscope is processing around a rod right and you force it to go faster it literally rises in the dimension in our physical world it rises against gravity now say you put a piece of wood over the top of it and you don&#x27;t let it rise so you force the procession and so it naturally wants to rise but you have a piece of wood over it what happens is that gyroscope will start smashing the wood like super violently and destroy your machine um like they&#x27;re that&#x27;s called an over unity system and so like people people try to use those to get energy out of them and like literally in that book the physics of love i talk about how there&#x27;s that energy of synchronization like the energy of matter synchronizing with the incoming light state of the universe and i think when you force precession you push objects out into further out in density right so they rise within our physical reality and when you put a piece of wood over it you&#x27;re literally not allowing it to synchronize with its own matter and so that&#x27;s that one half mcr equation that i introduce as far as like the amount of energy in gyroscopic procession and over unity systems so that&#x27;s like where that whole the synchronization of the creation of matter itself um comes into the gyroscopic procession and also your consciousness perceiving reality like there really is you know quite a bit going on yeah no this is where i become a bad host because my brain slips off into those those are those dreamy areas of what you&#x27;re talking about well that&#x27;s where i kind of try to i try to imagine myself in those realities it&#x27;s in it and i&#x27;m like [Music] yeah i mean i talk about it a little bit more in the book um if i if you want me to do a quick share or yeah i was going to say before we go this time i keep forgetting to do this i&#x27;m going to i want to you know talk about how people can get your book because i think it&#x27;s so cool yeah so don&#x27;t let me forget that well we can do that at the very end i guess but i wanted to share i guess a couple more pages from it oh no yeah sure go ahead oh there we go i&#x27;m really bad at keeping it secret like i literally have you know a lot of the book read you know and then walkthroughs of it on youtube it&#x27;s it&#x27;s for free it&#x27;s free it&#x27;s for everyone but if you want to support and buy the book you know you&#x27;re more than welcome to um but so what we were just talking about was the gyroscopic procession in relationship to your consciousness and so basically i didn&#x27;t actually end up drawing any pictures for for it but i wrote about it um but you can basically just shows that the natural gyroscopic uh procession is very interesting you know because there&#x27;s no momentum but when you force procession you notice that you can make great energies as you force precession the radius of orbit changes so the way i see it is when you force precession of a gyroscope you&#x27;re literally forcing it to drift further in this dimension and conscious and the dimension of density i feel like that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re forcing it to drift further out in and the resultant manifestation within our perception is it rising relative to gravity are you saying are you using density as in that&#x27;s just basically where matter exists uh when you say greater density well so this entire our entire experience from this model is one giant black hole um i&#x27;m trying to get to that you know so like basically yeah yeah the procession to this the center or the right so as as con as energy spirals towards the center of a black hole you get overlapping of energies and as the energies overlap at certain distances you&#x27;re basically equal to the speed of light or factors of the speed of light and that&#x27;s when you get matter manifesting like bits of matter coming in from different densities of experience because you have a vortex of energy but then you have a perception and so our perception is related to the vortex of energy and so you get energy from the inner rings energy from the outer rings right and so the energy from the inner and outer rings of perception add together and that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m saying is that literally matters being manifested from the inner and outer rings of perception and you get this wall of experience as in that&#x27;s related to your conscious harmonics and so when it comes to matter like the smallest smallest atoms are coming from the this isn&#x27;t the the most center point of this entire vortex um i think that answered what we were just talking about and when you were and so i guess people i guess the whole argument i guess that stephen hawking or they were going back and forth uh because you made the analogy of a black hole what you&#x27;re saying is that matter could be being born in that you know in that sort of atmosphere that matter only exists in black holes and that consciousness only is created in black holes because you need that overlapping of light upon itself to create a 5d multiverse experience where literally matters being manifested like blipping in and out of solidity like how else would you get matter blipping in and out of solidity yeah i almost wondered at one point i mean this was years ago i thought many black holes were maybe the source of uh matter bleeding from other you know universes or something well okay so i i really like what you just said and so i&#x27;m gonna open up the book the fifth dimension i&#x27;m gonna close this i&#x27;m gonna stop share real quick uh well no this is the fifth dimension i&#x27;m gonna open up the book the infinite pool of experience and awareness um because that one has what you basically just said and how that relates to that that other drawing the physics of love and how our entire experience is like a flower blossoming towards a greater sun within the sixth dimension um it&#x27;s quite it&#x27;s quite wild but let me get that going real quick why are you doing that too i was just going to say this book is it this this volume is interesting because it has all is it five or six books in one volume in one and it&#x27;s kind of cool it&#x27;s it&#x27;s laid out where you can go through a guide in the beginning and you know kind of gives you a guide to all the different books it appears like it&#x27;s one book but it&#x27;s actually it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the five books of physics in quotes physics metaphysics but it is very physics based off of relativity and modern physics um and then a book of poetry and then a section of philosophical discussions i like the poetry section too that&#x27;s cool yeah thank you i feel like it helps because not everybody is so scientific based you know not everybody likes the charts and some people can enjoy the poetry well we still have to remember that we can you know even if we aren&#x27;t uh if it turns out we aren&#x27;t spiritual beings we can still uh you know uh what&#x27;s the word uh we wish to be i like that i mean if it makes people and it creates more money on the earth why not yeah exactly you know um let me i&#x27;m supposed to be screen sharing yeah but basically that almost relates to like what louis lozando always talks about how you have like science is coming out from this direction you know religion&#x27;s coming out this direction but it&#x27;s a pyramid and they meet at the top right right i&#x27;m not saying this is the answer to that i&#x27;m saying this is very close to the top of that pyramid right something similar to this is going to be um where we&#x27;re headed and like when people talk about the age of the aquarius they&#x27;re talking about literally um the quantum realm of like liquid manifestations and i and i literally named the second book and this one the liquid light state universe um so it is very very related and i have the mind body spirit diagram and how that relates to your quantum manifestation in our universe right so it&#x27;s very and it talks about multiple timelines and uh hitchhikers you know from different dimensions so it covers a lot but you know um sorry i&#x27;m babbling but let me uh no it&#x27;s interesting yeah yeah no i feel like this is the direction of where that is going you know um but so we were talking about how you just mentioned black holes look like they kind of come you know our energy isn&#x27;t a black hole but then black you know kind of came from somewhere else right yeah yeah so that&#x27;s literally right the conclusion you could say of the entire book is right here and i really enjoy reading this if you don&#x27;t mind like go ahead no go ahead so this is basically with our new understanding of the infinite pool of experience and awareness we may see that our entire universe is blossoming like a flower into the sixth dimension when we look at the flow of primordial energy from the perspective of the sixth dimension we see it as part of a growing structure our universal experience is the result of energy flowing into a black hole in our experience we see the spark of new conscious experiences as energy flows into the black hole of every galactic center we are one part of a structure that is growing into the sixth dimension we are the harmonizers of that structure through love and synchronization we flow like a river into the next layer of experience as it branches out like water in a lake heading out to sea or like a flower blossoming towards the sun we are the water of the one-sixth dimension the dimension inwards to where an electron is the universe we flow like water we are water and we are time we are all one right so i i feel like that&#x27;s exactly what you were just saying like literally our energy comes from a black hole um yeah do you get what i&#x27;m saying oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and then we fractal out into another one and so that is literally um let me just do this that&#x27;s the premises of the entire next book that um i&#x27;m pretty much done writing but i haven&#x27;t finished have you titled it yes yes oh i didn&#x27;t i don&#x27;t have it open one second let me uh let me cancel that screen share and do one thing and then i&#x27;ll do a screen share uh okay this is an interesting comment from bob marley i think he says the more they don&#x27;t tell the truth more people are going down rabbit holes i think i don&#x27;t think i don&#x27;t think our government knows the actual truth they i think they have i think they have bits of i think they have a record of experiences that people have had it&#x27;s like with the uaps they they have all they&#x27;re having all these experiences with their pilots seeing uaps but they don&#x27;t necessarily know what the uaps are so going down the rabbit holes are just a way for us to get together just like alexei and i are and just discussing possibilities you know i&#x27;m sorry go ahead i just wanted to i feel like sometimes i don&#x27;t address comments in there no i mean that&#x27;s good and like when it comes to rabbit holes i feel like um if you don&#x27;t explore your universe you know i&#x27;m not saying like go down every rabbit hole be blind or like you know and then like end up i don&#x27;t know like down some rabbit hole where your head stuck and you you don&#x27;t have no way out you don&#x27;t feel like aware of reality right and like still like actually look at reality um it&#x27;s just like blindly go down a rabbit hole just doesn&#x27;t matter i i think as long as you know you&#x27;re going down the rabbit hole and you&#x27;re in the rabbit hole it&#x27;s okay it&#x27;s when you go down the rabbit hole and you lose and you&#x27;ve lost track that you are in a rabbit hole that&#x27;s the danger like we went down many rabbit holes today but we came back to you know we we pulled ourselves out we pulled ourselves out we live in you know our physical well i mean i don&#x27;t know i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t mean to call i&#x27;m not calling your work a rabbit hole you know and i wanted the reason i wanted to address the comment is because of that fact i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t think necessarily that some of the things that some people uh imagine are rabbit holes because i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like the reason the one reason i always wanted to meet alexa is because i feel like he has a unique perspective that i&#x27;ve never heard before and all of the it can&#x27;t be totally wrong right i mean everything you&#x27;re saying can&#x27;t be right i don&#x27;t think from my opinion nothing everything that i&#x27;m saying is absolutely true uh to me um and i don&#x27;t think that any physicists will really argue though with what i&#x27;m saying either that if that you have a perception and then you have a field of energy and then our experience is a manifestation of our perception and relationship to the field of energy i don&#x27;t think any physicist is going to argue that we live in a quantum reality we&#x27;re matters yeah those are like mountain dane statements you can i don&#x27;t think any physicist is going to argue the heisenberg uncertainty principle where there&#x27;s the whole energy distance momentum energy relationship i don&#x27;t think any physicist is going to argue the fact that one revolution creates one wave of electromagnetic energy you know as a matter of fact it just occurred to me that physicists would be less likely to argue your points than the ones i was making earlier about how i feel like there&#x27;s a consciousness realm and a physical realm and there may you know what i mean that kind of stuff is what they would argue wouldn&#x27;t be what they wouldn&#x27;t argue with you about what you&#x27;re saying no and like my approach is very very realistic we live in a quantum reality um like we have uh the orbit why would we be orbiting the center of time i don&#x27;t know why are we orbiting a galaxy so like it comes down to that&#x27;s just the nature of reality we we are on earth and we orbit earth our earth is in the solar system and it orbits the solar system our solar system is orbiting a galaxy but that&#x27;s where now our perception is being stretched because the velocity and the acceleration so fast on that next step it&#x27;s literally now our perception is being stretched because we have an accelerated reference frame towards a greater center like we&#x27;re literally you know spiraling around in circles some what astrophysicists or whatever don&#x27;t even understand why what holds galaxies together right right there&#x27;s not enough gravity in that system to basically keep us keeping a spiral right so there&#x27;s other forces involved that we don&#x27;t we&#x27;re just not aware of they&#x27;re not looking at the universe as if it is orbiting something they&#x27;re looking at that our perception which means that our the relationship of the matter that makes me is a relationship of the matter that makes the wall like literally when i say the beta waking state it&#x27;s the beta waking world it&#x27;s literally the relationship what do we got here skinwalker and all of us this ufo is at one time lol just keep it simple we don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re not talking dino beavers here yeah it&#x27;s okay but um anyhow you get what i&#x27;m saying man yeah i want bob i want bob to understand though that just because you don&#x27;t you know it it&#x27;s taking me interviewing alexei like five or six times to even understand some of the things he&#x27;s talking about once you start to think about it you say uh it&#x27;s not skin walker ranch territory you know it it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just simple physics like you were saying it&#x27;s actually very straightforward physics in a relationship to your human body like there&#x27;s nothing in my opinion there&#x27;s nothing about it until you start getting into the whole like um pacing about the golden spot in the fibonacci but i don&#x27;t even think that&#x27;s because you do have a natural note of manifestation based on the preparation of space through that density of the how your body it goes back to actual words because it&#x27;s like when you say the word manifestation our human brains have a perception itself of what we think manifestation is we think of ghosts when we think of medicine so when i say manifestation i mean anything physical anything in our physical reality and the mind body spirit diagram that&#x27;s body literally a manifestation is body right so there&#x27;s the mind body spirit diagram and then you have mind which is literally the conscious field and then you have a spirit which is the relationship of your body to the conscious field and when i was trying to make with that about words is that when you&#x27;re reading when i&#x27;m reading this book i take words at the value at the context as it is in as they are placed in this book if you use the word manifestation here in this book i&#x27;m smart enough to know the context of it if i if if i&#x27;m reading a ghost story book and i hear the word manifestation it&#x27;s a different it has a different uh context right so i think people need to keep that in mind when you&#x27;re talking to alexei i keep saying alex yeah i don&#x27;t mind i like it it&#x27;s much you know it&#x27;s good um you know then i know how to take the word spiritual i know how to take the word spirit i don&#x27;t know how to take the word manifestation all of that you know i live with a roommate that just always believed spirit doesn&#x27;t exist when you die you&#x27;re dead i&#x27;m an atheist and i was like okay well would you believe in light state harmony that you your body has a quantum reality do you believe in that you know like okay you don&#x27;t believe in spirit and ghost that&#x27;s fine do you believe in the quantum nature of reality you know do you believe uh that there&#x27;s an incoming energy field and that you are made of an energy field do you think that there&#x27;s a relationship between the two you know it&#x27;s like even god yeah you believe in a greater a greater laminar flow as in like bigger than our universal experience that&#x27;s the conversation we need to get to that point i feel like once we get to the point where we can talk about spirituality in that context then we&#x27;ll all be better off and we can stop talking about religions which are institutions on earth well they&#x27;re so they&#x27;re used for so much division like you just said yeah yeah that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting at is like they&#x27;re used as structured like it&#x27;s not really i don&#x27;t know we&#x27;re good no i just i just as as i&#x27;m thinking you know as you&#x27;re talking and we&#x27;re going along i&#x27;m thinking of how people respond and and how you know at some point if humanity&#x27;s ever going to progress that we have to we have to get we have to get rid of all of our notions of politics uh you know hey whatever you know all of those you know racism all all of those con concepts are the way we think we have to kind of get them out of our mind and start a blank slate you know yeah having those types of constructs in your head just really doesn&#x27;t help you in any way throughout your life i mean like why even teach it to people oh and i know i know bob marley&#x27;s saying no disrespect i know and i was i was just using your comment as a gentleman as a as a springboard to bring at my point i wanted i wasn&#x27;t trying to attach that to you bob i was saying i think it&#x27;s uh it brings up the it brought the point to me to and i meant no disrespect as well i meant more just like i almost want the scientific community to really analyze what i&#x27;m saying when i say that our quantum reality is you know manifesting from a fifth orbit and that you know the universe isn&#x27;t expanding our perception is being stretched we used to literally think the sun went around the earth that was our perception we stand on earth we look up yeah the sun goes around the earth that is the case when you look out at the sky at night the sun goes around the earth right so when you look out at the edge of the universe at night the universe is expanding right so what i&#x27;m saying here is that um it&#x27;s another layer of perception um but i want to see what stephen here has to say i co-create time as we say so like always spiraling oh we would have to talk about that in an actual conversation always spiraling inwards creating more time and more conscious experiences at the end of the day honestly think that we have to have some sort of cohesive structure you know like i was talking about earlier some sort of playground some kind of sandbox some kind of fabric uh and always thought of time as that fabric that that that time wasn&#x27;t created or what they&#x27;re okay so yeah you can create your own time or whatever but there&#x27;s got to be some kind of fabric that we all exist uh one big playground right and that our spirits come and enter and go leave and come and go and even come you know what i mean yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what i would like to think right because then then you could say here&#x27;s the physical part of that playground right and then here&#x27;s the sort of metaphysical or the spiritual aspects of that that&#x27;s pretty much where the book does take us to i mean you have the image of the the cover here i i have this so people can see it basically the cover shows the physical realms as we evolve you know yeah yeah yeah this is like one universe leading into the next universe leading into the next universe leading into the fractals as they like become denser harmonics but what&#x27;s also important to understand is too and i even opened it up um just because i figured that that might be coming up here so let me let me do the share screen again and one one analogy i like to to to use for my my thinking is that as that tree is falling in the woods people can be coming and going into that same existence right definitely i mean the tree doesn&#x27;t exist and it doesn&#x27;t make a sound well that tree can&#x27;t exist and it can make us the sound while i&#x27;m either whether i&#x27;m here or not or whether you&#x27;re here or not you know well yeah i mean it makes an energy wave right whether or not you have the ability to hear it&#x27;s a different thing like if you don&#x27;t have ears you won&#x27;t hear it that doesn&#x27;t mean an energy wave didn&#x27;t happen if you have synesthesia and you see sounds then all of a sudden you saw the energy wave you know what i&#x27;m saying like right right um let&#x27;s see can quantum particle physics hold building blocks of time or is time a byproduct i personally think that time is just a a measure of your own perception of existence in other words i don&#x27;t know this sounds dumb but i don&#x27;t think there is such a thing as time i think that we we we came up with a way to measure right because our you know we we came up with a need for time because we live on a planet that you know rotates once every 24 hours and the sun comes up and goes down and we found a way to measure that right we divided that up into 24 hours so we created the this sort of perception of time um but i don&#x27;t see a need for time to be created or destroyed right and it because you get relativity right so if i&#x27;m if i&#x27;m on earth i have my own perception of time and if someone&#x27;s traveling it you know some percentage of the speed of light their their perception is time is different from mine but how can we all have different perceptions of time if we&#x27;re not creating it ourselves the perception of it ourselves right i i like this question a lot and um do you want to keep going on it or i mean no i&#x27;m sorry i thought you were digging for something i just wanted no i was thinking i wanted to make sure i i understood the question and that i answer this as comprehensively as i can um quantum particle physics right so basically how how matter is manifesting into our reality and then you also have the super physical nature right so that fifth dimension i i really think that if i just do um a share it shows that it it really is a combination of both at least right away for your support there yeah the way i see it here like um i have the infinite pool of experience i think uh steve actually might have gotten this book um but so here&#x27;s the book it open already so multiple pages and then basically what i&#x27;m saying what i like to say is that time is that vortex it so like tony almost like what you&#x27;re saying time is it already exists in vortex form right um but then we have i&#x27;m trying to get to the right page um i apologize no that&#x27;s okay i just always wonder why there is a need for time to exist except for when we need to to measure uh motion or you know what why does it why does time need to exist well in order to experience right and so what i mean at the end of the day this this goes into the whole physics of love book again right so where we depending on your your delusions because if you create some type of delusion now you&#x27;ve created a vortex which literally is an in essence creating a loop of time in itself so in a way that&#x27;s where like you can create your own vortexes of time um but so i cannot if you can see myself i know this is probably going down a rabbit hole okay if i&#x27;m out in the middle of deep space i can&#x27;t see there&#x27;s nothing around me i can&#x27;t see it&#x27;s total darkness okay i&#x27;m there by myself somehow i can magically breathe and survive what is my reference point what is time to me at that point if i&#x27;m not moving there&#x27;s no motion there&#x27;s nothing around me that&#x27;s moving i don&#x27;t have anything to gauge motion from you know to measure you&#x27;re still moving though right no how do i know i&#x27;m moving that&#x27;s where everything is moving i mean there&#x27;s it&#x27;s to say that there&#x27;s like a a still object in space is is i guess yeah i guess what i&#x27;m saying yeah i guess i&#x27;m saying maybe i have a different um perception of time in that i only need it when i need to measure like how you know what time what time did you and i need to meet today right so that&#x27;s this we set up a structure of time so that we can meet it&#x27;s important in space but it&#x27;s a relationship of energy at the end of the day it&#x27;s a relationship of energy so like but what i wanted to answer um stephen&#x27;s question basically so if you have this as the big red sin red ring call it the greater ohm it&#x27;s almost like god right it&#x27;s the biggest om of creation it&#x27;s the biggest vortex of creation and that is the one that is the laminar flow it is our naturally manifesting universe that has no wants don&#x27;t wants spirals of delusion you could say turbulent flows within it like that is a perfect vortex in that in that image and so in that essence all matter would be manifested from that quantum the first half like you&#x27;re saying but since we live in this quantum reality of wants don&#x27;t wants assumptions and expectations you literally get something i already i drew a picture of it um in a different cad model i can open that up real quick let me find that um but so then you get a different here i&#x27;ll leave this open real quick while i find it um that&#x27;ll keep me from going down another round at home i know i&#x27;ve always had this con you know question of why why time was needed except for you know obviously organizational means and methods you know right what why did it have to be a thing you know it&#x27;s until we need it in other words if you lived on a deserted island you had nothing ever to do except go to bed you know you&#x27;re who why would you why would you need time you know can you share um oh i need to share this yeah that other drawing so basically what i wanted to show so the other drawing was basically a perfectly smooth flowing quantum only the first half of your suggest like what&#x27;s your question asked this second half so now that you can see there&#x27;s turbulent flows each one of those represents a karmatic cycle almost like a cycle of you know creation like i always refer back to my own product the skate case because i don&#x27;t like making fun of other people&#x27;s products so i&#x27;ll say if someone lives their entire life fulfilling my personal want of skate case to go out into the world now they&#x27;ve almost created their own time in a way they&#x27;ve created their own fractal of a delusion and so when it comes out to a greater structure within the harmony of the universe i&#x27;m going to do a stop share i&#x27;m going to do a new share here i like your term delusion after all well it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not one with that greater ring right god yeah yeah i don&#x27;t like using the word god but that it&#x27;s not the biggest not the biggest flow of reality yeah um and so go go back to this screen share here and so i use this but this is a good um really good to kind of like show what we&#x27;re talking about i like this one the laminator flows exactly and so you call this the blue the laminar flows of reality but then you have the now your second half of the question nor does man create their own times in a way i forget the full wording of that question but so here you have man creating their own vortexes of time in a way that remain unreap that remains attached and now this takes it into spec this next bit is where we would be going into a rabbit hole if you want to hear that um do you want the rabbit hole answer like yeah let&#x27;s change the rabbit hole answering we&#x27;ve gone down people like to say that this raw energy of experience what we&#x27;re looking at right now is used by e.t um for their own purposes right this is like the loose energy it&#x27;s the raw energy of experience and then you always you can some people talk about the concept of a harvest right and one picture i saw on twitter and i i wish i remembered who drew it their name exactly um but it was a very similar drawing to my uh physics of love drawing but instead of it being a two-dimensional drawing it showed it as a tree and it showed um fractals of delusion as almost like flowers butting off that main stem right and so when it comes to like creating your own space and your own delusion it&#x27;s almost like each one of these spirals that you create from your own once don&#x27;t wants assumptions and expectations is a fruit almost of some sort that is growing on a tree and so it&#x27;s almost so that&#x27;s just another way to look at it right so like yes quantum particle physics uh you know particles do manifest from the quantum greater laminar flow but then i would say our minds with the ability of once don&#x27;t want assumptions expectations and pacing about the golden spot literally create all these vortexes which can then be picked as some type of fruit right i don&#x27;t know if that makes any sense well and see i like the idea that the delusion creates space but i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t see the need for it to create time um so time to me is just uh you know uh it is is something i it&#x27;s like my tape measure i pull out you know when i need to whenever i need to scale a drawing i pull out my scale what do you think it&#x27;s time right because time is that energy there&#x27;s only so much of that original energy right it would create experience within time how does that sound because each one of those vortexes would be an experience within time it&#x27;s not actually creating time it&#x27;s not creating raw energy it&#x27;s creating an experience what is that what is but what is the i keep i keep believing in my own reality so much that i forget what the requirement of time why why is there a requirement to have this time this thing why is there a requirement to have this time i don&#x27;t know the answer to that i mean at the end of the day because the experience is why we have time um right i feel like if we didn&#x27;t have any type of if you had no ego at all in relationship to the magic squares that we were talking about earlier you would be perfectly invisible with everything you literally wouldn&#x27;t even exist um the only reason why i do exist is because i have some ego that&#x27;s the only reason why i look like i do and so i think once people like really understand the whole golden spot and i know this might be in the woo realm but it gets into like quantum healing like literally instantaneous healing of your body by being at your golden spot like um yeah and then all kinds of other effects potentially but you know that could be a different different day we talk about that well this all puts my mind in a uh a place where i have a hard time being a host because i just want my mind to drift and and yeah i mean if you wanted to go back to the magic squares just to kind of circle it all back how could we possibly circle back pretty easily actually we understand all those realms of space we understand that there&#x27;s this big vortex of energy and that our consciousness is tuned to a certain distance from that center of time right and so just to circle it all back which um let me do a new share just so we get we do this right oh yeah i was gonna i have this going if you have something else you want to share too i mean we do that but i just wanted to circle it back to that to the magic square um and then you could pull out your model right yeah that&#x27;s what i was going to do after you okay so let me let me just do this real quick then and then uh so basically this represents the magic square right here but it&#x27;s called the magic sphere because we&#x27;re going circular and it shows how when you create that vortex of energy literally the big square represents this but once you have that four to one stretch ratio you&#x27;re now tuned and perceiving this layer of reality so every time you have a new four to one stretch ratio you&#x27;re perceiving a denser and denser realm of reality right so what we&#x27;re trying to do with the magic square as far as making it a interdimensional telescope would create that four to one stretch ratio where your beta harmonic naturally harmonizes with that next layer of physical reality right and so that&#x27;s how that&#x27;s why you would make magic squares and potentially even use the concept of stacking squares to create a nice big vortex to to do that yeah the scalability is what&#x27;s for me uh it&#x27;s what&#x27;s impressive with the magic squares right it can be any size yeah the scalability of it is is kind of that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what kind of makes it magical to me if there is if there&#x27;s such a thing called magic i think so i mean when it comes to the human experience i think that like uh things just flipping enough slitting people are calling like magical at this time you know so see there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s another word that we have to take in caught into context right [Music] people people have these fanciful ideas what magic is well it doesn&#x27;t have to be a fiction no not at all um it can be very real and what i think is really cool though is where the magic square the principal foundation of the magic square in relationship to human language um it literally is what founded human language and a whole bunch of other things like magic squares at the end of their are very ancient technology um which i think is just i find extremely fascinating right yeah i didn&#x27;t find anything good there but yeah they&#x27;re like i was trying to do a quick google search for us i couldn&#x27;t find anything good but yeah if you look at magic square like let me google ancient magic square real quick because you&#x27;ll be able to see what i&#x27;m talking about and what i find interesting is that some of them are associated with the ancient sites that are found on our planet so here i&#x27;ll do a new share for us and when it comes to um naturally occurring interdimensional telescopes they could potentially uh be related to energetic vortices which would be happening at magnetic hot spots on earth and when it comes to like the um ancients well they built all their stuff in a magnetic hot spots and so it&#x27;s like okay you have naturally occurring vortices you have ancient megalithic structures and you have magic squares strategically planted there and then you have this guy i forget his name but he had a very vivid ufo experience to the point where he literally wrote out binary code binary code gets translated and it literally has um the longitude and latitude of all these ancient sites and it says progression of humanity at these ancient sites i don&#x27;t remember that i can&#x27;t remember the name that you&#x27;re speaking you don&#x27;t talk about me i mean if you just type download but so here&#x27;s you know here&#x27;s a magic square ancient the magic square on the the passion you know whatever that there you go there&#x27;s something and then here&#x27;s another ancient magic square concept so it&#x27;s not new technology by any means it&#x27;s like the principle of the yin yang i mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s super ancient concept um and it&#x27;s even what the foundation behind sigil magic which is another very interesting thing um it really does go back a long way but where i got it from was john searle right the guy who invented the flying disc john searle magic square he&#x27;s the guy that got me onto it and um you know he makes his solo effect generator by understanding the the principles behind the magic square everything from human language to literally sigil magic to ufo technology so that i mean there&#x27;s something there you know some people who might want to look into it and you can&#x27;t do it in a day no i mean you could it really doesn&#x27;t seem that complicated i mean like literally you get one of these guys you make those iron rods instead you get you you hook up a you know your amperage controller you hook up um whatever like a radio stat like a rheostat type thing where you can yeah okay yeah and like and like you&#x27;re saying so here you go and then here you have your platform some type of platform goes on top of it and then here is you know your telephone booth we&#x27;re just gonna do some green goo green dye yeah and so now you have this green dye it&#x27;s going to be inside of a magnetic vortex and it&#x27;s going to be with the proper crunch and stretch ratio i mean it could literally be um experiencing another realm of experience i think it&#x27;s going to take more power than i have in my house well probably if we need to create like a four to one stretch ratio with actual fabric of space time but that&#x27;s when you when you think about it when it comes to getting a bucket of water and swirling it with your hands and then getting the bucket of water to make a whirlpool it doesn&#x27;t all happen instantly it kind of over time makes a bigger and more defined whirlpool so maybe with low voltage just constantly running you would eventually whirlpool up the space time you know that&#x27;s where i don&#x27;t really know how sticky is space to itself you know um or the natural synthetic it&#x27;s interesting you can leave it running and when you get up in the morning half of your house might be looking on right i mean you got to make sure you turn it off because that&#x27;s not uh you know entirely i mean you might see dino beavers coming through the yeah the more tanks but i think you know i think this is a good start right here just this little simple concept and like um even if you just put metal salt for this i just need to put some metal rods in there you know i wonder where what kind of instrument you would you could put above it to measure the difference um what would you do i forget exactly the terms behind them all but they they have stuff like that and then you could um just to see if it&#x27;s working you could literally get a compass and just put it on the middle of it and see if the compass is spinning with the vortex of energy anyway i guess if you if you had enough money you could do like a gravity uh measure the gravity above it with lasers or some of the like the way they use they measure the gravity you know the interference with the gravitational waves the wave detectors that we have here oh yeah well we were talking about that with chris the inferometer or i don&#x27;t know if that was that&#x27;s the right word um but we were talking about that with the lasers and how they measure the time uh but i wanted to just mention real quick how this actually relates back to our our experience so now imagine this represents ah geez it represents literally a vortex so imagine like uh i wish i had a big cone i could just like yeah i know what you mean though when it points upwards right depending on which way the vortex is spinning you&#x27;re going to have a cone and if you&#x27;re here it&#x27;s either going to be energy coming towards you or energy going away from you if the energy is going away from you and getting bigger you&#x27;ll be experiencing the lower reverse realm if it goes the other way you&#x27;re gonna experience the nobiverse realm right so that&#x27;s literally density control when you turn it sideways to the the flow of density or gravity you&#x27;re gonna create motion through time which could literally translate into like either physical motion or a time dilation of some sort um so you have density control when you go up and down and you have like motion or dilation control when you go horizontal but it&#x27;s all relative to the flow of gravity which is the flow of manifestation in our local space time yeah so it&#x27;s all related to the you know i&#x27;m saying by orientating it different ways you&#x27;ll be able to do different things i think my my my brain is overloaded for today i&#x27;m i&#x27;m good i know you are like i&#x27;m overloaded too i&#x27;m ready let&#x27;s call it but well thanks uh alexa um [Music] these kind of discussions i think to me they help kind of uh push us push us into that realm of thinking that we all need to start getting into because we&#x27;re so we&#x27;re so used to going through time uh just you know the motions the daily motions you know because because we have allowed time to enslave us to a certain extent i think right we get up eight you know six o&#x27;clock we eat breakfast we go to work we come home we watch the news we go we we&#x27;re kind of slave to time in respect but um so these kind of discussions help us get out of that get our minds out of that that realm and into the other realm these other rounds so could i finish with the poem on time yeah oh my gosh thank you that sounds like that would that would be much better than my words well i mean i i really enjoy what you just said you inspired me to to want to do that like so this you know this is uh i have my book of poetry in here and this one is called time is but a thought and it&#x27;s literally almost word for word what you were just saying so here we go time is but a thought built straight from your mind it cannot be sold or bought and thinks you fall behind many stress as the hours go by with no place to rest ask yourself why did man make the clock yes i believe we did so is it solid like a rock no it can be mended we create our days and we create our ways it is all a choice although you may feel you have no voice open your eyes and open your heart notice the lies that&#x27;s a great start yes time may equal money and can buy you endless honey but is your life yours or is it controlled by your chores we live once for certain so do take advantage dreams reveal the curtain with endless possibilities to manage time is but a joke created by man to listen there was then now and then ultimate man wealthy and glsen so do take note that time is just a tool it is fluid and you own it and that my friend is truly cool there you go that is truly cool right and with that on your time that&#x27;s awesome yeah well thank you alexa um we&#x27;ll get together again and uh if you don&#x27;t mind and um and because i like i wanted to do kind of a series of these kind of things you know yeah i mean we can get because i&#x27;m not upset i&#x27;m not satisfied with conversations with normal humans i have to have them i don&#x27;t have conversations with normal so that&#x27;s why i think it would be cool you know we got chris on here as well yeah we&#x27;ll knock out some more details we&#x27;ll get a telephone booth on there and maybe we&#x27;ll have a really fun podcast where we all meet up and we&#x27;re literally in this telephone booth uh experiencing an alternate dimension yeah it could be fun well thanks alex thank you i&#x27;ll see you next time we&#x27;ll see you next time thank you that&#x27;s it see you all right that&#x27;s awesome thanks everybody thanks stephen for your support i don&#x27;t really uh advertise for um support um but i appreciate it i really do i think i thank you for that and um we will certainly be back again chris lato hopefully will join us next time he was kind of our little third person we were missing today he was uh doing some things he&#x27;s on he&#x27;s five hours ahead of us so it&#x27;s hard to get him here on a friday night away from family stuff which i understand 100 anyway i&#x27;m gonna stop rambling and thank everybody for watching</p>
