            <p>probably everyone here has at least heard a reference to the surl effect um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s turned into really a soap opera in alternative science and you know John surl has been doing his research since the 40s The Sur effect is an excellent case study in terms of the mythology and the reality of alternative science and in his case one of the things that makes it so excellent is the length of time it fades out of our current reality into the myth of History so it&#x27;s like how much of this is really real how much of it are stories that have been repeated so many times they&#x27;re not even close to what really happened how much of it has been made up and then interjected into this Mythos for sirl right we see the same thing with UFOs over the last few years we&#x27;ve started to see some of the same things for some of the superconductor research uh TT Brown is obviously a comparable example the biggest departure I think for Bei Brown from the reality that we know and observe or at least you know the historical reality that we know was um the B2 bomber right that was something that Paul laet came up with I believe he was the first person a lot of people have heard that the B2 may have anti-gravity on it um I came to a little bit different conclusion personally now I don&#x27;t know for sure I&#x27;ve never been on one actually never seen one in flight but um but the the idea was that they were using the bfield brown effect to create an anti-gravity effect um whatever the reality of that myth is at the very least it started out being speculative and just became more speculative for there so what we&#x27;ve tried to do is address some of these these mythological aspects of Gravity Research to try and cross-correlate things and say if person a sees a side effect right like the seral effect generator runs cold now surl when he came up with this idea this is the 1940s 1950s he apparently just said well it looks like this thing it&#x27;s ice cold when it runs in fact in his case he said it became superconducting because it became so cold which indicates you know several 100 Dees below zero well if surl just pops up and says it becomes cold when it runs we can&#x27;t tell one way or the other we don&#x27;t know what to think of that but we do know if we see somebody over here for instance Marcus Marcus hauling head from the Marcus device controversy Marcus popped up in 2000 I believe this was late 2002 Marcus had never heard of sirl had absolutely no reference to surl whatsoever never even heard the name of it he was an Indian venor who wasn&#x27;t even looking for Gravity what he was looking for was a way to model the magnetic fields of the Earth for some Arcane reason and one of the things he indicated was it ran cold so now we have two separate cases those aren&#x27;t the only two obviously we we start to piece these things together and we have a class of device and the interesting thing that we found is the more we cross-correlate data and again incredibly diverse sources these people know nothing about each other they know nothing about each other&#x27;s work they&#x27;re separated sometimes by decades and yet we&#x27;re finding they&#x27;re all converging in on a core set of ideas um you know in the case of this theg not only did it run cold it used the Hallmark of of what we think of as I guess the well I like to call it true anti-gravity uh bfield Brown has been argued to death in fact we we got tired of arguing it um true anti-gravity it would be you know in the world of S in the words of surl it doesn&#x27;t just take off from the workbench it takes the bench with it um the Ser effect generator you know obviously one of the examples that he has cited again no verifiable evidence for it was that it took the bench with it when he uh connected it to the bench and powered it up under a full load uh Marcus claimed the same thing there are numerous claims of effects like this what we&#x27;re seeing are these nonlinear effects and they come out of essentially rotating magnetic field devices it&#x27;s hard to be more specific than that because there again there are hundreds of variations um what we&#x27;re find finding is even in devices that seem diverse enough that they don&#x27;t even match like the superconductor devices you wouldn&#x27;t think superconductors would have anything to do with Mercury plasmas which tie to the Nazi Bell or anything to do with the c effect generator and when you get down to the electrical and the field-based level of these things you start to see the relationships here actually become uncanny they&#x27;re so striking that it&#x27;s amazing and again you have side effects described by diverse source of people you know people who&#x27;ve never met each other that match up so well it&#x27;s as if they&#x27;re describing the same phenomena coming from different devices now there are tons and tons of theories that explain why this might happen one of my personal favorites my pet theory for the last year has been Einstein&#x27;s unified field Theory one of the things that I liked about this theory was nonlinearity of effects the effects form an exponential curve when you&#x27;re working at smaller energy levels right like all modern Electronics pretty much pretty much any anything made in the last 20 years right your cell phone your radio anything like that you&#x27;re working so far down on this curve you don&#x27;t see any effects these unified field Theory effects because it&#x27;s an explanation for everything they&#x27;re all there they&#x27;re all present but you just don&#x27;t see them you can&#x27;t measure them they for all intents and purposes don&#x27;t exist so you start to work your way up this curve and you might see some strange side effects um there was a company that I had done a story on I can&#x27;t really disclose it at the conference Unfortunately they had done some testing that blew out their power supplies it created unshield em effects That&#x27;s a classic unified field the effect it&#x27;s actually a back EMF that comes out of your gravitational field you&#x27;re creating ripples in time space and they hadn&#x27;t thought to look for it at the time but those ripples create conventional induction and circuits and since it&#x27;s going through any kind of shielding you might have blows out the power supply so as you work your way up the scale from there you start to get what looks like the onset of maybe Philadelphia Experiment effects again it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a strange story but the more research I did into this uh the more truth I found behind certain portions of it actually I guess I could phrase it like that my focus was on the tech not on the story not on Mon talk or anything like that um you work your way even further up you begin to see full scale gravity shielding um it looks like large scale again true anti-gravity um there&#x27;s not a linear relationship between input power and output thrust the nice thing about this what this tells us is we can use electrical systems that don&#x27;t require enormous amounts of output to lift incredible amounts of weight and the reason is that because we&#x27;re not actually lifting the weight what it turns into actually I think the story is up there it becomes a gravitational transistor I think that&#x27;s what these things are all telling us they&#x27;re telling us this energy is out there maybe it&#x27;s free energy maybe it&#x27;s in the background of time and space maybe it&#x27;s not free at all maybe it&#x27;s just something that&#x27;s naturally occurring that we just kind of sort of can tap into don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s happening um maybe we&#x27;re tapping into something completely new but whatever the case may be by modifying time space with a small amount of energy time space itself does the work to lift these devices out</p>
