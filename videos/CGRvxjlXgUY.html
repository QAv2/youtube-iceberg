            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is for educational purposes and um we generally look at important theories of everything that may have slipped your attention uh because they went under the radar they were suppressed uh they are obscure and sometimes they&#x27;re difficult um but I found them to be invaluable and I just want to share them get them out there and uh hopefully keep moving the ball forward on them a lot of them are Works in progress you know uh putting a lot of uh burden on one person to come up with an entire Theory of Everything sometimes it takes uh a few generations for these things to work themselves out and uh today is video number 314 on the reciprocal system of theory from Mr Dewey B Larson and um Mr Larsson uh put out his two fundamental postulates in the late 1950s articulating the essence of his theory and then from there went on a process of deduction to deduce a theoretical Universe about how if if his postulates are correct then what is that uh what is a universe that follows those postulates what does a universe look like and uh then from there he wrote uh a bunch of books on various aspects of those findings now um way back uh in the earlier uh periods of these uh series of videos I did go over his um paper that he gave that was called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system there&#x27;s about 15 videos there and you can go through his videos to see the stepbystep process that he goes through to get from his postulates to his theoretical Universe now here I would just uh give you a quick once over on the postulates and uh and then we&#x27;re going to get into an article that LaRon wrote back in 1981 or this is actually another paper that he gave that we started yesterday uh on scalar motion now in general um the basic idea behind the first postulate uh which is the most important one of the two is that we live in a universe that is made entirely of motion not matter not energy but motion matter and energy are merely two different varieties of motion and motion for Larson was the relationship between space and time now if we think about motion uh probably the most basic kind of motion that we can think of is speed the bicycle is moving at 20 miles per hour 20 miles per hour 20 miles of space in one hour of time space over time speed is space over time um and so that is a relationship between space and time so at least as far as you know our most basic understanding Larson is correct you know motion is the relationship between space and time in the case of speed um now he says that all really of the basic scientific quantities that we know of are also relationships between space and time basically they are fractions with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator with the caveats that space and time are both three-dimensional or they at least have aspects that are three-dimensional he calls that coordinate space and coordinate time we&#x27;re accustomed to that idea as far as space is concerned but not so much with time and uh that space and time both um have their what he calls their clock aspects they are both progressing in what he calls a scalar manner um meaning scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction um like a clock the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but it&#x27;s not moving in any specific Direction it&#x27;s just getting later and uh so that is clock time clock space is that things are getting farther and farther and farther apart and uh you can see this uh analogize with your uh balloon with dots on it you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction now you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other but in no specific Direction and this was also measured by the Hubble telescope that uh you know observed that the distant galaxies are all moving away from each other that&#x27;s a scalar motion and as Larson pointed out in this article that we read started yesterday scalar motion is an accepted kind of motion in the universe by scientists but they have never uh really seen it for its significance and that is really a fundamental uh motion they seen it as um more of an anomaly or just a random occurrence or um you know some kind of uh Sideshow but lson is putting it front and center okay so uh space and time both have their coordinate as aspects three dimensions they both have their clock aspects of progressing and they both come in discrete units only meaning they are quantized there is a minimum unit of space and there is a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have that full unit then you don&#x27;t have space and you don&#x27;t have time you have to have a full unit in order to have any and um if you have exact one full unit of space in one full unit of time remembering that space over time is speed if you have one full unit of space and one full unit of time you have the speed of light for Larson the speed of light is what he calls unit speed 1 over 1 equal 1 and for lson unit speed is really like the background the origin The Ether the reference system the state of rest of this universe now you have to really be able to accept the concept of a universe of motion to be able to conceive of the uh of the fact that the state of rest of the universe is actually in motion at the speed of light um and you have to be able to accept the fact that you can have motion that precedes everything else so you have motion without anything moving motion precedes the thing that&#x27;s moving and in fact motion uh comprises the thing that&#x27;s moving anyway and um so uh for Lars the speed of light is really the midpoint or the zero point of the universe and then there is an entire half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light whereas the einsteinian will tell you that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe and nothing moves faster than the speed of light that betrays their ignorance uh that the whole their whole universe is actually only half of the universe the material sector is what Larson calls it that is the half of the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light but Larson also posits the cosmic sector which is the half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and the beauty of the reciprocal system is that the material universe and the cosmic Universe are identical except that you have to uh interchange change the roles of space and time so in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and you have clock time the clock is always progressing getting later and later and later but in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space things are always getting farther and farther and farther apart and so you can do this kind of extrapolation when you cross from one boundary to the other uh from one side of the speed of light to the other and um you know it en enables us to see into an Unseen World uh we really only see what&#x27;s going on in the material sector but we can extrapolate to figure out what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector by just inverting the roles of of space and time now another thing that Larson I don&#x27;t have never seen him actually mention this but you know he he&#x27;ll say that we see in space um but we don&#x27;t see in time and so what we see from the uh Cosmic sector um we actually see it in equivalent space so we see the inverse of what we see in space such as an explosion a gigantic explosion such as a supernova if the Supernova goes faster than the speed of light then um instead of seeing it so then it crosses the speed of light so it becomes an explosion uh in time not in Space the explosion is occurring in time but we don&#x27;t see time we only see space and so we see it as an inverse phenomenon in time in space so what we see is we see an implosion in space uh the explosion in time is seen by us as an implosion in space and this accounts for things like white dwarf stars that are super small and super dense Larson says that that is an explosion uh Stellar explosion uh that goes beyond the speed of light and uh that that uh you know creates the idea of the uh of the um twin stars uh you have one star that&#x27;s exploding in space and one star that&#x27;s exploding in time that&#x27;s the same star but it it has uh aspects or parts of it that don&#x27;t make it past that speed of light barrier and so you see it as a red giant white white dwarf pair the red giant is exploding in space and the white dwarf is exploding in time but what I&#x27;ve never seen lson actually say is that we hear in time that&#x27;s what we hear so we do have some kind of equipment to uh to penetrate this Cosmic sector uh at least this that&#x27;s at least the way I understand our hearing is that you know we hear frequencies we hear uh middle C that&#x27;s you know 26 cycles per second um and we hear the C above that and that&#x27;s twice this Twi twice that ratio so I think that there might be some way of um uh applying that uh to understanding The Cosmic sector although that&#x27;s just a a hypothesis okay now the the other the last thing that I wanted to mention uh is that you also have uh two two subboundaries you have the boundary of the speed of light that bounds the cosmic sector and the material sector but then within the cosmic sector and within the material sector you also have boundaries for unit space and unit time again space and time are quantized and so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you do not have space and if you do not have space you only have time because it&#x27;s got to be one or the other or both and um because the universe is made out of motion and motion is relationship between space and time and so that is what lson calls the time region that is the region of less than one full unit of space so this is really uh the the unit of space is 4.56 * 10us 8 m so this is a realm of microscop of the microscopic so this is where uh you have your atoms and your molecules and this is uh in the time region they are in time and so when you cross over into the time region you cross another boundary the unit space boundary and the rules again shift when you uh invert when you go into the uh time region and the same is true of what is called the space region over in the cosmic sector that is whatever is within one unit of time and that&#x27;s what if you don&#x27;t have time uh then you you only have space and the space region is for the realm of the instantaneous uh the realm of the what Larson would call Cosmic atoms and Cosmic molecules the Legacy scientists would call it um antimatter and so there&#x27;s really three boundaries here in this universe the unit space boundary the unit speed boundary and the unit time boundary okay now we&#x27;re going to take over with lson the last thing that he mentioned was that he was uh going to jot down some of his notes about scalar motion and about some of the anomalies that he found and he realized that he had way too much material for just uh an a chapter uh he had enough material for a book and so now he&#x27;s G to talk about this book um which I don&#x27;t know what book he&#x27;s really referring to but maybe we&#x27;ll find out okay here&#x27;s Larson within the subject area that it covers the conclusions reached in this new work will be identical with those reached in my previous theoretical works but they will be reached by a totally different route in the theoretical works I began with a set of postulates as to the prop properties of a universe of motion and all conclusions in all areas were derived entirely by derivation of the consequences of those postulates without introducing anything from observation or experiment in this new work I&#x27;m going to do exactly the opposite I&#x27;m going to start with a set of positively established facts including those that have been derived from the the scalar motion investigation and all the conclusions will be derived entirely by development of the consequences of those established facts without introducing anything of a theoretical nature that means that the entire book will be factual without any uh tie in to any physical Theory but since the conclusions will agree with the conclusions derived from the theory of a universe of motion whereas they will disagree in many respects with current physical theories the work as a whole will constitute a significant confirmation of the validity of the theory of the universe of motion I I believe that maybe the book that he&#x27;s referring to is called the the neglected facts of Science and that&#x27;s a book that maybe we we will eventually go through I&#x27;ve read the book but I haven&#x27;t studied it and so I don&#x27;t know it very well but it did come out in the early 80s uh just after this this talk came out the discovery and identification of distributed scalar motion was in itself an important advance in knowledge but it also opens the door to a better understand understanding of the entities that are now identified as distributed scalar motions one important point that has been clarified is the existence of multi-dimensional motion vectorial motion is one-dimensional it may extend into three dimensions of space But as motion it is confined to one dimension any such motion is described by a vector which is onedimensional and any number of these vectors can be combined into a resultant Vector which is likewise onedimensional but scalar motions in different dimensions cannot be combined in any way analogous to the addition of vectors it follows that scalar motions in different dimensions are independent an N dimensional scalar an N dimensional motion mathematically speaking is simply one that requires n magnitudes for a complete definition thus a one-dimensional motion or other physical quantity can be defined by one magnitude a three-dimensional scalar motion requires three magnitudes for its definition one of those magnitudes and only one can be further subdivided by the introduction of directions relative to a spatial reference system that motion can then be defined by a vector and it can be represented in the spatial reference system by a line current scientific thought regards the whole of existence the physical existence at least as being contained within the space and time of the spatial reference system and that current thought denies the existence of what I have just been talking about that is multi-dimensional motion but now that we have derived the existence of multi-dimensional motion from established physical facts is evident that this current scientific opinion which was never anything but an assumption is an erroneous assumption what we now find is that the conventional threedimensional spatial reference system is capable of representing only a limited portion of the total contents of the universe it takes three uh three dimension of space uh to represent one dimension of scalar motion with the benefit of this information as to multi-dimensional motion we can now complete the definition of the basic distributed scalar motions a study of the properties of electric charges which I will include in the new publication uh but won&#x27;t take the time to go into here shows that the charge is a onedimensional distributed scalar motion simil a similar study of gravitation shows that gravitation is a threedimensional distributed scalar motion the situation with respect to magnetism is not as clear-cut because it is Complicated by the existence of electromagnet ISM which is a phenomenon of an entirely different kind but we can identify the so-called permanent magnetism as a two-dimensional distributed scalar Motion in present day thought these phenomena are dealt with as Fields but just what constitutes a field has always been a matter of considerable difference of opinion from Marshall Walker we get this definition a field is a region of space where a test object experiences a specific Force but Einstein disagrees Einstein says a field is something quote physically real in space for the modern physicist as real as the chair on which he sits this difference in opinion as to the nature of the field is further Complicated by differences of opinion as to how the field Theory ought to be applied and as matters now stand the whole status of the theory is inconsiderable doubt from David Park we get this assessment of the situation quote this does not mean that the ultimate explanation of everything is going to be in terms of fields and indeed there are signs that the whole development of field Theory may be nearer its end than its beginning end quote the clarification of the scalar motion situation shows that the field is neither a region of space as indicated by Walker or something like the physicist chair as indicated by by Einstein it is simply a distributed Force the force aspect of a vectorial motion is a vector the force aspect of a distributed scalar motion is a field the fail to the failure to recognize important facts such as the existence of distributed scalar motion has a double effect in that it encourages the development of erroneous theories and then causes a disregard of the facts that disagree with those theories the situation with respect to gravitation is a good example The observed facts with respect to gravitation are well known and they are almost entirely disregarded as nearly as can be determined from observation gravitation acts instantaneously without an intervening medium and in such a way that its effects cannot be screened off or modified in any way but those properties are so difficult to explain on the basic basis uh of present day theory that the physicists have resorted to a the unusual expedient of constructing a fictitious set of properties that they can explain and substituting those fictitious properties for The observed properties not withstanding all evidence to the contrary uh present day physical opinion insists that gravitation must be propagated at a finite velocity through a medium or something with the properties of a medium Einstein of course made space a medium gave it the properties as he said of a medium it is freely admitted that there is no evidence to support this present day contention as one prominent physicist puts it nowadays we are also convinced that gravitation progresses with the speed of light this conviction however does not stem from a new experiment or a new observation it is a result solely of the theory of Relativity end quote once it is recognized that gravitation is a distributed scalar motion all necessity for this Defiance of the facts is removed because the properties of a distributed scalar motion are exactly those properties of gravitation that have proved so difficult to understand okay we&#x27;re going to stop there and uh start up tomorrow from the same spot and I think it probably take us one or two more days to get through this paper um probably too and um thanks for tuning in today have a great day</p>
