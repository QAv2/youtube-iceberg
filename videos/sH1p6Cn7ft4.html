            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Joavanni Monza. I am the editor of the ebook gravity superconductors interactions theory and experiment published by [Music] Ben. I am a mathematical physicist at the University of Bolzano, Italy. and my co-editor is Glenn Robertson, an engineer and physicist at NASA. The book is indexed in the Scopus database.</p>
<p>As you probably know, the microscopic nature of the gravitational force is still a mystery. There have been important mathematical and formal advances in the so-called theory of quantum gravity. This partial theory has also predicted some possible quantum gravitational effects observable at the cosmological and astrophysical level. Yet some people believe that we can learn more about the microscopic nature of gravity by looking at the interactions between gravity and superconductors. These interactions might be peculiar because superconductors are microscopic quantum objects.</p>
<p>This idea is not new. Actually, it goes back to the 60s as explained in the first chapter of the ebook which is entirely available on Google books. In 1964, Halpern also made the first computation of stimulated graviton emission. that means of the possibility to build a gravitational laser. His general answer was negative for several reasons.</p>
<p>But in chapter four by Georgia Fontana and chapter five by myself, we discuss if it is possible to overcome these difficulties in superconductors. The book contains a lot of information and different points of view. Glenn Robertson has also written chapter 3 and 12. I have also written a chapter chapter 8 in collaboration with Eljin Pleenov who has been one of the pioneers in this field. There is some criticism too for instance in chapter 10 by Hatawwayi and rice.</p>
<p>Chapter nine was written by Timo Junker, a young researcher who made a partial replication of the experiment by Pletenov with high voltage discharges. By the way, these experiments have been recently replicated at lower voltage by CL Per. Finally, other important contributions are by physics professor from the United States and from Germany, namely Clyde Woods. Chapter 2, Rais chapter 6 and 7 and Yohim Hower chapter 11 with Valter Dia.</p>
