            <p>What if I told you some inventions were so powerful, so disruptive that governments and corporations tried to erase them from history? One, Tesla&#x27;s death ray. Tesla called it the teleforce. The press named it the death ray, a weapon said to shoot down planes from 250 mi away. Two water powered cars. Stanley Meyer claimed his dune buggy ran entirely on water.</p>

<p>Antither mechanism. Built over 2,000 years ago, the Anticha mechanism could predict eclipses long before modern science. Too advanced for its own time. Five. Silent sound weapon.</p>
<p>A weapon you can&#x27;t see and can&#x27;t hear. The silent sound system was designed to speak directly into the human mind. Six. Hover tech and anti-gravity patents. Hundreds of anti-gravity patents exist, but most are locked away under national security, never to see the light of day.</p>
<p>Seven. Da Vinci&#x27;s submarines. Da Vinci wrote his submarine plans in secret code, fearing they would be used for mass destruction. Some inventions vanish because they don&#x27;t work, but others vanish because they do too well. What else is still locked</p>
