            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>How we doing veterans? Patrick here with Vetted. This is a crazy video. You see, Dr. Gary Nolan and Diana Pulka got together for an interview together for the very first time ever, as far as I know. I&#x27;ve never seen an interview with them together.</p>
<p>So, the fact they got together for an interview is kind of a big deal. just, you know, one one by themselves is great, but together this was a phenomenal conversation and we learned a lot about um this famous trip that Dr. Gary Nolan and Diana Pulka took out to the New Mexico desert to a UFO crash site, collected materials, had it tested, yada yada. This is a huge story that we&#x27;ve all followed and they revealed a lot of new information about that story that I&#x27;ve never heard before and I followed it very closely. Why? Because it involves someone that Diana and Gary referred to as Tyler D.</p>
<p>But as we all know in the UFO community that is Tim Taylor, the NASA, you know, I don&#x27;t know, NASA head, NASA science, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a scientist. I don&#x27;t know. NASA guy um who um you know famously worked with Chris Bledsoe and many other people, right? And this story that Tyler Tim Taylor took Diana and Gary Nolan out to the desert blindfolded to this alleged UFO crash site to collect materials. That&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the subset here, right? So everything we&#x27;re going to get into, all the clips that I have today are covering that new information about that. the materials that Gary recovered, the analysis, all of the stuff, other stuff that I&#x27;d never heard about the situation because Gary&#x27;s never talked about Diana&#x27;s talked about it quite a bit, but Gary has rarely commented on it.</p>
<p>So, this is a phenomenal conversation. Now, this all took place on Chris Leto&#x27;s podcast, the Leto Files. I&#x27;ve had Chris Leto on Vetta before. He&#x27;s a great guy. Um, and this was a phenomenal interview that he put together, and he gets right to it.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s just asked him, &quot;Hey, what what happened in the desert? What&#x27;s going on with that?&quot; So, it was great. And at the very very end, stay with me because Gary Nolan also dropped a few nuggets about Skywatcher and what they&#x27;re um been doing and what they have upcoming. So, stay to the very end for that. Uh let&#x27;s jump into this cuz we got a lot of clips to break down. Investors, please don&#x27;t forget to hit that like button.</p>
<p>That really helps out the videos. And of course, if you&#x27;re not already subscribed, hit that subscribe button. I&#x27;m trying to get to 100,000 subscribers before the end of the year. Here&#x27;s the first one. Again, this is talking about Tim Taylor aka Tyler D taking Diana and Gary Nolan out to a UFO crash site, right? Um, this is all detailed in American Cosmic Diana Pasulkus book.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s get this started. &gt;&gt; But what happened? Um, and what did you guys find at the New Mexico site? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I I recorded this in American Cosmic and we, you know, went to this site. We were both blindfolded and uh Tyler D, who I keep as synonymous, went there with us. Well, he took us there.</p>
<p>And so we did find what looked like um to me it looked like uh kind of like a frog skin type material and uh and we took that back and Gary analyzed it. I don&#x27;t I know that he he thought it was anomalous at first, but I actually don&#x27;t know what his finding is today, but that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what from my perspective we found. &gt;&gt; Well, perfect. Well, luckily we have him right here. What did you find, Gary? &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>Well, so there were several different pieces. Um, and you know, it&#x27;s interesting. The audience needs to understand that scientists are accustomed when they talk about their data to people always knowing that this is preliminary until I send it out. Um, and just like for instance with the Otakama, when I first looked at the data with the Ottakama mommy, um, I didn&#x27;t quite understand what the sequences meant because there was a lot of junk. And so when I began reporting it to my colleague, he he who shall go unnamed.</p>
<p>Um it it was like well like 90% of it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit anything. &gt;&gt; And also if you&#x27;re interested in more stuff about Tim Taylor, I did a huge deep dive about seven months ago. One of the best videos I&#x27;ve ever put together. I&#x27;ll put a link down below so you can go check it out. But I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>A lot of people watch it. A lot of people said it&#x27;s a great video. It&#x27;s a huge deep dive again on Tim Taylor aka Tyler D. All right. So, the pieces that they found, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s just a whole story to this and we&#x27;re going to get into this because Gary&#x27;s going to explain the whole thing that he just hasn&#x27;t before spoken about before.</p>
<p>Right? So, they get these pieces and um stuff comes out about the pieces that, you know, maybe they&#x27;re alien, right? and some stuff that he had initially told Diana. Diana went and talked about it and there&#x27;s been some updates since. So, basically, let&#x27;s talk a little bit more about these UFO pieces. &gt;&gt; So, with the the medals uh and the materials that I recall us bringing back, one were the the so-called um um what was it? The the alien honeycomb as it was called at the time. And uh I mean it definitely looked strange.</p>
<p>Uh uh there was another which was kind of this silvery black covered metal that was slightly fryable. Then there were a few pieces clear pieces of of metal that were that looked like aluminum with kind of scratchings and etchings on them. not etchings as if somebody was writing hieroglyphics, just kind of a pattern uh with a brown substance on them. And there might have been one or two more uh that we found. And in fact, Diana was like a divining rod out there.</p>
<p>Every time she turned around, she was finding something. Um I was uh mostly spent my time up on a ridge uh from h from where the object was supposed to have come over and supposedly hit. uh before it landed on the other side of the little ravine. It wasn&#x27;t so much a ravine uh as a long flat area. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>So, Gary also is going to get into like how this alleged UFO crashed because I&#x27;d never really heard all the details of what craft they were actually looking at, right? So, there&#x27;s more details about that, but he&#x27;s basically just going to go through the process here of taking the materials that they got from the crash site through airport security. And guess what? He got stopped. the the event of me putting my samples through the metal detector at the airport and the metal detector shutting down. Absolutely happened. You know, and as Diana knows, I went white.</p>
<p>I cuz I had samples in there and I was sure that they were going to open the thing up, find this stuff and, you know, drag me off to the penitentiary somewhere. So when I got back and did some of the measurements, there looked to be a lot of anomalous isotopes or metals that uh that I reported to Diana uh for sure. Uh and when I looked more closely though and again so this is the thing the scientists scientists like to be right but good scientists know that very often they&#x27;re wrong and when they don&#x27;t understand something the best thing to do is actually go find the real expert uh on metals uh for instance or how to use a certain instrument etc. And as many have remarked on the internet on Twitter, well, Gary&#x27;s an immunologist. He&#x27;s not a matologist.</p>
<p>So, what right does he have to do anything in in this area? Well, I have the right to ask the question first and then to go find the expert to make sure that what I&#x27;m doing is right. And that&#x27;s what I do. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, the basic situation is Gary gets these materials and then people are wondering why is he the one studying it, right? So, he goes and gets an expert and finds out. But again, on his initial kind of looking at it, he kind of told Diana some things here, right? like, oh, this this may be, you know, not of this world, right? And then when he digs a little bit further, he finds out this.</p>
<p>And so they said there&#x27;s a thing called datomics. Uh, and datomics in mass spectrometry are the atoms might have been individually separated in the sample, but in the process of uh of activating the sample, turning it into ions, and then it goes into a cloud. those individual atoms might come together uh during the measurement stick and then when the their mass is measured rather than being individual atom masses they are the combined atom mass. So they look bigger than what they are. So if silicon were together with silicon it could be something like 54 which would make it look like chromium I think uh etc.</p>
<p>And the only way to discern that is to there&#x27;s a few settings on the machine that you could set that lowers the chance for a diatomic because it would have a double charge to get there. Um or you better separate the objects or lower the concentration. So, at first it looked like the samples were not of this earth because they had so many mixtures in there that just didn&#x27;t seem to be right. Okay. But then when you let when you start asking the expert, they say, &quot;Here&#x27;s the explanation for why that looks this way.&quot; So, I didn&#x27;t figure that out probably until about three years after uh the um the article was published, but I wasn&#x27;t going to ever take the bait that was being put out there uh in the press as to, you know, try to start some kind of consternation between Diana and I.</p>
<p>Diana reported what I told her. uh and what she reported was what I thought at the time. And so any mistake was mine. &gt;&gt; And so yeah, that had kind of happened where they were trying to divide Diana and Gary and they were kind of saying different things and I had even covered in a video um myself. So maybe Gary&#x27;s even talking about some stuff I was saying.</p>
<p>I wasn&#x27;t trying to start beef with them by by no means. Um but there were some uh statements that didn&#x27;t coincide together. Let&#x27;s just put it that way. Uh, but now Gary&#x27;s here clearing it up with Diana and this is great. This is all we wanted.</p>
<p>Just clear it up. What&#x27;s up with those materials? So, um, here&#x27;s Diana explaining a little bit more from her side of things. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, you have to understand that this is the time period was um, a while ago. You know, I was writing this book and I still didn&#x27;t believe uh, in the phenomena at all.</p>
<p>Uh, I was shocked that Gary and Tyler believed it because they&#x27;re so credible and in, you know, amazingly intelligent. Uh, it was beginning to dawn on me that it was real. So as I was out there uh doing this field work um I recognized that this was you know the it&#x27;s not just that you had people like Gary Halputo off and you know uh physicists and and then other people that were wellplaced in programs like Tyler. It&#x27;s not just that they were doing this work. It&#x27;s also the fact that I&#x27;d spent my entire life looking historically at things that were considered aerial phenomena back in the day and that it fit the pattern.</p>
<p>And so there was a pattern match. So all of this and and that Tyler predicted that Gary would got would get stopped in the airport and that this would happen and that everything happened exactly as he said. Uh, I was very concerned about Gary, you know, I mean, Tyler was was completely fine. He knew exactly what was going to happen. He knew Gary was gonna be let off and those, you know, and he described the process.</p>
<p>So, he was sitting there having a cup of water and I was, you know, had white knuckles. I also thought something really terrible would happen to Gary and I thought, &quot;Wow, I&#x27;m glad I gave this stuff to Gary.&quot; &gt;&gt; Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m just joking. I&#x27;m just joking.</p>
<p>But I do remember at the time I thought, I do not want this stuff. Uh I don&#x27;t know what it is, but I don&#x27;t want it because first Gary can figure it out. But secondly, I just had this feeling that, you know, if it was really what Tyler thought it was, then this would not I I just didn&#x27;t want to have it. Um so so there was a bunch of things uh going on in my head uh to tell you the truth, Chris. Um, so yeah, it was a uh it was way out of my comfort zone.</p>
<p>Um, but now looking back, I&#x27;m really happy that we did that because you know there were some colleagues of ours who I asked um and you know first you know thinking that this person would want to do this because I didn&#x27;t want to go by myself. I wanted to take an academic with me and you know the colleague was like Diana I don&#x27;t want to do that. That&#x27;s so far out of my comfort zone. So I asked Gary and Gary was like I&#x27;ll do it tomorrow. And so that&#x27;s hilarious, right, that um Diana asked other people and Gary&#x27;s like, I&#x27;ll go, right, which is great because this turned out to be a phenomenal experience that they were able to share.</p>
<p>And I think actually when all the dust settles, it&#x27;s still something. These are great data points, right? Why is Tim Taylor taking them out there? And I, as we move along here, there was just so many details that just still don&#x27;t add up about this. But look, Gary isn&#x27;t done talking about those materials. He wants to make sure that we all understand exactly what came of those UFO materials that he collected again from this alleged UFO crash site. &gt;&gt; But but I want to add, you know, something about the materials analysis.</p>
<p>So just because it didn&#x27;t have a mixture of practically every element on the table and and things in between um doesn&#x27;t mean that I figured out what it is. Um, I mean the the alien honeycomb, uh, Larry Lumpkkey and I, and I would say more Larry than me, uh, Larry looked into the literature and found examples from that era of aeraf foil that exactly matched the honeycomb with the even the knot we found is a knot from the early 1900s that actually is a fisherman&#x27;s web, but they had adapted that exact structure to lay over the honeycomb structure that they then poured the resin on and that uh helped keep everything in place. Um but there were still there&#x27;s I mean I still have the samples. Just because I can say that they&#x27;re made of the elements that are supposed to be found in this universe doesn&#x27;t mean that they weren&#x27;t didn&#x27;t come from somewhere else. What was 100% clear was that the debris field was in the middle of nowhere filled with old pots and cans, bottles, even like I think we found like an old tomato can.</p>
<p>Remember that big old tomato can? You can still see the the the writing on the thing crushed. And the tomato can was from like the 1930s. So they used it as a dumping field but h also mixed in aerospace material in the middle of nowhere literally in the middle of nowhere. Uh and so you know you&#x27;re open it&#x27;s just like why would you do this? So why was I up on that ridge? Something that I haven&#x27;t talked about publicly yet ever but I I I will here for the first time because I think it&#x27;s interesting because it&#x27;s unlikely that I&#x27;ll have a chance to go back to the site. So, you know, supposedly this thing came down uh and hit the ridge, broke, spilled stuff across the debris field, and then stopped on the other side.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve already spoken about the the debris field being uh purposefully, apparently contaminated. Um or the object came down in just the wrong place in a previous in a debris field that somebody else had precreated. Um, so across the ridge there are all there were all of these cypress trees, very old cypress trees, probably several hundred years old. Cuz if you know the reason why we make wooden fences out of cyprress is because they&#x27;re filled with resin &gt;&gt; and fungi and bacteria don&#x27;t decay them. I mean, that&#x27;s the reason why they&#x27;re great, you know, and why there&#x27;s fewer cypress trees on the planet than there should be because we humans are busy chopping them all down for the utility.</p>
<p>Um, so there&#x27;s all these old trees along the ridge and then exactly where there should have been based on where the object supposedly crashed and the trajectory there&#x27;s a giant cypress tree that was still partly alive but which had been broken over, crushed. I mean like obviously some heavy object had hit this thing and knocked it over. And guess which direction it was knocked over? in the direction of the trajectory. So, somebody else can go out there or the CIA can go out there tomorrow and dig the whole thing up and make it look like it wasn&#x27;t there in the first place. Um, because it was there when I saw it.</p>
<p>Uh, there was evidence of a crash right in the in the piece of the of the, you know, the cypress tree which clearly had some stuff starting to grow over it, but it it didn&#x27;t look like it happened last year. It could have easily happened long ago and there was still these these pokes of the cypress tree trying to revive itself from that time long ago. So, um you know to to me it all that more than anything else said there was a crash. Um and then the debris field suggests that somebody was trying to hide something. Uh and and that&#x27;s about it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. So, this next part is where these details start to not add up because Diana is going to basically say that Tyler D, aka Tim Taylor has been excavating this site for over 40 years and he knows the people that owned it. But there&#x27;s been stories floating around and I&#x27;ve even been told on this podcast by people that Tim Taylor found out about that site in the early 2010s at an experiencer party in Canada and it was taken there and shown it and then proceeded to then tell people like Diana and Gary, hey, I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve been going to this crash site for decades. Uh when that is allegedly not true at all. So, I don&#x27;t know what the real story is there, but allegedly Tim Taylor has not been excavating this place for 40 years.</p>
<p>But all of this is new information, right, that Gary&#x27;s about to get into because allegedly, not allegedly, Gary&#x27;s admitting it right here. Him and Tim Taylor tried to buy the land where this crash site was. &gt;&gt; And so, you don&#x27;t think it could have been like a transport aircraft or something carrying tomato cans across the country? Well, yeah. I mean, all we have are the, you know, the supposed verbal testimonies of the anthropologist, the Harvard anthropologist who was somewhere off in the distance looking at um I guess an alien, not alien, sorry, Indian uh burial grounds or something or a cave. And then the uh the farmer and his son who uh showed up the day after.</p>
<p>And then the son supposedly came back later uh to see the soldiers cleaning up the area and then burying some of the pieces that they didn&#x27;t want to carry back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; History. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. that those sources are actual sources and most people aren&#x27;t accustomed to looking at them and you know but um those are corroborating sources from people who don&#x27;t know each other of this and what&#x27;s also interesting is that Tyler had been researching and excavating that site for 40 years.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. He knew he knew the owners. And so, you know, I have a suspicion that if the place had been cleaned up, there&#x27;s still a place where perhaps people didn&#x27;t think to clean up. And I&#x27;m not going to mention that publicly because maybe someday I will go back. Um, that uh Tyler and I talked about trying to buy the site uh from the original owners.</p>
<p>And to that end, that day we had late afternoon lunch with the owner, who was a old woman. Uh gosh, how old was that? How old? She was like &gt;&gt; Yeah, she Yeah, she came in with her dog. It was a really, you know, just a really local place, you know, with with a gas station restaurant that had been there for probably since the 40s, maybe even longer. I don&#x27;t know. But yeah, so Gary, I was under the impression that it was not they were homesteading it.</p>
<p>Am I wrong or &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They um Yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s Bureau of Land Management. They had a lease on it.</p>
<p>Um there was an opportunity perhaps to acquire it because it was more land than they needed and maybe they would sell it cheap, but I don&#x27;t think uh we ever followed through on the acquisition. So look, a bunch of new information about this particular event that I had never heard from. I covered this before and um so this was all revelations to me and it there&#x27;s still some confus confusing parts about especially from Tim Taylor um for sure, right? But at least some new data points here about this particular event and it is kind of strange they just all of a sudden come out with this out of nowhere. I don&#x27;t even know like why that just so unusual but I&#x27;ll take it. Right.</p>
<p>Again, Dr. Gary Nolan, Diana Pulka together in an interview talking about this particular event just doesn&#x27;t happen, y&#x27;all. So, this is super unique and I hope you enjoy those clips. Now, if you remember at the beginning, I talked about Gary Nolan giving us some updates about Skywatcher. Well, here we go.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What have you learned about the phenomenon in the last two years, Gary? &gt;&gt; Uh, first, that it&#x27;s more measurable than I thought it would be. Um, and that would be say through the efforts that I&#x27;ve been involved with at Skywatcher. Uh, and that uh, and some of the materials, purely publicly available materials, not secret stuff that people think I have access to, which I don&#x27;t. Uh, so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s more measurable uh, because we can put together sensor systems uh, that can see things. But it&#x27;s harder in that figuring out what the data actually means uh and coming to the kinds of conclusions that people think scientists should be able to come to is more difficult.</p>
<p>So I I I would say it it they&#x27;re both good from the scientific standpoint. We have access to more materials. We know that we have analyses approaches that can approximate them. We&#x27;re beginning to get reproducibility. But as is the case always in science, the more data you get, often the harder it is to come to conclusions to create a standardized picture.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And what&#x27;s also interesting is when Gary Nolan is asked, &quot;What&#x27;s the best evidence, right, of the phenomena that you&#x27;ve come across, he also brings up Skywatcher, but it&#x27;s also interesting that he can&#x27;t just answer that outright, you know. Um, but I also get it, you know, put on the spot, you know, what&#x27;s the best ev Oh my god.&quot; You know, but it is interesting that you just wouldn&#x27;t have that like ready to go. Well, this is the best evidence right here. You know, you just always know that it&#x27;s just there. Why wouldn&#x27;t you know that? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>You know, I&#x27;d probably answer the same way. Uh but either way, take a look. &gt;&gt; What is the best evidence for NHI that you&#x27;ve come across? &gt;&gt; Um so, well, the certainty claim has been misunderstood, but it didn&#x27;t stop it from going worldwide. you know Stanford scientist is 100% sure of this X Y or Z which I hadn&#x27;t actually said that I if you come if you look back at what I said it was basically what do you think the chance that it is here my I said if I were to make a bet it would be 100%. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that extraterrestrial intelligence has visited planet Earth? &gt;&gt; I think you can go a step further.</p>
<p>It hasn&#x27;t just visited. It&#x27;s been here a long time and it&#x27;s still here. Uh, and it has uh a basically um, you know, people talk about the wow signal uh, looking for extraterrestrial intelligence. The wow signal is that people see it on an almost regular basis. That&#x27;s the communication that&#x27;s already here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And and that statement seems so incredible that it&#x27;s tough to believe, right? People hear that and maybe a lot of people here hear that and they don&#x27;t believe it. And so I&#x27;m curious, if you had to assign a probability to that statement that you believe extraterrestrial intelligence has visited visited this planet, what probability would you assign? &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, when you&#x27;re placing a bet on the table on roulette, you&#x27;re going to place it somewhere and you&#x27;re 100% certain it&#x27;s going to be that when you do it. &gt;&gt; Um or you go home uh having lost all your money. Um, so, oh, there&#x27;s a beautiful hummingbird right out of the window looking at me.</p>
<p>Um, so the best evidence, um, I would say some of, well, I there&#x27;s a lot of the best evidence, but stuff that I&#x27;ve been involved with with Skyatcher where we make this supposed call and then things show up within a time frame posted and then I&#x27;ve got pictures of things like right next to the helicopter uh, that showed up uh, or just a coincidence of this on one of our separate events when objects were seen and we have pictures of the stuff flying by rapidly. I mean, because it&#x27;s moving so gosh darn fast that all you see is it across perhaps two or three frames of a of a rapid camera um moving and it&#x27;s not a bug, so I don&#x27;t care what anybody says. Um, so it&#x27;s those kinds of things that convince me further uh that at least not being the government, we can collect that data. &gt;&gt; All right. And also Gary Nolan put out this tweet about Skywatcher because you see um one of Sky Watchers, you know, members, James Fowler, who was heavily, you know, profiled um just in the last few months as being the guy behind sort of their technology, their dog whistle technology of calling them out and bringing, you know, UFOs in with their psionic assets and capturing all the video and photo data and all that stuff.</p>
<p>He has left Skywatcher now. Um, and Gary Nolan made a post kind of um, you know, congratulating him on his new post, but this is where Gary also mentioned um, some new stuff about Skywatcher. So, let&#x27;s take a look at the post. I&#x27;d like to wish James Fowler much success in his new GovCon endeavor and personally thank him for his efforts to support Skywatcher over these past nine months. The team at SkyWatcher is excited about moving into the next phase of our discovery framework and beginning the analytic process of scientifically evaluating the data collected from our field operations over the past 6 months.</p>
<p>We have a vast amount of data to parse through and then analyze. I&#x27;ve worked with big data for my last two decades in the bioace space biosciences space. We could collect the data in a few days then spend the next 6 months analyzing. The scientific process will not be rushed. So please be patient as we are doing this for the good of the community and want to do it the right way.</p>
<p>Once we have a clear understanding of the data significance, it will be compiled into a report and if possible developed into a paper for peer review. That&#x27;s the stage at which I would personally like to see the paper put on one of the Riv servers. I&#x27;m not sure what that says, but regardless, they&#x27;re trying to get their data peer-reviewed. That&#x27;s all we ever want. So, sounds like they have some stuff that maybe we want to see.</p>
<p>All right, I&#x27;ll put a link down in the description if you want to check out the rest of that interview with Diana and Gary Nolan. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s a phenomenal interview. They talk about a lot of different stuff. So, I&#x27;ll put a link down below if you want to go check that out.</p>
<p>All right, betterers. We&#x27;ll see you in the next one. Remember, everyday is a gift, y&#x27;all. Peace. [Music]</p>
