            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>okay hi everyone it&#x27;s been a fantastic conference and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed meeting so many cold fusion enthusiasts and got to chat to some really amazing people and I guess I&#x27;ll just sort of start by saying I love cold fusion cold fusion is is amazing but I&#x27;m also impatient about cold fusion and I&#x27;m impatient about cold fusion because of climate change I&#x27;m from Australia we&#x27;ve got this amazing thing called the Great Barrier Reef but unfortunately about one third of it is now dead it&#x27;s turned white due to bleaching because of because of increases in sea temperature but the problem gets worse the problem gets worse because of because of lag factors so lag factors mean that at the moment were about one point two degrees above pre-industrial but we&#x27;re actually locked in to above two degrees and what that means is there&#x27;s some lag factors around around ice melting but also around the sulfate emissions from coal-fired power stations the mean that mean when we eventually turn the coal-fired power stations off temperature will continue to increase so at the moment we&#x27;re on track for well above four degrees which is which is not going to be pretty so as an example you near where I live we&#x27;ve got these lovely forests the Yarra Valley so these essentially the climate they&#x27;re at four degrees is going to look something like the Flinders Ranges so we&#x27;re talking major changes to ecosystems all across the world by early next century so you know we need to get impatient about cold fusion when it we need to get some solutions out there and so what I&#x27;m what I&#x27;m looking at is is some leaner reactions and I&#x27;m also impatient about leaner reactions now a lot of people go for the scientific approach which which is very important reactions taking days weeks months years so I&#x27;m looking at reactions that take around about one millisecond so this is an image here a picture of one of these reactions taking place so I&#x27;ll just I&#x27;ll just talk you through a bit about my thinking where I&#x27;m coming from so basically basically I&#x27;m going to start with small hydrogen so small hydrogen was sort of heard about the ultra-dense hydrogen here earlier this week we&#x27;ve heard about the stuff I guess in the last presentation around the I guess contracted electron States and I agree that that small hydrogen is is most probably essential to a lot of these processes there&#x27;s a lot of theories out there about what small hydrogen is and I guess you start to look into these theories and it can get come a bit confusing and I guess I&#x27;m going to just tell you about what my theory is I&#x27;m not necessarily saying it&#x27;s correct but when you when you look at it maybe at the end of the presentation you&#x27;ll get some idea and you can you can decide for yourselves where you think it&#x27;s a valid idea so what I&#x27;m looking at is I&#x27;m looking at some changes to there to the fundamental model I&#x27;m looking at what I call wave particle equivalents so that&#x27;s basically the idea that you you model your particles essentially on ways but in waves in sort of circular motions very similar to the torah&#x27; toroidal ideas that we heard in the previous presentation I&#x27;m looking at me Sanh base nucleons when you smash up a proton you don&#x27;t get quite coming out you get me sun&#x27;s coming out so to mimi&#x27;s on seem a lot more sensible as a sub particle for the for the proton and the other nucleons and I guess the just just to summarize that the proton so essentially the new model for the proton is is three mesons basically a PI meson on the outside a kami saan on the inside and then one in the middle was which is essentially about the mass of two pylons and we had actually a presentation earlier this week where they potentially identified that that new meson and we actually out one of the guys spain pulled up a an article a published article which is actually identified this probe this mess on a few years back but no one believed them but I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s definitely consistent with my with my model I guess the other point also is the idea of composites so looking at the alpha particle as a composite rather than two protons and two neutrons and then the nucleus gets built up essentially from these alpha based particles with a few other things where the numbers don&#x27;t quite chop and that actually ties in quite quite nicely with your bonding and chemical bonding properties so in terms of lean our stuff we&#x27;re really looking at right yep okay so in terms of lean our stuff going back to the small hydrogen a hydrogen idea so the small hydrogen model I&#x27;m looking at is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s I guess looking at going below ground state which which Mills the mill Mills sort of came up with a theory around that probably about almost 25 years ago but the difference with my model is that the sizes are not actually based on the Ryder burg model of excited states which the Rydberg model is sort of you&#x27;ve got N equals 1 N equals 2 N equals 3 N equals 4 and the sizes are based just on the end factor now when you&#x27;re actually trying to pile this model to leaner it doesn&#x27;t work but if you if you apply something slightly different which is basically the Rydberg states are essentially two times the previous state so say for example N equals 3 is twice the size of N equals 2 then it starts to make a lot more sense so I&#x27;ll sort of explain that a bit more as we go through the presentation and I guess I guess the the basis for this sort of the the writer burg size I guess it really comes back to this idea of ground state centricity there that everything is sort of a multiple of ground state but if you move away from the ground state as being a sort of be-all and end-all sort of state you sort of start to say well do we need ground state centricity and so the idea of just having these states related to the previous one by a factor of two starts to maybe make more logical sense ok so that the new electron model essentially you&#x27;ve got the ground state there the green one and then and then as you go to excited States you&#x27;re essentially going twice as big and then as you go out to the infinite electron you&#x27;re looking at a wave form and then when then then the new stuff I guess is you&#x27;re going in the other direction you&#x27;re looking at these d excited States so you go you&#x27;re going smaller and smaller and smaller by a factor of two each time now also important there is the primary state so when you do the wave paddle particle equivalence calculation and work out what size should the electron be it doesn&#x27;t come out to the grounds sighs it comes out to this size that around about this primary state an interest to leave the primary state is pretty similar to what the ultra-dense hydrogen guys were saying pretty much exactly what they were looking at in terms of the size of their ultra dense hydrogen the other thing to look at there is the energy transitions between between states and you can simply just work that out with a Rydberg equation by using fractional end values so you get your transitions from N equals to 2 N equals 1 that&#x27;s your 10.2 from infinite to N equals 1 that&#x27;s your 13.6 and then when you start going down your jumps get bigger and bigger so you got 14 40.8 and then then a 100 and eight point eight as you&#x27;re sort of next step down now Neil&#x27;s from black light power came out with some of these these transition energies sort of 25 years ago so it&#x27;s that up but I guess my change is the factor of two wins in the sizes and when you start to think Lenna you later on you&#x27;ll see how that that&#x27;s necessary okay so super chemical reactions so I guess that one of the some things that&#x27;s coming out here is is ok with some of these reactions you know what the energies are coming to coming out and not necessarily high energies potentially there are a lot lower energies and so there&#x27;s this idea potentially of super chemical reactions so chemical reactions tend to be around a few V&#x27;s but if we if we do one of these transitions to a D excited state as as per the previous slide you&#x27;re looking at sort of forty point eight and one hundred and eight point eight you know some higher energies but we&#x27;re not talking nuclear we&#x27;re talking super chemical and that&#x27;s an example there of a reaction that I&#x27;ve managed to create which is potentially a super chemical reaction so a similar similar diagram here but one of the questions that&#x27;s always asked is okay well if we&#x27;ve got these D excited States how come everything doesn&#x27;t just naturally drop down to D excited States and to understand that you&#x27;ve really got to go back to this idea of a background energy and the idea that essentially the states continue up and they get they get more and more excited they get bigger and bigger and bigger but but they&#x27;re all stable up until ground state so ground state&#x27;s stable everything goes up there stays at ground state but then once it gets past ground state it becomes unstable and so it decays by photon decay back to ground state but the lowest states are stable so they naturally transition up to great ground state but you can actually potentially activate these states through through catalytic reactions okay so I&#x27;m now going to talk about dense hydrogen catalysts so if we if we want to actually try and achieve some of these these states of the excited hydrogen we can actually do it quite nicely using some some information which has been previously identified around auger electron energies so as an example here a copper has an auger electron energy of around one hundred and twenty two point five Eevee&#x27;s which matches quite nicely to the transition energy from from the infinite electron to the electron at N equals one ickle white one third with a very small error percentage there and this is some examples of some copper base reactions letting off quite quite a nice amount of light there and this is this is our brass of wet roads here and you can sort of see a nice sort of aura around around the reaction there so so we can develop these catalyst tables based on this information and essentially we can we can work out what the catalysts might be to go from any any state to any other state and this table here is been sort of developed based on all these different all go energy and so you can see copper there up up in the the top left and then if we look across it so the purple ones are the really good matches that&#x27;s less than 0.1% now energy match so the next one across it at one on five you say well what&#x27;s that well that is actually palladium again a very nice energy match okay so so now I want to talk a bit more I guess about this this new model and leaner so essentially the the new theoretical basis that I&#x27;m working with is we&#x27;re looking at creating these new dense hydrogen forms of hydrogen and then we&#x27;re looking at potentially capturing these dense forms of hydrogen by another nucleus and creating our transmutations so I guess the the idea here is that once we get down to these these lower dense hydrogen States their effectiveness for creating lino reactions goes up unfortunately also that the catalyst effectiveness tends to go down once we get too high so there&#x27;s potentially some sweet spots around there somewhere in the middle where we get a bit of reasonable catalyst effectiveness and also increased potential for for dense hydrogen formation and leaner okay so going back to the small hydrogen IDs so small hydrogen we&#x27;re looking at around about three to four hundred fermions as as the radius so that&#x27;s about N equals one on eight and we say okay well what&#x27;s going to give us that that that transition energy needed if around about eight eight seventy V&#x27;s well that actually works out quite nicely is nickel with it with an error percentage of 0.04 percent so you know it&#x27;s it seems to be working quite nicely with what we know as lunar catalysts are there more catalysts yes so you can you can see in this diagram here some of the other stuff coming in so that there&#x27;s another one next to nickel there&#x27;s there&#x27;s also I think we had some mention of lanthanum earlier in the week by by John Paul Bavarian that actually fits in quite nicely at N equals one on 10 and then as we go higher up we sort of see strontium as a cone iam silver and it been up to titanium and also interestingly lithium&#x27;s in there quite nicely had N equals N equals 1/2 so we were starting to see pretty much all the catalysts that we&#x27;ve seen in Lena appearing in this in these in these charts which you know to me is a it&#x27;s quite a surprise when it came out but um yeah since the work quite nicely this one here this is a photo of a strontium hydroxide reaction which creates quite a nice nice sort of blue spark and I guess I&#x27;ve also done a whole lot of experimentation with other hydroxides so I can compare the against the reaction more morphology of say calcium hydroxide barium hydroxide and a whole range of different other hydroxides and the strong gem stuff comes out looking looking quite different quite a nice little flash reaction they&#x27;re so dense hydrogen capture so there&#x27;s obviously a two-stage process and I guess once we form these these dense hydrogen entities we need to work out what&#x27;s going to capture them so I guess that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the sort of lithium is obviously been identified as something boran&#x27;s been talked about a fair bit potassium was used in a lot of earlier experiments but essentially I guess the idea of these sort of try TM groups on the outside these sort of extra try TM seems to have something to do with what&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed to to increase their potential for capture so an example of one of the experiments I did early on I was really looking for a very low cost leaner experiment sort of under five hundred dollars so I used a couple of soundless steel lighting plates of potassium hydroxide electrolysis and then hit it within far infrared heat heat lamp and an excess energy came out of that one I guess also potassium hydroxide with catalytic electrodes there you can see a nice reaction with a nice big big halo coming out of it so the hydroxides are often a relatively simple low-cost way to have a look at some of the potential around these reactions experimental confirmation so I guess I had a theory here I had a few nice light flashes and you know great to show the photos to your friends and all that sort of stuff but you know at some point you got to probably got to do a bit of science so I&#x27;ve this is my contraption that I&#x27;ve been using to do the testing and it&#x27;s got a hell of a lot of capacitors and you&#x27;re looking at a DC pulse but but interests interestingly the important thing is not to just contact the electrodes and leave them conte contacted you&#x27;ve actually got to bounce the electrodes off each other and so a bit been doing that getting the reactions and then we&#x27;ve sent the electrodes off for XRF analysis and also obviously taking the photography of it as well too so I guess guess what what we&#x27;re thinking here is when we make contact you get a large flow of electrons going through and then as the electrodes come apart you&#x27;ve almost got a it&#x27;s sort of like a water hammer effect yes so your electrons are probably in a pressure situation because the the flow is essentially restrictions the idea is the electrons start to essentially pressurize and potentially create these these smaller and smaller sized electrons so I mean I guess the idea is there you may be able to do a lot of this stuff without you know catalyst potentially or whatever but just using a almost like a pressure flow situation to create these smaller electron States and so in terms of the XRF analysis so I guess Molly medinan electrodes something something had a look at and so it looked at so we&#x27;ve got some decreases in phosphorus and magnesium but they can be ruled out in terms of basically boil off effects that we heard about earlier in the week we did have some increases increases in calcium titanium and chromium and so I guess if you look go back to your tables you say well my duodenum is an average catalyst for H N equals 1/4 and then N equals 1/6 tungsten electrodes increases in iron copper zinc and zirconium and tungsten comes out as a very nice catalyst for H equals N equals 1 on six titanium titanium here is very interesting when you look at this reaction morphology you&#x27;re actually getting these these secondary reaction effects and someone&#x27;s described this as the sparkler effect and whether it&#x27;s happening in sparklers or not I&#x27;m not sure but it but it is very interesting that you get the central reaction you&#x27;re not getting such so much of these halo effects but but whatever is in there is coming out and then I guess essentially reacting a second time and that second reaction is obviously very very high-energy you can sort of see those sort of sparkle of formations there you know you&#x27;re getting a hell of a lot of reactions happening there and you even saw that you can see if you look closely even getting these sort of tertiary reactions happening so if you do the analysis on titanium where you find out that titanium is actually not very catalytic at the lower in 1 and n values but it becomes catalytic and around and equals 1 unknown teen so if you do your calculations again and look at the radius now it actually works out that if you are getting some N equals 1 on 19 you&#x27;ve actually got a radius around point 1 FM which is actually obviously smaller than the radius of the of the proton and then so you&#x27;ve actually start to think about you know are we potentially having some sub nuclear reactions and I guess the sort of the the really those sort of spark the like formations are we looking at a totally new class of reaction here happening and so when you do the XRF analysis on this stuff we got a massive increase in zinc around point 2 percent no that&#x27;s not point 2 percent increase in the amount of zinc that&#x27;s that&#x27;s point 2 percent increase in the total elemental composition and so yeah that was different and that was just in a few reactions so you know we are looking at and if you and if you go to your basic ball off sort of explanation well no actually Zeek should have boiled off well before titanium so that that percentage should should probably be a lot higher so you know you you I guess the idea of fast leno is really coming to the fore you know potentially you can achieve a leno reaction very very quickly in less than a thousandth of a second and i guess the the sort of the the summary in terms of all this stuff is is i think maybe we almost need to start thinking again in terms of what we&#x27;re looking at here and i guess my thinking on this stuff at the moment really is we&#x27;ve got three potential classes of reaction here rather than just one the first is the super chemical so these electron transitions the second is leaner so that&#x27;s when we&#x27;re starting to look at our transmutations and that they may may be catalyzed by our super chemical transitions in the first place and then the third one is is these sub nuclear reactions there and you can you can see on the far right that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s some some hydrogen loaded electrons there with a with a fairly large explosive output so in terms of the climate change side of things I think we perhaps need to need to have a think about what we want to do in terms of mass production of energy systems for the general population and I guess my thinking is okay you know all the transmutation stuff it does start to get complicated we&#x27;ve got a whole lot of things going they&#x27;re probably suitable for large-scale reactors but I mean if we&#x27;re talking about sort of stuff for domestic use smaller scale then I think there&#x27;s there&#x27;s enough potential in these super chemical reactions to create very high energy outputs way higher than chemical at a very small scale potentially without any other sort of nuclear issues in some ways if we&#x27;re trying to build a super chemical reactor we actually want to try and avoid anything to do with leaner you know we don&#x27;t want our transmutations we just want our energy coming out so you know perhaps a a totally new perspective on on on cold fusion but yeah hopefully whoever works it out we can all work it out soon and we can we can get some new systems out there and hope to curb the the climate change problem in the near future thank you we&#x27;ve gone way over for this session if there&#x27;s a short question thank you excellent presentation on the spark effect we saw that with iron in with surrounds car it went through an entire one centimeter a rebar in 0.6 of a second normally that only happens with nanoparticles like it&#x27;s paralytic iron in air and it produced worksite crystals of FeO single oxide you doing 200 joules they domain Co use 300 joules I would suggest one other experiment understanding cold electricity I suggested cutting the return line and attaching a power monitor to the rebar it was insulated no other power produced one from 0.3 volts I would suggest having an experiment to see if you&#x27;ve got any residual something in there the producers called electricity after you&#x27;ve done your shock okay that&#x27;s that&#x27;s interesting I&#x27;ve sort of heard talk around these sort of back currents coming out of some of these these type of systems I I haven&#x27;t done anything but it would actually be something reasonably simple to do with a essentially a coil of wire around one of the conductors and and an oscilloscope so yeah that would be definitely interesting to investigate that and see see what would happened with you can see the videos of the same kind of effects on on on YouTube yeah okay good</p>
