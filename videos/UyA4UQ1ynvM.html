            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Good morning, good evening, or good afternoon depending on where and when you&#x27;re watching this podcast. I&#x27;m Thomas Fesa, my friends, and this is Disclosure Tonight. Happy Saturday. Saturday, February 14th. It&#x27;s Valentine&#x27;s Day.</p>
<p>Hope you had a good one, folks, and hope you you&#x27;re either heading into it or heading out of it. But either way, today is for your loved ones and those you care about the most. On that note, let&#x27;s go ahead and welcome in our audience and see who the heck we have out there. People I care about our audience. How about that? We have Amanda&#x27;s out there along with Amigga Rules.</p>
<p>Andy W&#x27;s here. He is in the chat. He&#x27;s in the back. Can&#x27;t wait to see what Andy brings to conversation today. We&#x27;ve got Bradley and Craig Smith.</p>
<p>Dan Lorv is here along with Eliza Teal. We&#x27;ve got Firefly and Greyhair Discoveries is in the chat. JJ&#x27;s out there along with Jay Cat Meow Jericho and King Bull 90s. How about that? I saw Kelly Broer Piercing Blue Eyes earlier. I know you&#x27;re out there somewhere, Kelly.</p>
<p>Who else we&#x27;ve got out there? We&#x27;ve got Max Metal. Uh, Metal Gaming 420. Start passing it around. Stop being a Bogart Metal. Prism Films US is here along with Sam.</p>
<p>We got Scooby-Doo Gooby who&#x27;s got a video of [clears throat] a UFO. He thinks it&#x27;s a saucer. Send it across. Scooby, jump in the back. We&#x27;ll cover it today.</p>
<p>Shto&#x27;s out there along with the ginger effect art. And well, that&#x27;s our audience today. On that note, let&#x27;s go ahead and uh jump into the studio and enjoy the solar storm that&#x27;s going on in uh Levi Lapland over in Philander right now. There&#x27;s an amazing solar storm that&#x27;s been going on there every single day this week, and today was not a day for it not to happen. That&#x27;s where I got the title card.</p>
<p>I went to go look what was going on. It was one of those things they call a cinnamon uh roll or cinnamon bun. Let me bring that up here and just show it. Where is it at? It&#x27;s here somewhere. Intro silence.</p>
<p>Here we go. Just a beautiful picture out there of beauty, my friends. Had to go ahead and just share with everybody. Yeah, this is a view that was, you know, not that long ago earlier today and it&#x27;s just going on and it&#x27;s cranking and it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous. Uh, it&#x27;s a great website to check out if you like watching Aurora Borealis like I do.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to go ahead and share with everybody in the chat. I think my I can actually share links with the chat. So, let me go ahead and do this and put it out there. There we go. save any bookmarks, folks.</p>
<p>It is just absolutely gorgeous. It&#x27;s non-stop and it&#x27;s just gorgeous stuff. So, that&#x27;s why I actually had to take that, put in my background when we could go ahead and start the show. Yeah. And with the uh stuff that&#x27;s coming up with the uh giant chronal hole that&#x27;s coming our way, maybe uh reaching down into the um mid latitudes in the upcoming days, the uh tomorrow, tonight, and the next day.</p>
<p>the solar storm is kick uh the solar wind is kicking up which will bring the auroras down a lot lower. It&#x27;s great stuff to say the absolute least. On that note, what an interesting week. A lot of things happening. Disclosure, not that much today.</p>
<p>You know, I have to admit I got up a little bit later than usual. Started going through the feed on X after story after story after story, going through all my contacts, all the different stuff. This is probably the slowest day that I&#x27;ve uh seen in disclosure. Absolutely odd. Uh I guess this is where it&#x27;s headed, but there was an interesting story.</p>
<p>If I can get across to this in a second. I think I can get it from here. Get out of this pose. Shrink it down a little bit right now. Oh, I I took down the wrong video.</p>
<p>Let me do it in a different place and I&#x27;ll go ahead and bring this up. Yeah, interesting story coming about NASA covering up evidence of things going on in our solar system that apparently they don&#x27;t want us to know about. And there&#x27;s facts included. So, let me see if I can find this bookmark here and get it to it really good. Hopefully, everyone&#x27;s had a good Valentine&#x27;s Day out there so far.</p>
<p>I would hope so. [laughter] Oh, let&#x27;s do this unexpected. Laura, how you doing, my dear lady? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m good. I&#x27;m doing a little back research um on stuff that was remote viewed back in 2024, September 17th, and how it relates to something that Jake Barber said about Michael Aerrera and the people that were picked up and why they were chosen. Um and I came up with the name of Julia Mossbridge, too.</p>
<p>Um is involved with this kind of research. And um basically they were chosen in terms of they had less plastic chemicals they were exposed to. They lived off the land in natural manner. And there&#x27;s something about that that he said caused them to be better for the program and training. It&#x27;s like his way of saying it was experience in third world countries.</p>
<p>Um, people that live simpler life outdoors more have less contaminants in the food and their drugs and their culture seem to a little bit better at disassociating and heightening their intuition. &gt;&gt; So, yours apart we got we picked up on that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, luckily I did grow up in a community. We had our own actually not a community.</p>
<p>I I grew up in a neighborhood. We all had our own wells. Granted, the water after a while tasted like sulfur. Absolutely horrible to smell. However, I did not get exposed until I was an adult to uh putting fluoride in the water.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I had early with the well as well, &gt;&gt; but then teenager. Yeah, I did too. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. So, it could be one of the reasons why we&#x27;re so &gt;&gt; in tune with what&#x27;s going on around us. Laura, &gt;&gt; could be.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right, so let&#x27;s &gt;&gt; thought I&#x27;d bring that up. Just working on it right now. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Let&#x27;s see if I can get to this one here.</p>
<p>No, not that one. I know I&#x27;ve got another one here. Either way, let&#x27;s get into Desktop Thomas. All right, so this is coming to us uh from the Sentinel briefing. This is an interesting article to say the least.</p>
<p>The Silent Edit. How scientific establishments are scrubbing anomalies from the record. When NASA quietly alters a database and prestige journals refuse peer review, the question isn&#x27;t just about scientific rigor. It&#x27;s about who controls the narrative. Interesting point is we talked about this last night.</p>
<p>If information or facts come out scient or the people of the boards who look at the stuff who own the data are more likely to change the data rather than keep it pristine to basically say well everything is within the category of the box where it belongs versus finding these anomalies that actually show something is real out there. What are we talking about? Well, uh, going through in the hunt for threei Atlas and the interstellar object analysis. Let&#x27;s get into it. I&#x27;ll go. In the world of open source intelligence, which is also known as OSN, we look for the diff or difference between what is said yesterday and what is claimed today.</p>
<p>Usually, we apply this uh to geopolitical troop movements or corporate scubbings. But this week, the front line of information suppression moved to the most sterile environment imaginable. The CEO fireball catalog over at NASA in Jet Propulsion Laboratories. We&#x27;ve been tracking the ongoing saga of old Professor Avi Lobe and the Galileo project closely. For months, the resistance to new data regarding interstellar objects, specifically the anomalous threeey atlas, has been palpable.</p>
<p>But in a recent incident detailed by Avi signals a shift from passive skepticism to active data level interference. This is what I&#x27;m talking about. Changing the data which NASA we&#x27;ve known for the longest time. They cover stuff up. They turn off the cameras on the space station.</p>
<p>They did it back on the space shuttle. They altered the pictures that came to us from the Apollo missions on the moon. So let&#x27;s get into this. Here&#x27;s a deep dive. So the glitch in the matrix a few days ago.</p>
<p>[snorts] uh Avi lobe in his post-docctorate uh document Richard Colette identified two meteors from 2002 and 2025 in NASA&#x27;s CNOS database that statistically appeared to be interstellar in origin. This is a massive claim. It implies that solar solar system is indeed permeable frequently visited by objects from other star systems some of which might not be mere rocks. This is kind of like equivalent to if you want to call it Dr. V&#x27;s uh Dr.</p>
<p>Beatatric Vitriel who went out there and searched the records to find stuff that shouldn&#x27;t be there and to bring it forward. Luckily, her data wasn&#x27;t computerized, but it was actually data that was put on uh um plates of glass that could never be changed once they they&#x27;ve been exposed. Uh they wrote a um they wrote a paper, they posted it, and then the system rejected it. Let me get this a little bit further to the side so we can see it. Here we go.</p>
<p>Uh, the system. Come on. I&#x27;m doing it wrong again. Okay, here we go. Oh, okay.</p>
<p>[sighs] Sorry. And this uh the system, they didn&#x27;t issue press release. They didn&#x27;t add footnote explaining the recalculation. They simply flipped the sign on one velocity component of the 2025 meteor. Uh less than 24 hours after the paper went public, NASA JPL updated the CNOS database.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t issue a press release. No, they didn&#x27;t add a footnote explaining the recalculation. They simply flipped the sign on the velocity component component of the 2025 meteor. The single edit silently and effectively grounded the object mathematically forcing it back into the solar system origin. Now, if I get into this Oh, we&#x27;re not going to be able to see this.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can bring this down to my desktop. I&#x27;ll be able to zoom in on it. This is before the paper where we&#x27;re going to be getting into some stats for this. Let me uh get this across. Let&#x27;s zoom it up a little bit.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about. something observed on the 2nd the 12th of February 2025 where it shows all the stats going across and more importantly its particular trajectories and everything to that particular extent. Now coming out of this get out of here as per our paper after our paper with a signal flip of velocity component of vy which makes the meteor solar system origin rather than from the earth. So they took the velocity y and flipped it from a positive to a negative. Got to wonder why Loe caught them.</p>
<p>Because like any good investigator, he had the receipts. Using the internet archive known as the wayback machine, he was able to show the before and after. If the data was genuinely incorrect, scientific integrity demands a public correction. A silent retro retroactive edit made only after a challenging paper is published is not science. Really audience, it&#x27;s a cover up.</p>
<p>Before the change, it showed the data with a plus velocity [snorts] of point of plus 15.2 km/s. [snorts] After the cenos&#x27;s data edit, they came in with a negative 15.2 km/s. Taking that object and grounding it to our solar system versus where its interstellar potential origins. Got to wonder why, Laura. It seems like it&#x27;s a cover up that NASA always tries to do.</p>
<p>If there&#x27;s evidence out there that could show there&#x27;s more than Earth, they don&#x27;t want the public to know about it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And now they changed their designation. &gt;&gt; I mean, they&#x27;ve been lying along and working for the government, but now it&#x27;s official. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly. So, the these are the gatekeepers, right? &gt;&gt; Exactly. There&#x27;s others who are getting paid very well by even aerospace companies. If we&#x27;re to listen to uh Danny She and what he said about a few of them &gt;&gt; talking about potentially Mick West &gt;&gt; possibly &gt;&gt; actually a gentleman with the initials JS who will be coming out with a book very soon hopefully in fe February. &gt;&gt; Oh um &gt;&gt; Mr.</p>
<p>J &gt;&gt; Jason Sans &gt;&gt; J &gt;&gt; J Stratton &gt;&gt; J Stratton. Yeah, you took the words off the top of my mind it couldn&#x27;t get out. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; and Travis &gt;&gt; Jay Stratton. So, they&#x27;re thinking that Jay Stratton&#x27;s new book is going to be filled with misinformation. &gt;&gt; Well, not necessarily, but what what Danny, now this is not coming from me.</p>
<p>Um Danny was saying aerospace industries are engaged in pay bribery, paying these well, let&#x27;s just call it payment for keeping secrets, hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Um he said he claimed they&#x27;ve hired guys like Jay Stratton and like Travis &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s why they had set up their different firms that are dealing with ultra propulsion methods whatever first one they set up down in Alabama they shut that they hadn&#x27;t shut it down they went then moved it through Virginia didn&#x27;t they &gt;&gt; uh yes and I also we did look at Jay a long time ago sorry Jay we kind of wanted to know and a couple years back and it was like uh he could go either way. Can&#x27;t really trust them. And I got international uh working for some international people, which was quite interesting. &gt;&gt; Yeah, very much so.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s just crazy, you know. But then again, there were a bunch of uh posts on Reddit that came out at one time from Jay Stratton&#x27;s wife that were really negative and almost derogatory against Lou. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Infighting. that that makes it even more interesting for us to wonder what&#x27;s really going on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But I&#x27;m still going to buy his book because inquiring minds want to know. &gt;&gt; Oh gosh. Absolutely. I&#x27;ll have to put it next to my book of uh eminent and lose next book when it comes out. Let&#x27;s get into it.</p>
<p>Well, NASA scrub the data. The academic publishing world closed its ranks. Avi reports that an associate editor at a prestigious astrophysics journal. Why is it all these always the associates, the people who are, you know, the staffers behind it that shut it down, refused to even send this new paper to peer review? The reason given, quote, I believe your work would be rather limited interest to the astrophysics research community as a whole. This wasn&#x27;t one-off.</p>
<p>The same editor used this exact template to reject two previous papers on three Atlas. one a paper on three eye atlases anti-tal physics later published in monthly notices of the Royal Astronomically Society to rave reviews. Now, this one is this is this the first time we&#x27;ve seen an anti-tail on a comet, right? As far as I can remember, cuz usually when a comet comes in towards the sun, the comet itself, R2-D2 is the comet, the tail is going away from my big head, which is the sun. But this one we actually had a comet tail that was going towards the sun not away which is something relatively new. Now uh this definition of a two a paper on the objects anomalous rotation and wobble which was again a new observation.</p>
<p>This is the definition of a choke point when a single individual can unilaterally decide the analysis of a potential interstellar probe is off limit or interest. um they are not acting as an editor. They are acting as a filter for accepted reality. Meaning we are rejecting the truth of what&#x27;s happening out there. Why does this matter? I know it&#x27;s obvious low, but this does matter, my friends.</p>
<p>For those for those of us tracking 3A Atlas, this pattern is alarmingly familiar. Same stuff we see in UFOs on a regular basis time like we&#x27;ve seen before on the space station, on this space shuttle and everything. We are seeing a bitrification in the scientific community. This is the same kind of actions that we saw that kept the UAP disclosure agreement out of the NDAAB. It wasn&#x27;t the senators who kicked it out.</p>
<p>It was the staffers who pushed the senators not to support it. Now the data hunters, those using sensors, satellites and OS in uh intelligence methods to analyze what is actually happening in our skies like Avi Lobo, the Galileo project and independent analysis analysis against the curators who believe their role is to protect the stability of established narratives by filtering out data that doesn&#x27;t fit the standard model. This is the same thing where we&#x27;re start treating science like it&#x27;s a religion. You cannot challenge the word of God. You cannot challenge the accepted methods that we have out there.</p>
<p>And if you do, it&#x27;s heresy. And we&#x27;re going to shut that down. The unborn babies of scientific discovery is, as Lo puts it, are being called before they can even reach the peer review incubator. At the Sentinel, we believe the truth is found in anomalies the data points that don&#x27;t fit. When a government agency silently alters a database to make an anomaly disappear, they aren&#x27;t just cleaning up a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>They are trying to close the door that has already been blown off its hinges. Wow. There uh now Sentinel is watching for more edits. They&#x27;re archiving the data. The data is out there along in the um in the internet wayback machine.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s interesting to say the least. This kind of stuff is going on. Any thoughts from our friends in the back? Laura, this is an interesting topic to say the least. &gt;&gt; It is and that&#x27;s why I try to capture things and I have many books that um get it in print just in case things disappear and keep them keep dates because it is it&#x27;s an evolving situation and I like to have the evidence. &gt;&gt; You know, back in 2005 when I was working with Barry Freeman, I&#x27;ll bring up his name frequently.</p>
<p>Guy I love uh rest his soul. Uh he died because his addicted son stole all of his heart meds and uh he met an untimely death unfortunately. But anyway, um Barry was one of the ones back in 2005 when I was starting to work with him. He said, &quot;You see anything on the internet, create a PDF, PDF it, save it to your hard drive because the internet changes on a regular basis and if you have the data, you&#x27;ll always have the original record, which is the same thing, Laura. &gt;&gt; Correct.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Absolutely. On that note, let me go ahead and get back into our next piece we&#x27;re going to be getting up to. Let me see if I can just flip this up. We&#x27;ve got a video here of uh Colonel Carl Nell from his appearance over at the uh Soul Conference.</p>
<p>Uh it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve never played here on Disclosure Tonight. It&#x27;s coming to us from Soul itself. So, let&#x27;s go ahead and get this one up and play it and uh we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll pause and go through it as time is going on. So, let&#x27;s jump into this piece, everybody. Here we go.</p>
<p>[music] The 2025 [music] Soul Foundation Symposium. We are playing this with permission from Soul. We appreciate their support of disclosure tonight and uh being able to show their content on our show. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s obviously humbling and gratifying to be back uh to talk at the third Soul Symposium. Uh Souls really moved the bar on this topic as you can see from uh the first presentation as well as what&#x27;s going to come uh later today.</p>
<p>I thought uh it would be interesting since we&#x27;re all here in Italy to maybe just do a comparison between uh the modern era of of sort of UFO UAP investigation and the period that&#x27;s called the the five good Roman emperors from uh from the death of Dichian to the rise of cometus which given kind of talked about is in in some sense maybe somewhat suffic facitiously as the sort of the best period in all of human history uh at least from the perspective of 1788. So I thought we&#x27;d we&#x27;d talk a little bit about that and relate that actually back to some of the things that um were happening in Congress as well. So um we&#x27;ll kind of follow this uh outline if we can go to that. So I&#x27;ll talk a little bit about the nature of knowledge uh get into uh lines of evidence and how we can know uh or not know what truth is. uh this comparison that I talked about and then this idea of the congressional briefing book that was put together that was some of the things that were going on behind the scenes that might be interesting.</p>
<p>So uh we&#x27;ll talk about the nature of knowledge first. So epistemology obviously is the philosophy that uh examines the nature origin and limits of knowledge. If we go back to to Plato and you know 400 BC he talks about knowledge being justified true belief and then you get into this idea of well how do you how do you sort of justify belief and so there&#x27;s this thing called the Munchhousen trillemma that uh the German philosopher Hans Alrech kind of proposed back in 1968 that highlights sort of the three-fold uh problem of justified true belief called after munchen and you can see in the photo there, this sort of um fictional kind of comedic figure that&#x27;s trying to pull himself out of the muck with his horse by the by the roots of his hair. You know, in other words, this sort of circular problem of of knowledge. And so, we&#x27;ve got sort of the idea of knowledge based on foundational facts, which I would relate to sort of the UAP first principles evidence.</p>
<p>Beatatric talked a little bit about this, but basically life evolved here pretty quickly. There&#x27;s maybe 20 billion sunlike stars in the galaxy. The amino acids are uh present in interstellar material. Every planet, every sun star we&#x27;ve looked at has planets. Uh we&#x27;ve got life that can live in geothermal vents and in um in in oil under the crust.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got microbes that can live in space. This idea that uh you know faster than light travel probably is possible since Alabir sort of solved Einstein&#x27;s equations for for at least a theoretical way of doing that. you know, dark energy exists that uh could equate to negative energy, which is sort of the means that might be applied to do that. So, sort of a lot of first principles evidence that would suggest that there&#x27;s uh you know, really a higher bar to argue that that life isn&#x27;t common and a higher bar to argue maybe that life and intelligent life don&#x27;t exist. So, so you&#x27;ve got the sort of foundational facts sort of argument and you&#x27;ve got then this idea of um beliefs justified by other beliefs.</p>
<p>So, you&#x27;ve got whistleblowers that have come forward and you&#x27;ve got this testimonial evidence. We&#x27;ve had three hearings. You&#x27;ve had uh the Leslie Clean 2017 article, the New York Times. So, like a lot of people coming out and basically saying this, including presidents, including um uh senators, etc. And then, of course, uh you&#x27;ve got what would essentially be sort of self-supported evidence.</p>
<p>And again, obviously, Beatric talked about this, probably the most compelling of the self-supported evidence, the sensor data. uh the transients, but also you&#x27;ve got documentary evidence. And I&#x27;ve kind of talked about some of these in previous talks. Uh and maybe we&#x27;ll talk a little bit more about the documentary part in this particular talk. But but the trouble is with each of these uh lines of evidence.</p>
<p>See if we&#x27;re going to get this to work. Okay, here we go. Uh is this sort of problem of uh justifying true belief, right? So, so foundational facts can be argued as being essentially dogmatic or essentially you know assuming the premise in the argument and uh you know so the way around that is sort of foundationalism that suggests that if I base my argument on foundational principles then I should assume that&#x27;s valid but the counterargument is it&#x27;s like essentially circular you&#x27;re you&#x27;re creating a sort of a dogmatism your AC axioms sort of imply the conclusion and so that&#x27;s the problem uh justified by other beliefs, you know, you create this sort of regression. Well, if it&#x27;s if your assertion is based on somebody else&#x27;s assertion, then you can question that assertion and ultimately you&#x27;ve got to trace that back. And you know, so the argument is, well, if that uh chain of reasoning is sort of infinite, then then we&#x27;re good.</p>
<p>But, you know, obviously there&#x27;s not an infinite chain of people that are going to kind of [laughter] assert that, right? So, infinitism is sort of countered by this regressive problem. and then self-supported. The idea is if I get a coherent set of facts like all these things interconnect then I should have sort of more confidence in that than just like sort of a linear chain. But again you know you can take that back and says into uh being somewhat circular. So this is the problem of justified true belief and so u relating this now back to the uh you know the five Roman emperors.</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius basically said everything we hear is opinion not fact. everything we see is perspective, not truth. And that&#x27;s something I think we&#x27;ve got to kind of take into account as we&#x27;re trying to convince the folks that are sort of naysayers. And so, what standards of evidence are reasonable to sort of justify belief and move belief from uh uh a status of uncertainty into a status of knowledge. And so that kind of gets to this next slide, which is the standards of evidence.</p>
<p>And Gary&#x27;s talked about this, I think he talked about this at the first Soul conference and it&#x27;s been a I think a perennial theme of the Soul Foundation to try to figure out like what what standards of evidence are appropriate, how do we define that and then how can we measure our progress against those standards? And so using some sort of legal terms here, there&#x27;s maybe Oops. Why did this screw up? has slipped out foundation and and I would use that term because you&#x27;ve got whistleblower testimony, you&#x27;ve got sensor data, you&#x27;ve got documents, you&#x27;ve got, you know, science is a big piece of this, but you&#x27;ve got like a larger context as well. So, reasonable suspicion, the standard sort of used in the uh United States for a law enforcement officer to sort of stop and question somebody, you got to have some suspicion to do that. probable cause in in the United States. You can arrest somebody for that, right? Preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got like 51%, you know, or or greater than 50% leans one way or another, then I can like ascribe to that, right? And I don&#x27;t think necessarily science would sort of kind of follow along with that, right? And then you&#x27;ve got clear and convincing, which is basically like let&#x27;s wait the evidence, right? Like some evidence is really more compelling by its nature. So it&#x27;s not just a summation of you know uh uh greater than 50% but um you know what is more compelling and then finally you know the the ultimate standard at least in the United States is uh to convict somebody sufficient evidence to send somebody to prison for life or perhaps even give them the death penalty which would be beyond reasonable doubt right and so this is where the conversation usually ends and say okay well if I can meet one or more of these standards then you know there&#x27;s sort of reason to accept this certainly in a legal sense. Um but like the definition here almost sort of implies the converse, right? So if there&#x27;s reasonable doubt then there must be a thing that&#x27;s like an unreasonable doubt, right? And and I think that&#x27;s kind of the problem with this particular topic. there&#x27;s there&#x27;s an unreasonable person standard that I would argue and evidence suggests is sort of been helped along let&#x27;s say created by u the stigma that&#x27;s applied to this topic and also uh essentially an &gt;&gt; quick comment from someone coming in the chat they said about Carl now being able to give us let me turn this off here let me get this up so I can show this for the audience I just want to go ahead and cover this really quick I wish Carl Nell would give us an example how he&#x27;s 100% % certain the NHI is here. Instead of hearing say like uh he did last time that he got asked and he was uh so sure he just said, &quot;Well, others are saying it.&quot; Well, apparently uh it&#x27;s been reported in the past here on Disclosure Tonight, that Colonel Carl Nell during his uh leadership at Ariccom, which is our Africa um if you want to call it defense locations, that there was a UAP down UAP retrieval that happened in Sudan.</p>
<p>So, the thing is, no one&#x27;s ever asked him that question. Be interesting to see where he comes up on it. Laura, your hand is up. Go ahead. Yeah, I&#x27;d also add that uh just recently on a podcast called Astral Recall Podcast, Chris Bledsoe was being interviewed and he talked about Carl Carl Nell.</p>
<p>He talked about um the term catastrophic disclosure. Uh Bledsoe was sitting in a a cafe at the Congressional Grill, Washington DC with him as well as a whole group of other people, senator, congressman from M MIT and other people. There were 12 of us having dinner and they were asking questions and he was talking about a back in the time when Iran was firing missiles at Israel. It was just before Trump took office in November. Um and he said that there were drones that came up or he said that what they said there were drones but they lied.</p>
<p>He said there were um to confuse people, they put up our own drones and he was saying that they he was told that this was going to happen more and more as we try and fight and throw missiles at each other for some reason. I guess they don&#x27;t want us to or whatever group. Um and then Carl responded that would be cat catastrophic disclosure. He&#x27;s and so Bledo said well you need to tell people then. So, he seems to think that the beings are forcing the disclosure on us.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. I&#x27;ve had this inkling feeling for the longest time. It&#x27;s one of those things you just know. Perhaps in the past the non-human intelligence made a deal, if you want to call it, with our federal government. They would slow things down potentially in the uh on the and we&#x27;d give you some tech, slow things down with regards to how often they&#x27;re being seen.</p>
<p>We give you some technology, but by a specific date that you must go ahead and disclose to the public of what&#x27;s come of why we&#x27;re here, what&#x27;s coming our way. Otherwise, shit&#x27;s going to hit the fan. We have to work as one. And I would without any doubt in my mind would actually have to say that our the way our government works and other world government works is deadlines come, deadlines go and them thinking in Washington, what are they going to do to keep us from not giving the truth? They&#x27;re not going to do anything. But things have been picking up for the longest time.</p>
<p>and things have been accelerating while the uh if you want to call it the AFOSI has been pushing back along with the DoD to shove the freaking UFO uh situation back in the bottle like they have. We&#x27;re heading into something at that&#x27;s in our near-term future that is going to be catastrophic. Not because the non-human intelligence wanted it that way, because the schmucks in our government have been doing everything to keep the truth out from getting to the public. Because they&#x27;re worried about the money they&#x27;ve got, religion, they&#x27;re worried about their governments, not necessarily worrying about humanity as a whole. &gt;&gt; And our ability to see and detect them is increasing.</p>
<p>Case in point, the recent conference that they had, I believe you saw. It was called 2026 UAP Detection and Tracking Summit, which I need to finish watching, but there you have it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. So, let&#x27;s get back to this. Appreciate you chiming in.</p>
<p>This is that&#x27;s what I like about watching videos. Sometimes we used to chime in a lot of times. People would say, &quot;Just let us watch the video.&quot; But when we&#x27;re hearing things and seeing it, we&#x27;ve got to stop. We&#x27;ve got to talk about it because otherwise I&#x27;m super ADD, my friends. I will completely forget about what I just heard if I didn&#x27;t jump in.</p>
<p>On that note, I&#x27;m controlling it as best as I can. Let&#x27;s get back to this video and uh see where we go. Let me turn the chat back on again. And people keep on asking about Mike. He&#x27;s on hiatus, which means he&#x27;s not gone.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s on hiat hiatus for the meantime. We&#x27;re working on how to kind of, you know, figure out where and when to bring him back because he&#x27;s been a pivotal part of the show for the longest time. I mean, he&#x27;s probably one of the reasons why we still have disclosure tonight as well. While some things happened that were greatly unfortunate. Yes, he&#x27;s still grounded, but like any good parent, eventually grounding has to go away.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s go ahead and get back to this if we can. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Organized disinfo campaign that&#x27;s that&#x27;s documented, you know, in the condent committee report and the Robinson panel and some of the stuff we&#x27;ll get into here. So in some sense what we maybe need to do is convince people to unlearn what they think they know uh and get to a state of atroxia that the like the classical Greeks would sort of said or peronius would say is essentially a state of uh withholding judgment um before all the evidence is in. And if we can kind of just get the vast majority of people into this atroxia state uh or or reverse this unreasonable person standard then we can maybe have a mature conversation about the topic and in some sense um I think that&#x27;s what soul is trying to do here as well as many other folks.</p>
<p>So just to kind of tie this back into the theme, Epictitus, famous stoic philosopher, lived during the time of the the five great Roman emperors, basically said it&#x27;s impossible for a person to learn what he thinks he already knows. And so that&#x27;s the problem with this topic. Everybody thinks they already know the answer and they don&#x27;t even consider the data. The problem that Beatatric talked about of submitting our papers and getting like automatic rejection in five minutes before they could even read it. That&#x27;s the standard that we have to sort of overcome to get into this place where we can have a serious conversation and obviously she&#x27;s achieved that and I think soul is is moving the ball forward to achieve that.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s maybe the context for the five Roman emperors Nurva Traan Hrien Antonius Pas Marcus Aurelius as I said kind of that that interesting period. So maybe we don&#x27;t take this too seriously but I think the comparison might be somewhat interesting. So, so on the left we we&#x27;ve got what my take is on the sort of canonical um uh description of the this period in time and on the right let&#x27;s compare it to the the modern era right so from AD96 to AD 180 that&#x27;s the period of the five great Roman emperors 84 years right so the period from 1941 the beginning of World War II to now 84 years so like they&#x27;re comparable in time. So uh the uh the period of the five Roman emperors basically the political rules established by Augustus were and sanctioned by his successors were bas was basically followed. In other words, they had sort of a standard way of operating that you know successive emperor sort of correspond.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Honestly just want to throw this in here. I guess we like following the Roman ways. I would honestly rather follow the Hindu ways. Just saying there&#x27;s a lot more knowledge there. Let&#x27;s just say that the two uh you know in the case of let&#x27;s say the modern UFO era oversight has slipped out of elected official control.</p>
<p>In other words, like the standard procedures of uh our our government institutions at least in the US maybe haven&#x27;t pertained with this topic because uh you know authorities sort of slipped out of our normal process and uh so going back on the on the left there uh the elite as embodied by the senate were was treated with respect. these emperors held deference to the Senate and so obviously uh Congress as we can imagine from uh what&#x27;s been stated by rounds and Schumer and Rubio the people that signed up to the disclosure act as well as the three hearings in the house is Congress uh recognizes that they&#x27;ve not been informed. So the five Roman emperors wage war but they were considered justified and successful. Uh I think uh we can argue and it&#x27;s been stated and Leslie Keane even captured this in one of her pieces that there is a subrosa arms race going on uh to reverse engineer these technologies. David Grush has talked about that as well as other folks and um so that&#x27;s apparently the case.</p>
<p>So uh there&#x27;s not levying of owners tax. There was certainly taxation during that period but not ownorous taxation. uh on the other hand uh you know trillions of dollars of taxpayer funds in the US have sort of been lost track of right this idea of the black budget and then finally uh you know they did good by uh the citizens of Rome be beautifying the city of Rome in particular and uh we&#x27;ve actually probably uh made some progress but an unknown amount of progress and uh they kept the pie from starving which is sort of the standard kind of common denominator and we&#x27;ve prevented ontological shock. So, so I think what we&#x27;re seeing here is basically uh they failed on every account except maybe the last and even the last is somewhat condescending. So, uh anyway, uh that&#x27;s part of the comparison, but the the timelines might be interesting too, right? So, uh, Nerva really followed a period of, uh, grave miscarriage of justice and implemented a lot of reforms that, um, uh, that were considered, uh, ethical and appropriate.</p>
<p>Uh, Trajan had the largest military campaigns during the period. Had dialed that in with military reforms. Antonius pious had a period of um peace and stability that Marcus Aurelius inherited and and these periods can kind of map to that that lower timeline. So the lower timeline is what I&#x27;m suggesting how one might divide the modern UFO period. So the man and some of this is kind of derived from Dolan but not necessarily strictly adherent to Dolan.</p>
<p>So you know the war the period from the beginning of World War I 1941 from the US perspective through the wave that sort of beatress talked about that that UFO &gt;&gt; I just want to bring up really quick here interesting to see how Carl Nell goes Laura and brings up Richard Dolan in passing saying you know quoting Dolan for what he&#x27;s been bringing up this really shows where Richard Dolan is. Well, I&#x27;m a big fan. I&#x27;ve been a member of his group for years now. So, he speaks the truth. He&#x27;s probably one of the best out there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I just had to point that out for the audience. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Flap in 52 that precipitate Project Blue Book. That&#x27;s the managing the problem era where the US government was trying to get a handle on this.</p>
<p>Trying to get a handle on this. The crisis and containment, that&#x27;s the 52 to 69 period. That&#x27;s your your blue book period essentially. The global strangeness period followed that with incursions in the northern tier and I would argue sort of kind of continued through what you streers&#x27;s publication of communion uh like I&#x27;ve kind of put that as like a watershed moment and then you get into this sort of what I call the you know dreamland beyond some of these are Dolan&#x27;s terminology through just prior to the uh Leslie Keane article and the videos and then we&#x27;re in this modern period the final piece what I call the great expectations. So, so if we&#x27;re going to kind of compare these two periods just for for kind of fun here.</p>
<p>So, uh, Nerva set the precedent for establishing just rule that that followed through to the all five um just emperors. And so, let&#x27;s bounce back and forth from the upper to the lower, right? So, so this period 41 to 51 set the precedent essentially for establishing how the US would confront the UFO problem uh post World War II, particularly Truman. If we jump back to the top init in uh Nerva initiate beneficent agrarian uh war welfare and legal programs and obviously this is the period that initiated this UFO management structure that happened in the US. um Nerva created a mechanism to expand citizenship to people in the provinces and during this management period access to this data and this is quoted out of some of the documents that we&#x27;ll show here was the most highly classified subject in the US government in other words like preventing really u infranchisement and uh going back to Nerva he instituted ensured stability and peaceful transition of power through this idea of adoptive succession. All five Roman emperors, interestingly, adopted their successors.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t have natural-born children. And so, that sounds a lot like nepotism, but what it ended up actually being was uh meritocracy because they selected people that were actually competent as as demonstrated historically. And so, contrasting that, stability and effective transition of control was implemented through a non-disclosure process, which I would argue is essentially a nepotism process. If you&#x27;re in the club, you stay in the club. So, it we we&#x27;ll walk through this and and there&#x27;s some interesting parallels that, you know, we don&#x27;t necessarily need to take too seriously, but I think it&#x27;s sort of instructive to highlight maybe some of the things that are going right, some of the things that kind of go went wrong.</p>
<p>So, going back to Traan, very aggressive military expansion of the empire to its greatest possible extent. So you could argue conversely 52 to 69 this was the blue book era very aggressive government debunking of UFO reports even more than the previous era the previous era and we&#x27;ll see some documents to this effect that was much more open about the reality of the topic champion philanthropic endeavors subsidizing you know the poor and orphans as anybody that sort of studied these periods knows uh and you know contrast that with the um accountability of this sort of legacy program that slipped out of this control that I talked about more than likely during the Eisenhower administration. Tragent granted uh uh quite a de a deal of the treasury to public works and infrastructure projects and as I said before the um the idea of public facing uh disclosure was very much discredited with blue book but also less wellknown is there was the maybe the first attempt uh the first okay discredited with blue book but ARO is doing the same thing as Eric Roth the guru says Arrow is the new Blue Book on Steroids 100%. &gt;&gt; Non-disclosure attempt to engage through uh Walt Disney in in 5556 which was was very abortive. So what we&#x27;re trying to say &gt;&gt; what he&#x27;s talking about here is at that a period in time um the government was in talks with Disney about uh bringing out a movie to go ahead and talk about disclosure and the UAP situation and everything.</p>
<p>Lauri, you&#x27;re familiar with that one, aren&#x27;t you? Yes, I am. And it made me think of the new movies that are going to be coming out soon. Um, in addition to um it actually timed Del Long is going to have a television series based on his first Secret Machines book. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Which is another Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s that&#x27;s in the future. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he also looked back during the Carter administration uh back in the 70s when he was there. He actually wanted to have a uh a display that was going to be on train a train that was going to go across the United States that was going to display rep uh replicas of crash materials we got from Roswell along with uh if you want to call it alien bodies and etc. So there have been presidents in different points in the past they&#x27;ve wanted to bring it forward but for some reason it always gets shut down by the elite.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. Well that&#x27;s changing. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Here is that there&#x27;s this sort of non-disclosure um initiative is not new and and and Jock will undoubtedly I imagine reference some of this that this has sort of been cyclic.</p>
<p>This this most recent post 2017 period is noteworthy for the progress that&#x27;s been made but by no means is it unique and this is actually every couple decades to sort of kind of come up again and then uh each of these sort of emperors and each of these sort of phases is sort of the same adoptive succession on the one hand which is essentially meritocracy and uh non-disclosure which is essentially nepotism happening. So Antonius pious just to kind of continue the analogy increased the relevance and tension to the provinces whereas this sort of global strangeness period started to at least impact the US in in a very global nature. There was uh military reforms during this period of the great Roman emperors. This is the the Reagan era, right? Goldwater nickels, space defense, Star Wars. So, you know, somewhat sort of u &gt;&gt; and all the times that Reagan came forward and talked about how an a threat from in the stars could go ahead and unite humanity in ways we never imagined.</p>
<p>And that could be honestly the reason why the information is not being brought forward because it would change our world governments in ways that not that humanity would want it, but change our government our our governments around the world in ways that the governments wouldn&#x27;t like it. Let&#x27;s continue. us uh Antonius Pies patronized the arts to a very extensive degree. This was the second abortive attempt that a lot of people are familiar with the Robert Emgger um James Sandler film where they were going to get the Hollowman Air Force Base footage and they ultimately uh the government was sort of like seeding that uh to create this sort of self-disclosure campaign. UFOs past, present, and future was a documentary that uh Ebenegger directed and u featured Rod Serling and people can go see this documentary.</p>
<p>But that footage that the government promised was sort of withheld. So it became sort of a inflated expectation but it was another instance of this sort of cycle happening. And then like uh Antonius pious this period was uh marked by a lack of internal revolt or foreign conflict where conversely this into dreamland period was marked by provocative and almost typically false disclosures. a lot of conflict uh with uh how to assess the abduction reports in this sort of UAP UFO community. The uh Jamie Shandera and Bill Moore sewing of disinformation, you know, uh becoming relevant that the the UIP community has been penetrated to some extent by uh by IC elements.</p>
<p>So, so like in other words very different like Antonius Pius was very stable and that period was very disruptive. And then Marcus Aurelius sort of the like the stoic emperor uh based a lot of his philosophy on uh uh the principle of stoicism. He successfully navigated numerous crises. He had plagues, he had wars, he had famine. Uh so the period that we&#x27;re in now, this what I call this sort of great expectation period is somewhat analogous, right? We&#x27;ve got wars, we&#x27;ve got climate, we&#x27;ve got AI, we&#x27;ve got UAP.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not clear necessarily if we&#x27;re going to be as successful navigating that. But maybe the takeaway there is, you know, uh that we ought to sort of exercise more of a stoic philosophy in terms of how we go about uh uh kind of navigating this. So anyway, I thought it&#x27;d be kind of interesting to kind of lay out that and see the sequence. So, all right. So, this is the first time we&#x27;ve actually seen this up close.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go ahead and get a closer look on what he&#x27;s actually talking about because this has been hard to see. So I guess we&#x27;re getting into it. Let&#x27;s uh get into this a bit more. uh 1990 we&#x27;re talking about increased relevance of and attention to the global nature of phenomena on US equities implementation implemented military reforms the Goldwater Act uh uh 1986 and strengthen emphasis on space okay on space defense a board of US government a board official US government support for eminent gear slander UFO documentary in 197 74 and ensures stability. Let me turn off the chat so people can see this.</p>
<p>All right. Ensures stability of the effective transition of control via non-disclosure i.e. nepatism. Then we&#x27;re looking a period marked by provocative often falsefold disclosures and internal conflict concerning newly publicized abduction accounts from 1987. Coming for Whitley Strieber.</p>
<p>A loss of lost accountability for trillions of US dollars in the defense budget. We&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve talked about this many times. This is what&#x27;s currently going on, folks. Money is being spent, but we have no idea where it&#x27;s absolutely going. Um, disenfranchise civilian UFO research groups through monitoring and sewing of of disinformation coming from war in 1989.</p>
<p>Then more importantly at the bottom, we&#x27;ve got ensured stability and effective transition of control via non-disclosure. And the last piece we got off to the side, let me see if I can zoom out a little bit. the ability to s uh where we&#x27;re saying in 2020s 2017 to present ability to successfully navigate numerous potentially destabilizing uh crew destabilizing crisis remains to be seen. Wars e uh wars economy climate AI UAP etc. B is emphasis on policy and legislative matters with respect to UAP disclosure which is the NDAAS of 22 23 24 and 25 folks because they&#x27;re trying to bring back that failed act for a fourth time and possibly end to non-disclosure policy.</p>
<p>Well, not everything. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re willing to give us all the truth. What do you think, Laura? These are a lot of things here. &gt;&gt; I think they&#x27;re so distracted right now with other things. Um they have their hands full.</p>
<p>So, I wouldn&#x27;t be hopeful at this point. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I I I agree with you completely. There&#x27;s so many things going on. Turmoil in the United States, turmoil in Europe, turmoil going on in Canada, over in Iran, where there&#x27;s over 200,000 people out there today in Munich, Germany going ahead and protesting about what&#x27;s been going on in Iran. Not in the United States with the Free Palestine movement, not a word.</p>
<p>But in Toronto, there were hundreds of thousands of people as well coming together with many people from the United States out there in protest. So it just shows you, you know, the government or more importantly the people are the sheeple who closed their eyes many times to the things that are going on around the world. Let&#x27;s get back to this video. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Um I&#x27;m going to talk slightly about briefly about UAP in U Italy since we&#x27;re here and I&#x27;m going to jump into this briefing book that will tie back to &gt;&gt; Dang it.</p>
<p>All right, let me get this back just a little bit here because we saw it for a second. Otherwise, we&#x27;re going to be seeing blur for the rest of this. What are we talk is he talking about next? UFO record UFOs recorded in ancient Roman times. Such reputable historians. Okay.</p>
<p>Uh widely regarded as accurate due to relig uh rigorous procedures from Roman authorities. One in 218 BC, we had spectacle of ships gleaming in the sky. 217 BC and RP round shields were seen in the sky. 212 BC. At Riate, a huge stone was seen flying about in 713 BC.</p>
<p>Uh at Latvium, a spectacle of a great fleet was seen to have been seen in the sky. In 154 BC, a cosmo Kamsa weapons Arma appeared flying in the sky. The Armada in uh 104 BC. The people of Amaria and Tudtor observed weapons in the sky rushing together from east and west. Those from the west appeared being routed in 100 BC probably at Rome.</p>
<p>A round shield burning emitting sparks ran across the sky from east to west at sunset. Sounds more like a meteor than anything. At 43 BC, a spectacle of defense and offensive weapons um was seen rise from the earth to the sky with a clashing noise. So it&#x27;s out there. There&#x27;s many more things that go back the Mahabarata and other ancient uh accountings across the world.</p>
<p>These are just some things that are being uh coin uh coined as to ancient Roman times. But if you look back in the historical record, the non-human intelligence has probably been around as long as humanity has been here. Let&#x27;s continue. &gt;&gt; Since we&#x27;re here now and we&#x27;re going to jump into this briefing book that will tie back to uh that timeline that I just gave. So uh this phenomena obviously isn&#x27;t a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>Libby talked about it. Plenty of the elder talked about it. Plutarch talked about it. The the Romans had this idea of a prodigy uh which was something that was so important that it hadn&#x27;t be recorded for um posterity and it would influence their understanding of their current affairs. You know, it was sort of be like a a prediction in some sense.</p>
<p>And so so Libby documented a lot of this. Some of this came down to plenty in his natural history and ultimately to Plutarch. Plutarch obviously being writing during the period of the five Roman great Roman emperors. But you could see the sort of the timeline there. 2016 BC a spectacle of ships gleamed in the sky.</p>
<p>In 2017, round shields were seen in the sky. 20 uh two 2012 BC a huge stone was seen flying about. Does these do these sound sort of like transients perhaps? In 173 BC, a spectacle of great fleet was said to have been seen in the sky. In 154 at Comp Compassia, weapons like arrowheads, spears, uh swords appeared flying in the sky and so on and so on. Back all the way up to 43 BC, a spectacle of defensive and offensive weapons was seen to rise from the earth to fly in the sky with clashing noise.</p>
<p>So, and and Jock has talked about this obviously in wonders in the sky and Beatatric has sort of talked about this. So, so this phenomenon goes back to ancient times that that predate the sort of the period of time I was talking about but came down to that period in pling the elders natural history in the recording of the prodigies and it&#x27;s important to note that you know the Romans took great pains to like validate that sort of this idea of justified true true belief like these things weren&#x27;t sort of halfhazardly recorded there was a significant administrative process and a vetting process that the Romans used to to assert that a prodigy was actually a prodigy or an event equated to a prodigy. So gets back to this idea of standards of evidence almost in a legal sense and which we&#x27;ve sort of dispensed with as I alluded earlier. This is an interesting event too, the the 19 um uh 33 magenta event that people have talked about. This is obviously uh as we&#x27;re going into World War II, several classified telegrams talk about, you know, this crash in 1933, not far from where we are here today.</p>
<p>So, there&#x27;s documentary evidence that&#x27;s been out there for quite a while that suggests this is this phenomena is real. It ties back even to um substantiating some of the things that David Grush has said even in an international sense. Um and and we&#x27;ve got three of the four telegrams that were sent contemporaneous with this event that basically said uh you know that that um Mussolini was clamping down on the information associated with this very anomalous phenomenon um and really starting what you might call the sort of the non-disclosure kind of um paradigm. So let&#x27;s talk about this congressional briefing book and and tie these two pieces together. So, as this legislation uh that uh everybody&#x27;s familiar with, the disclosure amendment and the other amendments that have happened have moved through the system, there was a briefing book of documentation that was put together uh to brief congressional members.</p>
<p>So not just like whistleblower testimony but official uh declassified and foyer released government documents over many years that once assembled sort of in a co coherent way makes a very strong case even in in the US government&#x27;s own words that the topic is real and so this this sort of package was put together to u kind of jumpstart the process of informing senators informing congress people that uh the topic ought to be taken seriously as these whistleblowers were coming in. So there was essentially 21 documents, three videos and now you know two whistleblower transcripts at the time. Now three whistleblower transcripts that were kind of put together for this and we had a prominent researcher like create exums you know like executive summaries. So, so some of these documents are quite lengthy. And so this whole thing was packaged up uh to incentivize the uh ultimately the passage of the disclosure amendment, which is to really recreate the control group that had slipped out of elected official control back in the Eisenhower administration and maybe bring this uh back under um you know, proper accountability.</p>
<p>you know, hearkening back again to what we were saying under the period that that Nerva started where we&#x27;re kind of conforming to the rule of law now. And so this right to know hashtag and UAPDA.org or are a series of organizations including Soul Foundation but um and Ocean X who is here and UAP Sweden, NPI, UAP Disclosure Fund, Galileo Project, 14 organizations have have banded together with varying political beliefs, varying emphasis areas, probably varying um um sort of focus of sort of their understanding of the topic from a scientific uh or new age or uh even um uh you like legal and and aerospace perspective saying like we need this amendment to sort of restore that oversight. So this congressional briefing book was a component in getting us to this stage and in fact this petition I&#x27;d invite people to go take a look at that. That petition is still in force and hopefully will be uh a mechanism to document the public will in continuing the cycle of disclosure. Now, so let&#x27;s tie now the this briefing book of essentially 24 items uh into this sort of timeline.</p>
<p>So we&#x27;ve got um memos and declassified documents that pertain to each of these phases. The managing the problem phase, the crisis containment like the the blue book phase, the global stranges where this expansion is happening, you know, understanding this is not just a US phenomenon. It&#x27;s more of a global phenomenon. this sort of dreamland stage and then this this great expectation stage. And so maybe I&#x27;ll walk through some of these documents and uh maybe highlight what is basically already been established as far as u official opinion on the topic.</p>
<p>So the first uh period right and we relate this to the Nurva period. So Nerva quote I&#x27;ve done nothing which should prevent me from laying down my power and living uh in safety as a private man. And so he&#x27;s essentially saying, you know, nobody&#x27;s going to assassinate me for for doing wrong. So let&#x27;s like maybe keep that in mind as we look at some of the documents here that that uh explain kind of where the US government&#x27;s thinking was in this early period. So the first memo from 47 and a lot of people are going to be familiar with these memos.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m maybe not saying stuff that anybody is not familiar with, but once you aggregate all this, it&#x27;s somewhat interesting. So, so Milton Lad is the number three guy at the FBI. He&#x27;s writing uh he&#x27;s getting a memo from an internal memo from one of their um u uh agents and it&#x27;s an extensive discussion of the flying disc problem. The Army Air Corps has been actively investigating these sightings and they list through possible explanations, celestial phenomenon, foreign technology hoaxes and this guy, the Brigger General Shugan, the head of the requirements division for Army Airore is requesting FBI assistance in interviewing witnesses. So essentially the army is basically saying this is becoming a domestic problem not just a military problem and we need the FBI with their investigative authorities to sort of help us get after this.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s like an emission that not only it&#x27;s real but it&#x27;s sort of beyond the scope of what the military can actually handle themselves. Well, well, well. Something a little bird told me. My higher conscious told me. Go ahead and check what&#x27;s going on over on X.</p>
<p>Yes, we have a breaking UFOs alert. Yeah, there&#x27;s a new video that just came out of Obama saying that yes, aliens are real. Let&#x27;s go ahead and bring this up. This is from an recent interview that just took place. Let&#x27;s go ahead and play this little clip for audience and see where it takes us.</p>
<p>Here we go. &gt;&gt; Are aliens real? Uh they&#x27;re real, but I haven&#x27;t seen them. And and and uh they&#x27;re not being kept in uh what is it? &gt;&gt; Area 51. There&#x27;s no underground uh facility unless there&#x27;s this enormous conspiracy &gt;&gt; and they hid it from the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president? &gt;&gt; Um where are the aliens? &gt;&gt; Where are the aliens? &gt;&gt; There we go.</p>
<p>Holy cow. didn&#x27;t expect this to go ahead and hit during the show. Andy, your thoughts on this one. &gt;&gt; Interesting to see that our president is coming out. Our former president &gt;&gt; Oh, you couldn&#x27;t hear it.</p>
<p>Dang it. All right. Uh cuz I&#x27;m in the wrong browser. Let me get to Brave. Let me get a new window up here.</p>
<p>Let me bring it across. Sorry for the people in the back. Let me play it again for the audience. Uh well, yeah, screwed up on that one. Let&#x27;s zoom up a little bit more.</p>
<p>Coming from this post. All right. Bang it up one more time so you can hear in the back. Andy. All right, here we go.</p>
<p>One more time. This is breaking news. &gt;&gt; Are aliens real? &gt;&gt; Uh, they&#x27;re real, but I haven&#x27;t seen them. And and and uh they&#x27;re not being kept in uh what is it? &gt;&gt; Area 51. &gt;&gt; Area 51.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no underground uh facility unless there&#x27;s this enormous conspiracy and they they hid it from the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president? Um, where are the aliens? &gt;&gt; Where are [laughter] the aliens? &gt;&gt; So, there we go. First of all, saying aliens are real. They&#x27;re not at Area 51. No, I haven&#x27;t seen one.</p>
<p>But if there&#x27;s going to be conspiracy about the president announcing it, he is saying it first. Does this take the whole situation, Andy, with regards to the president of the United States coming out and saying aliens are real and Obama is beating Trump to it? I think it could well be and you know we we we&#x27;re all you know adult enough to realize that you know the the first probably the first question that any president you know or any prospective person going in to become your president asks is are aliens real. &gt;&gt; Right. But this is the first time we&#x27;ve had a person who was president saying that was his first question. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>you know, he he&#x27;s the first one to be open and honest, we hope &gt;&gt; open on and honest with us about this, you know, um but yeah, I think he, you know, with what he says, you know, they&#x27;re not going to be in Area 51. He&#x27;s 100% correct on that. It&#x27;s too well known a site now. You know, um any any of these objects are in the most, you know, obscure places. probably could be in a storage pl &gt;&gt; near where any one of us lives, you know.</p>
<p>So, &gt;&gt; well, it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s easy to know that there is some friction between Obama and Trump. And for me, it just seems like it&#x27;s that he&#x27;s going ahead and trying to, you know, pull the rabbit out of the hat before someone else in DC has the opportunity to, you know. I guess Cardell means nothing without proof. However, it&#x27;s just interesting. You you have him jumping into this and he would say about it before, but I can&#x27;t talk about it.</p>
<p>But now he&#x27;s saying that they&#x27;re real. &gt;&gt; I know it&#x27;s not AI. &gt;&gt; Which one of your Yeah. Which one of your presidents when he was he was asked was um said, &quot;Oh, ask Barry.&quot; So, you know, go ask. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Biden said that. Ask Barack. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, um, you know, whether they all know he&#x27;s going to be possibly the most forthcoming being that he is no long, you know, he&#x27;s he&#x27;s he&#x27;s just a normal a normal citizen for for one of better words.</p>
<p>But, um, &gt;&gt; yeah. Yeah. The fact that he comes across and and says, &quot;Yeah, but real, you know, it&#x27;s like, yeah.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah. And &gt;&gt; Darl, from a position of someone who&#x27;s interested in the topic, not as maybe as deeply vested as we are, what do you think about what Obama is saying? I mean, is he really admitting anything? I&#x27;m just trying to figure that out. &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s play it again.</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Are aliens real?&quot; &gt;&gt; Play it again. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re real, but I haven&#x27;t seen them. And and and they&#x27;re not being kept in uh what is it? &gt;&gt; Area 51. &gt;&gt; Area 51, &gt;&gt; which means he hasn&#x27;t seen them, but he knows where they&#x27;re being kept and he knows it&#x27;s not in Area 51. He also says that uh it&#x27;s probably it&#x27;s the greatest conspiracy because they&#x27;ve hid it from a president.</p>
<p>So I he&#x27;s not saying there is a conspiracy. He said it would be the biggest conspiracy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Interesting to say the absolutely &gt;&gt; want to hear more about it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. We all want to hear more about it, my friend. the quality learing center. But then again, you do have that new facility that they built in the south side of Chicago that looks more like an a building from the Empire to have the Emperor&#x27;s freaking spacecraft come and dock than it looks like an actual museum. Just saying.</p>
<p>You never know. All right, we&#x27;ll get back to the video here. I just had to interrupt on that one. It&#x27;s interesting to say the least. Here we go.</p>
<p>domestic problem also. And so very tellingly, Hoover says like I&#x27;ll go along with this and that&#x27;s Jar Hoover. I&#x27;ll go along with this as long as I get access to discs recovered. So they&#x27;re already talking about like a recovery in July of 1947. And and now we can think back to the the Magenta case in 1933 where there&#x27;s a purported crash uh right before you know or as World War II was kicking off and obviously the liberation of Italy with by US forces and um some discussions that have happened about you know what may have happened through the Vatican with that material.</p>
<p>So an interesting like connective point right uh connective tissue there. So we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll go through a number of these documents. So the Twining memorandum very famous memorandum general Nathan Twining the head of air material command ultimately came became chief of staff of the air force. So this memorandum says the UAP phenomenon is something real not visionary or fictitious. It represents objects about the size of an aircraft that are circular in shape metallic and highly reflective and they appear to be under intelligent control.</p>
<p>This is this is official obviously memorandum. That&#x27;s the assessment of air material command in September 1947. Extremely explicit a lack of physical evidence in the form of crash materials. The memorandum was classified secret at the time but not a top secret memo. So so people kind of use that as a counter counterargument but um it is possibly explained by the classification level.</p>
<p>These all these documents are publicly available and they&#x27;ve been declassified formally. So this is uh completely 100% vetted government information that&#x27;s publicly available. A second FBI memorandum this is in 49. So special agent in charge of the San San Antonio field office is writing to Jed Edgar Hoover directly and they&#x27;re talking about the protection of vital installations. This is the topic of the memo.</p>
<p>So, unidentified aerial phenomenon, otherwise known as flying disc, flying saucers, balls of fire, is considered top secret by both army and air force. This is like a quote from the memo. The shape of the objects reported as round in a point of light with a definite area to the light source. Loss Almos is considered the target of these incursions. However, the incursions are occurring over numerous nuclear sites including Oakidge, including Hanford.</p>
<p>So, they go through nine scientific reasons that exist which indicate that the phenomenon observed are not you meteorites. In other words, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s no prosaic explanation and obviously it&#x27;s a highly uh like important matter and the FBI is being requested to uh look into this. So, we&#x27;re going to have to go through f some of these a little bit faster here. Uh Sarbacher Smith document. So, uh Robert Sarbacher was a consultant the defense research and development board.</p>
<p>He had a correspondence will Wilbur Smith a Canadian radio engineer. He basically asserted that there is a legacy program. Dr. Vanervar Bush the head of the uh defense research and development board was the head of the program. Oppenheimer was involved.</p>
<p>This is the most highly classified matter in the United States government rating even higher than the Hbomb. Right. And that&#x27;s been out there for quite a while. intelligence reports uh about one of the first pilot encounters talking about [snorts] the reality of the topic. This teletype uh that they were testing out new radar systems in Fort Mammoth in 51 picked up objects traveling 20,000 ft going thousands of miles per hour.</p>
<p>Right? Some feats that were impossible at the time based on the technology. All right, let&#x27;s just go into the second period here. Anonymous denunciations do not conform to the spirit of our time. Another interesting topic when you think about the sort of disinfo discrediting campaigns that have been going on. Uh 1952 the uh Belgian press is talking about UFOs over uranium mines.</p>
<p>Another very early connection with uh nuclear sites from foreign press documented by CIA. The Chadwell memo. This one&#x27;s extremely important. The 52 Chadwell memo. So, Marshall Chadwell is the assistant director for uh scientific intelligence at the CIA.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s writing a memo that asserts reports of incidents convince us there is something going on that must have immediate attention. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major US defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomenon or known types of aerial vehicles. He was requesting like a national program to investigate this official CIA memo by the deputy uh uh assistant director for science and technology. Maxwell Air Force Base emergency report. Incursions over the nuclear tier uh in in 1954.</p>
<p>Jets were scrambled to take care of that. Intrusions over May not again with nuclear missiles and um UFOs. the famous Malstrom incidents from &#x27; 67 uh where um another correlation with missiles and objects uh and missiles being taken offline and missiles being brought um brought online in the Soviet Union. Um documenting that we&#x27;re having to go fast here because they&#x27;re telling me I don&#x27;t have a lot of time. The the Bowlinger memo uh so the the Ballinger memo is interesting because Blue Book had been cancelled.</p>
<p>This is in &#x27; 69. So Blue Book is this is ending this, you know, Blue Book period. And so Boulder and people are protesting, you know, like we&#x27;re not going to have an official investigation of UFOs if Blue Book goes away. And and the Ballinger memo basically says, you know, like don&#x27;t worry, like all your report important reports didn&#x27;t go to Blue Book anyway. Like they they weren&#x27;t really part of the Blue Book system anyway, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it.</p>
<p>Uh that&#x27;s essentially the Bowlinger memo. and uh and they&#x27;re we&#x27;re going to continue to handle them uh with processes that already exist that that you like are not public. So that&#x27;s the bullander memo. So the global strangeness so like a little bit from Hrien I knew that good like bad becomes a routine that temporary tends to endure that what is external permeates to the inside and that the mask given time comes to be the face itself. Right? So maybe a little insight into what&#x27;s been happening here.</p>
<p>The Australian uh defense minute paper. This is really interesting. Uh you people can go on to the Australian U National Archives and pull up this document, but it basically says, and maybe I&#x27;ll quote it here. Uh this is an official Australian assessment of the state of affairs of the UFO subject in the United States as of 1971. So it&#x27;s like an official government report on a an ally uh retrospective to 1971.</p>
<p>Analyses of UFO reports by US Air Force intelligence indicated that real phenomena were being reported which had flight characteristics so far in advance of US aircraft that only an extraterrestrial origin could be envisaged quote unquote. A US government agency studied UFO reports with the intention of determining the UFO propulsion methods, persuaded the US Air Force to use Project Blue Book as a means to debunk them, and at a later stage to allocate funds for launching a crash program into anti-gravity power. Such an intensive onslaught on the gravity enigma can only be rationalized within the context of a firm belief that UFOs were real and that the intelligence behind them knew how to control gravity. So that&#x27;s like an official Australian assessment of what&#x27;s going on in the United States in 1971. Let&#x27;s go maybe quicker through these.</p>
<p>These are the incursions over the nuclear bases in the 70s documented the encounter over Tran. Uh an Iranian F4 Phantom engaged UAP over Iran. Lindsay Keane talks about this in her book. There&#x27;s official DIA assessment of that. Had great great interest.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll skip this one in the interest of time because that will be too long to talk about the the halt memorandum uh Charles Halt the Rendlesham Forest incident with uh the landing and the lights and the incursions. People are very familiar with that 1981. So essentially the reality this is you know not just a domestic US problem from a domestic US audience perspective but it&#x27;s really international problem. uh this final period, the u Lake area UFO incident, the Ben Rich statements are interesting, right? So this memo, many of our man-made UFOs were unfunded opportunities. So very much intimating that uh he&#x27;s been involved in some reverse engineering efforts at Skunkworks.</p>
<p>Ben Rich being the successor to Kelly Johnson running the Lockhee Martin skunk works. So how are we doing? Okay, so we got to pick it up. All right, we got to end it. So, let me just The Wilson Davis notes. We talked about that.</p>
<p>George Bush videos disclosure act, right? Trust testimony. Like everybody&#x27;s familiar with these anyway, right? So, you&#x27;re not really missing anything there. So, let me just go to sort of conclusion. So, this idea of uh this campaign plan that we&#x27;re trying to happen, right? So this sort of public initiative, you know, is maybe stalled with this the stalling of the amendment, but you&#x27;ve got these other lines of effort, right, that Gary alluded to, the philos philosophical humanities investigation, the scientific research, private sector efforts, the the met medical [clears throat and snorts] uh area. You know, we&#x27;ve talked about this idea of the Hilbert problems that would pertain to to some of these areas, the indirect approach in purple.</p>
<p>I would still argue the the quickest path to success is getting this sort of direct approach, government incentivization to happen. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t do, you know, the the purple stuff first. And then the final slide here um is maybe like an alignment of the legislative agenda. The UAP Disclosure Act was going to be followed by UAP whistleblower protection act, which was going to be followed by a UAP Truth and Reconciliation Act. And several of these are already written.</p>
<p>they&#x27;re like they&#x27;re ready to go, right? And so, you know, this program probably still needs to continue. And this idea of eminent domain that a lot of people are kind of concerned about is is a phase in a bigger plan that goes into a consortia phase and into a regulated market phase. So, so like there&#x27;s quite a lot that sort of went into this idea of this current area of disclosure. And so maybe I&#x27;ll just end with that and if we have a Q&amp;A, we can maybe talk more about that. So, apology for running a little bit long there.</p>
<p>[applause] &gt;&gt; There we go. Carl, now talking about disclosure in the past and the present. Uh, if I may go to Daryl Zernick since you&#x27;re up, your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Uh, I mean, yes, all the stuff that we already know. I mean, uh, you know, who&#x27;s the audience, I guess, is the question.</p>
<p>Is it is it a bunch of people that are &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s most the people who already know what&#x27;s going on. UFO disclosure. That&#x27;s who the soul formation go foundation goes to. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just a lot of information about historical context. You know, sometimes we have to look at our past.</p>
<p>I used to say a lot of times to understand our future. &gt;&gt; And maybe that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s pointing at. You would hope that we would, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem like humanity learns too much from its past. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, they never do. They never do.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; More and more interesting. &gt;&gt; Yeah, if we the same component &gt;&gt; if we can we do Go ahead. I&#x27;m sorry. &gt;&gt; No, that&#x27;s it. &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
<p>We did get a video uh sent in one at least from one of our viewers who said they saw some they&#x27;ve been seeing orbs flying over where they live on a regular basis. We&#x27;ve just got a little video clip here. I promised I&#x27;d go ahead to the audience to go that I would go ahead and bring this up. Let me go ahead and bring this clip up here. It&#x27;s a relatively short one to go ahead and show.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&#x27;s some things out there in the sky that as they&#x27;re going ahead and watching it, there&#x27;s something that&#x27;s there in the sky and after a period of time it vanishes. So there you go. there&#x27;s something that&#x27;s out there that they&#x27;re seeing that&#x27;s there for a period of time and then it flutters and kind of goes out which could point to potentially seeing something along the lines of a Chinese lantern or something like that, but it it&#x27;s just hard to tell from uh one single video of the event as it&#x27;s been going on. So, just wanted to go ahead and share that with everybody out there about what&#x27;s happening in the skies. Um, yeah, interesting conversation today from uh Carl Nell to say the absolute least.</p>
<p>Let me get back into the studio. Get [snorts] this back up and going again. Yes, the the solar storm has been increasing, friends. It&#x27;s out there. It&#x27;s going on and it&#x27;s going to be cranking up tonight.</p>
<p>The uh if you want to call it, the solar wind is kicking up to such a strength that we might get auror borealis clear skies like we have it here in Washington state right now hitting in the mid latitudes. So, it&#x27;s just, you know, as the um um magnetic field continues to um weaken, we&#x27;re getting more and more things like this popping up in our sky on a regular basis. And this was oh, probably about an hour or so ago of what&#x27;s going on. And just absolutely gorgeous of what&#x27;s going on up in Starlap up in uh if you want to call it going on in Finland right now. Let me go ahead and find this one again.</p>
<p>Bring up a little bit larger. Bring it down. So, yeah, they call this particular uh scenario that we&#x27;re seeing right now a cinnamon roll. Meaning, you see the things in the sky and it just kind of goes and just uh wraps around itself. It&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>And hopefully we should be able to see some of these things in the United States tonight. Manuel, go ahead. &gt;&gt; You put your hand up. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a question for you. Wouldn&#x27;t that affect the uh satellites in space in orbit? Uh the uh the uh solar winds and all that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This when the solar wind kicks up, it&#x27;s probably not enough to go ahead and affect satellites. Generally, satellites are initially affected coming from uh the initial X-ray burst that comes off the sun when the chronal mass ejection happens. And we&#x27;ll also see it potentially when you have the CME, which is that material that&#x27;s on the sun itself actually goes ahead and gets ejected off and interacts with our magnetic field. Usually during points when we&#x27;re having uh if you want to call it uh enhanced rural activity uh in the northern latitudes, we&#x27;re not really seeing that many if you want to call it satellites being affected. Now, what satellites are affected are the ones that are going over the South Atlantic anomaly, which almost goes from the western coast of South Africa all the way across to Brazil and out into the Pacific at this point.</p>
<p>This is a hole, if you want to call it, intermagnetic field. It&#x27;s not stabilized. It&#x27;s not getting smaller. It&#x27;s getting larger and larger on an in an unpredictable almost method on a daily basis. I know that uh Elon uh he uh he launched some of his uh satellite ditches and uh and some fell back onto Earth because they got hit.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, I don&#x27;t know if you &gt;&gt; was that recently or was that in the past? &gt;&gt; In the past. Yeah, there was a past where they actually went out to put up some satellites and as they were putting up some satellites, we hit a a CME that came in from the sun and when it happened, it actually prevented those satellites from achieving orbit. So, they had to go ahead and literally abort the orbit and bring the satellites down. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s what happened. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Just amazing stuff that&#x27;s out there. And I I mean, I just see this stuff. It&#x27;s so bright. even the ground and everything which basically is is all basically green at this point which means it&#x27;s green from the aurora that&#x27;s going on overhead and a lot of times when this happens you never see this kind of stuff so that means it&#x27;s clearly visible to the naked eye not just to the cameras that are out there if I could let&#x27;s see what else I&#x27;ve got going on here and what&#x27;s causing it right now we have a coronal hole that&#x27;s relatively huge it&#x27;s a large snaking coronal hole is directly facing earth Now effects are already being felt on Earth with our uh BT which is the point where it says when it&#x27;s negative we&#x27;re going to start seeing the aurora borealis which it is we is pretty enhanced mid- latatitude aurora displays are possible tonight especially strong during substorms kind of like what we&#x27;re seeing right now that&#x27;s a substorm going on I go to a point where the substorm is kicked off you can see it&#x27;s kind of quiet but then as the subtorms start picking up again we&#x27;ll start seeing more details going off in the distance get to another one here where we start seeing more and more activity as it goes on the you know you know I guess we get these uh if you want to call it the Aurora Borealis going on every 11 years which based on my age of going to be 58 this year uh I&#x27;ve got like one solar cycle left.</p>
<p>So enjoy it while they have it, folks. It&#x27;s just really interesting and it&#x27;s just absolutely gorgeous about this stuff. I watch this stuff in in my feed daily and it&#x27;s just you look at it and it&#x27;s nothing that we could go ahead. I guess we could create this with AI, but this is real and it&#x27;s just just nice and I guess relaxing to go ahead and watch. It&#x27;s watch what&#x27;s going on in the sky.</p>
<p>No, if I can, let me get to my bookmarks and see if there&#x27;s anything we haven&#x27;t covered here yet today. Okay, I know that we&#x27;re waiting for someone potentially to show up, but don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s happening. All right. Uh, not there. All right, news in Canada.</p>
<p>On to the late night late night update approach. This just really blew my mind. Welcome to W Canada. Can&#x27;t wait for Ontario to go ahead and break away from Canada itself. An Ontario resident who wanted both a vagina and penis wins public funding for a unique surgery.</p>
<p>Yes. And a court in Ontario has ruled that Ontario must pay for a penisparing vaginoplasty for a person who identifies as neither fully male or female. [laughter] Holy Meanwhile, there&#x27;s over 8,000 surgeries that are backlogged of people. I guess we&#x27;re getting actual at some point, too. That&#x27;ll be interesting.</p>
<p>[laughter] &gt;&gt; I know. I just saw this. Uh, Manuel, any thoughts on this one? You&#x27;re from Canada. Silence. &gt;&gt; Unbelievable.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. And it&#x27;s actually true, folks. Uh, let&#x27;s get let&#x27;s move on. All right. Coming from Koto Kotako.</p>
<p>All right. Uh, Kotaku. Uh we heard the what was going on with Discord earlier this week. Well, Discord is now shutting down. It&#x27;s age verification.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re required you upload an ID, do images of your face to go ahead and pass that you are of a certain age. Discord distanced itself from age verification after firm&#x27;s ties to planters. Peter Theal surface. Wow. They&#x27;re trying to get all this information about people.</p>
<p>Gee, I wonder where they got that idea. Peter Theo is one of the people behind all of this stuff. What else do we have going on? Well, apparently we&#x27;ve got someone in the United Kingdom who want they&#x27;re tired of reform not getting where they want to go and now they have another party they actually want to bring forward. Let&#x27;s play this little clip. &gt;&gt; Restore Britain will not just stop mass immigration.</p>
<p>We will reverse [music] it. Far more people must leave Britain. &gt;&gt; Okay. Potentially copyrighted music. Not a good idea.</p>
<p>So, Restore Britain, Andy, have you heard of Restore Britain yet? &gt;&gt; Then arrive. If that means millions go, &gt;&gt; yes, I have. It&#x27;s Rupert Low. He&#x27;s actually He is a standing uh politician that was kicked out of reform who&#x27;s now an independent, but he&#x27;s actually setting up his own party. I heard about this yesterday.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. and basically saying if that means millions of people uh millions uh go then millions go. So he&#x27;s really trying to stand up for the United Kingdom and get the unchecked uh if you want to call it immigration going on like we had here in the United States until we got a current president who literally shut the border down. Although the the prior president uh um Joe Biden said it couldn&#x27;t be done without Congress. Apparently it can be done.</p>
<p>You know, I guess it&#x27;s going to be hard to have yet another fractured party up there. Would it be better, do you think, for him to get along with reform, Andy? &gt;&gt; Oh, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a really hard one. I I I know they they&#x27;ve got an awful lot of very deep differences. Um, &gt;&gt; you know, the issue I have it splits the right, you know, what what they say as the right, you know, that you would have uh two parties. This Well, technically they&#x27;re now I think free but follow this basic the right of of [snorts] center politics.</p>
<p>So you got reform, you&#x27;ve got this this one. &gt;&gt; But in the United States, you have the center, you&#x27;ve got the left, and you&#x27;ve got the right. But the problem is the left has moved so far to the left that the center is now the far right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And unfortunately, it seems to be going this way now, you know, with with what&#x27;s going on in our, you know, UK Parliament and what what our prime minister seems to be going now.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s he&#x27;s kicked out a load of his previous members of staff for one thing or another. And he seems to be, you know, wherever he&#x27;s lurching to left more than he previously did. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s Yeah, it&#x27;s very complicated and gives me a headache to be honest. No, it&#x27;s one hell of a headache. That&#x27;s one thing we&#x27;ve been dealing with a lot here on Disclosure Tonight, if I can find the right one to get to.</p>
<p>But you know what? When you have Susan Goff around to go ahead and guide you for what&#x27;s happening, you never know who may pop up in the show. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Are you kidding me? For Valentine&#x27;s Day, we have to look at Susan Goff, the erection killer for a romantic holiday. &gt;&gt; Oh, there we go. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; If she&#x27;s not looking in my face, she&#x27;s looking from the bottom of the scene.</p>
<p>Good to hear from you, Mike. Where you been? Well, it says you&#x27;re the disclosure bouncer now. What the hell happened? &gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I&#x27;m just making sure that the trolls stay the hell out of here and don&#x27;t come in like they like to do from time to time. So, I&#x27;m around. &gt;&gt; You know that &gt;&gt; you&#x27;re on hiatus.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve been a bad boy. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah, but I keep an eye on things and um I&#x27;m not that far away. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, it&#x27;s nice of you to stop in. I know a lot of people in the audience miss you on a regular basis and that&#x27;s why we say you&#x27;re on a hiatus, not necessarily off the show because right &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s what it is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It is. And I miss everybody as well. And I also wanted to take this opportunity to say happy Valentine&#x27;s Day to everybody from the show. And um yeah, it&#x27;s um it&#x27;s been very quiet and you&#x27;ve been covering this on the show, so you and I are both well aware, nothing is really uh happening on the disclosure front right now. There&#x27;s too much going on elsewhere at the moment.</p>
<p>So &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Until it picks up, it&#x27;s just this is how it&#x27;s going to be at the moment. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. I know.</p>
<p>I appreciate you stopping in saying hi to the audience. A lot of people have been asking about you every single show. Yes, he has our bouncer at the front door to keep the trolls out. He&#x27;s been taken off the stage for the time being, but it&#x27;s a hiatus. I&#x27;ll just make that clear.</p>
<p>And I can&#x27;t wait, Mike. You know, this clip is going to be showing up on X not too long. &gt;&gt; No, we know that. But that&#x27;s okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ll be with it. That&#x27;s fine. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;ll be fun. &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>If we can, let&#x27;s get into our next piece here if we&#x27;re getting into it. Uh, British comedian Pat Smith brilliantly points out the hypocrisy surrounding the subject of mass immigration in the United Kingdom. And he says it in a ways a lot of Brits would actually say it. And just take a take a listen to this one, folks. Okay, I think we can all agree everything here is [clears throat] a little bit too Chinese.</p>
<p>All the restaurants and cafes and that, for a start, way too many noodles. I don&#x27;t eat noodles. You know, we&#x27;re going to need pie mash, ham, egg, and chips. I mean, you need to cater to me. Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I don&#x27;t think you understand. I&#x27;m not from here. Okay. I left the UK because I didn&#x27;t like it. All right.</p>
<p>So, I need you to change everything to make it feel like it&#x27;s the UK. Yeah. Still no. Is it right? Okay. Well, uh, also I can&#x27;t really work at the minute.</p>
<p>Um, anxiety. Yeah. So, when do I get my money? obviously got a few kids at home and all, so they&#x27;re they&#x27;re going to need to come here. That&#x27;s a no-brainer. Um, why do you keep saying no? I&#x27;ve noticed as well there&#x27;s a lot of Chinese people here as well, is it? So, I was thinking we could get loads of me over here and we have our own little area and then you lot can just off.</p>
<p>Does that sound good? It doesn&#x27;t. Well, no. Hear me out. cuz I was thinking if we get loads of me over here then we can vote in you know one of me to be in charge and then we can all start telling you lot how to live and after that I was going to organize some marches where we go through the streets chanting anti-Chinese sentiments so obviously you&#x27;ll need to protect us while we do that that&#x27;s a no as well is it and finally I am here illegally um yeah didn&#x27;t respect the rules on that one so do I just choose any hotel or have you got certain prison? &gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go. But I think that really kind of pegs in on what&#x27;s going on in the UK.</p>
<p>We have a lot of friends from the UK who would love to say things, but if they do, they can end up having the police knocking on their door at 4:30 in the morning to haul them away to jail for saying things that has gone against and call, you know, they would actually probably call this Islamophobic, unfortunately. But it&#x27;s great to see people that are out there and saying it themselves. Well, you know, we look back in history of different things that are going on. This is actually one of the uh if you want to call it, we had Operation uh Bluegill Prime where we&#x27;re putting a nukes up into the atmosphere. Did you know that one of those rockets blew apart on the island itself and never launched and cause a nuclear blow up right on Johnson Island? Let&#x27;s watch this one.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. Boom. Boom. Let&#x27;s go for the big one. And here we go.</p>
<p>Kabam. The nuclear explosion takes place. Boom. And here&#x27;s what&#x27;s left. The buildings actually survived, but the entire island, the entire toll was basically uh made uninhabitable and they had to go ahead and potentially clean these things up.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s anything else going on now? Let&#x27;s get past this. Uh the DMV. &gt;&gt; All right, this is a good one. We talk about voter ID. Majority every single person in the United States wants voter ID.</p>
<p>This is a little interesting clip from CNN to go ahead and drive home that point. It&#x27;s not what you think it is if you&#x27;re on their left side of things. Folks, take a listen. &gt;&gt; Poor people who don&#x27;t have access to those things to be able to get to the DMV to be able to get to places where you can get a passport. &gt;&gt; Our government expects a lot of us every single year, every single person is expected to file their taxes.</p>
<p>something that is very complicated. You have to outsour &gt;&gt; during co but you can do it online. &gt;&gt; People had to go and get a vaccine in person. I went twice. I had to carry my little I had to carry my little card around the government expected.</p>
<p>The government expect [laughter] people for time. Can I just explain to you the difference? Can I tell you the [laughter] difference? Can I just explain to you the fundamental far less ownorous moving? Would you Correct. Poor people. &gt;&gt; What we&#x27;re talking about here, Mike, is when CO happened, you had to have a little vaccine card that you had to walk around and present to everybody to be able to get into places in New York. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I remember that. Yeah. They really forced everybody to go back to a normal life &gt;&gt; to jump through the hoops they wanted everyone to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was Yeah.</p>
<p>Really terrible. And as soon as they bring that up, &gt;&gt; the dialogue from the Dems falls apart. Did you hear they all how they all freaking just started freaking going off like harpies? &gt;&gt; I went to carry my little card around the government. [laughter] &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re way off track. They&#x27;re not off track.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re on target. &gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s dead on target. And it sounds like feeding time at the zoo with them. Wow. Sounds like feeding time at the chicken farm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. Meanwhile, in Enimclaw, Washington, which is close to home, closer than most people out there, loudmouth Liliana swings at a pro ice supporter, lands a punch. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re not a You&#x27;re not a kid. &gt;&gt; And then she&#x27;s about to around and find out. &gt;&gt; YOU&#x27;RE GOING TO JAIL.</p>
<p>YOU&#x27;RE GOING TO JAIL. YOU&#x27;RE GOING TO JAIL. &gt;&gt; YOU&#x27;RE GOING TO JAIL. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, the harpies are going off. [music] &gt;&gt; Okay, I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s copyritten, but I just have to be careful.</p>
<p>And they&#x27;re hauling her after to the police station. But it&#x27;s not just there. It&#x27;s about to get ratcheted up from here. You know, anytime you touch a police officer, Mike, you know, it&#x27;s a felony, right? It&#x27;s assault. &gt;&gt; It is assault and battery.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Assaulting a police officer. Yep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We got to start covering some uh police videos on here soon, too.</p>
<p>A lot of interesting things where people don&#x27;t realize what&#x27;s truly going off. All right, we got those people out of there. That one&#x27;s gone. Now, watch the one. We got the one with the red hat and the and the light colored hoodie.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see if they&#x27;re going after her next. We&#x27;ve got a guy here with with red hair, of course. Oh, is that the same one? Maybe. [music] Why do they feel like they can do these things and not be subject to the law? It &gt;&gt; just doesn&#x27;t make sense. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re above the law.</p>
<p>Yeah. Or they think they are. &gt;&gt; And in some cases, they&#x27;re told they are above the law. &gt;&gt; Well, they think they&#x27;re exempt from the uh consequences, Darl. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re trained to go de arrest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, we do have a longer clip from Rubert Low MP. I think it&#x27;s not going to be including any uh license music. So, I think we can play this one.</p>
<p>This is like reform on steroids. I believe way as Andy would put it. Let&#x27;s go ahead and listen to what we have to go on here. They want their country back. I have chosen to speak to you today from the farm because places like this represent what [music] proper Britain is about.</p>
<p>Hard work, responsibility, effort, duty, [music] stewardship. This is the England I know and this is the England that I love. On a farm, you don&#x27;t think in [music] election cycles or headlines or polling. You think in seasons. you think in generations in what you leave behind to those who come after you.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s why here on the farm, I am now launching Restore [music] Britain as a national political party. I&#x27;m now going to dedicate my life to finding, organizing, funding, [music] and providing hundreds of qualified candidates to present to the British people at the next general election. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; This process has already started with invitations being issued to patriots in aligned political parties, [music] reform, the conservatives, the SDP, Advance, and more. In local politics, we [music] will work in partnership with localized political parties such as Great Yarmouth First that have the [music] best interests of their residents at heart, combining our forces at [music] the next general election. The men and women standing for restore in that election will not be politicians.</p>
<p>I promise [music] you that. They will not be failed ministers. They will not be tainted by failures of the past. They will [music] be from business, from the military, from science, from medicine, from education, from industry, representing real communities up and down [music] the country. Every single one will be from well outside the existing political establishment and every single one will understand [music] the difficult decisions that need to be taken because there are no easy fixes.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not going to tell you [music] comforting lies about the condition of our country. I have only ever been honest with the British people and I will be [music] straight with you now. What is necessary will be incredibly painful. But for the first time in a very long time, voters will have a genuine alternative [music] which is truthful with them about the scale of what now has to be done. The first priority [music] is to control who comes to our country and more importantly who stays in our country.</p>
<p>Restore Britain will not just stop mass immigration, we will reverse it. Every single illegal migrant [music] will be securely detained and then deported. The [music] message will be unrelenting. If you are in this country without our permission, you will be removed. For the foreseeable future, far more people must leave Britain than arrive.</p>
<p>If a foreign national is unable to speak English, lives in social housing, claims benefits, [music] refuses to work, fails to integrate, commits crime, or even actively hates our way of life and [music] wishes to do us harm, then they must leave or be made to leave. Restore [music] Britain will make our communities safe again for women and children. that I promise you if that means [music] millions go then millions go. We&#x27;re constantly told that the economy needs vast swaves of lowkilled migrants. We know [music] that&#x27;s simply not true.</p>
<p>What we need is to get millions of healthy Brits back into work. A radical overhaul of how welfare [music] is delivered. protecting those in genuine need but not funding healthy [music] sherkers to live off the back of hardworking men and women. If you can work, you must work. It really is that simple.</p>
<p>[music] Restore Britain will be abundantly clear. If you consistently refuse work, then you will lose your benefits. [music] We will punish indolence and more importantly, we will reward success. We will provide vast economic incentives [music] for men and women to start businesses, generate opportunities, build wealth, and create [music] self-sufficient families. Standing here today on the farm, I know exactly what it means to deal with energy bills, labor [music] shortages, regulation, unproductive paperwork, planning restrictions, tax, and endless uncertainty.</p>
<p>The state has definitively become [music] the enemy of the people. Restore Britain will burn away suffocating [music] taxes on work and enterprise. We will slash unnecessary regulation. We will dismantle [music] bloated quangos and the overbearing HR culture. We must slash parasitic [music] Britain.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Firefly. &gt;&gt; We will restore long-term stable logical policy so that businesses can plan and invest and grow again. But Restore [music] Britain is about much more than numbers on a spreadsheet. It&#x27;s about who we are as a nation and who we [music] are as a people. Britain is not just an economy.</p>
<p>Britain is not just an idea. Britain [music] is not just a passport. Britain is a nation. Britain is a people, our people. [music] And Restore Britain will never allow that to be erased.</p>
<p>We will celebrate our Christian heritage [music] and the identity that built and shaped this country. Responsibility, restraint, forgiveness, [music] duty, and fairness. In short, a high trust society. That will mean defending our [music] culture. That will mean resisting the relentless creep of radical Islam.</p>
<p>That will mean banning the burka, outlawing Sharia law, blocking cousin marriages, and reimposing our Christian-based rule of law. A restore Britain government would legislate to ensure [music] that no halal or kosher slaughter on British soil. This is Britain and we will do things our [music] way. This political party now exists for one reason, to restore Britain. to make [music] it a better, safer, and more prosperous place for British men and women to raise their families.</p>
<p>It will be difficult and it will be painful, but I assure you it is possible. [music] I hope you will consider joining me on this journey and becoming [music] a member of our party. It is our country. It is now our collective responsibility [music] to act. Together we will restore Britain.</p>
<p>[music] Thank you. Well, I have to say, Darl, Mike, anybody, this is the same battle we&#x27;re fighting in the United States right now with what happened during the Biden administration where they had the equivalent of uh the I believe what was it the state of Pit uh the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania coming almost on a daily basis. Where do you take all the different people and put them? How do you deal with it? you deal with another uh if you want to call it wasn&#x27;t from one country, it was from all of them. And they don&#x27;t want to integrate with the with our governments. They don&#x27;t want to integrate with our lifestyle.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t want to integrate with the way that things are in this country. But this is conceived as heresy in thei in the United States versus where we can see it happening in if you want to call it United Kingdom where they just had a local community where they brought in 600 new residents all male of war fighting age or working age. They give them food. They give them shelter. They give them a phone.</p>
<p>They give them money every week to spend. But you know what? They don&#x27;t give them any outlet for any of their sexual desires that they may have based on where they came from. Whether that&#x27;s their religious thinkings or or thoughts or what they&#x27;ve been taught where if you have a little girl who is not Muslim, you can do to them cuz they&#x27;re, you know, they&#x27;re haram. And if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really going on, these politicians are knowingly putting these populations into these areas where the existing citizenship &gt;&gt; is going to be freaking prayed upon by the society. It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re bringing them in, giving them classes, make sure they have to go through mandatory training and assimilation into the UK government before they let it free everybody.</p>
<p>No, they just plop them down, give them the stuff they need, and  walk away. Yes. Crazy situation. Go ahead, Mike. &gt;&gt; I have a question, Thomas.</p>
<p>Are they allowing these immigrants to vote in the elections in Britain? &gt;&gt; No. Where was that at? That was uh in France. They&#x27;re working to go ahead and pass something where an an individual who does not live where they uh you know for wherever they live if they&#x27;re not a citizen they can vote in local as well as you know local elections for like councilmen and stuff and mayors and stuff and even the people who take those who are running for those roles don&#x27;t have to be citizens as well. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m going to go to Paris and cast my vote for somebody else.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, you might be able to. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that&#x27;d be a great a great like uh Nick Shirley kind of video. We&#x27;re going to Paris today to go vote in the uh French. &gt;&gt; I mean, it comes down to you go someplace. It&#x27;s like I know so many Vietnamese and Cambodians who came across after the Vietnam war where their country was destroyed either by the CIA like in Cambodia which basically destabilized the government, allowed uh Pulp Pot to come in and just genocide the whole freaking population to what was going on in Vietnam.</p>
<p>We welcomed all these people in and you know what? They love America. They love football. They love baseball. They love their jobs. They love this country.</p>
<p>They fly the American flag. They&#x27;re proud to be Americans. But the thing is, we&#x27;re not seeing that in big swaths of those who have immigrated to this country. They say, &quot;Not my not my president, not my country, not something else.&quot; And they&#x27;ve got like Mexican flags hanging from their wonderful. Why are you here if you&#x27;re not here to support the government that you so want to be a part of? It just doesn&#x27;t make sense.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, no, you uh you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re spot on. &gt;&gt; And I&#x27;m not trying to be racist or anti-immigrant or anything. You know, my great great grandparents. Uh I had my uh the Demals. I believe they came from Denmark.</p>
<p>There was a chocolier company over there related to um my grandmother. She came from Poland. She was over in Poland during World War I. She was in a valley where you would have the Russians uh the Germans would come in and take over the place and they&#x27;d have to move out of the house into the farm and then they the they would get pushed back the the Russians were would come in and they get pushed out back to the farm except the Russians starve the people who live there and they would take the girls and take them by the hair and slam them up against the wall. Now, my grandmother didn&#x27;t tell me what happened next, but you can kind of put the dots together.</p>
<p>My uh great aunt became a nun because of that, because of what she went through during World War I. It was freaking horrible. So, there&#x27;s just a lot of that goes on in a lot of countries and a lot of different places. Sorry, I got down into that, but it&#x27;s just &gt;&gt; Well, before you get off of it, I I have to believe um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m making this statement. The people that hate illegal immigration the most are legal immigrants to the United States.</p>
<p>And what&#x27;s really funny is you never see any mainstream media going and asking legal immigrants, how do you feel about illegal immigration [laughter] cuz they already know the answer. &gt;&gt; You know what? I&#x27;m going to do that. I&#x27;ll get together with my family and get them on film. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; And get them to go ahead and talk about how they feel about it.</p>
<p>But we need to hear this from a different different places because and you look at, you know, I guess this all kind of ties back to voter ID right now that&#x27;s coming our way. And the Dems and freaking Washington are absolutely against it because their asses are on the line. But you know what? Like we just saw in that video clip a little bit ago coming out of that when there was CO all the Dems supported IDs for your COVID vaccines and the enforcement that you had to go ahead and show those IDs wherever you went. So what&#x27;s the difference? &gt;&gt; You have to show your ID to buy alcohol, to buy cigarettes, &gt;&gt; to get on a plane, to leave the country, come back in the country. &gt;&gt; I mean, I if you want to tell me all the poor people in America don&#x27;t have IDs, how are they buying cigarettes and alcohol? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Uh Brian, &gt;&gt; yeah, just real quick, I I real Star for the UK. That was a great video. And &gt;&gt; for us in the United States is shutting down the border. Anybody that wants to whine about that, onethird of women and girls, and when I say girls, I mean you&#x27;re talking, imagine for those of you at home, your six-year-old, your seven-year-old daughters get raped when they come up here. Onethird, they all are given abortion pills.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That was from across our own southern border. I have personally seen the rake trees. They&#x27;re little calibirdie bushes and the girls stand them and as the migrant men come across they get their fill and they move on. So if anything to stop &gt;&gt; So are they are those prostitutes with pimps? Probably. &gt;&gt; No, these are well they &gt;&gt; probably &gt;&gt; the girls come across with a coyote.</p>
<p>The coyote claims that that they are their dad, &gt;&gt; right? and they owe them money for bringing them across. So they have to do something to pay that off. That&#x27;s pro that&#x27;s prostitution. That&#x27;s trafficking. &gt;&gt; I mean, and I don&#x27;t mean to get you a strike with the young thing, Thomas here, but it&#x27;s absolutely sick.</p>
<p>And I know it&#x27;s happening in the UK and it should never happen again. And and if any man worth her salt needs to stand up to this stuff and stop voting for these idiots that encourage this stuff, if only for that. I know this is a UFO channel, but this stuff drives me nuts. I &gt;&gt; personally I know exactly where it is. It&#x27;s &gt;&gt; miles south of me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I have to say Brian, &gt;&gt; you caught me because I&#x27;ve been transitioning the show when different things are going on where it&#x27;s at. Let me find it here. uh to late night update with disclosure tonight. meaning we&#x27;re talking about things that are happening around the world in an independent journalist kind of uh you know position on it for us to go ahead and cover what&#x27;s going on and just get us I hate to say it get us out of the world of just UFOs because there&#x27;s not a lot of things going on but our audience has a lot of stuff they&#x27;re interested in and we want to go ahead and cover and bring our great coverage like we have before when we had the things going on with the drones in the past. Well, I like it Thomas and I &gt;&gt; and the shot and the shoot downs we had in over Ala Dead Horse Alaska United States over Malm.</p>
<p>They tried to shoot it down then over Lake Heron &gt;&gt; and in the Yukon. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, your audience had to hear my rant and and there it is. Uh but &gt;&gt; all that stuff&#x27;s important. Yeah. Especially the shoot down.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And so, look, we&#x27;re all involved in the society together and and we need to make it a better one. And we have interest in things like weather. Like I saw this today and it blew my mind. You know how they talk about there&#x27;s an atmospheric trough that goes on. That&#x27;s something where all the different moisture is delivered through.</p>
<p>This is the first time I&#x27;ve actually seen that modeled in 3D and rotated around. I just saw this and said, &quot;Holy I need to find more of this because this is just amazing.&quot; You know, and that&#x27;s an example of the kind of stuff we deal with with weather. Bringing an open eye to that. We&#x27;ve been talking about things where are going on with the sun because I really think Brian what&#x27;s going on with the sun is really tied to the non-human intelligence and what they&#x27;re doing here on the planet. Why they&#x27;re stepping it up.</p>
<p>They know what&#x27;s going to happen when they&#x27;re trying to get us to a certain point to try and preserve some of that to get us through this next kaboo. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you really turned a me and a lot of the audience on to that. Um and and I I find it absolutely fascinating and I think that&#x27;s obviously happened around the younger dus area too that they tried to &gt;&gt; continue. Well, that&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s the one that was 12,000 years ago, but 6,000 years after the younger dus there was an excursion.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t go completely, but it went certain far and every time that happens, it destabilizes our climate and you see mass populations moving out of areas. What do you think? It was everything was all uh abandoned. in the Mayan culture when they took it over. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; there was already something there. &gt;&gt; And imagine how many cultures may be underwater as well.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh gosh. Yes. &gt;&gt; That we have not found. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Let&#x27;s see.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got uh well, great conversation talking about stuff where we&#x27;re at, where we&#x27;re going towards. Again, we&#x27;re going to keep the conversation going. We have a great community of people that we want to continue to go ahead and uh have an audience with. Maybe we&#x27;ll grow and find some different ways to get to it. But uh based on where I&#x27;m seeing what&#x27;s going on UFO stuff, luckily we did have the video from Saul to go ahead and play today.</p>
<p>The only news that was new was the story coming that we we talked about up front about the uh NASA JPL changing data. We&#x27;ll still cover that as our top topics, but it&#x27;s where you just sometimes you have to change with the times otherwise you become extinct. Don&#x27;t want to be a dinosaur. On that note, well, what a great afternoon everybody. Happy Saturday.</p>
<p>Happy Valentine&#x27;s Day. Let me get this out of here. Does it work? I think so. Come on. You can get up here somewhere.</p>
