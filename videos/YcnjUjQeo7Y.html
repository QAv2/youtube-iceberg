            <p>went the light off first can you turn one okay that&#x27;s good all right when we turn it on the it&#x27;s going in the opposite direction it&#x27;s very [Music] interesting that [Music] gone [Music] well the same thing is going to destroy that one too were you up to full power yet yes yes [Music] thing you did see it move it moved but it moved in the opposite direction which is uh we haven&#x27;t seen that we never done this test before uh so I see it&#x27;s entirely possible that there&#x27;s a if I can use the term electrogravitic effect that is in the opposite direction of the ion effect once you suppress the ion effect then it then you see the real gra effect well this it&#x27;s really interesting because geometry is also very important and there&#x27;s been a lot of experiments done where they know the exact same same thing it&#x27;s even mentioned in Brown&#x27;s patent too um also in mentions patent to is that he used high voltage DC uh he noticed that if he kept increasing the voltage more and more and more the force uh would go would increase more and more and more and then at a point would stop and then reverse that&#x27;s right in this patent you can read it and that&#x27;s very interesting for reverse Direction force of direction there&#x27;s a difference between reduce and amplitude and reverse Direction no reverse and well that&#x27;s a good point is I&#x27;m not sure yeah I read that yeah I forun I can&#x27;t remember everything I didn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t mean to uh exclude some other people&#x27;s results but but anyway what&#x27;s really interesting is that we are still getting thrust even with the bags around it which if they&#x27;re ion wind it should not do we&#x27;re interesting and we&#x27;re getting reverse Direction on it which is very interesting too since we didn&#x27;t reverse polarity there were gaps here on the ground electure that weren&#x27;t quite covered but so it&#x27;s signant when it actually mov with the bags on the on yes I think we can say [Music] that BR apparatus he has the B charge Char the no it&#x27;s exactly the way he has it in his patent this is [Music] a used more of a mask tape nearly as badly it was sparking through the tape yeah we&#x27;re not sure we the transistors we multip back up multipli this is our original multiplier that one&#x27;s a new ones little higher more stages in higher voltage but this at this point we&#x27;re running behind anyway so so we better just do the rest of the talk I mean actually it&#x27;s the same way he had it in his paning at diag looks like it&#x27;s so that was history in the high voltage end is also on the leading is right here and that&#x27;s what he now there are lots of variations uh Stephen here is</p>
