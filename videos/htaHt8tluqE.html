            <p>[Music] What are electrogravitics and how do they claim to defy gravity? Imagine a technology that could make objects flow or even fly without traditional engines or fuel. Sounds like science fiction, right? But some scientists and inventors have explored ideas that suggest this might be possible through a field called electrogravitics. Electrogravidics is a term for a set of concepts and experiments involving high voltage electricity and its potential to influence gravity. The core idea is that by applying very high voltages to specially shaped devices called asymmetric capacitors, you could generate a force that pushes or pulls objects through space. The hope is that this force could counteract gravity, making objects appear to defy it.</p>
<p>This idea started back in the 1920s and 1930s with a physicist named Thomas Townsen Brown. He noticed that when he applied high voltage to asymmetric capacitors, they seem to move or generate thrust toward the smaller electrode. Brown believed this was an anti-gravity effect, not just electrical forces. The phenomenon is often called the Befeld Brown effect, named after Brown and his mentor Paul Beield. In practical terms, devices called ionoccraftrafts or lifters are built based on this principle.</p>
<p>They look like small boxes with wires and electrodes. When high voltage is applied, they lift off the ground, but only in the presence of air. The lift is caused by ionized air molecules pushing against the device known as ionic wind. This is different from true gravity manipulation, which would work even in a vacuum. Some reports from the midentth century suggest that military and aerospace agencies took interest in electrogravitics.</p>
<p>There are claims that it influenced the development of advanced aircraft like the B2 stealth bomber. Some researchers believe that electrogravitics could explain strange propulsion phenomena or even hidden technologies that could revolutionize flight by controlling gravity directly. However, mainstream science remains skeptical. Tests show that the thrust produced by these devices is mainly due to ion wind, not any manipulation of gravity itself. When tested in a vacuum, the lift disappears, which indicates that no anti-gravity effect is happening.</p>
<p>Still, the idea continues to fascinate many, especially because it hints at a way to move objects without expelling mass or using traditional fuel. In the world of eccentric inventions and scientific oddities, electrogravidics remains a curious chapter. It combines scientific experiments, military secrecy, and fringe theories, making it a captivating story about the quest to control gravity and unlock new possibilities in flight and space travel.
