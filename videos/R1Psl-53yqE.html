            <p>so everyone please welcome steve lutz who currently works in computer security and has past experience with corporate projects in physics and engineering on a variety of incredibly interesting topics uh he also is involved in propulsion and works with several well-known theoreticians and experimentalists that get regular mentions on our event so he&#x27;s going to be talking today um at least in part on some of his observations on superconductive gravity modification from working with poglanov modeness and power so welcome sir and uh feel free to go right ahead thank you my my talk is going to be mostly non-technical i would think or medium technical i appreciate the fact that remy&#x27;s on remy cornwall because he can backstop some of the things i think or speculate about but i&#x27;ll just go into a i&#x27;m actually using this new ipod ipad and it follows you around if you notice it&#x27;s weird before i go it just follows me um so i&#x27;ll just give a little brief background how i got involved in this space i was mostly i started a company overseas that that was researching uh novel methods of fabricating group three five nitrides in the semiconductor space so that would be your gallium nitride your indium gallium nitride etc right which is a big thing in the space now i mean my house mostly is gan uh lighting and my iphone charger is again mosfet which is tiny and and very powerful so it&#x27;s a great material system anyway i got involved in the uh what was it the propulsion space simply by uh reading papers that uh professor modeness giovanni modernese had published along with uh afghani pork lettuce a russian porn scientist and in those discussions back and forth with them i started having discussions mostly with of danny about his experiments and then through that uh i think it was giovanni introduced me to dr claude o&#x27;hare over at uh in france working with the two groups i noticed a couple of things one obviously they&#x27;re both working with the same material systems this was ybco uh superconductors and um both required liquid nitrogen cooling we&#x27;ll call it ln2 for now one thing i noticed when talking with kenny he was getting he was using very high uh pulses of electricity and getting these very dramatic effects there was a beam that would uh a force beam that he could measure they did measure the speed of this thing using a couple of rubidium clocks and uh let&#x27;s see what was interesting about it it was a it was a mono uh disc of material he described crystallinity to me being i would say high order polycrystalline not quite monocrystalline but decent quality and he told me that he was getting a self collimating beam out of it which is i thought was was rather interesting out of a single a single uh piece of material so anyway back over to uh claude poger i started actually working with him because um he had some interesting applications what he did was he went to thin films i&#x27;m going to call them low-order polycrystalline he was making himself and he would stack them i think when i was working with him he&#x27;s up to maybe 12 layers all of this is published so i&#x27;m not violating any uh non-disclosure agreements that i have with him and he was getting um he got the voltage down i think to a thousand volts rather than uh again he was using 1.5 million to i think up as high as 3 million volts at some point uh and he was getting a similar effect but it was not self collimating it was conical it kind of fell off pretty quick but he had measured it measured the uh the propulsion from it was quite high he showed me a chart comparing different rocket motors um scramjets ramjets and so forth you had this graph and then as far as his measurements were concerned uh it was way up above anything that we currently use in the you know in the rocket space or whatever so very interesting one of the things um i was tasked with was to work on the cooling budget the ln2 budget to see if we had a side application we were working on and uh there was a coin budget involved so i got in touch with some companies that build such equipment back and forth getting budgets it turned out the budget was quite high the cost of that cooling equipment is high doable but bulky and big nothing you could certainly fly around with um but this was a ground-based application we were working on that led me to looking at the lower i&#x27;m sorry raising the temperature of the superconductor so i started looking into metamaterials which looked very promising that were offering potentially superconducting properties and that was interesting as well i think at that point i reached out to a couple of different research teams that were working on it and then i had to leave the project for other reasons more in the in the information security space which is where i normally reside half the time the other half the time i&#x27;m in the semiconductor space and material science but anyway one thing that he said i asked them a question about the these craft you see them zipping around and whatever we&#x27;ve seen the videos i think they&#x27;ve released and i asked them about i kind of felt foolish when i asked them but i said i used the star trek term uh inertial dampening or whatever i was like how do they how do they get away with this how do they how does the craft survive it and if there&#x27;s any say occupants for example biologics how would they survive it you know with these g-forces that are happening and he kind of said well i&#x27;ll show you how it works and he started doing some math and then he pointed me to the quantum locking that tel aviv university had demonstrated and he said it&#x27;s similar to that it&#x27;s related to that but it&#x27;s not the same thing it doesn&#x27;t involve magnets or whatever so i kind of thought that stuck in my head i left the project but i still kept thinking about as an engineer i kept thinking how would you establish a field like that and i built a craft in my mind you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a shape maybe it&#x27;s a sphere in this case i did like a sort of a saucer or whatever and i started looking at the material i said okay let&#x27;s say magically we have meta materials that are room temperature superconductors great now how would you i already know the thruster part of it that that that&#x27;s pretty well they&#x27;re pretty far along with that but i was like how would you create this field and sustain it in the craft and i thought about the tel aviv stuff and i was like well okay first thing i thought of was uh took me back to the the group three five nitride research right so in three five nitrides you work with seaplane which is normal that&#x27;s what i was working with because i was on a low budget then you can work with m plane which is like semi-orbital and then if you got a real big budget like military would work with the p-plane which is non-orbital uh planes and i knew i had discussions with the chief scientist over at darpa the defense uh advanced well i think they call themselves arpa now but we were talking about these these problems and he it became very clear that if you could grow the materials it&#x27;s a hexagonal um structure you know again or ingan similar to zinc oxide if you&#x27;re familiar um so if you grow it seaplane it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of flat if you grow an m-plane it&#x27;s at an angle so you have these crystals growing and they&#x27;re rather delicate if you heat them too much when you&#x27;re growing them they&#x27;ll just kind of crumble and then the hardest one was the the p-plane the non-orbital but as you as you move from uh orbital to to semi-orbital to non-orbital you get amazing performance increases out of the material right so the brass ring in the nitride space is non-orbital and you can google it and there&#x27;s a lot of papers on it but i started applying that thinking to the to this uh hypothetical meta material i had in my head so i put it non-orbital on the on the shell of this craft so the whole the craft has a surface and i&#x27;ve got this magic meta material that hasn&#x27;t been invented yet and it&#x27;s in a non-orbital state it&#x27;s sitting there so the next thing i was reading patent by uh some patents by a gentleman by the name of levin good has anybody i don&#x27;t know if anybody&#x27;s read any of his stuff he um how did i find him he was the guy that basically got involved with um as a researcher linda linda moulton howell and he was investigating these crop circle things and through our audio recording i think he was able to reverse engineer to some degree what what was going on in those in those in those fields and he built an apparatus he patented it basically what it did it was like two you had a nano to a cathode and um he would hit it with the dc voltage with a uh ac ripple superimposed on the dc which i thought was very interesting and what would happen was there would be like this self-organizing uh plasma cascade of ions and in the middle of that excuse me he would put a variety of different seeds and treat them at different you know intensities and then you know measure the output it was very interesting it would it would um that the plants depending on the plant would grow either 15 to 25 faster or you could tune it and it would grow at the same rate but 15 or 25 bigger more yield you get more corn you get more whatever anyway i was thinking about that patent and i was reading it and i thought what if we what if we took that superconductor material and we hit it with that same type of energy right we hit it with dc to saturate it and then it superimposed ac on it and maybe got it to resonate right in some way and the thought i had in my mind was what if you cranked up the the ac portion so that you run the gigahertz or even terahertz frequency range and if you did that would you create standard waves within the with inside of this craft with that would that occur you know like you deal with audio you can do it all the time stain waves it&#x27;s a big i used to be an audio engineer it was a big problem for sustaining waves so anyway i thought what if you did that and you can create this field that dr pohair was referring to which was that related to that that quantum locking would you get a field that inside you&#x27;re in the craft and you&#x27;re basically quantum locked so you&#x27;re you wouldn&#x27;t feel any inertia if the craft was zigging around whatever you probably wouldn&#x27;t feel uh gravity fields or outside it basically this field would stand in for the mass you know all the atoms inside and including the skin of the craft this is my thought anyway this could all be very way off base i don&#x27;t know so i was playing with that in my head and thinking okay maybe that would work i have to talk to somebody who&#x27;s well trained in physics to see if there&#x27;s any any merit to that thought those thoughts and then later i was working on hypersonics i was looking at hypersonic aircraft i had a mutual friend with uh mark lewis over the department of defense they&#x27;re heavily looking into you know obviously hypersonics and i started studying the problem and see this uh on the skin of the craft you have crazy things happen at hydrosonic speeds it&#x27;s it&#x27;s chemistry it&#x27;s um like for example if you have a hypersonic aircraft it&#x27;s going through the atmosphere it hits a pollution layer that changes a lot you have to account for that you have to adjust for it that the skin of the craft is there&#x27;s some crazy physics happening so i thought about that and i was i was looking at using fractal mathematics to model that problem which after i googled it the chinese were already doing exactly that so a little late to the game however i thought about my my fictional craft right with that fictional meta material with that field the standing waves inside and everybody&#x27;s all comfy inside not subject to inertial you know movement or whatever and i started thinking about the skin of that craft and the field right my my non-orbital meta material obviously from the skin in you have this nice standing wave thing that you&#x27;ve that you&#x27;ve put together but the outside of that is going to be because it&#x27;s non-orbital for example you&#x27;re going to have uh whatever this field is is going to be projecting out a short way off the skin of the craft and the thought occurred to me how would that change the drag coefficient of this thing in other words you have let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re an atmosphere you know you&#x27;re going through nitrogen oxygen humidity whatever would when it comes in contact would that change the drag coefficient the answer is i have no idea but it certainly would change it you know if you have yeah my pin right what remy just said it might pin the air around it to some degree or who knows right but it&#x27;s like a half field it&#x27;s not a stained wave at this point it&#x27;s going to be like this i thought in my mind it&#x27;s like hairs or cilia coming off of energy right coming off the skin probably not not a long distance depending on the other the the the intensity of the field the other thing that that came to mind i was thinking about it is when this let&#x27;s say this field is standing in for the mass of the of the craft and the mass would be the material itself all the atmosphere inside if there&#x27;s any beings in there people or whatever everything is there a relationship between the amount of energy you need to establish that field and the total mass of the craft or is it independent it&#x27;s just a volumetric thing you don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;ve got lead in there or if you&#x27;ve got aluminum or whatever i don&#x27;t know right but the thought i was trying to wrestle with it in my mind um let&#x27;s see what happened next so i thought okay that&#x27;s a question if you can create this field what would the would it impact the drag coefficient of the of the craft the answer is maybe who knows the next thing i thought of i was rereading the old stuff with uh einstein&#x27;s work and you know everybody knows that you know you take mass you accelerate it it comes near light speed approaches light speed mass becomes infinite you know there&#x27;s a lot of debate about why you know what&#x27;s the mechanism and i thought in my head what if just like you take a ferrous material like and run it through a magnetic field and it picks up energy right like they had this problem when they when they first came out with um steam engines and they would run them and the axles would become energized because it&#x27;s you know moving through a magnetic field and they solved the problem but that idea only you have this field that&#x27;s standing in for the mass and so as let&#x27;s say the field is standing in for it i call it a substitution for a mass substitution kind of thing the field itself as you approach light speed instead of the mass increasing it would pick up energy from the from the ether or whatever we&#x27;re calling the you guys would know the terms better than me but it might pick up energy and your only problem at that point would be bleeding off that energy but your mass problem might not might not be there so you might even be able to approach uh or hit light speed without the headaches of infinite mass right maybe i don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s another idea but the thought occurred to me if this thing is standing if it&#x27;s not only like uh doing this quantum locking thing for the craft and the occupants or whatever but if it also might might stand in for the mass which i kind of skipped ahead a little bit but i started thinking about it if you had this craft and you energized it and put a mouse in it you shook it around the mouse would just sit there right it would be almost like a zog environment right and uh let&#x27;s see so yeah so if you have this thing this field is established right you would feel like you&#x27;re weightless inside so i did talk to uh dr pereira about this problem and basically what you can do is set up a field within a field you could and he showed me how you would do it you just those thrusters were talking about you would just have a a one g um down source let&#x27;s say you want you pick the floor of the thing and you&#x27;d have this thing constantly going would be like a magnetic field it would circle around and you&#x27;d constantly have this one g so you could create an atmosphere inside the craft we had this constant one g no matter which orientation it had you&#x27;d always be you know stuck to the floor that was interesting but the thing i thought was if you establish this craft with this field and it&#x27;s standing in for the mass temporarily while the field is is up you would be able to let&#x27;s say you had a 10 000 kilo craft right and then you turn on the field and it might turn into a 10 gram craft let&#x27;s just say and at that point how much thrust do you really need i mean remy could do quick calculation you could go up to it with a with a baseball bat hit it and probably knock it down range depending on the drag coefficient a long way which is just a just a baseball bat and i thought okay if that&#x27;s the case that would be quite interesting because that field which i was only focused on making that field for the um the quantum locking and the benefits you would have of not having to deal with g-forces might also give you a couple of other um very interesting benefits one being a modified or reduced drag coefficient right it could also it could also reduce the mass of the craft and this kind of a light bulb went on because i had several discussions with jack sarfati about this and you know he was talking about it it&#x27;s a low power you know metric space metric engineering approach and i thought this what i&#x27;m talking about is not high power right this would be just just hitting with dc maybe i don&#x27;t know you know the voltages but could be in the thousands or maybe you know 10 000 volts whatever and then and then creating this ac ripple over it and let&#x27;s say the terahertz range or gigahertz range and getting this effect that you want and maybe maybe you would have this craft that would have this amazing performance capabilities you&#x27;d have this you&#x27;re on vacation from a lot of the physics that would normally affect mass and um and and this is interesting if it is nearly massless then the amount of thrust you would need to propel it at high speeds whether it be in atmosphere or space or underwater whatever wouldn&#x27;t be a ton of you know if it&#x27;s a low mess i just there was a gentleman that posted something today i think his name is charlie on this group it was about an insect insects with this hexagonal um secondary wing system that they pull up and that might have some i don&#x27;t know anti-gravity effects and i thought yesterday i was looking at insects and there was one insect that can jump and exhibit 400 g you know 400 newton uh yeah 400 g g-force and the scientists were looking at how does it survive that and one of the things obviously is that it&#x27;s a low mass a low mass insect they could do these 400 g jumps and it got me to thinking if the craft is low mass all of a sudden you turn it into a low mass object you might be able to get away with all types of maneuvers and use very little power to uh to make it move about as opposed to you know the high-powered you know thrusters or rocket motors or whatever you like anyway that those are my thoughts i just want to lay them out there and kind of the journey i went through and some of the stuff i brought in from the material science world specifically the the group 35 nitrides you know ingan indium gallium nitride and um how that might be applied there was a gentleman on this call that mentioned i&#x27;m sorry i don&#x27;t know your name you were mentioning some of the stuff just in brief comments before i started talking and i&#x27;d like to hear your thoughts on that right but i don&#x27;t know your name but you were talking about some of this uh stuff so i&#x27;d like just people to chime in and at this point just tell me what they think of any and all of these thoughts okay well what so why don&#x27;t we do this before before we go to questions let me put this on gallery view and everyone please put your hands together for steve and that was that was one heck of a stream of consciousness actually you went over a bunch of stuff</p>
