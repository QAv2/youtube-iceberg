            <p>all right hello welcome to my channel we do educational stuff on this channel and um normally we work on series of everything particularly theories of everything that you&#x27;ve never heard about and that you probably won&#x27;t ever hear about except for this channel and uh today is our 220th video on Dewey B Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory and I could probably do a couple thousand videos on Larson&#x27;s system but um hopefully I&#x27;ll stop short of that and move into other subjects at a certain point but right now we&#x27;re uh kind of about to wrap up uh his 1979 book called Nothing But motion and nothing but motion is a good way to kind of summarize Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory in general Larson posits that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion matter and energy are just two different kinds of motion as are many of the other scientific phenomena that you&#x27;re familiar with such as pressure and acceleration speed uh matter and energy electric current electric charge magnetic flux uh electrical Electric electrical capacitance uh density and and um Force and fluidity viscosity these are all forms of motion and what characterizes motion for Larson is that motion is the relationship between space and time all of the aforementioned um entities are basically fractions where time or space is in the numerator and space or time is in the denominator uh but in Larson&#x27;s first postulate that he came out with in the 1950s his first and primary main postulate he postulates that space and time both have their coordinate aspects coordinate space we&#x27;re familiar with three dimensions of space but there also is coordinate time three or more dimensions of time and um so that complicates things a little bit and uh you can have quantities such as matter time to the third power over space to the third power resistance time to the second power over space to the third power permeability uh time to the third power over space to the fourth power you have things like acceleration time over space to the second space over time to the second power or Force time over space to the second power energy is simply time over space and as we probably know speed is space over time the bicycle is moving at 15 miles per hour 15 miles of space in one hour of time and so it is very convenient to be able to have these space-time um space and time only components of all of our favorite uh scientific quantities uh makes it very easy a lot more easy than the MKS system because uh that&#x27;s meter kilogram second well meter and kilogram uh meter and second are time and space but the kilogram is matter time to the third power over space to the third power that kind of follows everything up we can just get rid of that and then you just have the MS system or really just the reciprocal system another uh aspect of Larson&#x27;s postulates is that space and time both have their clock aspects we&#x27;re familiar with clock time the time is always getting later and later and later but in no particular direction this is what Larson calls a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but has no particular direction and that is the flow or the progression of space of of time but there is also the flow or progression of space Larson calls that clock space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and we perceive that in the Hubble telescope looking through it we can see that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other that is the flow of space which you can model with a balloon and a magic marker and put some dots on the balloon and blow up the balloon although of the dots are moving away from each other uh the further away they are the faster they are moving away from each other you can also use something like raisin bread for this if you want to add in that dimension of the interior of it all of the raisins are moving away from each other as you bake the bread uh now another aspect of the first postulate is that space and time both come in only discrete units there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time um they&#x27;re very small but they uh exist and so you can&#x27;t get less than one unit of space or time inside of one unit of space or time uh you don&#x27;t have space and you don&#x27;t have time respectively now one exactly one unit of space in one unit of time again that&#x27;s space over time or speed one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light for Larson is really one calls it unit speed and um it divides our universe in half more or less there is a half of the universe that is moving slower than the speed of light that Larson calls the material sector and that we are familiar with and our scientists are familiar with through their observations and measurements but there is another half of the universe that is actually moving faster than the speed of light which Larson calls the cosmic sector and this sector of the universe is virtually unknown um evidenced by what Einstein said where the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe whereas Larson says it is the midpoint of the universe that&#x27;s because Einstein didn&#x27;t know anything about the faster than speed of light part of the universe and that part of the universe is on top of us but we just don&#x27;t perceive it we&#x27;re not able to really see in time we only really see in space and so you can see here in the material sector you basically have what is called coordinate space three dimensions of space and clock time and uh in order to extrapolate that information over to the cosmic sector you simply reverse the roles of space and time that&#x27;s the general nature of reciprocity or the the reciprocal system and so in the cosmic sector you have three dimensions of time and uh or coordinate time and clock space progressing space so those are unfamiliar to us but that is what is dictated by the reciprocal system uh and then uh you know when you&#x27;re trying to form a matter you&#x27;re really uh atoms you&#x27;re really dealing inside a unit of space over in the material sector and over in the cosmic sector you&#x27;re dealing inside a unit of time inside a unit of space you don&#x27;t have space because of the discrete unit postulate you only have time and so in this in this realm of uh less than a unit of space which is where the atom is formed uh you have what Larson calls the time region and in the same way over here where you&#x27;re talking about Cosmic matter or what the Legacy scientists call anti-matter you have a inside a unit of time there is no time there is only space so that&#x27;s called the space region uh this is all pretty uh elegantly mapped out by the tajitu if that&#x27;s how you pronounce it from the from Chinese Taoism the yin yang diagram with the squiggly line between two sectors and they both have dots within them that is a good representation of Larson&#x27;s universe and that squiggly line is the uh speed of light okay now um we are about to wrap up this chapter here which is called Simple compounds in chapter 18 of uh nothing but motion and after this I think I&#x27;m just going to summarize a little bit about the remaining three or four chapters and then look at a little a little bit at the other two books that are in this um trilogy or a three-volume work called the structure of the physical Universe there is nothing but motion then the second book is called basic properties of matter third book is called the universe of motion and uh we will eventually go over those other books but there um even a little bit more advanced in this and so um I&#x27;d like to lay it a little bit of groundwork and maybe move into some other material um uh still on the reciprocal system but by some other authors and um just uh a little bit more perspective so let me take over here or let Larson take over here of the last couple paragraphs of this chapter on um simple compounds another point that should be noted here is that when hydrogen acts in a positive capacity it does so as a division three element not as a member of division one it&#x27;s plus one valence is therefore magnetic that is why hydrogen was assigned only to the negative position in the revised periodic table rather than giving it two positions as has been customary the variation and negativity with the size of the magnetic displacement has the effect of extending the Division III Behavior into division four to a limited extent in the higher groups lead for example has practically no division IV characteristics and bismuth has less than its counterparts in the lower groups at the lower end of the atomic Series this situation is reversed and the division IV characteristics extend into division three as an alternative to the normal positive behavior of some of the elements of that division silicon for instance not only forms combinations such as magnesium manganese silicon and Cobalt silicon 3. which on the basis of the information currently available appear to be intermetallic compounds similar to those of the higher division three elements but also combinations such as magnesium II silicon and calcium silicon 2 which are probably true compounds analogous to brillium two carbon and calcium dicarbon carbon carries this trend still farther and forms carbides with a wide variety of cosmic positive components in the 2A group the division four characteristics extend to The Fifth Element Boron this is only the only case in which the fifth element of a Series has division four properties and the behavior of boron in the compound formation is correspondingly unique in its division one capacity as the positive component in compounds such as B Boron II oxygen three uh Boron is entirely normal but its first order negative valence would be negative five formation of compounds based on this negative five valence conflicts with the previously stated limitation of the negative valence to a maximum of four units Boron therefore shifts to an enhanced negative valence adding two positive units to its first order value of minus five with a resultant of minus three the direct combinations of boron with positive elements have such structures as iron boron Feb and copper three boron 2. however many of the borides have complex structures in which the effective valences are not as clearly indicated this raises a question as to whether boron may be an exception to the rule limiting the maximum negative valence to minus four and may utilize both the negative five and negative three valences this issue would will be considered in the next chapter okay and that is the end of this chapter uh the next chapter is called complex compounds and I just think that uh we probably want to postpone going into this chapter uh until there&#x27;s a little bit more Foundation laid and people are more comfortable with this uh including me um this is a lot of organic chemistry I believe and um you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s important stuff but it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s a little bit off the track of um you know trying to introduce people to the reciprocal system I do want to you know provide Larson&#x27;s own words and to be able to present the system in some kind of depth but this is probably a little bit too deep for us right now um the chapter 19 complex compounds and then I believe there&#x27;s also a chapter here on ring compounds um having a little bit of trouble scrolling this this chapter is extremely long as well um so that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s kind of what I think if anybody has a complaint about that and they want to get into this right away more power to you um now uh I&#x27;m trying to get to the next chapter here uh but um the the next book in this uh Trilogy is called basic properties of matter and basic properties of matter is primarily on chemistry and uh you know kind of this is a little bit strange because this chapter here is on organic chemistry and you would think that you would need a little bit of regular chemistry before you get into the organic chemistry but so the the book basic properties of matter starts with uh chapters on compressibility um inter-atomic distances which is you know establishment within the time region of an equilibrium um because in the time region and in the space region the roles are reversed uh from what they are in the material and Cosmic sector respectively and so in the material sector you have the force of gravity which brings everything closer together and then in the um in the cosmic sector or you have the force of gravity which brings things closer together and then you also have the um what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system which is basically anti-gravity although it&#x27;s primary to gravity so really gravity is kind of like anti-progression actually but uh the um progression of the natural reference system is really you know the flow of space uh it brings it brings everything moves everything farther and farther away but if you cross into the time region then the roles are reversed and gravity actually moves everything away from each other out toward the boundary of uh what Larson calls the unit space boundary out out to the quantum uh level of space within the time region and the progression actually moves everything closer and closer together so mainstream science is usually looking toward gravity as the force that brings everything closer together but within the atom it&#x27;s actually the opposite it&#x27;s the progression that causes um things like solid cohesion okay so now if you&#x27;re looking at Larson&#x27;s book here Volume 2 of the structure of the physical Universe uh basic properties of matter I&#x27;m just going to read the uh the chapters here for you chapter one solid cohesion chapter 2 interatomic distances chapter 3 distances and compounds chapter 4 compressibility five heat six specific heat patterns seven temperature relations eight thermal expansion nine electric currents ten electrical resistance 11 thermoelectric properties 12 scalar motion 13 electric charges 14 the basic forces 15 electrical storage 16 induction of charges 17 ionization 18. The Retreat from reality 19. magnetics magnetostatics 20 magnetic quantities and units 21 electromagnetism 22 charges in motion 23 magnetic materials 24 Isotopes 25 radioactivity 26 atom building 27 mass and energy okay so that is uh that is what uh basic properties of matter is about and it&#x27;s actually a great book uh it&#x27;s very very difficult obviously um you know any type of book on chemistry is pretty difficult so don&#x27;t blame Larson for everything there but uh it&#x27;s also introducing a lot of new and unfamiliar Concepts we will be getting into this book before long but for right now I think we&#x27;re gonna move back and study a few other authors that are also talking about the reciprocal system of theory and we&#x27;ll get into that starting tomorrow so thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
