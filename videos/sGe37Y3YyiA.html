            <p>all right hello everyone out there I&#x27;m Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos on uh topics esoteric and obscure um mostly and uh we&#x27;ve been doing a little um course here on the reciprocal system of theory originated by Dewey B Larson back in the middle uh part of the 20th century and uh updated in the 21st century by uh Dr Bruce perrett and Dr kbk nehru and others and um we&#x27;ve been reading over uh an address that Larson gave to the uh Isis the international Society for the for a unified science and this is a 1986 talk that he gave uh called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system at this point Larson was uh 88 years old I believe and um you know coming to the end of the road but you know this is he has already been kind of working on his theory for like 50 years over 50 years by this time um and so he&#x27;s trying to lay out his thought process because that&#x27;s how the reciprocal system goes he&#x27;s got you know two original postulates um universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between time and space space and time are the same except that there are reciprocals of each other that&#x27;s paraphrasing and then the other postulate is in dispute from uh paret and others but it&#x27;s basically that the universe uh conforms to the laws of uh commutative mathematics and its uh um uh something our absolute its measurements are absolute or it&#x27;s uh and its geometry is euclidean and uh paret disputes that says that euclidean geometry is uh is a subset of the reciprocal system part of the reciprocal system is in euclidean Geometry but there&#x27;s a geometrical Cascade that occurs from projective geometry to a fine geometry to metric geometry then to euclidean Geometry so euclidean geometry is just a special case of the universe so um and I think Larson might have actually agreed with that had he known about these more modern geometries um but he felt like it was going to confuse matters even more than they already were and that&#x27;s kind of the case with Larson and to a great extent is that this subject matter seems so difficult because he&#x27;s trying to undo this whole system of lies of the mainstream Legacy science uh lies and half truths and rationalizations and all these things and he&#x27;s trying to figure out how he fits into it because he&#x27;s a scientist himself so he he is somewhat invested invested in into all the science but at the same time he&#x27;s got this different Theory and you know he he even says that you know 90 of Legacy science fits into his theory but it&#x27;s the 10 percent that he&#x27;s going after the the realm of the very small the very large the very fast the very slow and um you know but so he&#x27;s in this in this article he&#x27;s just laying out uh step by step how he developed the system we&#x27;re up to number 32 um uh you know development number 32 if the scalar motion is less than three-dimensional the basic Photon will move outward as radiation in a vacant Dimension and the motion combination will disintegrate in order to be stable the rotational lead the rotationally distributed motion must therefore be three-dimensional okay so the photon is just a one-dimensional kind of um nullification of the progression that at a light speed and that&#x27;s why it still moves at light speed because it still has these two free Dimensions but you have to you have to nullify all three of the dimensions before you have something stable um that you can work with which would be like an atom and that&#x27;s what he calls gravitation is the three-dimensional inward motion that nullifies the uh three-dimensional outward motion that he calls the progression of the natural reference system which we see uh both by the progression of time and its equivalent the progression of space which is the recession of the distant galaxies okay now to move to number 33 the three-dimensional combination of vibrational and rotationally distributed motions appears in the reference system as a as an identifiable object moving inward in all directions we identify such an object as an atom or a subatomic particle collectively the atoms and particles constitute matter okay so you need a three-dimensional combination of vibrational and rotationally distributed motions uh we identify Mass this is number 34. we identify mass as a measure of the net magnitude of the rotationally distributed scalar motions of matter we identify the observable inward directed effects of this motion as gravitation the magnitude of the gravitational effect is therefore directly proportional to the Mass okay number 35 the inward gravitational motion of the atoms results in the formation of material Aggregates of various sizes in these Aggregates the atomic motions and masses are independent and additive number 36. the outward motion due to the progression of the natural reference system always takes place at unit speed regardless of the size of the aggregate or the distance that is involved the net relative motion of any two gravitating objects with no additional motions is the algebraic sum of the unit outward motion and the unit inward motion okay so you just add them together uh it&#x27;s really more like subtracting them because of the spherical distribution of the gravitational Motion in the reference system the magnitude of the motion of one unit of matter toward another is inversely proportional to the square of the intervening distance okay that&#x27;s again the gravitational inverse Square law okay now uh number 37. at relatively short distances gravitation predominates and the net motion is inward since the gravitational motion decreases with distance while the outward progression remains constant the opposing motions reach equality at some greater distance which we will call the gravitational limit Beyond this distance the net motion is outward increasing with distance and approaching Unity at extreme distances this theoretical pattern of net speeds is verified observationally by measurements of the Doppler shift in the radiation received from the distant galaxies and so this is like the redshift the further away um these astronomical bodies are from us the faster they&#x27;re moving away from us and that&#x27;s because all of these all of these bodies are outside of the gravitational limit so inside the gravitational limit bodies tend to move toward uh like we&#x27;ll say of Earth inside the gravitational limit of Earth bodies tend to move toward Earth outside of that gravitational limit the bodies will tend to move away and if it&#x27;s very very far away the further away the closer to the speed of light of that the um body is moving away now this is complicated somewhat uh by the sun and the solar system so you know we can we can look and calculate the Earth&#x27;s gravitational limit and he does have an equation for that but um even if we get outside of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational limit um we still you know uh at least at the start are within the sun&#x27;s gravitational limit so even if something is far enough away from Earth so that it doesn&#x27;t fall into Earth uh it&#x27;s still within the sun&#x27;s gravitational limit and given that the sun is like a million times um more massive than the earth the sun&#x27;s gravitational limit is much uh much longer uh much larger than the earth now um he eventually you know has a couple of different gravitational limits um that eventually he&#x27;ll talk about we&#x27;ll talk about but uh for the Sun the gravitational limit is gigantic okay um so the the gravitational limit the first gravitational limit anyway is like an island so everything within that eventually will come uh crashing into the sun um but uh anything outside of that is then in free space unless it&#x27;s within the gravitational limit of some other star but the gravitational limit of the of the sun is something like uh 3.61 light years um and so that&#x27;s a huge huge bubble that the sun has that basically it possesses everything within that if you if you go all the way out to Pluto um you know at the edge of the solar system and this is all even if you believe uh that there is a solar system in that space exists and that you know all of this is not you know fake um even if you go all the way out to Pluto I think uh Pluto is is like less than one one thousandth of a light year so um you know we&#x27;re talking about 3 000 over 3 000 times as far as Pluto is is the sun&#x27;s realm and uh Bruce Perrette has uh strongly push back on this whole thing and he thinks that uh he he basically adjusted the equation for the gravitational limit uh he he buys in much more into uh the astronomy of uh Barham Karai if that&#x27;s I&#x27;m pronouncing that correctly uh who really says that the distances between the stars and even the planets is way off base and that um you know within one light year of here there are all kinds of other stars and star systems and planetary systems and that [Music] um uh I think uh paret goes and recalculates the the gravitational limit and it shoots it down by like a factor of uh a thousand or something like that so anyway uh just to say that this is something that is contested number 37 even though peret doesn&#x27;t put in a footnote here okay number 38 the conventional spatial reference system in conjunction with a clock for measuring time represents a physical situation in which the space component of the progression of the natural reference system is neutralized by gravitation while the time component progresses at the full normal rate in this reference system the space progression as indicated by the motion of a massless object appears as a one-dimensional motion through three-dimensional space so that&#x27;s the progression of space uh the recession of the distant galaxies and then also the progression of time which is scalar motion um so it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later but there&#x27;s no particular direction number 39 since we postulate a reciprocal relation between space and time each of the deductions expressed in the foregoing numbered statements is also valid in the inverse form that is with space and time interchanged number 40 we identify the time component of the progression of the natural reference system as the flow of time registered on a clock it follows from uh the foregoing that motion in time this is number 41 Motion in time takes place in three dimensions in the same manner as Motion in space the time component of the progression of the natural reference system uh or clock time is a one-dimensional outward motion through a stationary three-dimensional temporal system of reference in which in independent motions at different speeds and different directions also take place motion at unit speed number 42 motion at unit speed causes unit change of position in both the spatial reference system and the temporal reference system it is a motion in time as well as emotion in space okay number 43 when motion takes place in time the constant progression analogous to clock time is in space and would be measured by some kind of a space clock but the rates of progression are the same one unit of space and one unit of time per unit of motion thus the measurements relative to the space clock are identical with those relative to a clock that registers time if expressed in the same units for 44. as noted the space-time ratio in the units of motion is fixed at Unity by the reciprocal postulates it follows that a reduction of speed as for instance by an increase in the distance between gravitating objects does not alter the ratio of space to time in the effective motion it reduces the proportion of the total motion that is effective in increasing the spatial separation of the objects this effective portion of the motion increases the Separation by X units of space per one unit of clock time where X is a fraction and because of the fixed relation between space and time in the individual units also increases the separation in time by X units okay number 45.</p>
<p>where only one motion is involved the X units of time are coincident with the time progression and do not enter separately into the determination of the speed but if two objects are moving their relative position in space may change at a rate exceeding Unity by some quantity uh from the previous 44 we the change in the separation in time then also exceeds Unity by X the speed is the quantity one plus X over the quantity 1 plus X which equals one thus if at least one of the two objects is a photon or of other object moving with unit speed the relative speed is always Unity uh and disagree agrees with statement eight this is the explanation of the observed fact that the speed of light is independent of the reference system okay this is number 46 and the last one we&#x27;ll do today where motion at a speed greater than Unity Motion in time takes place under conditions that preclude actual changes of position in time this motion acts as a modifier of the spatial motion that is a motion in equivalent space the spatial equivalent of a temporal magnitude X is 1 over X okay a lot of stuff there probably too hard to follow for everybody too hard to follow for me even and I&#x27;ve been studying this stuff for 20 years Larson writes in such a dry manner that uh like I said so many prepositional phrases it&#x27;s very hard to keep track um so I&#x27;m recording this you can go back and listen to it over and over again if you need to um but I just don&#x27;t get discouraged um you know this is just an overview this is just to give an idea of how Larson thinks and how this is developed we&#x27;ll get into these more specific items in more detail uh later on down the road um but I just wanted to lay this down as a you know Foundation okay so have a great day and uh we will see you next time uh starting with number 47.</p>
