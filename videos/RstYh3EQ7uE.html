            <p>the scientific method was shown to be inadequate in terms of fully describing what was on the property we deployed a lot of sophisticated sensors in different areas of the property we would have a whole bunch of sensors deployed around a specific area that had activity that the previous nights or the previous weeks and then we would deploy a lot of a lot of focus and then find the next day or two that a whole bunch of activity had happened on the very end of the the opposite end of the ranch outside the sphere of where the humans and the uh and the people were were focused so it was almost like we were playing cotton mouse with something that knew what we were doing and that was very evasive and very deceptive and very sort of skilled in being able to camouflage itself and if it didn&#x27;t want to be discovered it wouldn&#x27;t be discovered</p>
