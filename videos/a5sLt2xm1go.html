            <p>you ever hear about waves that aren&#x27;t really waves in the traditional sense meet scalar waves the enigmatic cousin of the more familiar electromagnetic waves unlike regular waves that move up and down or side to side scalar waves propagate in expanding circles and their strength doesn&#x27;t diminish over distance some claim they could revolutionize communication energy and even healing Nikola Tesla was said to have dabbled with scalar wave technology yet despite their potential they remain on the fringes of mainstream science if scalar waves hold such potential why aren&#x27;t they more widely researched and understood</p>
