            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel dedicated toward um filling you in on some great theories of everything and cosmologies all-encompassing theories Magnum opuses from obscure authors and um anything else that I think could really help you with your life uh your uh Paradigm shifting your um holistic uh you know uh can&#x27;t can&#x27;t quite think of the word there uh you know holistic development um or just satisfying your curiosity and uh today is our 362nd video on the reciprocal system of Theory from one Dewey Bernard Larson and uh Mr Larson lived in the 20th century uh and he was a uh mining engineer out west in Portland and um about 1930 he had certain epiphanies about um the nature of kind of like the periodic table and um he was kind of looking for an equation for the interatomic distance of elements and compounds and ended up stumbling across some uh you know um intuitions that were uh even beyond that scope that were more revolutionary more fundamental and he pursued those and eventually much later in 1959 he uh put out his two fundamental postulates these are uh concise explanations of how the world works and from those postulates he uh went into a a developing a theoretical Universe through developing those postulates through a process of deduction and you know expounding on them now I have uh about uh 15 videos on that process uh way back maybe about 10 months ago uh called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system where Larson goes through his thought process uh all 165 steps um toward developing a theoretical universe and then in larsson&#x27;s books he kind of go goes uh through goes over his theoretical universe and shows how it stands up against uh some of the uh modern Legacy theories not only the Newtonian Universe also the einsteinian quantum mechanist and so on and it does appear to me at least that Larson&#x27;s um findings stand up quite well so that is one of the main uh attractors for me uh I just think that it&#x27;s a kind of a beautiful Theory uh it&#x27;s not uh fullprof uh it&#x27;s he doesn&#x27;t have all the Kinks worked out and he died back in 1990 but some people have come along since then and have uh attempted to um improve upon the theory and spread it out and one of those people is Dr Bruce paret we&#x27;re going to be looking at uh one of the papers that he wrote today uh but first let&#x27;s just uh get into larsson&#x27;s postulates uh Larson&#x27;s First Fundamental postulate and the most important is that uh the universe is composed entirely of one component motion not matter not energy not force but motion and in fact matter and energy and force are all just different varieties of motion and for Larson um motion was the relationship between space and time you can think of motion as basically a fraction uh with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator um think for example of speed the bicycle is moving at 17 M hour that is 17 mil of space in 1 hour of time space over time equals speed or you could say I dro the ball out of the window and it fell at 32 ft per second per second that is 32 ft of space in 1 second per second of time space over time to the second power acceleration or you could turn it around say I it took me Me 3 hours to push that thing one mile that&#x27;s 3 hours of time in one mile of space time over space energy and so on and so forth um just to show that you know uh all of our basic uh scientific quantities are forms of motion and can be expressed exclusively through time and space okay now back to Larson&#x27;s first postulate the universe is composed entirely of motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects X space and time okay that is a reciprocal relationship between space and time you can see that if you try to double the speed uh you start out that um the bicycle is moving 17 miles hour well let&#x27;s try to double the speed well then you can say the bicycle is now moving 34 miles per hour or you can say the bicycle is moving 17 mil per half hour either way is equivalent you&#x27;re doubling the speed either way you can either multiply the space by two or you can divide the time by two that is a reciprocal relationship and um so that is you know uh the first prong there of the uh first postulate two reciprocal aspects space and time then you have the uh three-dimensionality now another quality that uh that reciprocals have is that they um if you multiply them together they equal one and also if you um if you have one if one of them has a certain quality the other one also has that quality uh you can think of the fraction 1/4 and it&#x27;s reciprocal for over one they both when you multiply them together they equal one and when uh you look at their qualities they&#x27;re both the same they both have one and they both have four but one of them has 1/4 in the order 1 over 4 and the other one has 4 over one so they have the same numbers but they&#x27;re in a different order and uh that is similar with uh the second prong here of Larson&#x27;s first postulate that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions now what we know about space is that space is threedimensional now we don&#x27;t know that I I could definitely come up with some arguments that space is four-dimensional um other people might be able to come up with other numbers but in general uh we think of space as three-dimensional XYZ coordinates uh if you&#x27;re graphing it out um and just the concept of volume three-dimensional volume and uh Larson is basically saying that well what I observe about space is that space has three dimensions therefore since time is a reciprocal of space time must also have three dimensions so he posits the idea of three-dimensional time what he calls coordinate time and then he also um um has and now this is kind of an understated part of the first postulate and I wish that Larson would have included one more word in this postulate uh which would be either scalar or uh Progressive the universe is composed entirely of one component scaler motion or entirely one of one component Progressive motion because he just calls it motion and he&#x27;s um but what the kind of motion that Larson is envisioning and that he&#x27;s using in his theory is not the same kind of motion that your average person might think about when they&#x27;re thinking about motion uh he&#x27;s actually referring to a pretty obscure kind of motion um it doesn&#x27;t deserve to be obscure but it really is which is what uh he calls scalar motion or what other people have called scalar motion a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction you can um Envision a a scalar motion using a balloon with uh dots on it if you up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not really moving in any specific Direction they&#x27;re just all moving away from each other in fact you don&#x27;t even have to have the dots on it all the locations even in between the dots are also moving away from each other everything on the surface of that balloon is moving away from everything else this is a scalar motion it has no specific Direction really it has all directions and it&#x27;s a scale scaler because it&#x27;s based on the scale the farther away that the dots are the faster they are moving away from each other the closer they are the closer they&#x27;re moving toward uh away from each other now if you sucked in the balloon then they would all be moving toward each other but you do not get any direction out of that motion until you arbitrarily decide that one of those dots is motionless and you assign that as the reference point you can say oh well this one&#x27;s not moving now once you do that then you can start determining the direction of each one of the other ones now another thing about this scalar motion is that uh you know it can be modeled with a balloon but it also has been observed in nature uh in particular um looking through their telescopes the Legacy scientists have discovered that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and and uh since they are not willing to go back on cernus and say that you know our galaxy is at the center of the universe uh they would also have to be uh saying that our galaxy is also participating in this motion so all of the galaxies are moving away from each other that is a scalar motion so that is something that was OB is observed but for whatever reason the scientists have not really embraced um scalar motion as a Bonafide kind of motion it&#x27;s just kind of an anomaly for them but this is what Larsson is building his whole system on is scalar motion he calls this clock time and clock space the clock space is just what we&#x27;re saying like this surface of a balloon and all the dots moving away from each other uh Lar um refers to this as clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and uh his clock time is just like the clock the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but in no specific Direction it&#x27;s always just a forward progression and uh so he calls that clock time and clock space now we&#x27;re we&#x27;re much more accustomed to the idea of clock time than we are of clock space but with that balloon analogy you might be able to become a little bit more familiar with the clock space aspect and then there&#x27;s the discrete unit aspect each U both time space and also motion are quantized meaning that they come only in discrete units you have to have a a full unit of space or time or motion before you have any of it and uh if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time remembering that space over time is speed one unit of space over one unit of time is the speed of light and uh Larson refers to the speed of light as unit speed 1 over 1 equal 1 and this this is the one of the reciprocal uh when you multiply um two reciprocals with each other they equal one so this one speed of light is the background motion of our universe is always existing omnipresent and it is always and everywhere existing and it is um the zero point or the reference point lson calls it the progression of the natural reference system the null point or neutral point the um state of rest of a universe of motion is to already be in motion and um that also creates half of a universe that is moving faster than the speed of light and half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light Larsson refers to these as the cosmic sector and the material sector respectively and the cosmic and the material sector are identical to each other on a general level except that they are reciprocals of one another so in the material sector you have coordinate time I&#x27;m sorry coordinate space and clock time in the cosmic sector once you cross that speed of light boundary then you have coordinate time and you have clock space so you have to invert whenever you cross this unit speed boundary okay th that&#x27;s the basics of larsson&#x27;s first postulate the second postulate is just that the universe&#x27;s um Universe uh conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian now Dr Bruce pet uh pushes back on a lot of that second postulate including the idea of um idian geometry being most fundamental he says that it is projective geometry of which ukian geometry is just a subset he also gets rid of the idea of commutative mathematics uh as opposed to just ordinary mathematics and also gets rid of the idea of primary magnitudes uh we will talk about that later we&#x27;ve talked about it before as well now getting into Pet&#x27;s paper here it&#x27;s called The lorence Factor lorence uh the lorence factor is the factor that um time slows down in the relativistic equations as something starts to accelerate toward the speed of light and uh ultimately at the speed of light time is supposed to be stopping um and and he uh this is the third installment of this paper so if you uh want to hear this from the start you want to go back a couple videos but we&#x27;re going to just read it from here now that he has this um plus or minus y line to rotate lson adds an inward scalar rotation to the photon moving the net motion to the minus1 comma 0 coordinate with a single speed solution creating the rotational base whose net motion opposes the progression at the same velocity the speed of light running backwards that we call gravity a very familiar concept um that is also uh gravity would be the inward motion of that expanding balloon all of the dots are moving toward each other all of the locations are moving toward each other but if you decide to make one of them a reference point then you can start uh looking at you know what are called gravitational fields between the different uh other points and your reference point so it shows how the field is not a real thing it is only the product of a reference system essentially the lorence factor is just a fudge or cludge um hiding the use of imaginary quantities to describe a gravitational field structure imaginary quantities of be being i j and k uh your uh imaginary operators that you may have learned in Algebra 2 class or whatever it was back in high school uh they&#x27;re all the square root of1 in a fashion similar to the imaginary quantities used to describe electric and magnetic fields this gravitational opposition to the progression is what gives the appearance of increasing Mass even though Mass remains constant since a heavier object so-called heavier object must have more gravitational pull and be harder to move now this section is called the rs2 approach the lorence factor is a one-dimensional solution to a two-dimensional problem as is Larson&#x27;s definition of the rotational base however the universe is three-dimensional and as William Ron H Hamilton discovered it takes four dimensions to solve a three-dimensional rotation uh and that is why he came up with the querian a four-dimensional thing to solve a three-dimensional rotation the rs2 solution was to upgrade the complex plane of the corrected Loren factor and replace it with a querian this however changes Larson&#x27;s two unit approach of speed and energy into a 4unit system of plus one J JK and um I J K all multiplied together um equals minus1 this resulted in a far more accurate representation of the photon changing it from a linear vibration to aeran rotation with similar characteristics but including electromagnet IC properties with a one-dimensional electric rotation K combined with a twodimensional magnetic rotation I and J since I J equals k i * J equals k a by rotation can be formed along electromagnetic lines using i j negative K providing similar Behavior to Professor kvk n&#x27;s original by rotation model this will be elaborated on in a future paper but just wanted to note the RS and rs2 difference okay summary the lorence factor is the equation of a right triangle where speed is normalized for a unit speed of light ignoring the negative roots and velocities of the equation conceals the fact that the lorence factor is actually just a unit circle unit speed is the maximum speed the physical universe is capable of expressed in the reciprocal system as the outward progression of the natural reference system the minimum speed is negative Unity the inward motion expressed by gravitation the default speed of the universe is Unity when a conventional object at rest is accelerated what is actually happening is that the inward motion of gravity is being neutralized a rocket isn&#x27;t increasing its speed by thrust the thrust is reducing the effect gravitation is having upon it allowing it to return to the default speed of unity that is the speed of light in all directions outward it is impossible to accelerate an object past the speed of light in space because you are not adding velocity you are reducing resistance and once that resistance is gone you are done this is the situation in particle accelerators and why electromagnetic systems cannot accelerate a particle pass the speed of light all they can do is reduce the resistance preventing the particle from moving moving at the speed of light the circular form of the lorence factor produces similar results to larsson&#x27;s construction of the rotational base when the one dimensional interpretation is upgraded to three dimensions the linear vibration of the photon becomes a querian rotation possessing Electro magnetic characteristics such as um te TM and temem modes um can&#x27;t remember what those are electromagnetism um electric uh magnetic and electromagnetic what the Loren Factor comes down to is a device that is used to try to understand the inward backward speed of light motion of gravitation similar to tm&#x27;s epicycle description of the reversal of planetary motion but when placed in the proper context one can see past the illusion of mathematics and understand the underlying Concepts all right that is the end of that paper and uh my understanding of it is a little bit shaky I must admit but I will uh mull it over and see if I can get it to make sense to me um definitely could would consider it to be anti-scientific to just reject it out of hand and uh to recognize that my understanding of the reciprocal system is not um Po and so I may not understand all parts of it all at once and uh that it&#x27;s a work in progress and um you know not to accept it um you know without any evidence but just to not reject it without any evidence because normally people are going to be able to reject it by comparing it with what they already know not recognizing that that is circular reasoning so just uh let it in your head and be okay with being confused and maybe in a little while things will you you&#x27;ll get uh some more clarity about it all right well thanks for tuning in today we&#x27;ll be back tomorrow with a new paper um by Dr pet this is uh rs2 109 his final paper in the series of rs2 papers and it is called dimensional thinking so stay tuned for that tomorrow and other than that have a great day</p>
