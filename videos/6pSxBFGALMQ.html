            <p>In this clip, Gary Nolan gives his take on the Nazca alien mummies found in Peru. Check it out. &gt;&gt; I do know that you&#x27;ve paid attention to the tridactyl mummies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is your take on that? &gt;&gt; Um, so, you know, I think people have conflated a lot of the different um mummies that are out there, first of all.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s like &gt;&gt; Yeah, good point. &gt;&gt; 60 of them or something. &gt;&gt; And probably a fair number of them, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call them hoaxes. I would say that they are constructed, but they&#x27;re old constructs. So maybe they&#x27;re some sort of homage paid &gt;&gt; to the ancestors or something like that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; These are the constructed ones Gary is talking about. They do look fake as hell. &gt;&gt; Whatever they are. So the the there are some ones that you clearly look at, you go, &quot;Oh, come on.&quot; Right? &gt;&gt; That never lived. You know, that&#x27;s &gt;&gt; Then there&#x27;s the fetal position.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Then there&#x27;s the fetal position ones, the big ones. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Here are the ones that are more intriguing that Gary is pointing to. &gt;&gt; And I was at the beginning. I was, you know, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m always open to being wrong.</p>
<p>I was at the beginning thinking, oh well, because of the small ones, those are probably not real. But then the MRIs started coming out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The full body MRIs and the the ligature and the bone construction and the finger and then perhaps most I think extraordinarily the the um the fingerprints. &gt;&gt; For more visuals, these are the fingerprints.</p>
<p>They do look pretty creepy if you ask me &gt;&gt; on on them being clearly not human. So, it&#x27;s interesting. But here&#x27;s the problem is that because there&#x27;s so much circus around them, unfortunately, created by people who want a circus because it sells their TV shows, uh, no scientist of any merit would go near it. So, I was approached many times, many times to study them. And I said, I&#x27;ll do it on one condition.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the money I need. not personally, but here&#x27;s the money I need to do the kinds of analysis uh to accomplish this. Right? Second, there will be no TV cameras, and you won&#x27;t hear from me again until I&#x27;m ready to talk because I&#x27;ll have double-ch checked and triple checked and quadruple checked the results, and then I&#x27;ve gone out, as I did with the Otakama Mummy, bringing in uh further contiguous circles of experts to double check me. &gt;&gt; Real quick, isn&#x27;t it refreshing to listen to Gary on this? Definitely a big change from the other conversations Joe is having on these alien mummies. Safe to say Gary actually is one of those elusive quote unquote experts that actually do exist.</p>
<p>You know, they&#x27;ve said they made I think the mistake of saying, &quot;Well, we&#x27;ve done the DNA and there&#x27;s a lot of DNA that doesn&#x27;t match. Anything and the stuff is several hundred years old.&quot; Anything that old, you won&#x27;t get a lot of good DNA out of it. But just they did the same thing with the with the Denisovven and the and the Neanderthal, you have to correct the chemical errors that occur over time, there are ways to what&#x27;s called biioiniratically correct. You need to do what&#x27;s called overreading of the genome where you do so many reads of it that you stack them all up line by line. Like you if you had a thousand versions of an ancient Bible, uh you would stack up the lines one by one and finally you find one line that has this letter that&#x27;s correct and then this one correct.</p>
<p>And then you basically do a summation of uh an averaging of the correctness. And so they say, oh well there&#x27;s, you know, 90% of the genome is nonhuman. It&#x27;s probably garbage. It&#x27;s probably these mistakes. It&#x27;s probably bacterial contamination that you&#x27;re reading.</p>
<p>ways to deal with that, but that requires money and not oneoff DNA sequences put on the on the interwebs for some amateur genomicist to make a claim about, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, so there&#x27;s ways to do it. &gt;&gt; If you want to find these amateurs, just look to Reddit and X. It&#x27;s full of them. &gt;&gt; Long story short, I think there&#x27;s still something worth looking at there. &gt;&gt; Well, the scans are fascinating, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, the scans are the most interesting to me.</p>
<p>Have you seen the Jesse Michaels the newest video? &gt;&gt; Yeah, Jesse is a good friend. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s great. I love that guy. And the the the episode that he did is fantastic. And when you see the scans and they go over the bone structure of the thing and you look at it, you&#x27;re like, &quot;God, that looks real.&quot; &gt;&gt; If that&#x27;s a hoax from 1700 years ago or &gt;&gt; Exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly. &gt;&gt; Whoever if they if the carbon isotope dating that they did on it is accurate. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve looked at that data. It looks good. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>So then it is that old. you then because there&#x27;s no way someone back then could fake that. Also, one of them is pregnant. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s f Yeah, I know. &gt;&gt; Okay, so it&#x27;s a three-foot pregnant thing that doesn&#x27;t look remotely human being.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is the pregnant one Joe is referring to. Pretty fascinating, right? &gt;&gt; So, the jury is still out, &gt;&gt; right? But if they&#x27;re going to do it right, they need to sequester the stuff away, bring in the right people with sufficient resources, and get rid of the cameras. &gt;&gt; Have you talked to them? Have you encouraged this? Is this is it possible to nudge this in the right direction? And where&#x27;s it at right now? &gt;&gt; I I wrote out on Twitter a full thing of what they needed to do. &gt;&gt; Here is Gary&#x27;s tweet. Pause the video if you wanted to read it.</p>
<p>I mean the easiest first milestone to do to be honest that could be done within a couple of months uh is if it is somewhere in the homminid or let&#x27;s say vertebrate line there are metabolism genes that we all share in fact there are metabolism genes that we share with bacteria that are very similar so there&#x27;s you probably do you know the technique called polymerous chain reaction PCR &gt;&gt; the viewers probably don&#x27;t know so let me explain it real IC polymerase chain reaction is a molecular biology technique that amplifies specific DNA segments enabling genetic analysis, diagnostics and research by replicating DNA in vitro. So you know why try to do the whole genome? Why not just target a bunch of genes that we know evolve slowly but do evolve and PCR those out because that&#x27;s easier to do than is trying to assemble a whole genome &gt;&gt; and then by having just those let&#x27;s call it preliminary sets of evidence you could then say hm this actually reproducibly if I take a sample from the finger I take a sample from the bone marrow. I take a sample from here or there on the body. And I take a sample from different the three different main things and I see the same mutations and they&#x27;re different or somehow aligned with homminid evolution, right? We compare it to all the known homdids. I mean, that would be the kind of data that you could actually publish in a journal like Nature if you did it right.</p>
<p>M &gt;&gt; I think we should all start a GoFundMe to get Gary on this investigation. Who&#x27;s with me? If he actually was able to confirm these mummies as alien, could you imagine what it could mean? Comment below if you are down. &gt;&gt; Cuz that&#x27;s the only way that you&#x27;re going to get anybody to pay attention. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s also the bizarre anecdotal nature of some of the artwork. like the fact that these people did a lot of these tapestries and a lot of ancient artwork that&#x27;s a thousand years old that depicts these three fingered things.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s like what are they describe? Are they describing these actual creatures that was there only a few of them and it was a weird genetic mutation or is this &gt;&gt; a common visitor that they&#x27;re describing? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know either. I mean, why would you why would you put them in a cave in Peru? I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; And if you didn&#x27;t put them in a cave in Peru, what would be left? That&#x27;s the problem. &gt;&gt; The artifacts found are pretty strange.</p>
<p>They depict the exact image of what these supposed aliens might have looked like. Or it could just mean that they were really into aliens and decided to make merch and mummies based on them. I guess we&#x27;ll never know. I hope that behind the scenes there are people who are taking a more methodical approach to this who I think should remain stealththed until they have the data to the point where is publishable. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You want papers frankly when you publish them to be almost boring &gt;&gt; and so thick with detail that no pseudoskeepic would dare approach it because there&#x27;s just they&#x27;re just not smart enough. If you but if you put out these snippets that don&#x27;t have sufficient background, they can be picked apart by anybody, &gt;&gt; right? But that&#x27;s why peer review is so important. And people mistake peer review as trying to get the reviewers to agree with your conclusions. No, the main purpose of peer review is actually to make sure that the methods that you used are sufficiently detailed and are correct enough to the extent you came to any conclusions, they match the methods that you used. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for watching.</p>
