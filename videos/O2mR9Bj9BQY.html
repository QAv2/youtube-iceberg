            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>We got some breaking news in the Epstein files matter. Why is Julie K. Brown the intrepid reporter of all things Jeffrey Epste that broke the story that led to his prosecution in New York after it been swept under the rug by the Southern District of Florida? Why is she in the FBI investigative files in 2019? Why were they tracking her flights? Why did they post her flights in the Epstein files without redacting their name? Why are they monitoring a member of the free press, especially about Epstein? So, she puts pressure, let&#x27;s just go through the motions here for a minute, folks. She puts pressure on the Department of Justice and the executive branch, the FBI, to reopen the case after a series of scathing articles under the banner perversion of justice that ran in the Miami Herald in 2018. They reopen in 2019 and they&#x27;re watching her flights.</p>
<p>They want to know where she is at any given moment. If you like this update, check out and subscribe to the Legal AF YouTube channel and the Legal AF Substack.</p>
