            <p>all right how&#x27;s it going y&#x27;all and welcome to my channel this is a channel for educational purposes we try to look at um some of the uh theories of everything that have uh influenced my life and also uh you know so-called crackpots uh who spent their whole life working on their magnum opus and uh only to put out some kind of Masterpiece that gets completely ignored uh or never heard of in the first place or even ridiculed uh and uh I still think it&#x27;s a great thing so I&#x27;m trying to get it out there and um uh we look at all other kinds of all-encompassing theories but uh for last many many months we&#x27;ve been focused on dwey B Larson and his his reciprocal system of theory today is our 355th video on the reciprocal system and the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we do not live in a universe of matter and we don&#x27;t live in a universe of energy or force or anything else but we live in a universe of motion and uh motion for Larson um was the relationship between space and time now originally when he first uh pulled together his two fundamental postulates in the late 1950s he said that the Universe was made out of SpaceTime he eventually changed that to motion and motion is a relationship between space and time uh later in his life he actually said uh that by motion he was really meaning change in three dimensions and um I think some of that is related to uh you know our understanding of motion uh in lar the sense that Larson means he&#x27;s talking about what you call a scalar motion scalar motion is different than your basic you know velocity or other kinds of motion that has units attached to it a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction um and the general model that you use to to visualize this is using a balloon with dots on it as you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from one another uh but in no specific direction or really every direction all the dots are moving away from all the other dots and in fact even the spaces between the dots are moving away from each other so everything on that surface of the balloon is moving away from everything else um and in fact um you can extend that analogy or that visualization to another dimension by uh you know using something like raisin bread um where you uh when you cook the bread it rises all of the raisins even in the interior are moving away from each other as well so that&#x27;s uh what you think when you&#x27;re uh thinking of a scalar motion a motion with a magnitude but no Direction you can also use a clock Larson uses the term in fact clock clock time and clock space clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but it&#x27;s not getting later in any specific Direction um it&#x27;s just getting later and um in clock space the space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart uh but in no specific Direction so um that is kind of the first prong of larsson&#x27;s first postulate he had two fundamental postulates and he took these two postulates from the late 50s and then from that those two postulates he derived a theoretical Universe of what the universe would look like if these two postulates were uh in effect and uh determine then in his books that the postulates uh dictated a theoretical universe that looks quite a bit the same as the Newtonian Universe um that all of the scientists of pretty much assumed was uh was true except for in these relativistic situations of the very fast the very small and the very large that had to be kind of uh revised by Einstein and his generation in the early 20th century um and they came up with all kinds of things to um kind of repair the Newtonian Universe for these extreme situations and uh Larson came up with pretty much the same finding that the neonian Universe uh is what his postulates uh dictated except in the relativistic areas the very small the very large and the very fast and in those cas es he had different um Concepts and in some cases different mathematics than what the you know einsteinian and the quantum mechanists and those people had come up with uh you know a generation or two before Larson came around um and uh I find that Larson uh definitely eclipses the uh accomplishments of uh those people because his Solutions um work they uh he&#x27;s able to predict results he&#x27;s a uh able to predict new phenomena such as quazars that had not been discovered before he predicted their existence and their existence in great detail and uh he by but more most specifically larsson&#x27;s Concepts uh make sense uh it&#x27;s not like Heisenberg or Einstein that they&#x27;re just coming up with stuff and they&#x27;re even saying oh well this really has no meaning in reality it&#x27;s just a mathematical you know model uh this you know electron or whatever you don&#x27;t think of this as being literally something that&#x27;s actually happening this is just you know this is just something that we&#x27;re using for convenience to make calculations well larsson&#x27;s not doing that he&#x27;s giving you the concepts he&#x27;s telling you why these things happen they are consistent with his theory so that&#x27;s one of the main reasons that I like uh the reciprocal system now it&#x27;s not perfect and Larson uh was fallible made some mistakes and I think that a lot of those mistakes have been corrected uh by a few of his revisers uh that came to the four uh in the later years of larsson&#x27;s life and after his death in 1990 but uh going back to his uh his fundamental postulates the first prong as we were saying was the clock time and the clock space then there is also what he calls coordinate space and coordinate time time this is the three-dimensionality um coordinate XYZ coordinates um we generally think of space in that way of XY and Z coordinates volume and uh time also uh under the proper circumstances has a three-dimensionality um and uh that is what Larson calls coordinate time and uh um uh forgetting what I was just going to say about that um but the three-dimensionality of uh the reciprocal system is uh something that is rejected Again by um by uh Legacy science in in terms of the uh time aspect time is normally seen as being just a one-dimensional phenomena um by uh your average uh Legacy scientist then the third prong is what Larson calls the discrete unit postulate space and time both come only in discrete units you have to have a full unit of space and a full unit of time before you have anything um if you don&#x27;t have a full unit you&#x27;ve got nothing so those units are extremely small the unit of space is 4.56 * 10us 8 m approximately 500,000 of an inch and then um the unit of time is uh the incredibly small 1.52 * 10- 16 seconds uh that is uh you know over six quadrant trillion of them per second that&#x27;s 6 trillion billion of them per second and um you know so you&#x27;re you&#x27;re kind of thinking these are quanti these are these [Music] are um separate frames so the unit so so you know the universe is more like a cartooniverse where you know it looks like we have some kind of continuity some kind of continuous motion but really we have one frame after another after another after another after another that are very similar to each other but they are uh separate discreet and they&#x27;re flashing before us so fast that we can&#x27;t um I mean we can we canot even determine uh you know the lack of continuity of a cartoon at going at whatever 20 or 30 per second um this is uh you know trillions or even quadrillions uh almost a quadrillion times faster than that or a third of a quadrillion times faster than that that so um you know of course we wouldn&#x27;t be able to detect that but anyway if we have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time then we have uh the speed of light the speed of light is one unit of space and one unit of time uh speed is uh is space over time all speed um all of all of our units in scientific units can be expressed exclusively in terms of time and space they&#x27;re all relationships fractions in general of space over time or time over space and again uh we have this coordinate of space and time so both of those uh time or space components can have multiple Dimensions so you&#x27;ve got your speed space over time the car is moving 10 miles per hour 10 miles of space and one hour of time energy time over space it took me 3 hours to push that thing a half a mile that&#x27;s 3 hours of time in one hour of space time over space then you also have acceleration I dropped the ball out the window and it fell at 32 ft per second per second 32 ft of space in one second squared and so on and so forth and so speed in this configuration is one unit of space in one unit of time that is the speed of light that&#x27;s what Larson calls unit speed 1 over 1 equal 1 and that unit speed is really the background of this universe of motion this is the omnipresent always existing what Larson calls progression of the natural reference system now we generally only perceive that progression of the natural reference system in terms of time we perceive the flow of time always getting later and later and later but the flow of space always getting farther and farther and farther apart is generally nullified by the fact that we are situated within a uh so-called gravitational field and so uh Gravity nullifies the spatial progression from our vantage point so uh we&#x27;re seeing because we we per we reside in what lson calls the material sector and the material sector is the slower than the speed of light sector the speed of light is the boundary whereas Einstein says that the speed of light is the speed limit of the universe Larson says that the speed of light is the boundary of the universe and that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light the cosmic sector and half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light the material sector we reside within the material sector so we&#x27;re not seeing the Universe um you know from a kind of impartial Viewpoint we are seeing it from one side of the uh equation and that&#x27;s why we see uh time in its uh scalar aspect but we see space in its coordinate aspect if we were in The Cosmic sector we would see space in its scalar aspect and we would see the progression of space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but we would see time in its coordinate aspect three dimensions of time um and we would uh have great difficulty moving through time in the same way that we have you know resistance and difficulty moving through space okay um so uh from there um you know Larson wrote his books and wrote books on physics astrophysics chemistry astronomy metaphysics uh economics and uh some other topics with articles and and interviews and talks that he gave um and then passed away in 1990 uh since then uh Dr Bruce pet has come to the four along with Dr kbk Neu uh and have proposed this thing called rs2 SEC second uh re-evaluation of the reciprocal system or reciprocal system 2 and uh today we&#x27;re looking at an article that was written by Dr pet uh that&#x27;s called rs2 d 106 uh which is called dimensions and displacements now we&#x27;re at the tail end of this article so if you wanted to um hear the article from the start you want to go back three episodes this is the fourth episode on um this particular article and uh we should finish it here today um now he&#x27;s uh talked about the dimensional situ ation and um you know the difference between scalar motion and um vectorial motion and also the difference between spatial dimensions and scalar Dimensions now there are it it requires three dimensions of space to describe one dimension of scalar motion we in general are only able to uh experience one dimension of scalar motion but there are three of them so we are very much limited in our um our view again of the entire universe we can only see one dimension of scalar motion at one at a time and then he started talking about displacement ments uh and displacements are again uh where Legacy science is saying where they they&#x27;re measuring their speeds from zero from their state of rest so if something is is moving it&#x27;s moving um faster or slower than zero um in the reciprocal system the reference point the 0 point the state of rest is the speed of light outward in all dimension in all directions and so therefore uh the measurements are made from that speed of light datum and uh that is what L what lson and also pret are calling displacements uh you can either be displaced upward or downward from that uh unit datm okay let&#x27;s uh let&#x27;s finish this up here uh the section is called Atomic rotation because we are dealing with a three-dimensional Universe of motion Larson&#x27;s notation for displacements includes three components a principal magnetic rotation a subordinate magnetic rotation and an electric rotation so this is how Larson is notating his uh Atomic his basically his periodic table his periodic table requires three different numbers uh to describe um each element motion for particles and atoms or notation for particles and atoms use three displacements to represent displacement in the three scalar dimensions in the a b c format for example oxygen is 2 2 -2 which means that the two temporal rotations have a displacement in time of two units coupled with a spatial rotation in the third scalar dimension of two units so when we have a positive displacement the displacement is in time and when we have a negative displacement the displacement is in space if the displacement is in space that means it&#x27;s faster than the speed of light if it&#x27;s in time it means it&#x27;s slower than the speed of light so everything in the material sector is going to be uh primarily a displacement in Sp in time moving slower than the speed of light but there can be a component of that atom that has a um displacement in space such as oxygen 2 to -2 now if an atom is one of the noble gases then that third number is going to be zero um so the the third number is zero in all cases when you are talking about uh the noble gases um helium neon uh argon Krypton Xenon radon okay now um displacements can also represent either material sector 3D space or Cosmic sector 3D time structures which Larson rotates with an M uh Larson notates with an M or C prefix as well as exchanging numbers in parentheses by by those without for example m 2-2-1 is material Florine atomic number nine c to uh -2- -2- one is Cosmic Florine also atomic number nine so if if the uh atom is a cosmic atom which is what Legacy scientists call um uh antimatter than uh you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh negative displacements or displacements in space faster than the speed of light this seems to be unnecessary as the parentheses on the two magnetic rotations clearly indicate uh to which sector the three-dimensional structure belongs lson Larson uses the M or C designation with a superscript uh Aster to IND indicate a a Charged condition that cannot be represented in the displacement notation so the notation does get used one final note on Atomic displacements for a particle the ab C notation represents Motion in three scalar Dimensions minus the displacement of the rotational base lson refers to this rotational base as a double rotating system or Larson refers to this as a double rotating system that Professor kbk n later identified as a solid rotation such as the rotation of a ball rather than the rotation of a disc particles have single double rotating system uh part like uh you know electrons positrons protons and so on particles have single double rotating systems whereas atoms have double rotating systems the displacements listed for an atom are the same for each of these double rotating systems within the atomic structure okay that was H kind of a mouthful and a lot there a lot to uh kind of cont contemplate again I would just recommend that is the end of the article I would just recommend that you kind of let it wash over you don&#x27;t reject anything out of hand just uh hold it in your mind for later consideration um I would recommend that you try to get a holistic view of larsson&#x27;s entire picture before passing any judgment on it um because uh taken separately each kind of WR of Larson&#x27;s uh findings might all seem kind of ridiculous but then when you fit it together all at once then it does form a holistic picture and so um he is uh pretty consistent uh with how he does things and uh it&#x27;s very hard to notice that unless you really study all of his stuff so I would just recommend that you hold it in your mind um for safekeeping until you&#x27;ve been able to be exposed to the whole picture which you can be on this channel if you watch all these different videos as far as I know this is the only channel that is doing um any type of in-depth work on Mr larsson&#x27;s uh reciprocal system so uh come to me for your uh and I don&#x27;t profess to be an expert on this in any matter um I&#x27;m I get very confused about this stuff at times as well even though I&#x27;ve been studying it for many years it&#x27;s not an easy study um but it is is doable and it is a beautiful system I think when you finally do uh kind of see the whole picture okay and now tomorrow we will come back and look at rs217 which is called Mass and gravity and um so stay tuned for that come back tomorrow thanks for tuning in today and have a great night</p>
