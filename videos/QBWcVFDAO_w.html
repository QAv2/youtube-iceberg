            <p>we are live this is the alien scientist channel i want to do a recap of yesterday&#x27;s apec conference that&#x27;s the alternative propulsion engineering conference yesterday we had tom vallone glenn robertson and mike gamble on and then quite a long after chat after mike gamble left for mike gamble left around five after five hours at the five hour mark and then we went on for another almost uh hour and a half in private discussion afterwards um and then we probably went on until like two in the morning i don&#x27;t know i left around midnight but these guys go these guys go late with uh the discussions in the after chats um on these things as well but i just want to do a recap real quick to uh do some highlights i put these time stamps on the video where people can go to this video it&#x27;s the first link in the description under this video and um click on that link and it will bring you to this video you can check out my comment with the time stamps it talks about this jl naught and uh jl not in labs did a ton of uh replications and and has a ton of data and information which was later replicated by nasa and other other labs um really cool work uh really cool history there electro kinetics was this thing that was mentioned i&#x27;ve never heard of before but it&#x27;s an interesting and different approach to the theory of electromagnetic and gravitational fields via the idea of electro electrical movements and stuff um and and a possible explanation for what&#x27;s going on in apparatus like the the bifelt brown experiment and uh asymmetric capacitor experiments and some of these other experiments that people have built working lifters out of and we show and demonstrate a couple videos of those and talk about them including tim ventura&#x27;s work who&#x27;s the host of the apec conference we also um he mentions and gives a shout out to mark mccandless who passed away recently and the legend of the arv and electro pulsed hovercraft that was built by the military and tested an experimental x-craft that still should be declassified and needs to be ron it&#x27;ll declassified the day um then we got into the second part with uh glenn robertson or also tony robertson he calls himself tony robertson and uh makes my my friend makes the joke that every time i say tony roberts and he thinks of tony robbins but not the same guy um sorry for that reference but uh whit brantley uh is the head of uh the nasa advance he was the head uh he passed away a couple years back i think 2014 or something 2011 maybe um but he was the head of the nasa advanced propulsion research labs at huntsville and tony worked there with ning li and all these other guys and uh there were some interesting things said about that because it got brought up at the end of the conference and i know she&#x27;s a popular topic within the ufo community and the i guess the media as well focused on her story and her and specifically for whatever reason but um it was uh it was curious that uh she was she she did have a theory and she was part of that group and there was a lot of rumors that she went to china which we&#x27;ll get into in a second um but first i want to mention that wow you got to watch tony&#x27;s the whole presentation uh glenn robertson&#x27;s uh presentation here this was phenomenal stuff and a whole introduced me to a whole bunch of new papers on ideas that i&#x27;d already thought of and and knew about and this is so relevant to ken&#x27;s paper on phoenix theory and his whole idea of how to generate these um these states and and how to generate the mathematics because it goes a little bit his ken&#x27;s theory goes a little bit beyond this and i&#x27;ll explain that in a second when we get to this uh this part in the mini universe model that he shows and proposes and ken&#x27;s theory you take the odd and the even terms out and when you separate them you get you get the different you get the different aspects of relativity and um and quantum mechanics and unified in one theory which is crazy this is to think about the uh this is the way i envisioned it is this whole idea of our whole interpretation of photons and trying to understand what photons are it&#x27;s just this exchange of energy that permeates the whole vacuum that tells everything where everything else is and it&#x27;s all based around these information structures which are points where information gets trapped around this essentially a topological a topological domain and it&#x27;s all about connectivity and connectedness the quantum vacuum and how things relate in these vibrational in this vibrational spheres but um it&#x27;s interesting he proposes this whole gravitational model which i i it&#x27;s it&#x27;s fascinating i&#x27;m not going to get into it too much because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s too complex and technical to do in a brief discussion but definitely get into that and check out his mini universe model then we had mike gamble back on from boeing aerospace um always a pleasure to have mike on he&#x27;s he&#x27;s a wealth of knowledge and you know could probably present a couple more times for hours on different things and uh and teach us stuff but uh i have so many more questions about all this this stuff we talked about a little bit in the in the aftermath um in the q a section and and in the in the end of this conference um but the ideas of spinning matter close to the speed of light well the idea is that matters trapped light that&#x27;s light traveling at the speed of light but when you trap it in this sort of informational um topological structure like a it&#x27;s almost akin to a black hole in a lot of ways and and there&#x27;s a lot of interesting overlaps in the theories that are talked about and uh discussed in this aftermath but let&#x27;s get into the the key stuff and what everyone&#x27;s been waiting for that she got she got yanked back to china to work for them for in secret i think i i don&#x27;t remember i don&#x27;t remember who told me this but if i remember right the story to me that seemed the most possible wasn&#x27;t she sick i think we should listen to tony because he knows her yeah yeah good call on this mark by the way well tony&#x27;s yeah he&#x27;s important right here he&#x27;s waiting to talk go ahead tony um i talked to a kid about two maybe three years ago at a conference here in huntsville and he said he had talked to namely about a year or two before that so we&#x27;re talking now five years at least ago that she was still here in huntsville uh living somewhere here in huntsville uh but since she lives in huntsville area i would think if somebody searched obituaries or huntsville if she died they&#x27;d find her uh her son lives in the united states and is kind of i think is kind of a property guy so yeah he owns property in huntsville and uh somewhere else in the united states so i don&#x27;t think she would have went back to china unless she was forced i i do know she went back when she had her uh her cancer episode to get some chinese medicine but she came back from that i i talked to her after that but she&#x27;s quite a bit older than me so um she&#x27;s getting up in age they&#x27;re at least 10 years older than i am well maybe she just didn&#x27;t like that maybe she got tired of the publicity you know she was in the media a lot right maybe she just got tired of it i have no idea i know she got the took a project with the army after we did the super conducting one to continue some superconducting work and we heard she was messing with some chemicals that she should have been wearing uh you know like a full garment to protect her and she was handling it with her hands and got poisoned from that and i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve i&#x27;ve talked to her since then but this kid like i said at least five years ago she was still here in huntsville [Music] so there you have it at least five years ago she was still there in huntsville alabama um maybe we&#x27;ll uh try and get a hold of us you know someone can get a hold of her and uh get her get an interview with her get an email for her contact information or appoint that would be great to get her on to you know to share her perspective and i hope that she&#x27;s doing okay and that she&#x27;s all right with that uh unfortunate news of her getting poisoned while working for the army um definitely some stuff to look into here uh you know it kind of defeats the rumor that she had gone to china and was working for the chinese government on anti-gravity and um also i had heard that she had been working for applied science or applied materials in some capacity but i&#x27;m not sure um that was just uh some some information that got passed on to me but anyways there you have it um we also had an aftermath uh in the aftermath of this discussion we got uh some really interesting people on who i&#x27;m gonna have back on to have more discussions with us including one guy that was talking about his experiments having something to do with the moon and that thomas townsend brown had reported that the moon the moon yes the moon uh had um had something to do with the experiments that they worked more when there was a moon overhead and at the cycles of the moon the microgravity um would affect whatever because warfields if they&#x27;re caused by gravity you know this this maybe you know there&#x27;s might be something to it there might be something there i don&#x27;t i thought it was cool and maybe significant if it&#x27;s in the lab notes and other people um should be aware of it and and something worth mentioning that you know like hey let&#x27;s let&#x27;s if we&#x27;re doing warp drive experiments and stuff like this let&#x27;s pay attention to moon position and cycles and and the date of the experiment and all that kind of stuff because it&#x27;s super important for later experimenters to go back on your data to know when you what day you took the experiment and what time and everything so anyways make sure um you&#x27;re taking good data and uh we&#x27;ll have we&#x27;ll investigate all these weird anomalies and mysteries more on the alien scientists channel thanks for watching and i don&#x27;t know where my camera went but have a nice day</p>
