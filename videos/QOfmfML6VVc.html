            <p>he says this there is some kind of capacity to draw Incredible amounts of energy from I&#x27;ve seen it the quantum vacum I&#x27;ve seen it you&#x27;ve seen it I&#x27;ve seen it there&#x27;s also obviously the capacity to use propulsion systems that so okay okay okay why why is the followup like hey when in what context did you see the devices that are pulling energy from the vacuum is it okay let I&#x27;ll let Ross finish because I want a rant but go ahead but far beyond what we&#x27;re describing yeah that seems to be the case as well anti-gravity anti-gravity they know about it anti-gravity Zero Point Energy appications of what you&#x27;re saying also are that potentially okay okay um so guys let me help you out so my people in that in the audience right now who are blue pilled as hell my blue pilled boys and girls out there Ross kohart is deep State Ross right off the bat I can already tell they&#x27;ve already had many pre-existing conversations and that most of this interview is basically scripted out like step one we&#x27;re going to ask you this step two we&#x27;re GNA ask you this step three we&#x27;re gonna ask you this at least if you are going to have a scripted interview make it sound natural like if somebody tells you hey I&#x27;ve seen a fre free energy device that&#x27;s pulling energy out of the quantum vacuum first of all you shouldn&#x27;t lead them you don&#x27;t need to lead them to that just let them say it themselves and then you should ask them a follow-up question like okay whose device did you see when did you see it where did you see it the fact that that&#x27;s not the follow-up question right here is super weird and then Ross kohart does his own like adds his own commentary here to the second half so</p>
