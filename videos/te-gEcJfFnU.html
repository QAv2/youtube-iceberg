            <p>hello it could change everything dr. Ning Li said this in response to the Discover Magazine interviewer about her prototype AC gravity machine back in May 1999 20 years ago so what has happened to dr. Ning Li and her research on artificially making gravity since then this is the taming gravity follow-up to my taming gravity review post in the original Discover Magazine article zero gravity anti-gravity devices and the Popular Mechanics article taming gravity regarding the work of dr. namely as a well-established and highly respected physicists leading the way towards gravity manipulation dr. Ning Lee has consisting indulged seemingly unscientific ideas about gravity however her work in her place amongst her peers is well-founded in an article published by Discover Magazine dr.</p>
<p>Ning Lee discussed her work as well as added personal commentary about what she hopes her research could bring foreign the Popular Mechanics article on taming gravity provides a basic description of what and how dr. Lee is hoping to utilize the wonders of the bose-einstein condensate to create what she is referring to as a sea gravity dr. Ning Lee is extremely passionate about her work she is also equally aware of the consequences her work could have on modern science and technology after all she is trying to figure how to manipulate gravity while discussing her research with Discover Magazine she made note of the repercussions of such a discovery by saying it could change everything current industry will vanish from the face of the earth the far-reaching effects of an anti-gravity device would forever change the course of human history from travel to modern man&#x27;s oil-based energy supply everything we know would be completely upended the power of anti-gravity far exceeds that of any other energy currently known to man using it in a practical setting would obviously transform the way Humanity lives although the Discover Magazine article was published in May 1999 dr. Lee had stated she believed she could create an antigravity device within just 10 years more than 19 years have passed since then and we have yet to see any anti-gravity technology in the mainstream even so the prospect of her work coming to fruition enough to keep science and tech geeks up at night interestingly dr. Ning Lee isn&#x27;t the only scientist pursuing anti-gravity technology researchers such as the late Hideo hayasaka and Saki Taguchi of Tohoku University have also studied gravity modulation in fact it was this duo who first witnessed anti-gravity propulsion while studying high-speed gyroscopes with metal fly wheels during takeoff the gyroscopes would seemingly hover in place for a split second which had the researchers questioning why it was happening this ultimately caused the scientists to change their field of research to anti-gravity manipulation another prominent scientist working in the field of gravity modulation as Eugene Putnam as a grad student at tombery University in Finland pod klett knob discovered that objects place above spinning ceramic discs lost nearly 2% of their weight this discovery has a direct relationship to gravity modulation research and lent credence to similar exploration being conducted in the same field James Woodward of California State University as yet another researcher working on gravity modulation his work primarily consists of the effect of inertia on gravity and how the cosmological constant can in effect push objects in a certain direction nieto with Athena was also studying how antimatter relates to gravity and whether or not it can float instead of sinking into gravity despite countless man-hours in the laboratory the best evidence of anti-gravity and its effects have been discovered through the telescope astronomers and scientists studying supernovas have revealed that the universe&#x27;s expansion is in fact speeding up instead of slowing down as once previously believed the effect of inertia it would seem is powering the universe&#x27;s expansion since the universe&#x27;s expansion is speeding up researchers believe that this signifies a cosmological constant or a hidden energy behind-the-scenes propelling the universe and everything in it forward this powerful energy called dark energy is hypothesized to counteract the effect of gravity and if mastered it could create serious technological advancements stranger still according to the discoverer article are the speculations of Hal putt Hoff of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Austin Texas he believes that the energy that powers the cosmological constant is also powering inertia in other words anti-gravity research done on earth is linked back to this strange phenomena of dark energy and is the reason why anti-gravity can be achieved no matter where you are in the universe since her experiments and subsequent results attracted the attention of the DoD dr.</p>
<p>Ning Li hasn&#x27;t made any public statements about her work or her disc-shaped artificial gravity manipulation machine in fact since receiving the $500,000 grant money from the DoD back in 2001 dr. Ning Li hasn&#x27;t been seen or heard from since 2003 she basically has disappeared it is rumoured by dr. Cerf at ease contact in Washington DC that dr. Ning Li went back to China however in the discover article she did make one very prominent statement regarding her research current industry will vanish from the face of the earth she said obviously this ex NASA funded researcher had reason enough to believe her work could lead to an all-out industrial revolution dr. Ning Li has obviously made significant strides in taming gravity otherwise why would she have gotten the attention of the DoD Department of Defense even to the point of receiving a $500,000 grant from them it would be inspiring to hear from her again about her research however it seems that she has disappeared into the black budget projects of either the US and/or China of course this also means that the possibility for her in her research being our world&#x27;s first official breakthrough and the possibility of taming gravity have disappeared with her regardless and until the US government feels black budget projects are not needed anymore we still have dr.</p>
<p>Lee&#x27;s original research to inspire us and speculate on if not paved the way towards our officially understanding gravity and how we can manipulate it to our advantage anyhow this may mean that we as the rest of the non black budget world have the challenge to transform ourselves into a society where the military-industrial complex emphasizing industrial control over the economy and therefore the military feel they are not only ready economically to reveal such technologies but also they accept us as evolved enough not to turn such technologies into Armageddon basically we need to evolve enough not to need the military-industrial complex as unimaginable as that may be then these technologies such as is in the promise of dr. Ning Lee&#x27;s research should become in place with all of its far-reaching and far-out implications taming gravity here we come did you read the original discover and/or Popular Mechanics articles on dr. Ning Lee and her AC gravity what do you think may have happened to dr. Ning Lee since receiving the $500,000 grant from the u.s. DoD please let me know what you think in the comment area below I am really interested to hear what you have to say so please leave your comments below if you like this video please give it a thumbs up also don&#x27;t forget to hit the subscribe button and please make sure to share with your friends thanks for watching</p>
