            <p>hi gentlemen welcome back today we continue with searching for free energy and this time we again speaking about Zero Point Energy the same energy we have I have been describing in the Thomas Henry morid radiant energy collector basically this big antenna which is able to to pick up the cosmic waves which should be also part of the this 0 point energy yeah and if and this device does the very similar thing and this is called the Thomas Traver Pyramid Power yeah basically this small pyramid is I think 1 by one m 1 by one meter and in the middle there is this Machinery or this passive components which basically pick up this Zero Point Energy so this outside this is the copper pipes yeah inside of this pipes yeah there is two graphite rods and some kind of quartz sand fill it so so this this this portion of the pipe now selected it&#x27;s filled with quartz sand and there is a salt water on the bottom yeah and then we would just have two plus and minus and I will now describe how it&#x27;s How we are able to access this energy Yeah so basically that&#x27;s it yeah it looks like a chemical reaction yeah and and that that is a hoax but in theory yeah this should pick up the Zero Point Energy and if I go now to the only image we have so basically so this is the setup of the middle machinery and it&#x27;s connected to this capacitor I this is in the middle if I go back in the middle this blue part is the 10 plate capacitor and um and this is the copper wire wounded connected to one and the other side of this capacitor and then the housing or this wire is connected to uh and and between between this capacitor we are able to get output of energy and and this bolts are connected to the steel frame of the pyramid and that&#x27;s basically it yeah so this small and simple system yeah I will put down in the description below the videos from Thomas Traver which where he explained I think in in in several hours how this works but basically that&#x27;s it so this small piece of Machinery with the condenser graphit uh quartz sand and graphit rods all connected to uh let&#x27;s say grounding via this Frame should be able to give us the free energy source forever yeah so that&#x27;s it because it it it gives the access to the Zero Point Energy the energy which we can found which we can find in vacuum space yeah and this is the technological problem currently in physics because the it defies the thermodynamics uh formulas yeah because the the in the vacuum there is a zero point energy which for which we are missing some cont constant and that&#x27;s it yeah so I cannot say much more about this it&#x27;s very simple device to reconstruct if you watch the Thomas Traver videos but basically this is it so thank you for watching until next video stay tuned on my channel bye-bye</p>
