            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Today will be an Adam bomb UFO disclosure news day. There are multiple news events that are slated to happen today and I want to cover them for you. Let&#x27;s call today Disclosure Wean. First up, we have the director of the upcoming, highly anticipated documentary, The Age of Disclosure, appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher. Friday, Bill Maher welcomes at age of disclosure director and producer Dan Farah.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see what some people on UFO Twitter are saying about the age of disclosure in general and his appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher today. Joe Meria wrote, &quot;This will help spread the word. Just the beginning. Where will it lead? I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Daniel Miller wrote, &quot;Regardless of what some with an axe to grind on here may say, &quot;Age of disclosure will move the needle on public awareness and engagement. Do not underestimate the power of moving the Overton window and progress being made.&quot; Next up, George Knapp announced we&#x27;re going to get a new Jim Latsky interview.</p>
<p>The last one was on October 17th, 2023 on him and Jeremy Corbell&#x27;s podcast, Weaponized. Here&#x27;s George Knapp announcing his interview with Dr. Jim Latsky that will air today. Dr. Jim Latsky managed the largest acknowledged UFO investigation ever funded by the US government.</p>
<p>He gave me his first interview in 2 years. Excerpts will air Friday, October 31st at 6 p.m. on KLS. Kas TV and will later be posted on 8 News Now&#x27;s website and on YouTube. A longer interview interview with Jim Latsky is coming next week.</p>
<p>And here is filmmaker James Fox responding. Can&#x27;t wait to hear see what he can say. I want to give you a brief review of how big a deal it is that we&#x27;re getting a new Dr. Jim Latsky interview today. And I&#x27;ll do that by sharing a tweet and a clip from Jeremy Corbel that he posted right when the first interview was published from October 20 2023.</p>
<p>Jeremy Corbel wrote, &quot;UFO Adam bomb was dropped on weaponized. Dr. James Lassky admitted on record and confirmed one, the US government has a UFO in its possession. Two, that we have an exploitation program to attempt to reverse engineer it. three, that we were able to get inside it, penetrating the hole.</p>
<p>This is direct and firsthand eyewitness testimony on record. This is exactly what Arrow is supposed to be doing instead of obuscating to the American public. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Now, let&#x27;s play that clip. Is you&#x27;re officially allowed to tell us that the United States government has in it possession a craft of unknown origin and you are able to access the inside.</p>
<p>Is that correct? The wording that you you read is correct. Ah, you&#x27;re going beyond the wording. &gt;&gt; No, I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m asking you, did that meeting happen? &gt;&gt; And is it true? &gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s true.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. You You&#x27;re You&#x27;re telling us. You told us because you were allowed to tell us that our government has a UFO in its possession and has been able to access the inside of it, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Merrick von Renenamp who regularly contributes opinion pieces to the Hill wrote the following on Twitter.</p>
<p>Momentum building. Never before has a US vice president and secretary of state stated openly they are fascinated by UAP. At the same time age of disclosure directed by Dan Farah is set to appear on at realtimers at real time with Bill Maher while Dr. Beatatric Valarriel scientific work makes waves. He&#x27;s referencing Dr.</p>
<p>Beatatric&#x27;s scientific work of objects having been captured through photography uh as I understand it in near Earth orbit prior to Sputnik the first satellite going into um nearear orbit. So the implication is it these objects could be of of scientific or technological origin. Let&#x27;s go deeper into Merrick van von Renamp&#x27;s mention of sitting vice president JD Vance to give you some context. on October 1st this year, he was on the Ruth Ruthless podcast and he said that he&#x27;s obsessed with UFOs and that during the August recess, he wants to get to the bottom of what&#x27;s going on regarding this enigma. JD Vance has subsequently made new comments about UFOs on October 29th on the podcast podcast one with columnist Miranda Deine.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s play that clip that UAP James provided on X and then I&#x27;ll give you my commentary. &gt;&gt; One last question about UFOs. So, [laughter] I&#x27;m a mad UFO uh lunatic as well. Yeah. So, and you said I think the Ruthless podcast that you were going to in August you were going to figure out &gt;&gt; what happened.</p>
<p>So, have you been &gt;&gt; that was a little tongue and cheek. I&#x27;ve not figured it out yet. I didn&#x27;t have the time to figure it out yet, &gt;&gt; but you got access to all this. &gt;&gt; I I do and I really want to sort of dig into it. You know, Marco is actually very interested in this, too.</p>
<p>We talked about this a little. We talked about this back in our Senate days. So, yeah, there there&#x27;s certainly an interest there. There&#x27;s certainly an intrigue, but I haven&#x27;t yet had the time to really dig in. Things have been so busy, but this is the like the crazy person inside of me.</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s, you know, all of us put the tinfoil hat on from time to time. I&#x27;m like, I wonder like I I can&#x27;t allow myself to become so busy that I spend the next 3 years and I don&#x27;t get to the bottom of this. So, I will get to the bottom of this, but it&#x27;s going to take me a little time &gt;&gt; because Chelsea Gabbard says that she believes there are aliens. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You know, I I don&#x27;t It&#x27;s interesting. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I do or don&#x27;t believe it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&#x27;m a big believer that there are things out there that we can&#x27;t explain. And so, if another person sees an alien, maybe I see an angel or a demon. So, I&#x27;m a big believer that there are like spiritual forces working on the physical world that a lot of us don&#x27;t see and a lot of us don&#x27;t understand and a lot of us don&#x27;t appreciate. But, you know, is it aliens or is it our guardian angel or is it aliens or is it a not so guardian force that doesn&#x27;t care about us or in fact actively wishes us harm? I don&#x27;t know the answer to that question. What I try to do is I try to say my prayers.</p>
<p>I try to be as good of a person as I can be and I try to do a good job and hopefully that&#x27;s all I need to do. &gt;&gt; Really interesting that right off the bat he said that he&#x27;s adamant about getting to the bottom of of the UFO enigma. Now that&#x27;s fantastic. This demonstrates that what he said in on early in early August wasn&#x27;t just a whim. He&#x27;s dead serious.</p>
<p>and we have the Age of Disclosure coming out in about 21 days. I suspect he&#x27;ll watch it. I suspect most government officials will watch it considering people such as the former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper will be in it and and other highlevel government officials sitting senators and so forth. It&#x27;s going to make waves I think in Washington. So he&#x27;ll be among those in the US government that will watch it and this will give him even more education on the significance of this issue.</p>
<p>Now he said something really interesting. He said if another person sees an alien maybe I see an angel or a demon. But here&#x27;s the thing. Highlevel ex officials like former Colonel Carl Nell and David Grush and others [snorts] people who have had high level clearances worked in the US government have been unanimous on the claim that there is a subrosa cold war among nations to figure out how these non-human intelligence technologies work. so that they can have a b an advantage militarily.</p>
<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound a whole lot like uh angels or demons to me. That sounds more like something else. Which brings me to a tweet that I wrote very recently. I stated, &quot;Every religion will want to claim UFOs as bolstering their theology, but what if these phenomena exist totally outside it? Can we entertain that as a real possibility?&quot; In a post-disclosure world after UFO confirmation which I believe will happen in our lifetimes it is going to open a wellspring of discussion about spirituality and that will be one of the great positivities of entering a postclosure world. What is the nature of reality? Why are we here? Just learning about these entities engaging our world will trigger that conversation.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t want to be uh dogmatic or close-minded. I want to give everyone room to explore this new challenging phase of human evolution. So if someone wants to believe that their scripture outlines exactly who or what these uh consciousnesses are have at it, but what I will do is I will say, you know, I&#x27;m open to you being right, but are you open to me being right that maybe these non-human intelligences simply have nothing to do with scripture and just exist totally outside its bounds? I&#x27;m hopeful that a post-dlossure world will make us all more open-minded and less dogmatic because I think that&#x27;s healthier because ultimately these are questions we we don&#x27;t have definitive answers to. So why should we commit to any any particular explanation? Please don&#x27;t forget to subscribe if you&#x27;d like to support this channel. You become a patron.</p>
