            <p>Are you familiar with the invention secrecy act of 1951? &gt;&gt; Oh my god. I would love for you to get into that. &gt;&gt; The invention secrecy act say do MKlax. &gt;&gt; Well, no. [laughter] This this is actually very because &gt;&gt; the X files of Congress.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They actually did this. The Meshi Secrecy Act of 1951 is where the federal government came in and there were guys that were building certain technologies of cars being able to run on water or different things and going 200 miles, 400 miles, 500 miles, &gt;&gt; the Teslas of the world, the real Teslas, &gt;&gt; the real Teslas of the world, and then all of a sudden getting killed or they get they die. You first of all, I highly recommend you watch the documentary for yourself, okay? But the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 is a real thing that the US government because let&#x27;s just say you have a new invention. They&#x27;ll come to you and they&#x27;ll say, &quot;We think this is worth $100 million. We&#x27;re going to give you $25 million and we&#x27;re going to take the patent away from you.&quot; And you don&#x27;t have a choice to say yes or no.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to take that away from you. And they have &gt;&gt; you mean I can&#x27;t call the negotiator with the birthday card and say, &quot;Hey, 20 million on this date.&quot; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Maybe you get a better negotiator to to decide the numbers. But uh they have apparently 6,000 inventions that has been kept here and no one knows what the inventions are in there. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s definitely so the way and like look there&#x27;s obviously information that we&#x27;re developing that we don&#x27;t want our adversaries to get, right? So like obviously that just should remain classified. However, when you don&#x27;t have any oversight onto that so you can&#x27;t ensure that people aren&#x27;t legitimately getting killed in the process of releasing this information or saying like, &quot;Hey, this is not this is not what you think it is.&quot; That&#x27;s a problem.</p>
<p>there&#x27;s literally no oversight and it&#x27;s operating outside the purview of any branch of government. We know that the Pentagon um up until recently had to pass a audit in a audit in a while and that there&#x27;s this issue with these defense contractors that really are operating I mean these people are um the way that the different lobbies operate in Washington it&#x27;s literally like a cartel. People think Mexico is bad. Really the only difference between Mexico and the United States is we wear suits. Um and that&#x27;s really it.</p>
<p>I mean over there I I you know you have like the the Fizers of the world. I mean that those are our cartels, right? Um but specifically with these defense contractors, they&#x27;re then given government contracts and so they&#x27;re not required to answer to Congress and then who has authority to supervise that. So I think that that&#x27;s how they&#x27;re hiding a lot of this information and but to date just operating on um either photo or video evidence or testimony, I can definitely tell you that I am um not confused on the topic. I definitely think that UAPs are real. They&#x27;re not Russia or China.</p>
<p>Um, they&#x27;re definitely not ours. &gt;&gt; After two years of working on this, we have finally pulled it off. And let me tell you what it is. Every time we do the Vault Conference, if you&#x27;ve attended, you know this. I stand up and I speak for probably 45 hours is what I do at the Vault Conference.</p>
<p>And I love it. I love being around the guys. I love it. But I wear the Ferragamo shoes when I do this or I wear some kind of dress shoes. Eventually, for the last 25 years, I&#x27;ve always been on stage walking around.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m like, you know what? I&#x27;m sick and tired of it. I want a shoe that I&#x27;m comfortable wearing. And here&#x27;s what I love. I don&#x27;t like shoes that are so heavy. That&#x27;s a dumbbell.</p>
<p>You can use it as a weapon. I don&#x27;t want that. Like the Zenia, you carry it. I I have so many of them, but they&#x27;re so heavy. Like, you can literally curl the Zenia dumb, you know, the shoes and and you&#x27;ll get a pump within 30 reps.</p>
<p>And I wanted the combination of the the Hoka, the the the Uncloud, the super foam, because there&#x27;s a big thing going on right now with the super foam where the bottom of the shoe you wear it. You know which ones I&#x27;m talking about, the Uncloud or the Hocas, right? They&#x27;re so comfortable. &gt;&gt; And I said, &quot;What if we take luxury and then combine it with the super comfort? What would that look like? And let&#x27;s build it in Italy.&quot; So what did we do? We went to Italy. We designed the shoe in Florida. We made the shoe in Italy in five of five of the factories.</p>
<p>We went back and forth. God knows how many times. And by the way, the shoes we&#x27;re about to launch and introduce to you right now where you&#x27;re going to see the video for the first time. I&#x27;ve been wearing those shoes for the last 22 days straight. I&#x27;m wearing them right now.</p>
<p>I literally wore it with suits. I wore it yesterday. We went to lunch. I wore it every single day. It&#x27;s the most comfortable shoes I have.</p>
<p>Yet, it&#x27;s authentic Italian leather. Rob, if you don&#x27;t mind playing the video, go for it. Here&#x27;s a video of the latest shoe, the FLBs. When we set out to create a shoe that [music] blends comfort, function, and luxury, we had the choice to make it fast. We had the choice to make it cheap.</p>
<p>We chose neither. Instead, we chose Tuscaniro. We chose [music] true Italian craftsmanship. Each pair touched by 50 skilled hands. We chose patience, spending two years perfecting every detail.</p>
<p>And we chose the finest quality at every step. Introducing the future looks bright collection. Not rushed, not disposable, not ordinary, rather intentional, luxurious, timeless. Boom. &gt;&gt; There you go.</p>
<p>Designed in Florida, 100% made in Italy. 50 hands touch each shoe that was made. And here&#x27;s what&#x27;s unique about it. I want to kind of show this to everybody that knows this. And I&#x27;ve worn pretty much every one of these shoes.</p>
<p>So if you compare this the Italian leather of course it&#x27;s made in Italy it&#x27;s not assembled made in China assembled in Italy 100% made in Italy assembled in Italy it&#x27;s FBS berutis which are $1840 fragamos are 8.95 zenyas are 1190 and Gucci&#x27;s are 950 leather premium lining all of them except for Gucci laceless feature it&#x27;s the fob&#x27;s the berutes you have laces fragamos laceless and then you have also the zenyas and then the Gucci&#x27;s have the laces I don&#x27;t want to wake up in the put laces on. I want to get out the house. Took me 3 seconds to pull my shoes on today. Craftsmen, five different Italian factories all made this shoe. Berlutes are the same as us as well as FLB.</p>
<p>But the only shoe these trainers, the only one in the world today, according to the factories that told me this in Italy that has the super foam, the only one that has the same super foam used in the Enclouds and the Hulkas, it&#x27;s the FBS. And they&#x27;re officially out and you can place the order. Here&#x27;s a challenge. We only have a thousand of these pairs. And when you say thousand of these pairs, they start from size, I believe, uh, is it eight? It goes eight, nine, 10, 10 and 1/2, 11, 11 and 1/2, 12, 13.</p>
<p>Those are the sizes that we have. And the shoes that you can get today, the colors you have access to, Rob, if you can go back to, you can have access to those browns, which is absolutely beautiful. And by the way, the brown on the bottom, the stitching on the uh side is a left stitching if you can change the picture. And on the bottom, it says the future looks bright. Look at the the white uh lines on the side.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s beautiful. The only ones we have right now that you can get sent out today are the black and the browns. If you do want the white to pre-order, I would highly recommend you do so. They&#x27;re going to come out the second week of December. So, the white and the navy blue comes out the second week of December.</p>
<p>The Browns and the blacks are available. If you believe the future looks bright as much as we do, go place the order. There&#x27;s nothing like sitting in the boardroom with your trainers and you put your feet over your knee and people look at the bottom of your shoe and it says future looks bright. That&#x27;s how you get deals done. All right, so they&#x27;re out.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m excited to announce it and I&#x27;m very happy for people to go sport it. When you get them, take pictures, send it our way. We&#x27;re going to show all these shoes, all the pictures that are being taken. I already got a bunch of them sent to me on Instagram. Go to vt merch.com, place your order.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all over the website. Maybe buy it for your husband, buy it for your brother, buy it for your co-workers, buy it for your best salespeople if you want to let them know the future looks bright.
