            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel we look at a lot of uh spend a lot of our time uh looking at theories of everything uh we do deep Dives on uh great theories uh great research from people you probably never heard of uh but if you did you&#x27;d be happy about it and today is our 420th video uh uh dwey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory uh and uh we&#x27;re looking at uh one of his books that is called the basic properties of matter chapter 2 interatomic distances and uh we are right in the middle of that chapter we&#x27;ll get into that um soon as I give you a little bit more background um Mr Barson&#x27;s uh theory was first uh put out in 1959 where he put out his two fundamental postulates just two sentences about how the universe operates then he took those two postulates and uh through a process of deduction he arrived at his theoretical universe and so this theoretical Universe was is uh through an if this then that approach uh was what Larson&#x27;s Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then in many books he compared his theoretical Universe with the actual measured universe of the scientists that they&#x27;ve compiled uh you know through experiments in their Laboratories and um uh uh putting together in their scientific tables that&#x27;s exactly what basic properties of matter is uh larsson&#x27;s book it&#x27;s on chemistry some of the basic properties of matter like the melting point um and we are looking at the chapter that&#x27;s called the interatomic distance uh every element has a uh uh distances between um each atom uh when they are kind of packed together in the solid state and uh that is what Larson derived an equation for uh more than one equation depending on um different factors within the atom uh it&#x27;s its location on the periodic table and so on and then he Compares his results with the uh scientific tables now most of uh Larson&#x27;s content is uh in his first postulate uh which uh is uh paraphrased as uh the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay um my version of it will be a little bit longer but just that uh the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it&#x27;s not constructed of the fundamental forces but it is made out of motion specifically it&#x27;s made out of a motion that Larson calls scalar motion which is a nonl alized generalized kind of motion uh that has a magnitude but no specific Direction um you can Envision a scalar motion with a balloon that you put dots on with a magic marker if you blow up all uh if you blow up the balloon all of the dots will be moving away from each other and uh if you suck in the balloon all the dots will be moving toward each other they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction um they are just all moving away from each other or toward each other um you wouldn&#x27;t be able to determine a specific Direction until you arbitrarily assigned one of those dots to be motionless and then you would be able to start making measurements so the the uh Direction measure measurements are a product of the reference system not of the motion itself and um Hubble and his associates back in the 20s uh did observe that um all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other so this is not just a an imaginary motion that um you make up with a balloon the um it&#x27;s actually got physical counterparts um the motion of the distant galaxies is a motion outward in all directions now um the people that uh you know use that as a justification for the Big Bang uh it&#x27;s that is one interpretation but I think in order to make that interpretation you would have to be uh again saying that our galaxy is not moving all the other ones uh appear to be moving outward in all directions except for ours you know so that&#x27;s gets into like a cernus quite qu type question all right um so and the the results the mathematical results are the same either way so it&#x27;s not like you can really tell from um once you assign a reference point once you assign a a stationary point the U the the measurements are going to look the same ma from a mathematical standpoint now so Larson says the universe is made out of motion in particular this kind of scalar motion uh that is what the universe is built upon uh he says that um you know if you don&#x27;t have anything in the universe the universe uh you still have motion you have to be able to accept the idea that motion uh comes before the thing that&#x27;s moving and that even before you have anything in the universe you have Mo this outward motion uh which Larsson calls the progression um and um that motion occurs uh basically motion is the relationship between space and time we tend to think of motion as being U and all other activity of the universe as being um on a stage of space and time like the space and the time are the container of the universe but um in Larson system space and time are the contents of the universe the universe is made out of motion and motion is made out of the relationship between space and time motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time space and time are both the same except that they are reciprocals of one another they so they come in like a different order the same way three halfes and its reciprocal 2/3 are um have the same have the same uh components but they are in reverse order um and they also multiply to B1 and uh also with uh space and type so um LaRon says that space and time and motion occur in three dimensions so you know motion is a fraction with space or time is the numerator time or space is the denominator but they can come in multiple dimensions and so you know um all of our scientific quantities are kinds of motion speed is space over time energy is time over space these are the simple aspects but if you want to get more complicated matter is time to the thir power over space to the thir power density time to the thir power of space to the sixth power because density is just matter over volume volume is space to the thir power so time to the thir power over space to the thir power divided by space to the third power is time to the 3 over space to the 6th pressure is time over space to the 4th power so you can think of pressure as um time over space which is energy over volume so pressure is energy over volume uh you can also think of uh pressure as um force is time over space to the second power so you can also think of um pressure as Force per area uh force is conjugate acceleration is s over t to the second power momentum is uh T the 2 power over s the 2 power and N so so that just shows you that uh Larson has a alternate system to the MKS system and it is much more efficient because it only has two variables instead of three makes things a lot more clear and you can check your equations also um now the other important thing um among you know many things though is that uh space and time only come in discrete units you have to have a full unit of space before you have space you have to have a full unit of time before you have time uh if you have exactly one unit of space in exactly one unit of time you have the speed of light which Larson refers to as unit speed 1 over 1 equals 1 this speed of light in larsson&#x27;s system is the background speed of the universe so this is the pace of the outward progression the progression um is outward at the speed of light in all directions that is the empty universe or the origin Larson refers to it as the progression of the natural reference system the null point the zero point um and uh this replaces the zero point of the scientist which is zero motion Lon Larson measures his motions from the uh um from this uh unit progression from the speed of light outward in all directions that&#x27;s why he calls it Spa a speed displacement as opposed to a speed because there was already a speed there so it&#x27;s the difference of the speed instead of just the speed so he calls it speed displacement and um so this basically means that if you have uh the speed of light outward in all Direction is the zero point that means that half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light which goes against the Legacy scientists again who say that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe that shows that they are not aware of half of the universe only the half that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light which Larsson calls the material sector um but not aware of the cosmic sector which is what Larson calls the faster than the speed of light now when you cross that boundary from one to the other you um have to invert the order uh invert the roles of space and time so in the material sector we generally see three dimensions of space in a still frame what we call coordinate space XYZ coordinates or volume and that is also you know what you call the space spatial reference system we see three dimensions of space in a still frame and we see clock time which is the uh flow of time the progression of time the scalar motion outward in time time is always getting farther and farther and farther apart or later later and later the progression of time so in the material sector we have uh coordinate space and clock time but if we cross that boundary that speed of light boundary we move into the cosmic sector into the faster than light sector then we see coordinate time and clock space so we see three dimensions of time in a still frame and we see uh the flow of space or progressing space space is always getting later and later and later or space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart like the dots on an expanding balloon in addition to that one boundary there is also uh one a boundary within each one of those um within each one of those sectors uh that is the um that leads to a um small region or uh inside region of each sector um and that is when you do not have a full unit of space or time because if you don&#x27;t have a full unit you don&#x27;t have uh if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you don&#x27;t have space you only have time because the universe is made out of space and time so it has to be one or the other of both and so um lson calls that the time region that is the interaction that occurs in less than one unit of space which is 4.56 * 10- 8 m or like 500,000 of an inch um when you have interactions that occur in less than that amount of space they occur in time and that is a boundary again that you cross um and then and so that is the realm of atomic and molecular interactions that he talks about here in this basic properties the matter book in The Cosmic sector you have the same thing but with time uh within one unit of time you don&#x27;t have time you only have space so Larson calls that the space region and that&#x27;s the region of interaction of uh Cosmic atoms and Cosmic molecules uh what are known as um msons or antimatter and um when you cross these boundaries the rules also invert and and so are they uh the directions invert so uh inside the time region you have um progression the progression is moving everything toward each other toward zero space and you have gravitation uh the opposite of the progression this the Contracting balloon in the earlier an analogy that is now moving um everything away from each other toward unit distance okay so that is where you get this concept Larson has of the interatomic distance that is the place within the time region where the constant uh rate of the progression is completely balanced or equal to the um variable rate of gravitation so where gravity equals the progression is where you have this interatomic distance now in this chapter he&#x27;s a little bit in the weeds here talking about the different uh kinds of matter the different uh um divisions of the periodic table and each one of the different divisions is dealt with slightly differently basically we&#x27;re talking about one equation but there are certain caveats that we have to take into account these are more finer points but I&#x27;m just going to read them uh read everything and don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t understand all of it if you if you kind of get the basic idea um uh this is our sixth installment of this chapter and we did I think about 10 videos before this um so you might want to go back if you want to get all the details of um the equations a special type of structure is Possible only for those electr negative Elements which have a rotational displacement of four units in the electric Dimension now again an atom is made out of three separate kinds of rotation first it&#x27;s made out of two photons that are um simple harmonic motions wav like motions now there&#x27;s a debate between Larson and some of his followers how that wav likee motion gets established whether it is from a vibrational motion or whether it is from two rotational motions but regardless there are two photons at the core of every atom but those photons are moving outward at the speed of light in all directions like the progression until they are slowed down by rotations there have to be three dimensions of rotations to slow down and stop the atom and get it to start gravitating and those rotations are notated in larsson&#x27;s periodic table so every element of the periodic table has a three number signature the first number is the primary two-dimensional rotations the second number is the secondary two-dimensional rotations and the third number um is the um electric rotation in the opposite direction which these are scalar motions so they don&#x27;t have Direction per se the only direction that scalar motion has is in or out um okay so um that that third dimension is um in opposition but the third dimension is the only optional it can be zero in all the noble gases it&#x27;s zero and it can be positive or negative um kind of um in the same way that veilance is uh you know where something like um oxygen has a uh you know is two steps away from the the nearest noble gas neon um that&#x27;s minus two but you could also think of as plus six toward the next noble gas helium and that&#x27;s kind of what he&#x27;s getting into here there there different orientations of some of these elements and depending on where it&#x27;s located on the periodic table there are certain other factors you have to keep in mind um okay um these elements on the borderline between division 3 and division 4 uh when they have a display placement of four units in the electric Dimension the electric Dimension is the one-dimensional U so that is the third number so when that number is four these elements are in the borderline of division three and division four uh where the secondary positive and reverse orientations are about equally probable and again probability is one of the major factors that Larson uses to D deduce his universe based on what is uh you know what is possible and what is probable and also the idea that uh what can exist does exist under similar conditions other elements crystallize in the hexagonal or um tetragonal structures utilizing the different orientations in the different dimensions for these displacement four elements however the two orientations produce the same specific rotation 10 um the interatomic distance in th these crystals is therefore the same in all dimensions and the crystals are isometric even though the rotational forces in the different dimensions are not of the same character the molecular arrangement in this Crystal pattern the diamond structure shows the true nature of the rotational forces outwardly this Crystal cannot be distinguished from the isotropic tubic crystals but the analogous body centered cubic structure has an atom at Each corner of the cube as well as one in the center whereas the diamond structure leaves alternate Corners open to accommodate the abnormal projection of forces in the secondary positive dimension in those of the lower elements of division 4 um that are beyond the range of the inverse type of orientation there is no available alternative for combination with the secondary positive orientation the crystals of these elements therefore have no effective electric rotation in the remaining dimensions and the relative specific rotation in these Dimensions is Unity as in all dimensions of the inert gas elements so the specific rotation um basically is 1 plus um in these applications it&#x27;s one plus the um c number the third number uh in this case the third number that&#x27;s why for the inert gases it&#x27;s un Unity as opposed to zero because you have to have one in in all of uh the reciprocal system applications you you always have to have that one unit just to get started because that one unit is what nullifies the progression in that Dimension the progression is always a unit so it has to be nullified just to get you to zero okay um the most common distances in the Aggregates of the division four elements are shown in table five which I think we&#x27;ll get to here up to this point no consideration has been given to the elements of atomic number number below 10 as the rotational forces of these elements are subject to certain special influences which make it desirable to discuss them separately one cause of d deviation from the normal behavior is the small size of the rotational groups in the larger groups of the four divisions are distinct and except for some overlapping each has its own characteristic uh characteristic Force combinations as we have seen in the preceding paragraphs in an eight element group however the second uh series of four elements which would normally constitute division 3 is actually in the division 4 position as a result these four elements have to a certain extent the properties of both divisions similarly division one elements of these groups May in some cases act as if they were members of division 3 the second a second influence that affects the forces and the Crystal structures of the lower group element ments is the inactivity of the rotational forces in certain Dimensions that was mentioned earlier a specific rotation of two units produces no effect in the positive direction the reason for this is revealed by equation 1 one by applying this equation we find that the effective rotational Force which is the log of T natural log of t for one um for T equals 2 is uh 0.693 Which is less than the opposing space-time force of one the net effective force of specific rotation 2 is therefore below the minimum value for action in the positive direction in order to produce an active Force the specific rotation must be high enough uh to make the natural log of T greater than Unity this is accomplished at rotation three okay so I think I might have told you that uh you have to have you have to be able to nullify uh three dimensions of the progression all three dimensions of the progression before you uh kind of stand still and are able to gravitate um I believe that is a different explanation than what he&#x27;s giving here which is for the uh specific rotation and this is uh based on the natural log uh which he derived in the equation for um this interatomic distance and the natural log is also it has you have to have three in order to get a natural log greater than one and so so you need three uh units of specific rotation here in order just to get um any type of um uh force that will nullify the uh the progression I&#x27;ll have to look into kind of the differences there but we will sus it out this is again is kind of a detective story you kind of just get Clues and you uh stash them in the back of your mind and eventually he kind of uh solves the problem you know he kind of says it later but uh you know you can&#x27;t blame Larson because he&#x27;s working on his own with no resources um you know to put this together um and he&#x27;s he did a fine job but not everything is on a a silver platter for you you know he didn&#x27;t have the time or resources to roll out the red carpet so you got to you got to dig and you got to you know be somewhat of a detective or a bulldog okay now um we&#x27;re talking about division 4 elements here and so um he goes through the table we got silicon uh the specific rotation three 3 on either 5 or 10 um observed 2.31 and again that is in um angstroms uh calculated 2.31 observe 2.35 phosphorus calculated 2.19 observe 2.20 second uh orientation of phosphorus calculated at 3.46 observed at 3.48 sulfur uh calculated at uh 2.11 observed at 2.07 uh second orientation of sulfur uh calculated 3.21 observed 3.27 chlorine calculated 1.92 observed is only 1.82 so that that is a fair uh fairly significant ific an error there um chlorine 2.48 calculated observe 2.52 um moving up to the next uh row on the periodic table germanium uh 2.46 calculated observed 2.43 arsenic 2.37 observed 2.44 it&#x27;s again fairly significant difference uh the second orientation of arsenic 2.46 observed 2.51 selenium calculated 2.32 observe 2.32 second uh orientation of selenium 3.46 observe 3.46 so he&#x27;s on a roll um okay and it goes on and on there&#x27;s Fair difference here with bromine bromine however you pronounce it um tin he got exactly right there um for one of the orientations but significant differences in one of the other ones and uh it goes on and on so we will uh resume tomorrow um he will probably explain a little bit about this table and then probably move into a different group of elements hang in there and thanks for tuning in
