            <p>hello YouTube I&#x27;m dr. Anna W satis finder and chair of the International Society of unified science and president and trans Power Corporation of commercial and custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company we offer the largest selection of decision support software that you can find today I&#x27;m going to go over the reciprocal system theory of physics we&#x27;re going to do part two of the reciprocal system explanation of ten unexplained two mysteries of stars we did five last time so we do the remaining five today I want to scroll down get to number five here these mysteries by the way come from Lucifer&#x27;s comm so number five number five mystery the planet that should have been swallowed loss 18 is 330 light-years away in the Phoenix Phoenix constellation about 25 percent more massive than our Sun this is another entry we&#x27;re not the star itself but what it orbits is the real mystery 2009 cold Hellyer of kill university discovery de los 18 had a planet dubbed lost 18 be the planet is slightly bigger than Jupiter but has about 10 times its mass which is just below the mass it would make it a brown dwarf which is a star that failed to initialize what puzzles a services is that the planet orbits less than two million miles from its parent star by comparison mercury is nearly 36 million miles from our Sun waspy teens so close to its parent that it completes its orbit in less than 23 hours and surface temperatures around 4000 degrees Fahrenheit which is 2200 degrees Celsius being so close to the planet should eventually fall into its Sun it has survived already for about six or an 80 million years given the mass of the star it orbits this planet should have been consumed long ago I thought I was able to form and remain in a location where plants were thought unable to exist as a question that continues to complex astronomers let&#x27;s not perplexing to advocates of the reciprocal system this is just a question of Newtonian gravitational math and it&#x27;s not a mystery the stars I mean excuse me the planet is moving fast enough around the Sun I mean it completes its orbit and lesson 23 hours so there&#x27;s really no mystery here even by conventional standards and we&#x27;ll get to plant information looking a little bit now let&#x27;s go down to mystery number four the star dust that found its way home since PSR and that means pulsar b12 57 plus 12 is a remnant of a supernova explosion so I just never expected to find planets anywhere near but they had an entire solar system a total three planets and wonderf planet orbit this pulsar thinking they must be common scientists began looking for her other poles ours four planets however only one other pulsar was confirmed to have a single plant order that&#x27;s showing that they are indeed extremely rare the process by which sister planets are able to form is still not well understood the most accepted theory is that the planets formed a little white guard on from a planetary disc that originally surrounded the star however any planet making material on dust should have been thrown billions of miles out in the space by the secret of the explosion now the gas and dust was able to return to the remaining become tidally locked and contain enough material for the formation of a whopping four planets remains a mystery okay from the reciprocal system planets are not formed from planetary discs just minutes plants are formed from the original supernova type 2 explosion they are result of expansion in time which is the inverse of expansion in the space planets are failed white dwarfs or pulsars so normally what happens with a supernova explosion say type ones a white dwarf on a red giant with type two it&#x27;s full and the red giant material generally disperses away and doesn&#x27;t leave for so planets are actually failed white or sort of pulsars actually so there&#x27;s so there&#x27;s no mystery here and there so no system now it&#x27;s very number three the disco star v838 monocerotis is located in the constellation mato service which is about twenty thousand light-years murder earth and was at one point considered one of the largest stars in the universe in 2002 the brightness of the star shut up suddenly was thought to be a simple matter which is what happens when the remaining core of a dead star and then is a white dwarf a human is too much hydrogen gas from a neighboring star that&#x27;s nonsense he says parenthetically causing a fantastic explosion was started after a couple weeks as expecting scientists but even the record books Casanova but less than a month later the star burst in light again since the time trade between one solution is too short to be caused as two separate and OVA astronomers were puzzled and took a closer look then they discovered their problem there was no white dwarf oh sorry simply erected by itself and it repeated the process of brightening and dimming several times over the next few months during us brightest eruption the star became a million times brighter than the Sun and one of the brightest lights in the sky typically starts brightened slightly before their death the measurements indicate that the store was only a few million years old haha and that&#x27;s nonsense because in the reciprocal system the largest stars are older than the younger stars so a mere Toffler story is you know that&#x27;s way off anyway you can gather this piece continues when the Hubble telescope captured an image of the star and after the eruptions a large cloud of gas and debris will see an accelerating away from the star one theory is that the stars they collided with something unseen there&#x27;s another star planet but scientists are still puzzled mind is now a decade of mystery well I say here standpoint in the reciprocal system astronomers had the stellar evolution sequence upside down the star is not only it&#x27;s probably a blue giant it&#x27;s very old it could possibly be a wolf rayet star in essence it&#x27;s a variable start the reciprocal system stellar energy generation is not due to hydrogen fusion or you know light element fusion it&#x27;s due to heavy element vision and usually what happens with the variable stars at one element one lower elements you know above iron wool or fission and that will cause temperature and pressure and so on to expand and the star will expand out and that will cool the star that won&#x27;t come back and then when that&#x27;s happening then then the previous element which had fission before the end of fission again so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a cycle there and simply a large old variable star okay number two mystery number two the rogue planet CF BDS ir 2149 - zero four zero three is pacified is around dwarf these are felt to initialize nuclear and I laugh at them no such thing it&#x27;s nuclear fusion in that course because there&#x27;s gravitational segregation there&#x27;s no hydrogen the quartz heavy elements on the core obviously and it all happened to real burning stars the author says well-characterized is an AP greatest star due to its size and mass many others characterize it as a gas giant this would make it a planet without a parent star which has been theorized been only rarely observed only four possible candidates for the title for a planet and then to exist the one in question being the closest earth and an estimated 100 years without a large stark orbit the motion of the plan planet is influenced by other stars in the AV to rate of star group this doesn&#x27;t mean that it travels through space in any sort of straight-line common misconception about birth plans but just how a planet is able to go Road remains a mystery now from sampling and reciprocal system my planet may be created if their parent stars go supernova but this man dwarf could also be a star which is entry design of little Madison does unless it sees this energy production this may be temporary it&#x27;s possible in an existing stellar system with plants that when the star goes supernova most of the plants would be destroyed obviously but in some cases they may be ejected out of that particular stellar system and become annoyed okay now the last one number one the vanishing star dust TYC 8 2 4 1 2 6 5 2 s located 440 light-years away in the constellation Centaurus is believed to be around the same size of our Sun but a mere child a 10 million years old compared to our 4.5 billion year old story from 1983 to 2008 some research the right wing of dust around the selectra pasta plant formation believing they&#x27;re getting some insight in how our own solar system formed when the Tsar was due for a checkup in early 2009 astronomers were astonished when they looked through their telescopes they saw nothing but the star itself the ones the visible glowing disk of dust was gone it did not leave behind any planets or any signs as to where it had gone they quite simply managed scientists were baffled noticed about it astronomer carl melis something stated quote we don&#x27;t have a really satisfactory explanation you&#x27;re just what happen around this star well this is really easy for the reciprocal system obviously the dust has been pulled into the star just as a reciprocal system says it it would stars a creek mass of course they lose some mass as material streams out of the store but what we don&#x27;t usually see is the masculine end of the star and so stars have a net gain of mass over their lifetime thus they move up the main sequence not down or staying put as the conventional theorists say they slowly gain massive with millions of years mostly become blue giants so for more information on those typical system of theory particularly in Astrophysical astronomy please obtain dewey be Larson&#x27;s Astrophysical masterpiece the universe of motion Dubey Larsson was my theoretical physics mentor from 1965 until his death in 1990 he&#x27;s by far the most intelligent and most logical individual I have ever known study the reciprocal system improve it for yourself where the simplest possible treatment see my work the unless you naver&#x27;s which you can find at amazon.com a transformed court dog collar for the most comprehensive work with thousands and thousands of equations for you scientists and engineers professors out there obtain my work existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything and if you want to apply the theory in practice for science and engineering work get my databases this comes in two modules reciprocal system microcosms module for matter properties and the reciprocal system macrocosmos module for astronomy and astrophysics all of these represent a monumental piece of work that I&#x27;ve done for the theoretical physics community and you can obtain them from transparent court comm or amazon.com also see my theoretical physics website reciprocal system dr.
