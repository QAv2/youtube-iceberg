            <p>Yeah. Let&#x27;s say that the UFO craft that you&#x27;re talking about are real and that the effects and the speeds and the stuff that you&#x27;re talking about are real. What are we dealing with here? Like what how are these things doing what they&#x27;re doing in your opinion? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I I have no idea. This is all speculation, but it would probably some be some sort of like cold fusion like low energy nuclear reaction or something where you know like hot fusion is you know controllable fusion is the holy grail in you know energy unlocks.</p>
<p>So uh you know we&#x27;re now experimenting with magnetic confinement of lasers to you know allow for fusion. It&#x27;s really high energy fusion and in my opinion it kind of defeats the the purpose a little bit because the amount of energy you know you have to input to like make the thing work and amount of technical prowess it&#x27;s just extremely complicated. So it&#x27;s again this sort of horseshoe thing it&#x27;s like yeah so you you need some like fundamental unlock there &gt;&gt; were a couple of scientists that thought they did it pawns and fleshmen and I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know if they did I&#x27;m not deep down that conspiracy. So I don&#x27;t know if we have cold fusion like I don&#x27;t know if I don&#x27;t know if you know uh we have like alien reproduction vehicles where we have UFOs that we have in saucers that like America can fly. I I don&#x27;t know of that at all.</p>
<p>So, as far as how the aliens are flying them, I don&#x27;t know, but like it would probably be some sort of cold fusion on the front end energy-wise and then some sort of magnetic sensing. So, robins, you know, birds actually navigate home using the magnetic field of the earth. So, they have this aven cryptochromes, these CRY4 proteins, uh, uh, that basically using electron spin can understand where the magneettophere of the earth is and that&#x27;s how they know where they are. spatially and it&#x27;s more accurate than you know optical and it allows them to navigate home and quantum biology is this sort of burgeoning field generally like photosynthesis enzyme creation a lot of things are now being attributed to quantum mechanical effects inside the body the body&#x27;s notoriously warm wet and noisy and you know uh creates sort of decoherence when it comes to quantum so we didn&#x27;t think that anything quantum occurred but now more and more evidence is pointing towards sort of quantum stuff happening And a lot of the crafts when people see them like Commander David Fraver and others, you know, he&#x27;s the guy in 2004 off the coast of San Diego, the Nimttz group, seem to think that the crafts feel like they&#x27;re almost like alive, like they&#x27;re almost like biological organisms or beings themselves or something. And my guess is they would probably use some sort of quantum sensing for the navigation uh cuz it&#x27;s more accurate.</p>
<p>Even even Loheed has something called the dark ice magnetometer which uses quantum sensing and it is more accurate than for example GPS. Like if you lose GPS comms and you&#x27;re in some sub like you know deep underwater or whatever, you would use this like dark ice magnetometer.</p>
