            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I do educational material on this channel uh videos about uh all kinds of different subjects that you probably don&#x27;t know anything about but I think they&#x27;re important because I&#x27;ve done a lot of research a lot of digging and I&#x27;ve dug into some uh old crackpots who uh everybody&#x27;s dismissed but they spent their whole life working on something and they came out with something special but sometimes uh they either were censored out or they just didn&#x27;t put it into the put it on a silver platter for people and so it&#x27;s kind of hard to dig it out I&#x27;ve tried to um make these things a little bit more accessible in this case we&#x27;re looking at Dewey B Larson one of my heroes uh one of the main reasons he&#x27;s one of my heroes is that all of his most important books came out after his 80th birthday so you know if you&#x27;re uh you know digging on something if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;ve got uh some kind of passion in life you know you might have to wait but you will get it done eventually so um Larson uh is the author of the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory of everything that um purports to uh be able to penetrate any subject and come up with a coherent and correct answers now he did his earlier Works were all on the hard Sciences like physics and chemistry um we&#x27;re looking at right now we&#x27;re looking we&#x27;re going to go back to those eventually but right now we&#x27;re looking at his final book that came out after he died um called beyond space and time and this is his digging into metaphysics so uh philosophy religion and uh psychology and for Larson metaphysics was what is beyond space and time independent of space and time and space and time is a very important part of his theory because in Larson&#x27;s uh in Larson&#x27;s world the universe is not made out of matter and the universe is not made out of energy but the universe is made out of motion that&#x27;s so Larson has a universe of motion that&#x27;s the title of one of his books on astronomy and uh motion is the relationship between space and time okay we know uh the most basic motion that we know of is speed speed is measured in Space over time 10 miles of space and one hour of time the bike is going 10 miles per hour now but every other scientific phenomena that you can think of is also a relationship between space and time and in Larson&#x27;s system space and time are really the same other than they are reciprocals of each other so space and time have the exact same qualities but they are reciprocals of each other in the same way that two-thirds and three halves are reciprocals of each other they both contain a two and a three but they are inverted space is the inversion of time and vice versa but it&#x27;s a little more complicated than that because space and time are both multi-dimensional we know space to be uh three or more dimensions and as a result of the reciprocal postulate uh time is also three or more Dimensions what we know about time is that it&#x27;s always progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later it&#x27;s flowing so too space is also therefore flowing progressing things are always getting farther and farther apart and that was observed by the Hubble telescope way back in the 1920s all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other now that&#x27;s what as Larson calls a scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion with no Direction but a magnitude so you can Envision that as a balloon if you put a bunch of dots on the balloon you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other or if you cook some raisin bread you put the raisins in the bread all and then it starts cooking and expanding all of the raisins are moving away from each other but in no particular direction um the further away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other now uh the other part about space and time that is uh notable is that they are both quantized they both are only only come in discrete units there&#x27;s no uh you know Continuum there&#x27;s no smoothness to space and time there they come in chunks even though those chunks are so small that you hardly are able to notice them just like you know Sans in an hourglass or something like that it looks like a smooth progression but it&#x27;s really just one grain at a time and um so therefore space and time uh that are come in discrete units and one unit of space in one unit of time which we saw is speed space over time is speed one unit of space over one unit of time is the speed of light the speed of light in Larson&#x27;s universe is the midpoint or the null point or the neutral point or even the origin of that universe and there&#x27;s an entire half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls that the cosmic sector or sector two uh in addition to the material sector the sector we&#x27;re familiar with slower than the speed of light uh he calls that sector one or the material uh Universe now the material Universe builds up through aggregation to its most complex level which is DNA a few billion atoms per molecule at that level it becomes eligible to be controlled by a sector 2 entity an entity from the faster than speed of light uh universe and when those two things come together in the right proportion and the right configuration they form what Larson calls the life unit and this starts out from the lowest level of the life unit and evolves and develops up into its most complex level which Larson says is the intelligent human being and at that point the intelligent human being comes under the control uh gradually very slowly uh of a an entity from sector three sector three is this metaphysical region that he&#x27;s talking about the region that is beyond or independent of space and time I would suggest that this might actually be the speed of light itself and um so at that point this sector 3 begins to communicate with humans uh and um giving them insight into ethical Behavior good behavior uh just Behavior whereas sector two is uh directed towards survival so those things sometimes work in Harmony and sometimes they work in Conflict when they are in Conflict the human being has to be able to decide which way to go uh based on their free will now we are in chapter 25 of Larson&#x27;s uh final book beyond space and time and he&#x27;s discussing uh uh it&#x27;s called outlook for communication so he&#x27;s talking about Community various Communications between sector three and the intelligent human uh variously called ESP intuition [Music] um scientific Insight religious Revelation and so on and um right here he&#x27;s talking about miracles and trying to put Miracles into some kind of scientific categorization so we&#x27;ll start here uh these are Larson&#x27;s words whether they call for miracles or not there can be little doubt but that a substantial proportion of the petitions currently being addressed to the deity are improper requests for special or preferential treatment for example probably outnumber all others but such requests are not at all consistent with the ethical code now the ethical code is kind of like the composite of all of the communications that we get from sector three and we can put them together in some kind of tapestry where we understand kind of what the code of right and wrong good and evil uh is and so he calls that the ethical code so uh requests uh prayers for special or preferential treatment are not at all consistent with the ethical code uh he quotes one uh philosopher who calls it greedy supplications for special favors also the pleas for Mercy that are encouraged by most religious leaders belong in the same class class they ask that the petitioner be Exempted from whatever penalties may be assessed against others this is the biological code sector two uh whenever you&#x27;re talking about biology you&#x27;re talking about sector two uh this is the biological code the me first Doctrine and it is directly opposed to the Golden Rule the essence of which is that we should ask no more for ourselves than that which is given to others now uh I don&#x27;t know why Larson&#x27;s doing this because he he has already gone over the golden rule in detail but he never gave this particular definition of the golden rule um you know he he was talking about do unto others as you would have them do unto you and I was criticizing that because it&#x27;s not Universal I it&#x27;s a guideline but for me that&#x27;s not Universal because you know what if you are a Sato masochist or what if you are uh you know intravenous drug user drug addict you know do unto others as you would have them do unto you so are you gonna go out and uh whip uh whip people or inject people with uh heroin uh because that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what you want um so that doesn&#x27;t add up for me the Golden Rule it&#x27;s a useful guideline but to me it&#x27;s not a universal but here he&#x27;s redefining the goal Golden Rule saying the essence of which is that we should ask no more for ourselves than that which is given to others that is a little bit of a different connotation I think and maybe deserves to be looked at a little bit more closely okay back to Larson although the present investigation has not gone into these matters extensively enough to justify any firm conclusions the preliminary survey seems to indicate that if it is to be effective prayer must be concerned with matters that involve human actions not physical events in familiar language this means that one should pray only for wisdom or moral courage either for himself or on behalf of others whether or not this tentative conclusion is correct is a question of major significance to the human race and an exhaustive study of the subject is certainly Justified with the cooperation of religious organizations if possible but without if necessary a comprehensive study should ultimately result in delimiting the range of subjects with respect to which prayer is appropriate and this will enable some studies of the relative effectiveness of different procedures few observers are likely to believe that such a study would find the prayer wheels of Tibet very effective but yet the truth is that many modern procedures not only in prayer but also in other attempts at metaphysical communication are equally as perfunctory as these wheels the efficacy of group prayer for instance is open to serious question in view of the highly individualistic character of the intersector communication in general of course it is quite possible that group activities of this nature have a meaning in and a value to institutional religion that is separate and depart from the communication that is the ostensible purpose but some inquiry into this situation ought to be in order the efforts that are currently being made to apply group techniques to the discovery of new solutions for scientific economic and other problems seem to have a somewhat similar rationale and could well be studied in the same connection the only one of the intersector communication processes thus far discussed which has been subjected to any kind of a systematic study is telepathy which with the related process clairvoyance the direct perception of information is currently being investigated under the general name of ESP extra sensory perception Clairvoyance is essentially equivalent to intuition the only difference being in the nature of the information that is sought an individual&#x27;s conclusion with respect to the morality of a proposed action would be ascribed to his intuitive understanding of right and wrong whereas his correct perception of the nature of a hidden object in an experimental situation would be ascribed to clairvoyance the results obtained to date from the ESP experiments have been meager as in as indicated in the discussion of the subject in the earlier Pages it would be correct to say that certain aspects of these experiments have demonstrated the reality of the ESP phenomena but knowledge has not Advanced much Beyond this point this lack of progress can be attributed to a number of causes some of these such as the insistence uncoupling psychokinesis with ESP the saddling ESP with all of the shortcomings of this psychokinesis hypothesis can be laid at the door of the experimenters themselves others such as the exaggerated degree of skepticism with which the results of the experiments are received and the general lack of support of ESP research are chargeable to the scientific Community as a whole it is apparent however from the findings of this work that more meaningful results cannot be expected until the investigators have a better understanding of how to proceed clearly some further information of a basic nature is required before ESP experimenters can be so planned and executed that they will give conclusive answers to the questions that are being investigated one of the most important issues we find is the matter of motivation what we may call routine communication with sector 3 intuitive access to simple information has the benefit of a high power transmitter and most individuals have no difficulty receiving the messages in the ordinary course of life reception of complex and specialized information such as in Revelation and scientific Insight is much more difficult examination of the various methods of intersector communication from the standpoint of the characteristics that they have in common indicates that in all instances the individual who receives one of these extraordinary Communications is a person who is specifically qualified in the field of knowledge that is involved and who is able because of a strong motivation to exclude other matters and devote practically his entire attention to the one subject matter under consideration the essential requirement seems to be an intense interest in the success of the undertaking coupled with the absence of competing thought processes Insight or Revelation is not in itself a thought process in the ordinary sense of the term on the contrary it is the total lack of resemblance to the ordinary processes of thought that gives rise to such Expressions as flashes of insight and causes those who comment on these metaphysical modes of communication to use adjectives such as incomprehensible miraculous Etc but the message cannot be consciously perceived by a recipient unless it is converted into a thought process of some kind aside from the possibility discussed in chapter 11 nothing is yet known about how such a conversion is accomplished but evidently the probability of of success is enhanced if the mind is cleared of extraneous matters and the entire thought mechanism is held in Readiness to receive the message now this is again more like it for me I was criticizing Larson a couple days ago because of his uh not really understanding uh that really meditation um is not thinking it&#x27;s not he was saying be alone with your thoughts and he was saying uh you know concentrating on your thoughts um but here he&#x27;s saying the entire thought mechanism is held in Readiness to receive the message it the thought mechanism is held and that&#x27;s to me much more like it you have to um not think in order to be open to these messages okay back to Larson our findings further indicate that transmission of a sector 3 message is a much more difficult operation than reception of a message so that&#x27;s in prayer transmission of of a message to sector three okay instead of uh the Intuition or whatever which is a transmission from sector three an individual must be in a special mental or emotional state of a nature not yet understood in order to transmit such a message to another human being which is telepathy whether and remember all he all intelligent human beings do have a sector three component so which he calls level three so telepathy would be the communication between two sector three entities uh in humans whereas prayer would be a communication between a sector three entity and a human and sector three in general and then intuition would be sector three in general communicating to the sector 3 entity within a human okay back to Larson weather the same degree of preparedness is required in order to transmit a message to sector three uh prayer or equivalent is not clear because of the lack of reliable knowledge as to the results of prayer it may be reasonably assumed however that prayer is the inverse of intuition the intuitive process pairs a high power transmitter with a relatively inefficient receiver prayer reverses this combination and pairs a relatively inefficient transmitter with a very sensitive receiver on this basis we could expect that it is equally as effective as intuition okay we&#x27;ll leave it there uh and take over here in chapter 25 when we start up tomorrow thanks for tuning in have a great day and hope to see you soon</p>
