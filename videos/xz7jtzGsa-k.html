            <p>[Laughter] [Music] gentlemen james jacques welcome thanks for being here uh we&#x27;ll explain uh what this is all about because uh on the new spotify podcast we don&#x27;t really have an intro the same way the old ones did um james you produced a phenomenal documentary on the phenomenon on what&#x27;s going on with uh ufos and i just sent you an article that my friend sauger sent me today about a photograph a very clear photograph that they&#x27;ve taken of this triangular ufo so there&#x27;s something that we&#x27;ll be talking about in a little bit jacques valet you have been studying this most of your life too long too long we discussed it last night at dinner that um your interest in this came from an experience that you actually had as a child you actually saw a ufo as a as a teenager with two other witnesses one of the witnesses was half a mile away with binoculars so i&#x27;m pretty sure that um that that object was real and it was a classic disc middle of the afternoon clear sky absolutely clear at the time i became convinced that it might be a prototype of something that would be coming out later and you know we&#x27;re here many years later and we still don&#x27;t have anything like that it was just hovering and it was fair and you&#x27;ve been studying this for so long and this was uh something you guys talked about in the film that you were actually the character that the french ufo researcher in close encounters of the first kind or the third kind rather was modeled after the stephen spielberg film spielberg was intrigued with the idea of a of a character that was not quite as weird as you know the et&#x27;s but was a lot weirder than you know the people on the ground in the u.s trying to make sense of this in the military and so on so he needed this intermediate character and he thought you know frenchman was was the right thing to do and so did you talk to him about the film did you talk to him about when when he was putting it together and yeah uh i uh journalists put us together when about halfway through the you know the final final shooting of the film and there were there were gaps in the movie at that point and we we so we had lunch twice together and it was was a lot of fun he was at the time he was looking for a transition between the time when they they know the you know the big thing is coming the mothership is coming and they don&#x27;t know where and the mothership is sending signals but they can&#x27;t decipher the signals and i he said you know he had spent the morning at the jet propulsion laboratory and he said he couldn&#x27;t make any sense of all the mathematics they had and i said well maybe you could have you know two screens that give you an angle and and the angle tells you where the thing is and he said now that&#x27;s too complicated you know and it takes too long right it or it&#x27;s got to be just a few minutes in the film and then i i thought of a photograph that was on the desk of dr heineck you know dr j j heineck who was the air force consultant on ufos at the time and i was working with him building databases and so on and on that photograph there were three guys you know really well-dressed on ladders around a huge sphere of the earth in the lobby of some building somewhere with pieces of string that they were they were putting the string over the earth and i i told dr heineck i said alan you know what&#x27;s the story behind this and and he said well the when the first sputnik was launched you know october 57 nobody had a computer program to compute an orbit but they knew where the the sputnik had been seen nobody expected the russians to come up with this and they needed to know where it was going next so they the new york times called the director of harvard observatory saying um can you give us a comment on the russian satellite and the guy said hey it&#x27;s 3 o&#x27;clock in the morning you know what russian satellite and so they got dressed in a hurry and they they were trying to compute the orbit by putting a string around around the model of the earth in the lobby of the of harvard and i thought it was so funny and and spielberg said that&#x27;s it you know that&#x27;s it the the general says come on uh you know you know the the geographer who is uh the interpreter of the french of a french guy uh says well it looks like it&#x27;s somewhere in wyoming you know but where in wyoming you know where should we go and the the general says you mean we&#x27;ve got 10 billion dollars worth of radar and you know cameras and everything else nobody&#x27;s got a map of wyoming and they break into the lobby of the building next door and they come back with this globe and you know they&#x27;ve got the globe and they they look at it look at it and get their coordinates and because they it turns out the geographer tells them you know those signals they look like a longitude in the latitude so they they they chris you know they they get the point where it&#x27;s going to be and that&#x27;s that was a piece that was missing in in the movie so i was really proud of that you know it was it was really fun well also it&#x27;s a the one funny part in the movie yeah it&#x27;s a great movie and it&#x27;s uh it is probably the movie that got me most excited about ufos when i was a kid and i remember thinking if ufos were coming here from another planet one thing that i remember thinking is why would they even bother talking to the government like what what do they care who the government is like if if i was looking at an ant colony i&#x27;m not going to ask the ant colony which one&#x27;s the the elected official that&#x27;s in charge of all the other ants you don&#x27;t give a [ __ ] you&#x27;re just like trying to study the ants and i felt like if something was coming here from another planet that was so sophisticated it could either travel from another dimension or travel from another galaxy why would it care like who the president is or who the generals are you know not only that but the witnesses don&#x27;t talk to the government either you know by now the witnesses are tired of being ridiculed by scientists and you know by and told that those things don&#x27;t exist so they don&#x27;t they don&#x27;t talk so they&#x27;ll talk to you know uh people like you people like me uh because they trust you know they they trust me and in silicon valley you know you wouldn&#x27;t believe the number of people who come to me you know including ceos of companies that i&#x27;ve worked with who tell me about sightings that people in their family have had or sightings they had including you know sightings in vietnam for example and so on when they were in the military that have never been reported and and the government isn&#x27;t getting that when you first started studying this james when you started studying this phenomenon when you were thinking that you&#x27;re going to put together this this movie what you&#x27;ve done other documentaries on ufos what what got you into this so i had a really good friend of mine who was a high school buddy skye renee we traveled around europe together after we graduated from high school and in our early 20s he told me about this ufo crash in roswell in new mexico and i literally thought at the time i&#x27;m going to have to write this guy off i&#x27;ve lost my best friend he&#x27;s lost his mind and and that was that and i sort of walked away thinking god we&#x27;ve had such a great friendship i&#x27;m so sorry this guy&#x27;s gone and i brought it up with a guy that i was mentoring he was my mentor uh at a production facil excuse me production facility in california it&#x27;s got richard and he goes oh yeah roswell yeah that was an alien spaceship it crashed i mean the government admitted it i mean they they put the story out themselves these guys were the the only bomb unit in the world the 509th exclusively responsible for the deployment of atomic weapons these guys would not mistake an everyday weather balloon for a flying saucer he goes that actually happened and i went really so then i started looking into it before i knew it uh i started making a movie wow so what like when you heard about roswell and you you&#x27;ve investigated it now and you&#x27;ve gotten into what do you think that was well i can only go by the people that were there and uh major jesse marcel was one of the first military officers on the scene he&#x27;s part of the 509th and major marcel said the debris was strewn over an extremely large area and it was material that was not of this earth and he described the the material was one one chunk in particular was three to four feet long three feet wide light as a feather you could barely feel it in your hands when you carried it but they couldn&#x27;t destroy it with a blow torch they couldn&#x27;t destroy it with this photo you&#x27;re showing us right now jamie is the debris that they threw on the floor that was clearly just aluminum foil and sticks and stuff from a weather balloon that&#x27;s the fake debris yeah well there&#x27;s two stories right there was a story that came out the first day that said we&#x27;ve recovered a crashed ufo and then there&#x27;s a story that came out the second day whoops it was a weather balloon and uh this was after they had taken the wreckage and they flew it to wright-patterson air force base and it wasn&#x27;t what you would do with wreckage from a weather balloon what they&#x27;d done is they&#x27;d flown it in two separate jets or planes i don&#x27;t know if they were in jets back then two separate planes to make sure that they had at least some of it like if one of them crashed they at least had some of this stuff and to this day there&#x27;s people that were there that swear that this was something that was from an alien world and then you&#x27;ve got all the debunkers and all the other people that swear that it&#x27;s nonsense and that people are just making things up and they get a lot of attention from this and so they&#x27;re you know they&#x27;ve been telling these stories for decades and they might even believe it themselves but it&#x27;s all [ __ ] well my approach to that is you know no single case and i think the the scientists are not completely to blame there no single case can can prove either that we&#x27;re being visited or even that there is a phenomenon here on earth that we still need to be discovering you you need to i&#x27;ve been trained to look for patterns you know my my background is in artificial intelligence and computer science and you look for patterns whether it&#x27;s in medicine in business you know in in in other fields in physics and one case even as as good as roswell is you know that doesn&#x27;t do it so i&#x27;ve been looking for other cases that can reinforce a pattern and reveal you know what is what is really behind it because the idea that it&#x27;s just e.t coming here that doesn&#x27;t really answer all the questions we have well it seems like there&#x27;s been so many reports over time and it&#x27;s so difficult to find out who&#x27;s telling the truth and who&#x27;s not because many of these are just anecdotal stories they&#x27;re just eyewitness accounts and we know people are occasionally or quite often full of [ __ ] it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just a part of people they lie and they make things up i wanted to put the cap on roswell because what people don&#x27;t realize is that they announced to the world that they recovered a flying saucer there had been a whole massive wave in the 40s and late 40s and this is following the detonation of the first atomic bombs yeah the tests you know the and then the atomic bombs that were dropped on japan yeah so we had the trinity site 1945 and then there were two bombs dropped and that was from the enola gay which was stationed at roswell new mexico in in 47 when this incident occurred they announced and told the truth to the world that&#x27;s a fact they were flying the debris to wright parrison air force base there was no cover-up it was all out in the open with a quick stop in fort worth when they got to fort worth they had a debris filled in their b-29 bomber general uh major marcel gets off the airplane and general roger amy&#x27;s there&#x27;s a flurry of of uh press activity and he says keep your mouth shut let me handle this grab some debris from an everyday weather balloon throws it on the floor he says you keep your mouth shut and they pose with dubose colonel dubose and with major general major rod marcel and general ramey two out of the three people came clean on camera before they died and said that was a fake press conference that was fake debris what we recovered was the initial story that came out was true it was not of this world now what is the current understanding of what happened to that debris the you know in back in silicon valley we&#x27;re sort of i you know there&#x27;s a group of people who are getting really interested in this because we&#x27;ve got new technology to analyze materials and we&#x27;ve got materials from a number of similar incidents um again what we&#x27;re looking for and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard to do okay it&#x27;s only now that we&#x27;ve really got equipment scientific equipment that can can really look at this the the characteristics of uh i mean materials are the same throughout the universe i mean iron from mars is just like iron from you know from the earth the isotopes would be the same ones the isotopes are the you know the the components that define the the orbits of the you know of the atom and what goes into the nucleus of the atom they would be the same ones in outer space when they are on the earth okay what could change would be if somebody was altering artificially the ratio of the isotopes within the elements so it gets pretty complicated uh we are doing with we&#x27;re doing a survey of all the samples that we have from a number of crashes like roswell roswell was not unique it was not unique in new mexico and now we have we have samples from europe who have samples from south america there are a number of people who have started to look at that there were publications by professor from stanford professor sturak 30 years ago about material recovered from brazil where again the the isotopes were measured i&#x27;m the guy who he uh the french volunteered to measure the isotope ratios and i carried that you know that precious little sample to to paris to get it to the people who were doing the experiments the jury is still out uh obviously somebody could take you know common elements refine the isotopes and put them back together um the of course that was done for the atom bomb you know it would between different isotopes of uranium you know and you have to um differentiate between you know which what goes into really making the bomb and now you can buy for medicine for example you can buy radio isotopes in small quantities but they cost you know an enormous amount for a few grams so if we find that some of those samples have been altered that&#x27;s a revolution because it means that there is somebody somewhere either on earth or off planet who has a technology to do that for a particular purpose if we find that that&#x27;s a revolution but did they find that with roswell is there any record of what happened with the wreckage what what was studied what they discovered so uh you have to go in two directions first you don&#x27;t need something you know three feet by five feet to do that you can do it on a few grams okay we&#x27;ve got instruments now new instruments that that were created by some of the people that i work with that can just do it at the biological level you know like almost a level of you know a few a few grams or a few milligrams so uh we&#x27;re in the process of doing that and in fact the book that i&#x27;m preparing is going to talk about that the other thing is you know where would they the big thing go you know we don&#x27;t have the big thing well you know after a few years people talk and again both in silicon valley and other places scientists need to talk to each other and i&#x27;ve had discussions with people who handle that material one of them i can tell you about was a very high level engineering manager in a large company that has research labs in in silicon valley he was asked 30 years ago to look at some material and he described to me what that was and actually he showed it to me the he said it was a matrix of orthosilicates and he could not understand this deep structure i mean he could analyze it in his lab he was a man who developed the magnetic coating for disks and tapes so i don&#x27;t need to tell you how many billions of dollars of business those companies that he worked with you know made based on his patents so he he had a good lab and he he was able to do the analysis he could not understand the deep structure of that material now the the problem that the people who have those vehicles have is they will because it&#x27;s top secret they have to compartmentalize everything so one company would get the material another company might get some descriptions of maybe the beings another company might get some something that looks like fiber optics or electronics so they wouldn&#x27;t but only a few people would be able to put all the information together that&#x27;s not a good way to do research it&#x27;s not a good way to to do science we&#x27;ve got to get that stuff to the scientific community and open it up well this this is uh what bob lazard said about working at area s4 that that was the problem they were having one group was working on propulsion the other group was working on metallurgy but this material that this gentleman had seen where he couldn&#x27;t identify the structure what was that and where was it from it was from a crash from a crash where he didn&#x27;t tell me he didn&#x27;t tell you no but they had and he had gotten it through what method uh he had been asked on the secret project to do the analysis so this had been something because the government had brought into the lab that was unique in the united states and you know that was he was the appropriate guy is it possible that this could have been some material that was created by a foreign government that has an extremely advanced understanding of these materials if it had been that material would have been used by now and we&#x27;ve never seen that material again and what year was this when he did the study um i don&#x27;t know when he did the study uh he&#x27;s dead now so he&#x27;s not going to be right yeah and because this is all top secret this you know look in in silicon valley people from different companies and so on get together and they you know they they look at things together if they trust you you know because then you need to get different minds on the same on the same page right and then so um that conversation was over 20 years ago i&#x27;ve never forgotten it i had another conversation with a military man who is you know retired now who told me that he was brought in to a large hangar where there were pieces of things that looked like a vehicle and there was a wing that would have been you know the size of this table and he could he could lift it with one hand it was again very light you know like what james was saying about roswell extremely light material that was very very strong but still today we don&#x27;t have anything like that we&#x27;ve got fancy titanium things and so on but he was he knew what technology went into you know our advanced aircraft he was with the air force and he couldn&#x27;t believe that he could lift that entire metal little surface with one hit so what is the current speculation on where the wreckage from roswell went like as far as people know what people do talk like clearly if there was some material that was recovered that was from an alien spacecraft it must be somewhere it would well typically the the way you know a secret project works if you look at other projects that we we know now how they were handled like the submarine on the russian submarine that was recovered and it would go to different places because you you&#x27;d send different parts to the best experts absolutely the best world experts in those people you already have under contract and you might not tell them you know where it comes from you might tell them this is something you know one of our guys got this out of czechoslovakia you know we think it&#x27;s russian stuff from a mig you know and uh why don&#x27;t you analyze it they would they wouldn&#x27;t necessarily tell you that it comes from a ufo right whatever ufos are ask jacques where the bodies are okay but hold on this this does anybody is anybody speculating as to where the material from roswell is like is there is there a legend is there a rumor not something that would pass you know that the scientists would really really look at um you know in in the 40s there there was you know there were people working on advanced materials for ultra light aircraft for rockets uh you know the the transistor people say look at the transistor we must have gotten this from the aliens well the pattern for the transistor is a german pattern from 1934. you know the german scientist discovered the transistor effect and he described it and but nobody nobody had any need for that i mean there was no electronics in 1934. so nobody really had any need for it and then the electronics was in glass tubes and so on so that that was rediscovered you know by uh at the labs by the people who patented the transistor yeah that was one of the big ufo conspiracy theories was that some of the technology that was recovered from roswell was used and back engineered to create transistors and they did this at bell labs and there was a company called the american computer company that had a whole website dedicated to explaining where some of the technology that we currently use came from they had the they were all in on this conspiracy that it came from roswell i don&#x27;t i i don&#x27;t think you would find too many people in silicon valley who would believe that because they you know some of the people from their labs you know came west and some of them are still alive and they would tell you how it happened and if you when you look at the old films the old movies from bell labs you know you can you can see what they were doing and it it&#x27;s kind of laughable i mean it it&#x27;s you know high school physics you know hooking up the thing with big wires and so on and this was not really advanced stuff but they they they understood the transistor effect which was known since the 30s it was not and it was not new science it was just something that had never been you know required there was no application for it to develop because they you know the amplifiers worked fine you know and there was no real need for it when there was a need then they started working on that that&#x27;s one of the big rumors so right is the transistor well that was one of the fibers fibers you know fiber optics kendall carso who was is someone i you know respect and admire revealed that he was in charge for the army of getting he got a lot of and somebody gave him a you know cardboard box literally full of stuff that came from places like roswell and they were fibers and when you put a light at one end you know the light would go to the end of the fibers well that effect has been known you know in physics for a long time so again that&#x27;s not that doesn&#x27;t prove anything i had that conversation of course so i spent two days with him thanks to mr bigelow you know he we brought him to las vegas to you know talk to the the science board uh of uh of bigger aerospace and and then i had some private conversations with him about some other things that were not in his book but the fiber you know i told him frankly you know fibers glass fibers were known before world war ii uh people used them for in in lab work and so on so that&#x27;s not really no reason he said look i you know i&#x27;m not a scientist you know i i&#x27;m a military guy but i was asked by you know the head of the lab to preserve this and to and what he did is to give it to different labs you know give it to mit give it to i don&#x27;t know but tell give it to a few others and what happened when he did that i don&#x27;t know what happened i interviewed colonel corso do you believe him yes okay so i interviewed corner corso on camera in 1997 in roswell it was right at the 50th anniversary of the roswell event there was a lot of hoopla around around what had happened and he told me on camera a that he saw these bodies that he assumed were childlike with these big heads and eyes you know in a warehouse somewhere but he described the materials what he said to me and i&#x27;m not saying this is true or not but what he said to me was that they were shocked at the lack of provisions on the craft that the bodies had no reproductive organs uh slits for mouths no vocal cords there were these little pen-like things that laser turned out to be later turned out to be lasers and there was this filament stringy stuff that was later to be determined to be fiber optics and that the material had this uh you could crumple it up with light as a feather and then it would re-gain its original form um that&#x27;s what he told me on camera and he i think he died a year later he told that also to paula harris who traveled with him you know in europe and published his book in in italy and other other languages his english book was censored by the publisher and he he died really i mean he was given the you know the proof um he had 24 hours to check the proof he didn&#x27;t check everything he didn&#x27;t have time and there were parts that were missing and and parts that he had told me fortunately you know i can testify to what he told me but the um you know a lot of what he knew wasn&#x27;t in the book that was published in the u.s it&#x27;s in books that were published in other languages you know thanks to paula to paula hearst who preserved all that but there was you know still at that stage you know there was some you know some tricks being played not to get all the information out and this is something clinton looked into when he was a president right the president wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be cleared that&#x27;s hilarious to i mean to number one i i obviously i don&#x27;t know the facts but you would think that if you could contact top office of the united states that you would get access to that but i guess because it&#x27;s transient because they&#x27;re in and out it&#x27;s not a matter of curiosity it&#x27;s a matter of um need to know and you also want to protect the president and also the president changes every four years yeah and also there are three different classes of of uh secrets you know there is there are secrets that are under the control of the president there are secrets that are under the control of the state department that have to do with foreign intelligence that don&#x27;t go through the same channels and then there are the atomic secrets and the the clearances for you know over the years i&#x27;ve occasionally been cleared i was cleared for the best project under you know under mr regular mr bigelow the uh but the the the clearances for atomic secrets are the p clearances the q clearances the r clearances they are completely segregated from the kind of clearances that we had as part of the the the the bass project or the atip project so those people would not have been cleared for some of the scientific information and i think we&#x27;re getting to the point where we need to somebody needs to open up the doors and the windows and get the scientific community involved well it does seem like there&#x27;s more openness now from the penthouse right there was the one person who who worked at the the pentagon uh that was saying that there&#x27;s they&#x27;ve recovered crafts that are off-world vehicles not from this earth like that was a that was a direct quote and then these photos that supposedly exist now from this new article that&#x27;s out that are top secret but people are trying to get these photographs released the general public that show this triangular ufo this but just these kind of statements and just the release of the go fast video and the other videos uh from the um the uh the gimbal video that that show these vehicles that are being observed by these fighter jet pilots that are watching these things in real time going holy [ __ ] what is that and you get to hear their words you get to see the video you see the actual object jetting across the the you know the surface of the of the ocean and they don&#x27;t know what it is and they&#x27;re trying to figure it out while they&#x27;re watching it um that&#x27;s never existed before there&#x27;s never been this much openness so there&#x27;s a new level of at least admitting that there&#x27;s an issue that there&#x27;s a phenomenon that didn&#x27;t exist before you&#x27;re talking about the us yes in other countries people have been a lot more open yeah including russia you know i mean and in certainly including france i mean there was one one incident 1978 a mirage you know a guy flying a mirage a full colonel french air force the mirage doesn&#x27;t have any weapons it&#x27;s just coming in to dijon you know dijon where the mustard comes from okay well they happen to have you know a base an atomic base there and they have the mirages are fighter bombers they can take they can take nuclear ammunition uh he was unarmed he&#x27;s flying at you know late afternoon early evening uh no problem he sees a light at his two o&#x27;clock position bright light doesn&#x27;t know what it is gets bigger he thinks he sees a structure behind the light but he was never really sure you know there seems to be an object there solid object but the the the light goes around him and stops up on his tail which is a kill position you know in for a fighter for a fighter jet he doesn&#x27;t like that it takes evasive action which he wasn&#x27;t prepared to do i mean he didn&#x27;t have you know special suits or anything he dives uh the object starts moving again goes around him makes a 360 degree circle at high speed at and he can&#x27;t believe it i mean that number one there couldn&#x27;t be a pilot because a pilot could be crushed but there is nothing that can move that fast and the thing is back on his tail he has to dive a second time okay he lands in dijon writes a report the report would probably not have come out except that there was a there were a number of people on the ground who saw this happen saw the whole thing and there was a journal you know who was the french police and a branch of you know parallel to the french police who wrote a report and that report was public so they interviewed they found the pilot they interviewed him i mean there is no question that happened and this was 1978 so i mean what else is new okay that we&#x27;ve got those things well what&#x27;s new is we have footage you know and some of the footage that james had in this you know in his movie uh that actually proves it but actually you know footage doesn&#x27;t prove anything because you can fake the camera but when you have people the the pilots themselves and the footage and the instrumentation and the radar i mean that thing was tracked on radar that saw the whole thing you know uh you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t really do that to a nuclear bomber would you have something yeah so this is a breaking story and uh former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence christopher mellon uh literally sent this to me about 15 minutes ago and he wanted me to read it verbatim so i was going to read this it&#x27;s pretty startling stuff so i&#x27;ll read it in the last 48 hours the public has learned of two stunning incidents captured on film by u.s navy carrier pilots earlier this year one of the cases features a photo of a bizarre flying sphere and a black cube inside that is identical to dozens of other reports by navy pilots these strange objects have been shadowing east coast naval ops since 2015. they sometimes maneuver in formation and have occasionally been reported achieving supersonic speeds the other incident produced a stunning detailed photograph of a massive triangular shaped vehicle that emerged from the ocean and flew vertically straight up and out of sight just past a navy f-18 operating off the u.s aircraft carrier these iphone photos taken by the pilots should be released to the public as there are no sources and methods to protect and the national security benefits of raising awareness regarding this issue vastly outweigh any conceivable benefit from concealing the information it is hard to believe that in the face of such radical and incredible technology within our vast defense department the only we only have a so-called task force consisting of two individuals with no budget who are still being off are stiff armed for access to relevant and timely information by the air force and other security organizations by comparison 60 years ago in response to sputnik america entered the space race which led to landing on the moon our government needs to wake up and address the far greater technology gap that these and many other incidents are revealing there is obviously a glaring strategic mismatch between the current task force and the technology that has been identified why did he send you this because he felt the developing story and he wants people to be aware that there&#x27;s really compelling evidence right now photographically that needs to be released and so you told him you were coming on here and that&#x27;s when he sent it to you yes and he said that these people need to feel some pressure um they need to they need to know that we are requesting not demanding but requesting further government transparency on this issue and he&#x27;s very passionate about it he knows of these photographs the governments we got the story i think it was yesterday and the government is refusing to release these photographs the pilots want these photographs released the people involved with the incident want the photographs released and so we he wants the public to know that these photographs exist and that they should be released and they&#x27;re currently in the possession of uh he wouldn&#x27;t reveal that he knows the person but but he said that the government is not wanting them released and he feels that they that we have a right to these photographs and there&#x27;s video that came with this story as well well remember this comes from the very guy who uh was strategic christopher mellon in getting those videotaped evidence from the cockpits of those f-18 fighter jets off the east coast as well as off the west coast in 2004 2015 and ended up with that big story on the front page of the new york times in 2017. yeah see that that&#x27;s a new thing because if you went to like 24 or 2004 when this all happened no one was really talking about ufos in a serious manner like it was still something that would be mocked and ridiculed but to have it on the front page of the new york times and to have this spokesperson for the pentagon say that they&#x27;ve recovered off-world vehicles not from this earth not made on this earth like this is a this is a change right a really i mean even though it doesn&#x27;t receive that much public attention because it&#x27;s all happening during a pandemic and everyone&#x27;s just and also the news cycle today is so bizarre something gets into the news cycle and then it&#x27;s gone tomorrow because some new scandal or people find out ellen&#x27;s mean or whatever it is there&#x27;s always something new that&#x27;s coming out and these these things though they seem to it seems to be there&#x27;s more of them and more of them coming out and with each new story that comes out people feel more emboldened to tell their story you know i think personally everything changed in december of 20 2017 when that page a front page the new york times revealed that secret a tip program and i know personally because i&#x27;ve gotten ridiculed for decades for the work i do a lot less so recently people are suddenly raising an eyebrow going wow there&#x27;s clearly something more to this and just you know radar weather balloons and and misidentified aircraft jimmy pull up the video of that&#x27;s in that article there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s an actual youtube video there&#x27;s two ones from 94 ones from 2013.</p>
<p>let&#x27;s go with the 2013 one um but these uh videos are very strange you see these this object what&#x27;s interesting too is that okay this is the one that i didn&#x27;t see but that this thing the way it moves and behave the one that&#x27;s from i guess it was from the 94 one this is the 2013 one this is the one from puerto rico so it&#x27;s just kind of cruising across the sky it&#x27;s hard to track here in this black and white there it is does it estimate how fast this thing is supposedly going it looks like they were near uh some sort of like military base or something and on aguadilla which is like the west coast so weird to see like it&#x27;s not clear what this thing is so one of the things that i think it&#x27;s really good to establish go i&#x27;m sorry but go go further ahead in this video to see if maybe there&#x27;s a better version of it or a better sort of check the other one has a little clear video yeah there you go that&#x27;s much clearer like what is that well that&#x27;s not a bird like yes moving through the clouds one of the things i wanted to make a distinction of is the technology the observed technology that these guys are talking about so you&#x27;ve got objects with no wings no visible means of propulsion the ability to hover accelerate from a standstill to out of sight in the blink of an eye right angle turns at high speed and fly rings around our fastest jets that is the technology that cannot be confused or explained away is something conventional so anytime you see an object like we&#x27;re looking at here if it performs or exhibits that technology maybe it shoots off at high rate of speed does the right angle turn at high speeds no wings no tail no propulsion no sonic boom almost no sound that&#x27;s and they&#x27;re trying to get a close-up on this thing so you get a better idea what the shape is it&#x27;s very hard to tell but this these objects also one of the weird things is it moves around the same way commander fravor described that thing moving around that was hovering over the ocean that it kind of darts around left and right right and left almost like it&#x27;s just not connected to what whatever our atmosphere is it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s moving into this weird zigzag sort of a way this is an infrared image right it&#x27;s not visible it&#x27;s not a normal camera i don&#x27;t know i don&#x27;t know what it is is that what it looks like it&#x27;s the same type of camera that as he went from the nimitz so you&#x27;re looking at the heat signature you&#x27;re not really looking at the visual picture right so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not not you cannot get a clear definition of it well they need better cameras so did you go further along in the video it does uh they do get a better view of it there there&#x27;s there you go like what the hell is that you know that was one of the uh more startling moments of producing the film the phenomenon for me was when i met with senator harry reid who spearheaded the atip program the advanced aerospace threat identification program that wound up on the front page of the new york times um i wasn&#x27;t quite sure when i met with him how where his comfort zone was and so i was really kind of cautious for the first half an hour of the interview but then i started we started to relax and and get more comfortable with each other and i decided to kind of push it a little bit and i said hey uh senator i uh met with gordon cooper who later became mercury astronaut who told me on camera that there was a landing incident that took place at edwards air force base circa 1957 where they happened to have a camera crew out near the dry lake bed capturing the installation of a new landing facility for f-86 fighter jets and it was broad daylight and all of a sudden this disc appears out of nowhere and the camera crew turned their cameras on it and they filmed the landing of this flying saucer on the dry lake bed at edwards air force base and i&#x27;m telling this story to senator reid thinking you know i don&#x27;t know how he&#x27;s going to react when i but this is what i was i have him on camera and uh and he said he has the film footage developed it was good footage he held it up he looked at it it was a disc you know blah blah blah and uh eventually he gets a courier jet from washington dc that flies in pick up the footage senator reid goes and it was never seen or heard from again and i said yeah exactly and i said did you guys uncover stuff like that he goes oh yeah it&#x27;s all there it&#x27;s we we have it it&#x27;s all there and then he goes to change the topic and talk about something else and i said well hold on senator uh are you saying that there&#x27;s evidence that hasn&#x27;t seen the light of day and he looked at me and he kind of pauses and he picks up his water bottle he drinks a sip of water and that that that moment seemed like an hour but it was probably just a second or two and he puts his water bottle down he says i&#x27;m saying that most of the evidence hasn&#x27;t seen the light of day so that that for me was such a powerful moment because i&#x27;m going look at who this is coming from this is the former head of you know senate majority leader harry reid saying that the vast majority of evidence hasn&#x27;t seen the light of day and if the president of the united states can&#x27;t get access to it as i found out when i interviewed all the people around president clinton who can who has the authority to have this stuff released and that&#x27;s something that i would love to know and i&#x27;ve been trying to find out so someone does someone in some position of government or some intelligence agency someone in the pentagon someone or some group at the highest level of clearance has access to this information and knows about it absolutely senator reid said they uncovered all this stuff during the program and he said the level of resistance that he got from the intelligence agencies was insane like i mean they did not want this project going forward at the pentagon but they pushed and they pushed and they pushed and they got it through it started in 2007 it went all the way up until it ended up on the front page of the new york times in 2017. and of course now we know there&#x27;s another project but jacques do you know who has the authority to release this stuff to the general public no no not not in in this particular case where are the bodies from roswell i don&#x27;t know i mean you know all you have are rumors you know uh walter reed hospital in the basement you know i i can&#x27;t get to the basement of walter reed hospital have you ever talked to anybody that&#x27;s reputable anybody that you believe seems to know yes well you know there are physicians in the uh you know who with clearances who have tried to to get that information and to my knowledge because i don&#x27;t they don&#x27;t need to tell me everything but um if there was you know if there is material evidence like the kind of thing i&#x27;ve got okay that witnesses have given to me you know that i went went out and dug it up okay so i know where it comes from okay but if we found that it was really very strange even beyond our ability to manipulate the isotopes that still doesn&#x27;t prove that there isn&#x27;t somebody who is smarter than we are somewhere on earth making that stuff okay so i still couldn&#x27;t stand you know at the academy of sciences and say look this this proves it but if we have bodies i i would think that if if that they have a different structure from any organism that we know you know from biology on earth i mean uh i would have to think that would be a revolution the strange thing instantly i mean yes people would be confronted with it the strange things that the iconic image of an alien seems consistent that&#x27;s one of the weird things is that there&#x27;s different versions of aliens that people claim to see but the iconic close encounters are the third kind large head large eyes yes very thin body with no musculature no genitals that all seems to be very consistent correct yeah like the african landing case and yeah zimbabwe in 1994. that is a crazy part of your documentary because you see these children that are going to school in africa this thing lands and then they draw pictures of it the children are all consistent and then 20 years later they all meet and talk about it again and now when people lie a lot of times when people lie when they&#x27;re making up a crazy story like being abducted by ufo they want to be special they want to be different like i was the one they chose there&#x27;s none of that from these kids they all have the same story they all have the same you know they didn&#x27;t have the best drawing skills but they all drew something that&#x27;s incredibly similar it was all a classic looking ufo flying saucer type vehicle and a classic looking iconic creature that is just like the close encounters of the third kind they all describe something that looked like it was wearing a black wetsuit they all described something that had large eyes and a large head for its body i was doing my first documentary back in 1997 when i was just naive enough to think i can get an interview with steven spielberg we had a mutual friend involved this woman janet and she gets back to me and she&#x27;s like yeah so spielberg&#x27;s definitely not going to meet with you but he knows you&#x27;re working on this ufo documentary he thinks you should look into this landing case that happened in africa at the school and i said to myself at the time and remind you know remind you guys that i was making a film on ufos and i dismissed it so quickly because i thought there&#x27;s no way that a mass landing with the sheer volume of eyewitness testimony at a school in broad daylight could happen in the whole world not know about it so i just walked away from that story for about 10 years 10 years later i&#x27;m doing an event at the national press club with with leslie kane who was part of the article in new york times that came out in 2017 and she introduced me to this guy randall nickerson and she&#x27;s like oh he&#x27;s working on this landing case in africa long story short uh he&#x27;s working on a film uh now i think it&#x27;s coming out next year specifically on just that case dan farah is producing it and he said um i&#x27;m working on the case and and if you want to do something with me on it a small piece i could so i got back into it i licensed some of the footage that dr john mack the harvard psychiatrist that came and interviewed the school children on camera within a week of it happening he unfortunately looked the wrong way in london got run down by a car and died so i contacted the institute with the help of randall nickerson i licensed the archival footage we tracked down the witnesses today we flew them in from all different corners of the world brought them together a lot of them were standing right next to each other these they came face to face and one of the things i realized was that there were roughly 100 kids in the playground broad daylight aerial school rule zimbabwe 1994 and they got within arms right armed some of them with an arm&#x27;s length of these beans and brought these witnesses together for the first time in 20 years and a lot of them hadn&#x27;t even told their their you know significant others just because they said they were tired of having to defend this and i myself didn&#x27;t believe it when i first heard about it back in 1997 and that segment of the film is the most in my opinion is the most powerful segment very compelling you&#x27;ve got all these children saying what they saw on camera after it happened and then you see them 20 years later and then we go to africa and we meet with the headmistress she was a teacher at the time we went with other witnesses we go to the landing site we talk to people at the school that case is absolutely and it was witnessed by lots of other people in and around the area for several days before it chose a school to land it&#x27;s so compelling because the children are all clearly they&#x27;re not actors so as they&#x27;re adults later they&#x27;re all talking about this moment and it&#x27;s like they had a religious experience together like they&#x27;re all sharing it and talking about it and you could tell it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s a deeply moving experience if if they were actors they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do such a good job because to convey the reality of that moment to them to to to to be able to have this interpretation of this event where they&#x27;re all consistent in the story and they&#x27;re all clearly still shook by this moment it&#x27;s really interesting because if you had that scene in a movie it would take like a really good actor to pull it off and they&#x27;d probably need multiple takes they&#x27;d probably want to get the best one but those kids the way they were talking about it the way they were drawing it you&#x27;re like wow it really does seem like something happened to them i i know how credible that the testimony of the children is because i i my partner rebecca she&#x27;s never had much of an interest in what i do making documentaries on on ufos i do other things as well but when i was reviewing in the studio uh the archival interview of the children she just dropped off a cup of coffee and she stopped and went oh my god those children are not lying this is the most amazing thing i&#x27;ve ever seen because look i ask your audience to don&#x27;t take it from me just suspend judgment for a moment and imagine hypothetically if a ufo or several ufos landed at a school in broad daylight in rue zimbabwe africa and interacted telepathically with nearly 100 schoolchildren not all of them had telepathic but seen the incident how significant of a story would you give that well not only that they had the same message yes but the telepathic message was that technology is a real problem yes and there&#x27;s things that people are doing with technology that are going to ruin the earth yes and they were trying to relay this to children which is very strange you know i mean maybe they just thought they were adults because they were the same size as the aliens i mean do you think they knew that they were children do you think they understood that it was a school i mean this is all speculation yeah right but no i definitely had to ask myself look during the production of the film paula harris actually turned me on to another landing case that happened in australia in 1966 at a school and this time there were roughly 300 witnesses that saw a disc land right outside a playground in australia and we went to australia and investigated that case went to the landing site talked to eyewitness testimony people that jumped the fence at the school playground and ran over to where this thing landed and then we even interviewed a guy who snapped a photograph of a disc a polaroid back in 1966 two days prior to the incident so it&#x27;s very uh probably that we have a photo we have photographic evidence we have uh eyewitness testimony and for the first time we&#x27;ve got testimony from a science teacher so why do these things land at schools it seems like and i&#x27;m just totally speculating here but it seems like if if i were going to do that it seems like a pretty benign environment we&#x27;ve had testimony from military guys that we take a fairly hostile position towards things that penetrate sensitive military installations and you know so maybe i&#x27;m just saying maybe maybe stay safe you may be safe we have to stop reacting to uh you know intrusions by ufos as a threat i mean that&#x27;s a whole thing behind this new task force and as much as i respect you know the task force my colleagues and i want to cooperate with them to the extent that we can bring information or resources to to what they do but there is more this is not should not be looked at specifically as a threat i mean with with the phenomena that we observe i mean if they wanted to blow up those f-18s they could do it okay the obviously that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s all about and this idea of just labeling it all as a as a threat because it&#x27;s unknown that that&#x27;s a wrong idea 90 of information comes from the public comes from children comes and very very little of it is made up you know in france i mean the the data would we get you know with at the french space agency comes through channels where if people reported something that&#x27;s found to be untrue they&#x27;re going to be called by the police and you know they may they may have some penalties associated with that now you said that they can blow them up but there&#x27;s never been any evidence of a ufo attacking anything right like the thing that there has been really yes what would have been people killed apparently for no reason very rare though where where was the 10 12 cases there are you know i spent i went to brazil four times and i got to know brazil and the data there pretty well and i spoke to people in the armed forces people in the brazilian you know air force and the police there have been a number of cases where people died and where witnesses died and also cases where witnesses were chased through the jungle by objects with beams and i was really interested in those beams because those beams were extensible well it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard to make an extensible if you turn on a light or a laser you know it&#x27;s going to keep going it doesn&#x27;t go 10 feet and just stopping me there those beams stop which means it&#x27;s not just light it&#x27;s something else and also they they will pin you to you know a hammock for example some of the people who are asleep you know hamak they wake up and they see this light and the light comes down and pins them to to the bed or to the hammock and it i&#x27;ve published pictures of injuries with people sustained as a result of those beams so you know this is at least a demonstration of the you know of a power that number one we don&#x27;t quite understand the technology and number two we don&#x27;t understand why that is and you&#x27;re of the opinion that these things might not be from another planet that it could be they&#x27;re interdimensional so yes i&#x27;m amazed that you know i mean in the 50s and 60s there was all that science fiction about you know aliens from other planets and so on all these movies so that was okay and frankly when i started looking at the statistics trying to make sense trying to build those databases and do ai on top of it i was looking for you know et extraterrestrials now we&#x27;ve got so much more data that contradicts that things coming through the wall of a bedroom okay as a as a light and the light turns into something else and it has information in it or it has or it turns into something physical you know this is not this is way off i mean these are not just vehicles that come from somewhere else so it could be there are a number of contradictions in there it could be there&#x27;s a number of different non-related phenomena well you know to to some extent i mean we keep saying that the scientists are skeptical and so on that if you look at physics today i mean people will tell you there&#x27;s probably more than there must be more than four dimensions you know of space-time there must be to explain you know uh atomic phenomena to explain quantum mechanics to explain all those things they they&#x27;re there could very well be their theories that are published in physics journals about multiple universes about universes interpenetrating each other maybe channels between those universes there could be you know there could be another universe with a room like this five minutes ahead of us we would never see them we would never detect them there could be another earth five minutes ahead of us in another universe and we physics today authorizes us to think about those things now they they think about those things not because of ufos they they consider it because it makes sense in the theories they have to build to explain what they see in the lab okay in the in the particle labs in the accelerators in detecting all these on all these other layers of of matter of nature but it it implies that this isn&#x27;t just you know not only the other planet but this isn&#x27;t the only universe i was going to say jacques one of the assets that jock brought to this film the phenomenon and he became involved through lee spiegel and you could you know talk in a minute about your reluctance to get involved initially jacques was like okay well i&#x27;ll participate just this one little section and eventually i lured jacques out to the studio and we were editing the film at the end of this dirt road in a very remote area we had a place that had no running water no internet no toilet long story i was gonna get a better space but i just couldn&#x27;t find one and we just got so much work done in this space i decided to just edit the whole movie here but it was a little cabin in in the woods on the on the california coast it was gorgeous full of flowers and so on but no facilitation just electricity some of the time yeah and there were times when you yeah it wasn&#x27;t even electricity so yeah and jacques would say okay i&#x27;m coming out for the weekend he would do these marathon edits with us and he&#x27;d say i got my face paint i got my compass coming out and and one of the first cases i think that you got involved with speaking of beans was sakura new mexico that involved a police officer in april of 1964 this is considered to be the most well-documented close encounter of the third kind that&#x27;s when the witness describes seeing beans associated with the craft in u.s history turns out when jock found out that i&#x27;d already spent five years investigating this case i interviewed the the wife i interviewed his co-workers i interviewed his son his daughter and i went to the national archives and i got all these new documents i revealed some of them in the movie jacques said to me that i showed him this stuff he said my gosh i can&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re doing this case he said i was at wright-patterson air force base in april of 1964 with dr heineck and you were telling heinek take it over about these close encounters cases well about all the cases we had in france that i had in my computer catalog and that&#x27;s when he wanted me to move to northwestern you know from texas my first year in this country was was here in austin so it&#x27;s always fun to come back to austin austin has changed since uh 1962. i can tell you i can testify to that changed since 99 when i first got here and so uh i i told alan you know let me you know look really carefully at the air force files and you&#x27;ve got to have close encounter cases in those days we were calling them landing cases because there were traces on the ground and that&#x27;s where you could do some physics you know if there is there is more than a testimony the guy says something landed in my backyard it left these halls you don&#x27;t have to believe them you can go see the holes you can measure them you can look at the temperature you can look at radiation you can look at all these things so and he said no well we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t have those kinds of cases so i convinced him you know that to let me look at the files and he said look i&#x27;m going to write parefsan you know where project bluebook was headquartered at the foreign technology division which is an intelligence branch of of the air force it looks at foreign materials it was a logical place to put it and what&#x27;s funny is everybody assumes that that project was top secret you know i mean even in the you know the movie production the series now the top secret blue book blue book was never top secret there were a few cases individually that were secret because of that radar was classified at the time but the observation itself wasn&#x27;t classified and in those days i wasn&#x27;t i didn&#x27;t have a clearance and i wasn&#x27;t even an american citizen i had only been in the u.s you know for a couple of years so i uh he said that&#x27;s no problem you know we&#x27;ll get you just a clearance for two days you know to go to to get to the base but the the archives themselves were like you know any french scientists who wanted access could have had access any american scientist and they what frustrated the air force was that you know carl sagan never went there all these all the scientists who said that who pooh-poohed the whole idea of ufos they never went to look at the archives they never looked at the testimonies of the wires at the terry types you know we talked about carl sagan last night and you felt that carl sagan was pressured by ridicule and that was some of the things that he had speculated that actually turned out to be true like water on the moon and possibly even some form of life that existed in the past or currently on mars yes he was willing to they speculate they had interesting discussions between hainac and sagan heineck you know was kept talking about the air force fights and sagan said that um you know if we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve got narada no right looks at everything with radar covering the united states you know completely so if if there are these things norad must be detecting them so heineken said well you know go ask them so sagan went to norad and he went to you know mountain where the headquarters are and the control system yeah cheyenne mountain and he&#x27;s explained that you know i understand you guys must have ufos they said no and he said but you know you&#x27;re tracking everything we&#x27;ve got these people you know heineke tells me it has got these reports about and you know you must have ufo reports you must be detecting something they said yeah but we don&#x27;t call them ufos so we have no ufos it doesn&#x27;t show up in the files somebody says keyword ufo no right doesn&#x27;t have anything so carl sagan said what do you guys call them and we said they said we we call them ucts and he said what&#x27;s a uct and he said doctor it&#x27;s an uncorrelated target and he said how many uncorrelated targets do you get a month they said about ten thousand what does that mean though well that means that that said what he asked he said look we&#x27;re here to look for incoming trajectories of ballistic missiles from russia so if there is one data point system doesn&#x27;t care if there are two data points system starts looking if there is a third one it computes a trajectory if the trajectory looks like an incoming thing for example from alaska over towards montana we&#x27;re going to alert you know the fighters otherwise it could be a flock of birds it could be a weather balloon it could be anything else you know and when we&#x27;re not paid to track 10 000 other things you know where we are here to defend the united states well so who is looking at the other ten thousand well that&#x27;s one thing i was going to say is that you said earlier that you felt that project blue book was fairly transparent but the one of the things that i uncovered when i was investigating this landing case which was a close encounter of the third kind witnessed by a police officer in socorro new mexico in 1964 was that the military was on scene within less than an hour it was richard t holder from white sands uh holloman air force base area he documented the landing prints from the landing gear of the spaceship um the so-called craft documented with photographs yeah they took photographs photographs exist today yeah they&#x27;re in the movie yeah he uh he documents the footprints that corresponded to exactly where the eyewitness reported the on-duty police officer where he saw these little child-like beans they documented all this and yet they downplayed that aspect of the phenomenon they of the encounter so much and i know that because they the lonnies and more the police officers said he was told not to talk about it because it&#x27;s one thing to explain away an unidentified craft it&#x27;s another thing to have to explain away beans on the ground and how did they describe these beings he said they were small child like um there was a teddy images yeah so this yeah so uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s officer lonnie zamora that&#x27;s they placed rocks around the landing gear imprints to preserve the fresh ground traces and then there were four of them those rocks are still here today like you know from 1964 today you&#x27;ll still see those rocks they&#x27;re more in the ground at this point but they documented and i have the diagrams the footprints of the creatures as well so they knew it was a close encounter of the third kind how did they describe the creatures they were there were these tiny little they looked like children and they had white fitting suits on white fitting or tight fit tight fitting white suits tight fitting whites tight feeding white suits and what what i was going to say to you is what were their heads like there were big bigger heads but the description of the beans was that there was only a couple of newspaper articles that came out regarding the beans because the air force wanted to really downplay the fact that it was a close encounter the third kind but that aspect of the encounter leaked out before the off before the military got there to the local newspapers the officer lonnie zamora had cut out those articles describing his description of the beans and he kept them in a black duffel bag which i discovered at his home and i feature those as well in the film but again then you had congressional hearings two years later where you had part people at project blue book quintanilla denying the fact that there was any substantial evidence that would prove we&#x27;re not alone that was a lie and quintanilla lied and dr heineck towed the party line during his entire time but then afterwards he left in 1969 the air force and he&#x27;s founded kufos which basically proves that he believed he did a 180 and he believed that we were not alone well that was he was waiting for a case like that you know i i kept telling him i kept showing him reports from all over the world okay and and he still said i can&#x27;t you know i i i believe those reports i believe we have the same same thing in the us i convinced him of that but he was waiting for a case where he could convince sagan and manzo and you know dr menzel at harvard and his colleagues in in science because he knew those guys and they would believe quintanilla rather than believing heineken and you know the problem at zoccoro was there was only one witness one witness is all the beans but there were a number of witnesses that saw the craft saw the craft yes and there were theories that this was an experimental thing from white sands white sands is you know 30 minutes away and it&#x27;s full of things and there was the other explanation was it&#x27;s a test for a lunar landing you know system and so on it doesn&#x27;t look anything like the the lunar lander and there there was a lunar lander but it was in california it wasn&#x27;t in new mexico egg-shaped craft okay it was white i remember fraver describing a tic tac i was investigating when that story broke i was still working on socorro socorro he described as an egg i don&#x27;t know did we have tic tacs back in 1964 maybe we did maybe pretty close but tic tac egg described it had no wings no tail it had a blue flame but when it got to 20 feet off the ground it went completely silent no exhaust vents no wings no tail had a little insignia on it which we actually show in the film so this is supposedly that&#x27;s a fake that&#x27;s not the real symbol that&#x27;s a fake symbol that was that was uh richard t holder got to the site told lonnie to put a different symbol because they could quickly identify a hoaxer if they were able to we found the real symbol at the national archives that was written in dr heineck&#x27;s own handwriting which i shared with you which is an inverted v let&#x27;s say an a two lines here and one a line across the top it&#x27;s an a it&#x27;s featured in the movie so but that was a fake symbol oh so someone put a you put a fake symbol on it just so to see if people were hoaxing it doc well what he did was he he said to the witness or they did rather they did the it was a good idea actually he said look um let&#x27;s change the symbol that way if there&#x27;s anybody else claims to have seen this thing and they say yeah that&#x27;s the symbol we&#x27;ll be able to quickly identify a hoaxer so that was that was the point behind that that&#x27;s pretty clever yeah it&#x27;s pretty clever did these things the beings the way he described them did they have the archetypal alien appearance of very small bodies large eyes did they have all the characteristics that you&#x27;re hearing from these other he described them as being small child like and then he&#x27;s and then i interviewed the wife unfortunately lonnie had died before i got to him but i got interviews with him that were done earlier on radio but lonnie&#x27;s wife said whatever my husband saw changed him forever he was never the same and he went straight to the church right after it happened i mean the military was on the way to the scene when he was at the church talking to the pastor about this incident but she said it it changed my husband he apparently got eye contact with one of the two beings that was standing at the base of the craft he wouldn&#x27;t talk to high neck until he had gone to the church yeah and spoken to yeah and uh it changed his life it changed heineck i mean at that point heineck came back and said you know you&#x27;re right i mean we have those things and we we have to take it into into consideration so that&#x27;s really the case he was waiting for to to start looking at then there was another landing case that happened in 66 in michigan so two years after the landing case in sequoia and this one was witnessed by police officers and a whole bunch of people in a college and reporters that was the infamous michigan landing and the dr heineck had a huge press conference and explained it as swamp gas he later said it was one of his biggest regrets and then congressman gerald ford who became president of the united states was like so up in arms about this that he was screaming from the hilltops you know how could you it was his constituents and they they pushed for congressional hearings in the united states a lot of people don&#x27;t know that he was up in arms in what way he said he was so real he was so angry at the air force for dismissing his swamp gas that he he pushed for congressional hearings which we had congressional hearings and here&#x27;s the crazy part this is something we realize in the edit studio right at the end of the hearings the congressional hearings in 1966 in washington dc as they were departing the building from those hearings um there are a uf a flying saucer landed at a school in australia on the other side of the world that was happening as they were walking out of the building it&#x27;s crazy it was just one of those things we were wait a minute the time yeah that was does it appear that these things happen in clusters yeah and you know socorro happened yeah the day after heineken and i left the air force base in dayton okay wright patterson we were there for essentially three days okay so we spent the whole day in the vault you know looking at the fives and so on and then then after that we flew back you know both of us flew back to chicago and uh next day phone call from quintanilla to high neck how soon can you be in new mexico and he said why would i go to new mexico he said because something landed in socorro and you were there there it landed when it happened just when we were leaving the air force base and i mean there is nothing you can do about that i mean those are coincidences you know information coincidences that just happen i would love to take this opportunity to any of your audience out there i came across a memos when i was at the national archives regarding quintanilla talking to heinek and quintanilla was very concerned about a film crew that arrived in socorro new mexico shortly after the incident they didn&#x27;t really want him talking but he participated with the film crew and even said to eineck in this memo he goes would be too obvious if i show up there but why don&#x27;t you be passing through to heineck in 1964 or 65 and just find out what the hell is going on why is this police officer us we told him not to talk about it participating with the film crew the film is called phenomenon 7.7 and it was done by a guy named michael musto and um i can&#x27;t remember the other guys i mean it&#x27;s called phenomenon 7.7 empire studios i spent four years trying to find this film if anybody out there knows where they can get their hands on it it&#x27;s color film 16 millimeter of the entire they interviewed lonnie and all the people around him in just months after that incident it&#x27;s the best case in america well you found some incredible footage like the u.n testimony footage it&#x27;s and i i lived through that with him watching you know what what james was doing to try to by any means you know get to the the real actual footage and that&#x27;s incredible we spent my my sister kelly fox worked as an archivist for several years digging up never before seen archival footage and one of them the very man lee spiegel who put on the 1978 united nations event with you and heineck and coin and a handful of others the footage has never seen the light of days it&#x27;s just gone and calmly cooper and gordon cooper and we found that my sister found that footage and it was the one of the pinnacle moments of production this footage that had been missing for 40 years and it&#x27;s in the movie and it&#x27;s color and it&#x27;s clear yes sound is clear it&#x27;s perfect and once we found it it took a year to get our hands on it remember all the stuff we had to go through oh my god your audience&#x27;s eyes would glaze over if i gave you what is it show specifically there was a will you tell us about the event at united nations it&#x27;s amazing but this footage what is this footage that you found show oh well i&#x27;d you talk about the food the film yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a film crew that had a budget from empire studios in los angeles traveled to socorro new mexico shortly after the most uh phenomenon 7.7 michael musto empire empower film studios i cannot find this film you have no idea how hard i found i went and found the guy&#x27;s wife he&#x27;s dead she i befriended her i spent a year and a half getting to know her she finally let me into her husband&#x27;s archives he had all these like storage facilities it&#x27;s 110 degrees with no windows i&#x27;m inside there while she&#x27;s bawling her eyes out because her husband had just died and i&#x27;m digging through all of his stuff i looked through there i contacted the head of the studios i found out where empire studios got bought by other companies i i literally spent the better part of five years i could not find this film but it&#x27;s the best uh documentation of the best close encounter of the third kind in us history so uh and it&#x27;s all filmed in color one of things we talked about last night at dinner is uh betty and barney hill and i told you that angela hill who&#x27;s a top ufc fighter is the granddaughter of barney hill which is crazy and she didn&#x27;t tell me until after the podcast and i was like what like i almost wanted to start our podcast back up again and have her just talk about that i i just wanted to talk about her mixed martial arts career and then that came up and i was like i can&#x27;t believe this is real like you&#x27;re telling me something you&#x27;re related to your grandfather was the most famous abduction story ever him and his wife betty and barney hill the most famous ufo abduction story ever and that was in what year was that 61. yeah september september 1961 in new hampshire yeah and that is a story again that featured the same sort of iconic beings right it was very similar jacques you were there with them you interviewed them well about a a year or a year or so later they contacted me and dr heineck saying that betty thought that she was she had some contact with you know the phenomenon it might manifest it might happen again and she wanted to do sort of an experiment so they had some land close to a a big lake where they had a little summer summer place and so heineck couldn&#x27;t go there and ask me to go there and the betty and barney were there and dr simon who was the psychiatrist from boston who did the hypnosis of both of them separately and really broke the case was was with us and uh so we drew a big you know circle in the grass and i had a telescope with little telescope with me i had a little table set up and spent the night there waiting for ufos and fighting mosquitoes because you know the time of year in new england you&#x27;re going to get mosquitoes we didn&#x27;t get any aliens but we had a lot of time to talk and and the next day spent the next day with betty and barney and went through the the whole thing we listened to the tapes again and you know the tapes are terrifying and there is no question i mean people are coming now saying well maybe it was a test maybe they were you know maybe there was a psychological experiment that&#x27;s not true i think these people were their story checks out completely from beginning to end and i took dr simon aside and you know there are lots of stories of people being regressed hypnotically by whoever you know but dr simon was you know a psychiatrist during world war ii for the army and he was an expert in hypnosis and he was a licensed hypnotist he wasn&#x27;t just some ufologist who decided to hypnotize people which is very harmful by the way i don&#x27;t know why people allow that to happen to them so i i took him aside and i said doctor if i had been sitting there in their car on the back seat and here is bonnie and you know driving and bedding next to him and they see that would i have seen the car stop and all these little beings and the ufo you know stopping them on the road and dragging them out and he said i i have no way of answering that i can tell you that by the the hypnosis that my patients are telling the truth as they experienced it i cannot tell you what we would have seen if you and i have been there i cannot make that jump and i&#x27;ve never forgotten that you know i mean there could be a type of experience that some phenomena induce that you know just are not reproducible and that&#x27;s you know that&#x27;s the toughest type of testimony you know and how do you make sense of it even if you have physical data you know you you know the car did stop you know you know you still i have never forgotten that that dialogue with him a little over a decade later you have travis walton snowflake arizona let&#x27;s before we go to that i have a lot more questions yeah so when you we say this that if you were there you might not have experienced it are you saying that like this this could have been something that they only experienced that maybe even witnesses would not have seen that this could have been unique only to them like they were chosen for this experience they were abducted and i&#x27;ve spoken to quite a few witnesses who said that their car stopped on the road is a case you know two years ago in france that i investigated again the witness didn&#x27;t report it to the french authorities because you know witnesses don&#x27;t want to be laughed at i mean so they they think it&#x27;s useless because the scientists are blocked they will never look at it so they they just keep it to themselves but what happened is uh she was in a car with with two uh teenage girls one you know her daughter and the daughter of of another family and they were driving and they saw this thing and and they i i asked her did you did you uh see any other cows and she said no and well this was an expressway in france in broad daylight there must have been other cows and that that often happens you know they suddenly all the sounds stop you know the birds don&#x27;t sing anymore there are no dogs barking you&#x27;re in the countryside you know everything it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a bubble around you and this thing happens you have an experience and we know there were other cars on that expressway i mean there&#x27;s got to be and it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s an isolated thing that time outside of yeah as if there was another time and space so you&#x27;re looking at perhaps a phenomenon that we will we just don&#x27;t have the capability of understanding right but you know it&#x27;s a gold mine for science i mean this is why we need to get the academia you know involved anecdotal descriptions just look at the right you know the the fighter you know pilots and say well it&#x27;s a threat because it went around the fighter pack you know how many experiences like this though are are similar where people have these similar stories where out of nowhere hundreds everything you can talk to any of the groups that gather that that kind of data around the world and it&#x27;s similar in that everything stops yes and so what with this constant really one of the constants so what this might be describing is some sort of an ability to control space and time that we don&#x27;t understand this is control dimension consciousness human consciousness long enough to create an experience and that&#x27;s what you know dr john mack you know i got to know him quite well i read his book many years ago yeah well his book passport to the cosmos is a an homage to passport to magonya which was my book of many years ago we had those conversations and his take on it was he he did a lot of hypnotic regression as a psychiatrist with alien abductees the thing that was disturbing to me about that it was actually recommended to me by my friend maura she read it she&#x27;s like you gotta read this this is crazy these people they&#x27;re all having the same story and she uh she might have even given me the book but when i read it that was the thing that struck me like how similar the stories were they were all of them had a pattern that you could follow and they didn&#x27;t know each other they&#x27;re from different parts of the world yes and that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m looking for i&#x27;m not looking for individual cases you know i&#x27;m a computer science guy i try to look at patterns and things that will take you to the next level of understanding and to take one case at a time i mean what was john mack&#x27;s conclusion after all his years john changed i mean initially he was you know he got interested because there were all these books about hypnosis and so on done by amateurs or people who are not trained in hypnosis and he started sort of retraining himself to do hypnosis he i asked him if he had used hypnosis in his practice as a psychiatrist and he said no he said it you know he had a course in hypnosis of of one week you know but he never really practiced it he&#x27;s relearned hypnosis with some of the ufologists who were hypnotizing people and then gradually found that what they did was very shoddy and was was really completely unscientific i mean there were some of those books they were planting the idea you know uh tell me about the blue aliens that you talked to yeah and you don&#x27;t if you do hypnosis you don&#x27;t lead the witness you don&#x27;t do that and so he got disgusted with that and redid it started to redo it his way and unfortunately that&#x27;s when he when he was killed what was his initial idea about what was going on he he bought initially he bought the idea that these are aliens from somewhere i mean why not and that they are here to probe you know our consciousness to understand humans and then he he gave up on that as he learned as he did more and more interviews and understood more the the process and looked at the data and what did he decide it was after that when he was giving up on the idea that they were being i think he was on a whole new track of of research but what was the line of that research i think he was you know he was coming to maybe i influenced him a little bit but he was coming to my idea that we have to look at more than the extraterrestrials that we see in the movies from the 50s you know from the 1950s that this is not it i mean we need something more complex if we&#x27;re going to get the scientific community involved meaning not just space travel from space as we know not some super rocket that comes here something interdimensional is more more possible and and they are not explorers coming here to pick up a few stones because you know if they&#x27;ve been we have 200 000 you know well described cases so why would you come from and we&#x27;re exploring mars you know now we&#x27;re sending a probe you know we&#x27;re sending a couple of probes to the moon we&#x27;re bringing back the stones but we don&#x27;t do that you know every friday i mean once you&#x27;ve done it you&#x27;ve got you&#x27;ve got it i mean why would you keep doing it so what is what is your speculation what do you think is happening i don&#x27;t see myself as you know the scientists who should speak on that because you know i know too much about the work of teams you know i&#x27;ve worked with many teams in in silicon valley i&#x27;ve financed a number of companies there in in medicine in space research in computing of course um the it takes a team we need to get what what i can do is i i can bring some of the history like you know the socorro thing where i try to help you in in the movie but uh because i i know the history i&#x27;ve met many of these people i&#x27;ve met the researchers i know what they went through you know uh including the air force officers you know i mean they were under extraordinary pressure so i can bring that context and i can i can bring i would know how to put the ai component on top of the files okay but when all these other people would have to work with it to come to ethereum i understand that but about all the years of studying surely you must have developed some sort of an idea of what you think this is well what i&#x27;m i i&#x27;m a student of that material um there is some form of consciousness out there that&#x27;s teaching us something you can i could show you teaching or something yeah they are teaching us something like you know what you have in the movie with those kids i mean i asked that&#x27;s what the kids are saying i asked jacques this exact question i remember where i was when i did it it was in a cafe in silicon valley i was with dr peter sterk regarding some metal stuff and i looked at you and i said jacques you know god can you please tell me what&#x27;s going on and you said regarding government secrecies two points and i&#x27;ll get to yours in a quick second and correct me if i&#x27;m wrong here but you said to me james look at the government secrecy this way it&#x27;s not so much a question of what they know it&#x27;s more of a question of what the government doesn&#x27;t know they can reveal that we have structured craft of unknown origin that that exhibit flight characteristics that are light years advanced from anything we have they have no wings no tail no visible means of propulsion they can go from a standstill to out of sight the blink of an eye so there&#x27;s some reports they can travel underwater at hypersonic speeds they go into space we don&#x27;t know who they are where they come from or what they want there&#x27;s no governing body that wants to disclose that nature of of reality because suddenly and i&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a threat because clearly if it was we&#x27;d know about it that you know we can&#x27;t these fly rings are on our fastest chats we don&#x27;t we can&#x27;t just disclose that kind of information and the other thing you said to me and correct me if i&#x27;m wrong again because this is what you&#x27;re getting at what&#x27;s the bigger picture what&#x27;s going on and you said think of it this way james is an omnipresent intelligence okay that has the ability to manifest itself in a multitude of ways it&#x27;s nuts and bolts but it&#x27;s also psychic that fravor talked about that that object went to his cat point i mean he said it made the hair on the back of his neck stand up straight because those coordinates weren&#x27;t known they explained what you&#x27;re saying to people so this is a stand-alone podcast so they know what you&#x27;re talking about so sorry yeah so david fravor who&#x27;s the navy pilot that had that dramatic encounter with a tic-tac off the coast of san diego um back in 2004 that was also documented with the you know radar and visual confirmation but also filmed on another subsequent flight just moments afterwards but he said that this object first of all reacted to him when he was flying down to to intercept it but then after it flew rings around him and he said it made a joke out of the fastest plane that navy had at the time it went to their cap point which is the predetermined latin longitude strategic point of the military exercise so how on earth he said how on earth could this object know where that point was so what i&#x27;m saying is there&#x27;s a psychic it&#x27;s a nuts and bolts phenomenon but it&#x27;s also psychic is what i&#x27;m saying uh a fairly accurate assessment of what&#x27;s going on absolutely what what gives you the impression that they&#x27;re teaching us something well that um you know i could give you a couple of you know quick reactions i mean they&#x27;re appearing to children you know those children are going to grow up and they will remember what they&#x27;ve seen and so on but there is another there is an analytical answer that you know one of the things i did when i had a good good databases filtering out i mean i think we all agree that 90 of the cases are not true ufos okay so uh you know there are things of the moon seen through a layer of clouds all lightning bold lightning whatever all the things that the scientists say yeah that&#x27;s true 90 of it should be removed very very few hoaxes by the way very very few because if you&#x27;re going to come up with a hoax you&#x27;re going to come up with something better you know something better than that that you know you can you can reveal and you can laugh and so this is not it you know you don&#x27;t hoax about something that&#x27;s that terrifying that people can check i started looking at patterns the way you look at patterns in science in other words you take you know you do regressions you do that the phenomenon is not constant it goes through waves um two months or three months over a country like france or over florida or you know japan and it&#x27;s very intense and after about two or three months they go somewhere else or they disappear so you have this this structure and i started looking at the structure to see if it correlated with anything we know so i started looking at it does it correlate with mars you know mars right now is in the sky because it&#x27;s close to us okay it&#x27;s a conjunction you know of of of mars and uh maybe when mouse is closest to us you know uh we can you know it&#x27;s easier for them to come here or something there is something that happens that facilitates what the that broke down okay that correlation didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t quite work and it looked like but it looked like it was almost correlated but not quite and there is something in in psychology called the schedule of reinforcement if you want to teach say a chimp to do something to for example pick up a ball or something every time he picks up the bowl you give him some food okay so you reward every good action works with kids too i mean it works really well with human beings that&#x27;s that&#x27;s why we have advertising but you you reinforce the the action that you want to encourage except that if you reinforce every instance where the the chimp picks up the ball after a while he goes play with something else okay and he forgets the experiment if you if you want to induce a behavior that will stay there forever that will never be forgotten you have to have some randomness in other words you don&#x27;t always reinforce the same thing and sometimes he picks up the ball fine and he doesn&#x27;t get the food and you know so you you make it random and that you know uh that uh the the psychologist who did those experiments was skinner dr skinner published all these experiments and that became gospel for the psychologist a lot of psychological experiments are around that way of reinforcement of behavior and behavior control and that got applied to to a lot of different fields well that&#x27;s what the the schedule of ufo cases if you look around the world not that just one country not just that air force pilots or the navy or something you have to look at the whole thing if you want to see that pattern the pattern is a worldwide reinforcement of behavior the behavior seems to be you need to let go of some of the things you&#x27;re doing and you need to let go of technology that&#x27;s harmful and you need maybe to be prepared to go into space i mean but interpretation where are you getting this interpretation from what what aspect of these experiences is giving you that interpretation places where that reinforcement has taken place and and the appearance of the phenomenon because the phenomenon is just at the border of what we can recognize it&#x27;s a little bit weird but they are basically humanoids i mean they are not monsters with tentacles and so on um they are they are humanoid and the people like you know lonnie lonnie zamora and they they think that there is a communication that they they can look at the eyes of that creature and they they get something you know they they get that reinforcement um i want to say something about the africa case because i was in china a couple times doing filming for the phenomenon and i learned of this landing case it&#x27;s known in china as mong zhao gua and and i didn&#x27;t prep any of the chinese people that i was hanging out with about what i&#x27;d filmed already in africa the landing case and the telepathic message that these beans allegedly gave the children and i got this interpreter was telling me what this landing case in africa 1994 same year in china as in africa and this guy mung jog walk up the same environmental message in china that the children got and i got goosebumps i&#x27;m sitting there going you got to be kidding me and here&#x27;s another crazy part that one of those wow moments in the film i was in africa meeting with judy bates who&#x27;s now the head mistress and she said well come into my studio i&#x27;m going to show you some drawings i keep them in a very special place of what the kids saw that day and she&#x27;s taking these drawings out of these beans and you know this the quintessential big black eyes and big head and and uh and even at one point had these two indicating these two little apostrophes that would indicate some sort of brain telepathic wave going out from the head and uh fascinating i took photographs of my iphone about two months later i was in australia doing the landing case in 1966 and i came across these cave paintings that i was learning about from locals from the juan gina and i saw these drawings that were thousands of years old of the exact same beans that i just saw in africa and i literally had the hair in the back of my neck stand up going wow this is the one tina&#x27;s they were driving these they were drawing these cape how could what is the name of these these photos juan gina juan gina yeah not sure exactly but it&#x27;s australia cave paintings or cave art you&#x27;ve seen the wanjina you did the book on on um ancient day has there been a cataloging of various crafts and various beings and how many versions of them are there like how many versions of crafts have been seen i know there&#x27;s a square that appears inside of a circle there&#x27;s the ones that look like yeah the triangles there&#x27;s the ones that look like the tic tac there&#x27;s the discs there&#x27;s a cigar cigar right i&#x27;ve got video footage of one of those that a guy took and sent to me really impressive do you have it here salida colorado 1995.</p>
<p>tim edwards he can look it up it&#x27;s available somewhere yeah so these are the the what the [ __ ] see look at that one down at the bottom there look at those i mean you said these are from australia those are from australia yeah real similar and i i literally saw the drawings and there&#x27;s one in particular that was just really gave me goosebumps uh and i don&#x27;t know exactly where it is but it had the face and it had these two kind of apostrophe indicating some sort of communication telepathic um just just crazy i mean that&#x27;s what the children had drawn look at those eyes those were thousands of years old thousands of years very strange isn&#x27;t it crazy there&#x27;s there&#x27;s also this thought that human beings will one day be something different right we used to be some sort of an ancient hominid now we&#x27;re this and if you extrapolate if you go from what we used to be we&#x27;re hairy and muscular and you know very ape-like to what we are now which is softer our heads are larger we&#x27;re far more intelligent if it just keeps going in that direction and if we keep with our integration uh with technology and electronics like that we might be something very different in the future and it&#x27;s probably going to look like an iconic alien there&#x27;s a lot of speculation that what we&#x27;re looking at is us in the future and that these things are what we are going to become or what we are if there are multiple timelines that are running simultaneously in different dimensions that these things are what a human being becomes in these other timelines a million years from now a hundred thousand years from now whatever it is you know you guys were talking earlier about the time freezes during encounters this is a little side story i want to tell you about when i brought the children together in africa as adults they had time to process their encounter and you know they were adults they could articulate better they had 20 years to think about it and they said i said put me there i just i want to be there it&#x27;s such an exciting moment to hear from people who got within three feet of a potential beam of another world and they said well if you&#x27;ve ever been out in the remote wilderness and you come across and you have a rare sighting of a wild animal there&#x27;s this moment of intrigue and curiosity almost like time stops and the what you&#x27;re looking at is just as curious and intrigued about you as you are of them and they said that&#x27;s what it was like with these beans that they were literally standing there and the beans were looking at all the children their eyes were scanning just moving and there was this moment of curiosity they did not feel threatened it was a benign encounter but that time had stopped and it was just mystery entry curiosity so with some of my colleagues we decided to go back to you know and then reinvestigate some of the primary cases because they there is something missing in all this we&#x27;re you know we&#x27;re missing some clues and so we&#x27;re about to publish a book called the best kept secret because some of it some of what we&#x27;ve uncovered was kept secret and it&#x27;s still secret even from you know the ufologists who&#x27;ve really researched all that stuff it&#x27;s going to be published you know early next year but we&#x27;re pre you know uh people can pre-order it uh on amazon it&#x27;s called the best kept secret and what we&#x27;ve done is to go back to some of the key cases and some new cases where we found that there may have been some superficial information about it but most of the information was kept hidden by the witnesses now you know we keep talking about cover-up cover-up by the government which is true but the witnesses are not stupid they don&#x27;t want to be you know laughed at by scientists um you know six o&#x27;clock news so they meet give you some report because they think it&#x27;s their duty to report something to the police or the air force and so on but they they won&#x27;t tell you the whole story and if you want to know the whole story you&#x27;ve got to go there which may take a couple of days you&#x27;ve done that and you&#x27;ve got to you know gain their trust and sit in the kitchen and if if you&#x27;re lucky they give you a cup of coffee and you talk and you talk to their kids and you talk to you know and you get to know them and they get to know you and if you&#x27;re genuine if they can see that you&#x27;re not playing any games you will eventually get the whole story and we&#x27;ve been doing that and that&#x27;s what the book is about and it&#x27;s going to change history it&#x27;s going to change the history of the of the phenomenon how so it builds on the human element the human element but house how is it going to change history how is it going to change it that number one the structure of the information is amazing the real structure not just what the police bladder or the you know air force teletype it&#x27;s not necessarily about the object it&#x27;s not necessarily about you know what somebody heard you you&#x27;ve got to look at and we found especially one case that&#x27;s extraordinary people had never had never talked and it came to us and we&#x27;ve been studying it carefully from every angle and then we&#x27;ve been looking for patterns around that case that again that&#x27;s the best kept secret people can pre-order it right but what is what is it about the structure like what is what is so astonishing about the structure of the information that you&#x27;re getting from these these accounts the i mean i do you have to read the book okay but uh well people read the book what you would find was a commonality of um the the structure has to do with the intrusion in the life of someone this is not something that oh by the way i saw flying saucer yesterday you know and now i&#x27;m going about my business the how profound the information goes inside the consciousness even those pilots are changed you know they are changed permanently yeah you know and that the information that the the thing stays with them and you can talk to the witness 40 years later which we&#x27;ve done and it brings back is i mean their memory is completely clear you know they know exactly where they were what they were doing because it&#x27;s such a profound experience right what about the structure of the information that&#x27;s so astonishing that&#x27;s going to change history the um both the the materials and we continue to look at the you have to look at the materials at that at that level not simply that oh goody you know we can take it to the lab and we&#x27;ll analyze it and we&#x27;ll patent it and you know we&#x27;ll sell it as a new weapon which is sort of a you know the stupid way of looking at this these materials are earth materials okay most cases we&#x27;re looking at where the complexity is and where why they were there at that particular time okay that&#x27;s certainly one aspect of it the we don&#x27;t understand why these materials would be associated with an instrument or a vehicle that does what those things do the the situation also is structured in in such a way that it it ties into our culture and you know in most cases there is no anthropologist you know with the team that goes out there whether it&#x27;s a military or scientist or ufologist they don&#x27;t bring in an anthropologist when you when you look at the at the traditions the local traditions when you look you can begin to tie the details of the sightings to what would be in the conscious of i saw that in brazil i mean in in brazil you can&#x27;t just go there and ask people you know to fill out a questionnaire you know about how many degrees to the left of the north pole was it you know it doesn&#x27;t work that way you have to get into the culture and the phenomenon works on the culture at a very deep level i think that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re showing so they&#x27;re taking apart that mechanism these beings are having these interactions with people they&#x27;re teaching these people something and that this is becoming more and more prevalent and we&#x27;re learning something from this experience and the more you have stories like the 2017 story in the new york times the more this comes it&#x27;s almost like a slow trickle effect of getting the information out exa and changing changing our behavior do you think it&#x27;s preparing people for more frequent or more prominent visits i i don&#x27;t speculate i can&#x27;t i can&#x27;t answer that um well one of the things that i&#x27;m very optimistic about is that we&#x27;re living in extremely divided times right now and this is a story that transcends politics transcends religion and borders whether people believe it or not they&#x27;re curious um and i think ultimately when this story is starting to come out and there are people behind the scenes working diligently to get it to come out that it&#x27;s going to have a very unifying effect on humanity i mean i sound like i&#x27;m you know group hug moment here but i actually do believe that it&#x27;ll force us to look at ourselves as who we really are one race one planet and um and that there seems to be this external consciousness that is affecting our evolution somehow and a planet that&#x27;s extraordinarily fragile you know i mean it could be impacted literally physically by a lot of things and and impacted by our stupidity i mean there were three cases in history where the the you know the alert went to go bomb the soviet union i mean three cases where the bombers were recalled because one guy thought this doesn&#x27;t make sense i mean he had image&#x27;s environment he left the compound to go outside and you know sort of readjust and and realized that what he was looking at was a simulation of a russian attack and that the the bombers were up and ready to open the envelope in other words they mistook the phenomenon for a threat for for a threat but everything in the defense establishment is oriented towards a threat if you don&#x27;t have a threat you don&#x27;t need all that that&#x27;s the problem with the way you were describing the way we&#x27;re approaching this phenomenon that we&#x27;re approaching it like it&#x27;s a threat yes and that instead of the military looking at this there should be the scientific community that has access to this information the military has very very good platforms for observation you know like those infrared cameras like the radar like all the sophistication that they have the tracking systems the satellites that&#x27;s very useful but you know i i&#x27;d rather have a cup of coffee with the guy in his trailer who has seen something and can show me the traces in his backyard you know because i can i can do something with that what was going to say is is a you know you look at what they do but you also look at what they don&#x27;t do and and one of the huge moments for me and you could extrapolate on this is when i met with with senator reid he uh kind of accidentally drops his huge bombshell where he talks about uh the most astonishing aspect of the phenomenon as far as he uh determined from atip that sacred pentagon program was that they were not only observed over super sensitive military weapons installations but they were shutting our nukes off and senator reid went as far as to say in a couple of cases that he looked into if the president of the united states wanted to launch he couldn&#x27;t have launched and i interviewed one of these officers colonel robert salas who&#x27;s a launch control officer and during the height of the cold war and he said well the message was pretty clear as far as i was concerned i said what do you mean he goes kind of like them taking matches out of the hands of a baby you know i mean you know it&#x27;s kind of interesting they give these messages to the children look i&#x27;m not saying that definitively one way or the other this is exactly what&#x27;s going on but i get messages to the children landing cases with children then you get these benign encounters and then shutting our nukes off i don&#x27;t know i mean that&#x27;s that has to mean something right well it&#x27;s a powerful it&#x27;s a very it&#x27;s a powerful signal is it a show of force or is it a show of hey you shouldn&#x27;t be playing around with these things or is it both you know for a while i mean we&#x27;re testing those facilities so for a while when i was bringing that up people would say well you know we&#x27;ve got incursions over those platforms to uh to see if the guards are really you know reacting to detecting a threat and so on again the threat but that&#x27;s one thing to fly over a nuclear facility or a storage area where you have nuclear bombs it&#x27;s another to you know overcome the code of the missiles one by one okay and you have cases in in your movie where all the missiles all the silos were turned off one by one you know and as you said if they had wanted to launch they couldn&#x27;t have launched the missiles that&#x27;s not something that you know is just an exercise you know and especially since the russians are the same thing yeah and and this is something that the general public is always because i&#x27;m joe public myself i mean i&#x27;m a guy a civilian that just wanted to get to the bottom of it i found i sort of stumbled upon this thing accidentally and now i can&#x27;t walk away from it because i&#x27;m going this is like the biggest story of modern history i think that every man woman and child is entitled to know this but i would always ask these generals every time i&#x27;d meet with these military guys and i&#x27;ve asked them all around the world why are you guys covering this up and they said look you can&#x27;t look at it that way you have to understand from our perspective we are we are employed by the public to protect you for us to disclose that we have these unidentified objects whizzing around in our airspace with impunity flying rings around our fastest jets you know we don&#x27;t know who they are where they come from that&#x27;s just not in our nature to disclose that to the public you know that&#x27;s going to open up the floodgate to a bunch of questions of which we don&#x27;t have answers so you can kind of justifiably so see why the secrecy has lasted as long as it has but it&#x27;s starting to come out now and um and i think we&#x27;re living pretty exciting times with it all i really do you know i i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve ever mentioned this that to you it&#x27;s a little an anecdote but i had a friend who was one of the early researchers in france so an engineer named michelle was something of a philosopher and he was compiling all these this data and he went to the air force and got the french air force was pretty open at you know with with their cases and uh the man was uh colonel claron i remember his name this was from the mid 60s and they would have lunch you know which is a thing you do in france you know you have lunch with somebody and then you talk and the um he convinced claire juan that you know go to your superiors and find out you know we should tell the public about this and we should open it up you know we should we should tell them this is going on okay and uh claire once said well you know it&#x27;s a good idea uh let&#x27;s have lunch again in one month you know i&#x27;ll tell you what i find out they get to the same restaurant a month later and michelle says what did you find out for from your superiors said it turned out i my superiors told me to go to the americans so i went to the u.s embassy in paris and i talked to my counterpart in the military and uh we&#x27;re not going to open the files and michelle said why not he said well the americans think that there would be it would open up too many things you know that we couldn&#x27;t control that society is not ready that people would be scared people would panic you know the religious ideas would float around people would fight each other about you know what what&#x27;s happening and in in their consciousness and in their faith and in their life and we couldn&#x27;t control it and uh you know they they told us to shut it up how long ago was this 64. 63 64. so the time is ripe it&#x27;s crazy that this has been going on for so long and it&#x27;s so remarkably consistent well if you talk to people on the street you know they&#x27;re not scared of this and the vast majority of people believe that the government knows a lot more than what they&#x27;re admitting well they&#x27;re admitting they know a lot more than they ever admitted before they are exactly and one of the things i really wanted to establish if you&#x27;ll notice i have a very dramatic encounter at the beginning of the film which occurs in 1955. it was with colonel william t coleman who later became public spokes officer for project blue book which is the air force investigatory arm for ufos and you listen to his account of this encounter this really dramatic encounter it started la duration of about nine minutes it started at nine thousand feet it ended at treetop level at what he called maximum continuous power in a b25 bomber over alabama in 1955 and he describes like he had three engineers in the plane with him their treetop level flying flat out and they literally thought they&#x27;re gonna hit this disc and they&#x27;re looking right at it and broad daylight going where are the wings where are the exhaust ports where&#x27;s the propulsion how on earth is this object flying and you listen to his description of it and then you fast forward because we we put it we bookend it to david fravor off the coast of san diego and their description of the flight the the the observed technology is it&#x27;s identical to what was documented in 1955 so we&#x27;re clearly dealing with a with a technology that&#x27;s light years advanced it&#x27;s the same description of witnesses back in the 40s and 50s it&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening exactly today so um i just wanted to i wanted to mention that because a lot of people are like oh clearly it&#x27;s some you know some technology that skunk works we&#x27;re working on i&#x27;m like no no no no this is the same stuff that&#x27;s been going on the 40s and it&#x27;s happening today and but we have to make sure that if there is quote disclosure uh that it&#x27;s not just the next chapter of the cover-up because there are things that haven&#x27;t come out you know like senator reid told you yes on your movie there are things that have not come out that should come out that have been again kept kept hidden uh again from fear that people would overreact or something is there a concern that they haven&#x27;t told their own superiors is there concern that some of it would be disinformation that they would make up some sort of a story to try to cover things up um well i i don&#x27;t know but you could orient it to you know a message that would be both interesting but reassuring superficially and again uh organize it around the threat and you know again that message of reacting to the threat it makes sense for the military but the cases that they are working on are only 10 of the database should look at the other 90 you know uh i interviewed this uh general parvis jafari he was an iranian general had that dramatic ufo encounter over tehran in 1976 and at the time i wasn&#x27;t i was more focused on the encounter itself and how extraordinary it was and then parvis jafari while piloting this f4 phantom jet tries to shoot at the ufo and he suddenly realizes maybe that wasn&#x27;t such a good idea and his controls frees up on him and he has this really dramatic encounter where he talks about he was going to eject the plane and like you know why did i try to shoot at this thing i mean it knew he was about to shoot at it according to him and 10 years after i interviewed parvis jafari just looking for some sort of additional material for the credit roll at the end i found this really powerful statement from parvis and he goes he was reflecting back on the incident and he said my biggest regret was that i tried instead of making peaceful contact instead of trying to make peaceful contact i tried to shoot this thing and i wish i could go back and have tried to make peace it&#x27;s a really powerful statement coming from an iranian general about an incredibly uh dramatic encounter you know um just reflecting back on why is it that we have this this stance of hey anything that&#x27;s unidentified in in our airspace must be seen as a threat and uh we have to go after it and shoot at it i mean that&#x27;s not the kind of contact i&#x27;d like to i don&#x27;t want that representing me you know also i don&#x27;t think it would work very well no and but there have been cases where they shot when they shot what are you iphone someone shot a ufo yeah when 1952 over the white house yeah i almost put this in the movie and jacques and i went back and forth on this for a long time and i&#x27;m so glad you brought this up yeah because i said you had that fight yeah we we kind of did please tell us the story because it&#x27;s amazing you were right to keep it at that level because it um in in the 80s there were congressional hearings not about ufos but about something that i was doing professionally which is building civilian computer networks for crisis management for industrial crisis management and we were funded i mean the company i created was funded to develop essentially the you know the the equivalent of computer conferencing we have today on facebook this was way before the web was invented uh in the again the mid 80s to link together all the nuclear power plants in the major countries five countries including japan when it was against the japanese law to have japanese data outside japan and to for them to be on that network the data had to be on our computer which was in in california we operated that network for three years and this was a closed network it wasn&#x27;t accessible by people outside it was just operated by the international you know uh industry essential essentially of atomic power and we by the way detected a number of flaws and this was after a three mile island accident you know that was could have done a lot of damage and people were scared and they wanted to share the information and we were the essentially the facebook equivalent to that industry so i was asked to testify at the algor hearings on emergency management and i and another little company uh were the only civilians there or the only non-government people there all the others were from you know the three-letter agencies the cia the nro the the other agencies all a fema you know the emergency management administration and so on and that was extraordinary because well the those were the top people who would manage an emergency other than war i mean they told us you know don&#x27;t don&#x27;t even go into the nuclear war thing because even in nuclear war most of the damage is environmental damage which i didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s the amount of dust that kills you it&#x27;s not necessarily the bomb that kills you it&#x27;s it&#x27;s what happens after the after the ball so we were just looking at you know civilian casualties and civilian crises and there i met a number of people who were the people in the government who would be handling you know nationwide of international crises uh like the building crisis the people who had been there in the days of the berlin crisis were there and so on how do you structure the information to get all the people who need to know need to i mean everybody goes inside into a bunker and then the bankers communicates somehow and then you get in touch with other countries you get their experts and then you try to manage the situation okay like you know suppose a big meteorite falls okay it&#x27;s the size of half of chicago you know what what do you do after that okay and government needs to continue one of the people there was an expert who had worked under five administrations managing the structure of crisis management for the us government he introduced me to arthur london arthur londell was a legendary member of the intelligence community he was knighted by the queen of england he&#x27;s one of two or three americans who are knighted and then his buddies at the cia used to call him sir arthur of the light table because a lot of the things he did was with with negatives you know with satellite photographs that were on the light table he is the one who discovered the missiles in cuba and and briefed president kennedy um showed him where where that was and why there were missiles and not just trees you know uh it takes a lot of training it turns out you can&#x27;t just look at one of those pictures and say ah do you know that&#x27;s a missile uh he was the one who told who was sent by the u.s to brief charles ago president the goal about the u2 shutdown over the soviet union and we we became friends and we became friends because i was introduced by the people from the the algor hearings uh they knew what i was working on and he had been a pioneer within the intelligence community in getting all the uh you know he started the the air force&#x27;s image interpretation center in washington for for the navy the air force cia and the other the other places he told me about 1952 he was very interested in ufos because he had seen photographs i mean he was the armed forces photo interpretation center okay epic he was getting all those things he had all the clearances from all these services uh he didn&#x27;t tell me the whole story but he told me number one that those things had been photographed he told me that at the robertson hearings 1953 53. he had the the mariana movie you know he gave it to the committee the committee took it somewhere and analyzed it they said they were seagulls you know when he got the film back the first the first 20 frames were missing from his film it&#x27;s a very famous from the cia film the cia laboratory analysis of the film very famous film footage of the ufos back in 1950 by so let me tell you the level of the cover-up at that point that they would do that to their expert and then we talk about 1952.</p>
<p>it&#x27;s in 1952 the official explanation came from dr menzel at harvard those were inversions of temperature over washington where it gets hot over washington and there&#x27;s photographs of these right uh there was no photograph there was no photographs of what&#x27;s appeared over the white but there were no that there were uh there were you know there was striking radar you know radar tracking of it and the the he interpreted the radar as being in versions of temperature multiple that they they sent of course they sent the air force after it yeah well he said one of the pilots got permission to shoot was authorized to shoot and shot you know a piece of metal out of one of the disks those were disks that were flying they didn&#x27;t care about the defenses they flew over the white house they flew you know over the major facilities in downtown washington that are forbidden i mean there&#x27;s no no of a flight and um so they they had to do something and they shot at it the the thing was recovered the piece of metal the piece of metal was recovered he told me you know i really shouldn&#x27;t talk about what happened after that there is no question that there was a piece of metal recovered from that encounter and that it was shut off you know a flying disc over washington in 1952 and all the explanations that were given to the scientists and to the public were bs yeah yeah i mean we we feature this case in the film and when and we have the guy that was actually in the radar room this guy al chop we had testimony from a gentleman that interviewed him tom tulian back in 1990 something and it&#x27;s very rare extremely rare footage of an interview with the very man who was in the radar room listening to the cockpit listening to the pilot as he was surrounded by ufos right over the you know washington dc white house um capitol building and he was terrified i mean he suddenly found himself traveling at 600 miles an hour through the pitch-black darkness and he was surrounded by unknowns and he literally radios down to the tower and says they&#x27;re completely surrounding me what do i do and they were speechless they didn&#x27;t know what to tell the pilot they could see on the radar all the discs all these ufos around surrounding this plane and jock said well i know and we feature this in the film you probably remember that part um and then jock said well it goes a bit further there one we actually did shoot at them and one of the pieces of the the debris from the ufo fell to the ground it was recovered and where is that piece we went back and forth on whether to include that in the movie and i finally said i kept you know maybe at some point i&#x27;ll be able to tell you where the yeah where it is the the piece but those are the things when would you be able to do it yeah do it now why wouldn&#x27;t you why would you want to wait i i i think some of the you know i i respect the the the need for certain things to be managed in a particular way and it wouldn&#x27;t really add to you know to the story to talk about that in in the book we go you know a lot further in talking about what those materials are you know and what the questions are what the questions are for science but also what the questions are for disclosure if there is over disclosure but there isn&#x27;t going to be one big disclosure that says you know we&#x27;ve got contact with aliens from alpha centauri i mean that these closures come in layers they come you know everybody needs to get around do you know the truth but this piece of metal from the 1950s isn&#x27;t it about time yes so well we&#x27;ve just seven years we&#x27;ve got others i mean we&#x27;ve got plenty of letters you can answer his question in indirectly by that memo the cross memo that you that we did feature in the film and who wrote it he was a metallurgist and what lab was he working at so you know fast forward after 1952 1952 was a disaster for the air force because they realized that their lines of communication which were already a network it was a network of stereotypes were saturated by people reporting ufos including air force bases reporting ufos and somebody thought if the russians were to simulate the ufo thing by throwing you know artificial things in the sky or whatever and they could saturate the communication and we couldn&#x27;t deploy the defense system so we&#x27;ve got to do something about it to reduce the level of reports from the public so they create they call together five of the top scientists in the land uh you know felton page lou alvarez people like that nobel prizes people who knew the nuclear secrets from the days of oppenheimer and so on and they brought them to discuss what what they should do and they be briefed by art lundal that&#x27;s where he lost his 20 20 pictures okay which were the best pictures from the beginning of the film okay you never saw again uh that&#x27;s where highneck testified but high neck was as he says cooling his heels in the antichamber in the lobby and they would only bring him in for a couple of things before the scientists the long story short the outcome was a classified recommendation to explain away most of the phenomena to the public to reduce a number of reports so the the idea wasn&#x27;t to make the problem go away it was to make the reports go away because the reports were clogging up the communication channels which were vital to the defense of the country okay that made sense i mean there is usually some reason why the military does something okay sometimes it&#x27;s not obvious but in this case they were they were it was logical so high neck was there and high neck had a bunch of papers from his testimony and so on uh after my phd at northwestern i i had an office at the computing center there&#x27;s a whole summer coming and i offered to dr heineck to reorganize his fights which were in a complete shamble and so he says sure i mean that would be great you can put it in new folder so i i buy new clean folders and i start going through all the files because we had copies of you know essentially 20 000 reports from the air force that were unclassified and so i make these new things and i put everything back in order i also punch the cards for that so that we have a database at the same time which i still have i know and with the names of witnesses by the way which and i find this folder which is full of stuff and in it there is two pages an onion skin everybody i mean your audience i&#x27;m sure your audience has no idea what an onion skin is you know when you have a typewriter a hand typewriter and you want to make several copies you put a carbon between the and the first page is your letter and the others are you know thin paper you know that thin paper is called an onion skin of course now we have computers so we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t need carbon copies so so it&#x27;s a carbon copy of a memo from somebody i&#x27;ve never heard of to somebody in the intelligence community saying we should not have that panel because we are not ready and which is interesting by itself i mean who are these people who want to stop this top level scientific panel of united states defense establishment i mean who do they think they are the other thing about the memo is that it&#x27;s stamped secret at that point i still have a french passport and i have a green card so i&#x27;m legally in the united states but i&#x27;m not even a us citizen i became a u.s citizen a couple you had to wait five years before you could apply for citizenship but i certainly didn&#x27;t have any reason to look at a secret memo but i start reading it because i i need to tell heinek that this shouldn&#x27;t be here shouldn&#x27;t be in my fives okay um highneck told me that he had not only had he forgotten that memo but he didn&#x27;t think he had ever seen it that if he had seen it that would have changed certain things well it turned out that group turned out two things number one that robertson panel was not brought together by the air force it was brought together by other people in the intelligence community the air force was recovered the scientists were never told that they didn&#x27;t know that so you bring together the top you know top clearance top physicists in the u.s including a couple of nobel prizes and you don&#x27;t tell them who you are well okay uh then can i step in just for a quick second because this was something that we featured and it was really complicated story so basically what jacques is saying leading up this we had a really hard difficult time deciphering this so basically there was that massive sighting in 1952 over washington the air force had to do something they decided to convene a panel of the most smartest minds on how to deal with this it was called the robberson panel the robberson panel was then uh told not to happen by this this memo that you find yes which basically is a is an unknown government agency with more power more influence than the cia it wasn&#x27;t even an agency it was a contractor contract they but it was a contractor they had a contract to look at ufos and what they were saying is you know it&#x27;s a good idea to bring the scientists but this is premature we&#x27;re not ready to tell them about their patterns it&#x27;s always about these were top level computer people in 1954 they were working with punch cards but punch cards work i mean you know there&#x27;s nothing wrong with punch cards the they they were they wanted to bring the best information and then they had ideas that they wanted to discuss about how to test their hypotheses about you what ufos are they the robertson panel went on ignored that pemo it went on and it concluded that the they should discount the reports from the public and they should look at instrumentation from the military which is what people are doing now i mean we see the you know we see the military with these advanced cameras the nimitz you know all those things that are in your in your movie and they&#x27;ve discounted reports they kept project blue book going so that the public would have a place to write if they saw something but it was a very low level thing but we got to this we got to this because you were saying about the examination of the metal yes we never got to that well the um the memo that so when i discussed it with heinek and i got only one other person in the confidence the memo came from an organization in ohio called battelle memorial institute top organization on the analysis of metals they were the ones who invented titanium aluminide they were the ones who invented some of the coatings and some of the metals used in spy planes like that were used later in the u2 in the sl-71 in those undetectable airplanes and so on they were at that time the experts they were also the experts on ufos because they had a contract with the air force and i think that that memo uh which i really didn&#x27;t want to you know expose you know but i would have written that memo you know i mean that that that conference was an attempt to cover up the reality and what what the battelle scientists were saying was wait a minute you know we we need to look on the ground we need to simulate a ufo wave see what the statistics are that&#x27;s going to take another year don&#x27;t don&#x27;t convene that meeting now right and they were overreading they were but joe&#x27;s question is where would that piece of metal that was shot off the ufo that memo revealed it was written by a metallurgist from the memorial institute so if he had that medal in the possession it would have been analyzed by metallurgists at the memorial institute yeah but at that point these the different parts didn&#x27;t were not communicating but did they examine the metal uh i i i shouldn&#x27;t talk about that um i think you know the the book talks about how complicated it is to get once you get the metals or the samples or whatever what do you do with it and what does it mean why shouldn&#x27;t you talk about whether or not they tested the metal well uh because i&#x27;m not i don&#x27;t have the complete information you know i mean obviously that was classified art rondall told me that because number one you know he he knew that i knew the rest of the story number two i had just testified before you know a congressional panel on crisis management for the united states of america so he knew that i understood how those things happen you know how they are managed um but there is plenty of other metal i mean i don&#x27;t really care about that particular metal if you don&#x27;t care about that particular matter well because there&#x27;s a piece of metal that we&#x27;ve shut off but if there&#x27;s a piece of metal that was shot off of a ufo in 1952 that&#x27;s proven to be of uh consistency or with some sort of a we we have others we have others what do we have uh we have others from um argentina from brazil you said there was something from brazil russia from other places has it been proven you were talking about it the lab we have in silicon valley but these metals other people have similar things right but these metals have they been proven to be of a structure that we can&#x27;t replicate uh not what i&#x27;ve looked at so far what have you looked at so far that leads you to believe they&#x27;re extraterrestrial um the condition under which they were found and the reports from the witnesses about what they did okay but if you&#x27;re talking about something that doesn&#x27;t seem obviously extraterrestrial how do you know how do you know that this is an extraterrestrial piece of metal if it if it if it has the same characteristics of metal that you would find here on earth the characteristics of the metal are going to be the same ones that we find on earth because iron from from mouse or venus is like right iron you can pick it up but let&#x27;s go back to the type where you&#x27;re talking about that one particular silicone if it is engineered yes at the atomic level for say 1954 at a level where our technology hadn&#x27;t evolved to the point of for example separating the isotopes and you&#x27;ve found things like this uh yes not not me but some of my colleagues believe that they found things like that but they only had a tiny amount i went to argentina and i got more of the stuff because there is still some some stuff there and i brought back test tubes with enough material that we are going to be testing it again so they haven&#x27;t tested anything that shows that it&#x27;s clearly extraterrestrial no one has any concrete evidence from any of these samples the the metal that was found in in brazil where people described an object flying over and then an explosion that showered some of it fell in the water some of it fell in the sand on the beach some of it fell on rooftops and so there was a lot of stuff and for a long time we only had you know a pinhead worth of stuff which is good enough for one measurement but people told me you can&#x27;t come here with one measurement you need 20 different machines different things different techniques if you want to do it right so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing right but do you understand that what i&#x27;m asking i&#x27;m asking is there is there one smoking gun is there one piece of metal that you can say this this was made at a time or this is from 1952 there was no technology to recreate this metal then we didn&#x27;t know how to make this well that the one that i&#x27;m talking about was 57 over uba tuba in brazil and other groups have a similar thing and we&#x27;ll compare notes but the what was found was that one of the components of the magnesium one of the isotopes of the magnesium was way over what it would be in nature in the natural magnesium which means somebody took it apart and reformulated the magnesium and magnesium is very light and very strong unusual yes it also ignites in contact with air and so it blows up easily and the the reason our sample doesn&#x27;t blow up is that there is oxide it oxidizes very quickly so there is a layer of magnesium oxide on top of it and the analyses some of the analyses that have been done would indicate that number one it&#x27;s extremely pure purer than the dow standard for magnesium but you know again if you go to see a physicist they&#x27;ll say well i can buy the dao standard and i can refine it further right in my lab okay it&#x27;s that now chemical that you know they supply metals to everybody right uh they didn&#x27;t never had a commercial need for that that if if i have a need for that i can do it okay so that doesn&#x27;t prove anything but if we can verify it and if we can look at the you know the ratio of the other isotopes and so on highly precisely which we can do now and but that hasn&#x27;t been done yet no no we&#x27;ll do it in the next in the next few months okay so so the answer is if i can round this out there&#x27;s no real clear evidence that any of this metals extraterrestrial correct so when you say we have lots of metal that seems to have come from a ufo what would lead you to think that if none of this has been proven to be extraterrestrial well because people saw the thing crash yeah right isn&#x27;t part of the problem is that people don&#x27;t always tell the truth yeah but if they come up with if they say this thing crashed you know you&#x27;ve got ordinary people in brazil in that little town you&#x27;ve got the police you&#x27;ve got the you know telling telling you that this thing fell and here is your stuff you take the step to the left this is the stuff you&#x27;re clearly manufactured is it clearly refined and manufactured so this is not something that could have come from an asteroid no okay no i asked the same question i was in the lab with him and gary nolan and i was exactly like you i was like well what are you i&#x27;m i&#x27;m right where&#x27;s the evidence yeah i need to know and gary said to me and some of which had to be edited down a little bit because it was he he went a little beyond the comfort zone of stanford university he said to me that what we&#x27;re looking at has an isotopic value that he didn&#x27;t understand that if it was to be recreated on earth it would be in the billions of dollars to do it yeah that&#x27;s what he told me and that&#x27;s better yeah then he said to me we we don&#x27;t understand it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s engineered at an atomic level we&#x27;re learning that with this new device that we have in silicon valley we don&#x27;t understand it we want to understand it and we feel like it could be revolutionary breakthrough technologically if we could understand it and this other material that in the the silicon valley that they were had discovered 20 years ago that your friend had analyzed and he said there&#x27;s nothing like it and we&#x27;ve seen nothing like it since then yeah that there&#x27;s this man who was given right that that sample right and we don&#x27;t know where that is now right we don&#x27;t know where it is we don&#x27;t know but but he said an awful you know a matrix of awful silicate yeah that he couldn&#x27;t probe with in his lab and you know obviously but tell would have been a logical place to to look at that because they had all the people who signed that memo were metallurgists so that makes you think of something i get frustrated with it too because i went to the lab and i saw the machine i saw the metal samples which you carried around like this you never let them out of your sight and i said jesus are you paranoid or what are you worried about you said these things they have a way of disappearing disappearing and and i asked the same questions you&#x27;re asking what do we know and they&#x27;re very you know he&#x27;s concerned that he&#x27;s going to make a statement that&#x27;s going to be be premature that the further scientific analysis that the scientific journals and the peer review hasn&#x27;t happened yet and therefore he&#x27;s being really conservative but basically what he&#x27;s telling me is the subs engineered at an atomic level it would be in the billions of dollars to recreate if we could even recreate it and we&#x27;re talking about pieces that recovered as early as 47 and 57 and you know et cetera so it&#x27;s extremely exciting but they&#x27;re it&#x27;s too early to make any concrete statements okay but that&#x27;s much better but the least you&#x27;re saying that there is something some evidence that shows that there&#x27;s something and whether or not it&#x27;s made for materials that exist as we know it currently on earth it&#x27;s made in a way that there&#x27;s no way anyone can make it today without like some insane budget and much less likely in the 1940s yes well again this is human testimony yes you know this scientist from that that company with that matrix of orthosidicate the the air frost council who told me about the thing he could lift with one finger you know a whole wing um the you know colonel corso with the stuff that he recovered that he was given by the army i mean initially the army had had the project to to analyze this and uh right after the war and that he gave to the different labs what we need to do is go through the normal scientific publication process why hasn&#x27;t this happened every time somebody tried dr heineck tried they wouldn&#x27;t publish it but in 2020 don&#x27;t you think they&#x27;ll be more likely to be interested and possibly publish this we&#x27;ll find out so you still have all these medals in your possession or in someone&#x27;s possession yes what other kind of evidence is there is there anything else that&#x27;s compelling um i don&#x27;t know of any biological evidence that&#x27;s what what like a body you mean well we don&#x27;t even need a body i mean you need saliva from emotion right i mean we can do the dna i brought this up with with christopher mellon recently and because you hear that same old argument you know oh you know the skeptic and i think it&#x27;s perfectly healthy to be skeptical i&#x27;m to be the first one to tell you that the vast majority you must have ufo reports can and have been explained away in sort of down to earth conventional terms but there&#x27;s that core 10 or 15 percent of cases that truly after careful scientific investigation defy a terrestrial explanation and those are the cases that we focus on and i asked christopher mellon what do you say to the skeptic that says oh there&#x27;s clearly just anecdotal evidence as to the reality of ufos he&#x27;s like well we put that to bed a long time ago you&#x27;ve got visual confirmation radar confirmation ground to air visual and ground air radar you&#x27;ve got photographic evidence from the cockpits of these military aircraft you&#x27;ve got landing prints in the ground you&#x27;ve got soil sample analysis from from the propulsion you&#x27;ve got plants and and soil samples there&#x27;s a preponderance of evidence of cases all around the world you know the only question is you know who are they what do they want where do they come from i mean that seems to be where we need to set our sights and senator reid says something really interesting to me he&#x27;s like look just because we don&#x27;t understand something it doesn&#x27;t mean we should shy away from it it doesn&#x27;t mean you know we should you know focus in the scientific community and and get to the bottom of it and put the necessary resources in place and stop treating this like a taboo subject that we have to all uh you know shy away from well whoever has a stranglehold on the information the intelligence community seems to be in a position where a lot of what they have is i don&#x27;t know yeah they&#x27;re also they don&#x27;t want to say that they&#x27;re also sitting on footage of of you know apparently according to all the people the military guys i&#x27;ve talked to crystal clear photographic evidence landing film footage evidence um cockpit film recorded evidence i mean there&#x27;s that statement i read earlier from from about this latest story breaking about two navy pilots getting one triangular shape ufo that came out of the water they&#x27;ve got a crystal clear photograph of that that they&#x27;re they&#x27;re not releasing to the public so i think we should get the pressure on for for further government transparency i really do and i think that the more tangible solid compelling evidence needs to get released it&#x27;s so fascinating and everybody wants to see something like this you know it&#x27;s oh it&#x27;s biggest story ever i mean the cockpit recordings that that christopher mellon snuck out of the pentagon they ended up on the page of the new york times that was huge everyone is waiting for that type of evidence we know it&#x27;s there we&#x27;ve had confirmation from extremely high level government officials people in the intelligence agent saying it&#x27;s there we just have to get it released well at the al gore hearings about emergency management the question of the satellites came up and somebody said one of the congress people we had we pay you guys to deploy these satellites to and you look at the earth you know all the time you know with 10 centimeters you know resolution so if you see something you should be able to that could be a crisis you should be able to tell us if it&#x27;s going to threaten the population of the united states there was one guy there who didn&#x27;t laugh because he was respectful of the committee but he said with all due respect i cannot un under the you know this audience i cannot tell you where i work but you know there are three letters to the my employer and uh what i can tell you is that i i measure every morning the amount of snow that has fallen on the nose of the statue of jerzynski in downtown moscow in front of their headquarters of the kgb i can measure i can tell you how much snow fell that night because i measured so that tells you you know the kind of instrument that we have i&#x27;m by regulation by law i must turn off my satellite when it flies over the united states i&#x27;m not spying on your house if you authorize me to run the satellite to run the you know acquisition i could tell you when there is going to be a flood in arizona because i measured the i could measure the amount of the snow that fell you know on the rockies last night and we&#x27;ve got these climate prediction schedules we can approximately tell you where it might melt and where it&#x27;s going to go when it melts and how big the reservoirs are going to be and when the reservoirs are going to overflow but i&#x27;m not authorized by law to look at any of the data and if i looked at it i wouldn&#x27;t be authorized to disclose it to you because you&#x27;re not cleared for the characteristics of my the resolution of my device and i&#x27;m sure that you know in in march i&#x27;m going to be sitting with my wife and my kids looking at the tv and i&#x27;m going to see this woman in arizona with her two babies in her arm up to here in her kitchen up to here in water because the dam has flooded because it happens every winter because there&#x27;s no melt so it comes down but i&#x27;m not authorized to tell her and even if i told her i would have to tell the governor the governor would have to tell the sheriff and the sheriff would have to disclose you know send somebody right but then but did he say there are four levels of management did he indicate they were picking up ufos no no well uh no we were not talking about yourselves we were talking about right but you were saying that if we have these satellites that can do these incredible things why are we not picking up ufos well no i&#x27;m saying why if they are picking up ufo why they are not telling us they can&#x27;t even tell us when there is going to be a flood in arizona okay so they might be picking up these ufos there&#x27;s a good reason for that they might be picking up these ufos but they&#x27;re not giving us the data they&#x27;re not allowed art london was saying about you know his experience the other uh compelling story of abduction that you you had briefly brought up for a second before we were still on the uh the betty and barney hill story was travis walt yes we we interviewed travis for uh potentially for the film and then opted to kind of avoid that aspect of i don&#x27;t consider the travis walton an abduction so much as an encounter that didn&#x27;t end well and he probably was taken aboard to get recovered but what do you mean well he uh they were in the woods right uh snowflake arizona i think it was 1973 it was a logger right it was a logger they were they had a contract with the government to log a certain area or to clear a certain area and um it was late and they were behind on the schedule so they were working a little bit later than they normally would and they all got in the truck they had four door trucks that had like seven of them uh driving out and they saw a light in the sky they thought it was a fire and as they got closer to it it was this perfect disc hovering about treetop level right out the window i mean they said he could have hit with a rock and he told the driver travis walton stop the truck i&#x27;m gonna jump out and they all against their will don&#x27;t do that travis and he just left out of the truck and started running towards this thing thinking it was going to just shoot off but it didn&#x27;t it stayed there and as he got closer to it he started to kind of freak out a little bit and it started making a weird sound like it was spooling up or something and so he tucked down behind a log that was on the ground and and he&#x27;s and they&#x27;re screaming at him in the truck get back get back here what are you doing and he&#x27;d realize he was dangerously close to this thing so he was going to make a run for the truck and he got up as this thing was spooling up according to him it was and he tried to make a run for the truck and some kind of energy force hit him and knocked him like a raggedy and all the way across like 60 feet and he landed and those guys took off thinking they were next and they left them for dead out there in the woods they&#x27;re driving down the road hightailing it out of there and then the driver realizes like we can&#x27;t leave travis man we got to go back and get travis and they were all freaked out thinking that they were going to be next finally they argued and he said look man i&#x27;m going back to get travis whether you guys are with me or not and that you if you want you guys can stay here i&#x27;ll come back and get you they&#x27;re like no no let&#x27;s stick together so they all sit together in the truck they turned around they went back ufo gone travis gone they go down into town and they have to tell the authorities you can imagine 1975 they&#x27;re telling local authorities and there&#x27;s a small enough town where everybody kind of knows everybody hey our buddy got abducted by a flying saucer and he&#x27;s gone they&#x27;re like yeah you guys are all under arrest for uh homicide we&#x27;ll start an intense search the next day with helicopters dogs it made world news all across you know as you can imagine these guys took a lie detector test they said you know they stuck to their story even though they knew that people wouldn&#x27;t believe them they thought they&#x27;d killed travis and they buried him somewhere in the in the in the hills so they&#x27;re all doing this five-day intensive search will trav travis walton reappears five days later with facial growth here&#x27;s the really fascinating part of this story that i find incredible because again don&#x27;t look at what these the phenomenon does sometimes you look at what they don&#x27;t do well they didn&#x27;t drop them off where they picked them up that was the most i&#x27;ve been out there it&#x27;s a really remote area in the mountains in the in the forest he would not have made it back alive drop him off in the middle of town they didn&#x27;t do that either but they dropped him off right on the outskirts of town so he could a they would they did it in a little valley so they minimized any possibility of their exposure they dropped him off in a place where he could get help but they would minimize being seen they did it at night and five days later he reappears and of course he he&#x27;s back and he recounts the same story and he&#x27;s been recounting the same story and what is his story story is he woke up uh it&#x27;s funny actually i met with travis a handful of times and i sat down with him and a lot of times when i really want to absorb a story i closed my eyes and then their words recreate the visuals for me so i see it and so that&#x27;s what i did with travis at dinner just the two of us and i closed my eyes and he told me he woke up uh on board he was on a table and there were and he was kind of blurry-eyed but he could see these little beans and he initially thought what am i looking at here where am i and he saw these little beans and typical beans the the diminutive body big head big almond shape black eyes and he was absolutely terrified and he grabbed some sort of instrument that was on the table and he said that he even touched one of them and he goes i was surprised at how light it was it moved really easily and he started aggressively swinging some instrument that he found on the table towards these things and then they scurried off and left the room he went off they went to the right he went left and he was walking down a hallway and he said you can imagine like polished aluminum there were no seams no rivets no weld marks but it was all solid like one solid piece and he said it was tight and my shoulders were rubbing on either side of these of this hallway and i was running down the hallway totally freaked out didn&#x27;t know where he was and he could have having a hard time breathing and he took a left and he went into this room and there was a command chair and and in the he sat in the command chair and he started playing with buttons he was trying to get out he just wanted to get out and all of a sudden there was a holographic projection of like a star chart that was holographic that that appeared and he was moving with these buttons and everything started to move and he thought my god if i&#x27;m on a spaceship i could crash this thing i don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;m doing and then two very humanoid-looking people beautiful angelic people with these glass bulbs came in with tight-fitting suits on and he said oh my god you guys are here to save me thank god but they wouldn&#x27;t talk with him they just took him by the arm and they escorted him out he went down a ramp and then he said i was either in a hangar or i was in a big huge another spaceship i don&#x27;t know if it was a huge hammer hanger on on the ground or if it was another spaceship but there were lots of discs of different sizes parked inside this hangar looking thing but it was indoors and they escorted him out they met with another a woman i said well how do you know it was a woman it was a woman it had a glass bulb and they they put something over his mouth and he kind of fought but he said he was weak and the next thing he knew he woke up in a field and looked up in the and the disc was just leaving departing and it was five days later wow yeah there was a movie made about it called fire the sky but the ending was tr uh tracy tormey wrote that and the ending of the film was changed the last minute and it was inaccurate yeah because the [ __ ] i know hollywood exactly these mothers yeah i know and he fought it and they said look you want the movie to get made they were changing the ending but that&#x27;s the real ending in the movie that was right from travis walton to me wow but i decided in the movie is he still alive yes he is where does he live uh snowflake arizona i believe he still lives there wow yeah he&#x27;s great his story is exactly how old is he now he&#x27;s probably maybe late 60s yeah and and i went to the actual site with him we actually drove out to that site and i tell you man when we got there he got out of the car and he was just running just running towards the spot and it had recently snowed there was snow in the ground and i couldn&#x27;t keep up with him but he was running to go to the exact location where and i could see him reliving the whole thing i mean it was a really powerful moment uh with him and it was a very very remote area of of the mountain range it&#x27;s a very compelling story it&#x27;s a really compelling story and they all pass and i interviewed a number of the eyewitnesses that were with him at the time and there was a movie made about it called travis i believe you should definitely look into it but a documentary but he was really funny he was working at like a walmart you&#x27;re going to say pass a polygraph test yeah they all did yeah but i was talking to one of the witnesses i&#x27;ll never forget this and he and i was like god what did you see can you describe what the disc looked like and he goes you ever seen like a brand new corvette like that beautiful brand new corvette and i said yeah yeah he goes it was more perfect than that it was just this perfect disc and he said it was lit up like you could see there&#x27;s almost little windows in it and it just suspended in this darkness and it was kind of just wobbling there but the way he described it he made the correlation of a corvette a brand new corvette isn&#x27;t that funny yeah and um yeah it&#x27;s a fascinating case and i i decided that this is the first film that i was dealing with my fourth one that i dealt with close encounters of the third kind which is one that were you know the witnesses claimed to report beans and that was about as far as i wanted to go with it because i i was concerned about the the mainstream participation i was getting with like harry reid and podesta and governor bill richardson and and those christopher mellon chocolate and i was concerned not to go too far with it and to take baby steps and one of the things that&#x27;s been incredibly exciting for me to see for the first time keep in mind is my fourth film on the topic is that not only are we seeing a we&#x27;ve got people like dan farah who&#x27;s a mainstream you know he produced ready player one with steven spielberg who&#x27;s attaching he&#x27;s the latest producer who&#x27;s associating himself with this film but you&#x27;re getting like harry reid and all these household names that are not only looking at it participating but publicly endorsing it and that is extremely exciting because that is an indication that people are getting ready for this story to come out you know what i&#x27;m what i&#x27;m saying yeah and i felt it was important to take those baby steps and and not go too far because there are some aspects of the phenomenon that if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with it might might be a bit of a stretch and so well it seems like the public is more interested and more open to it now than ever before and it seems less ridiculous oh totally no yeah no question about it and yeah the new york times thing really made the difference i firmly believe that yeah it for sure did because it was sent to me by a bunch of my friends that are like legitimate intellectuals professors scholars like people that are very really smart like look this is right up your alley like look at this new york times now uh-huh exactly people that have been ridiculed me killing me for decades ago oh my god i mean like the guy that lives across the street from where i grew up is walter merch senior he edited apocalypse now okay he&#x27;s like the pinnacle of success editor and he&#x27;s always kind of made little jabs at me over the years and then he finally goes boy james you might have been you might be right yeah that was really satisfying for me and then to see lou elizondo publicly endorse the film and we&#x27;re talking about like if you think about it you&#x27;ve got people endorsing a film that take my name off it&#x27;s just stories that we reported on but that deals with potential close encounters of the third kind that&#x27;s so amazing i mean if you walk down the street you meet average joe and you say hey did you hear about the ufo that landed in africa the occupants got out and communicated tell them get the [ __ ] out of here crazy go so crazy somewhere else like you would yeah but but it&#x27;s happening we feature it we were in the edit room for three and a half four years and we said where are we going we&#x27;re on the road to rua that was our mantra road to ruin what we meant was let&#x27;s compile the evidence and let&#x27;s build our case so we can allow the audience to walk away at the end of the film saying that landing case in africa might have actually just happened and i think we succeeded think about all these cases whether it&#x27;s travis walton or betty and barney hill or the the african cases if if you weren&#x27;t there and you&#x27;ve never experienced anything like it it was just this one unique thing that happened it would be it&#x27;s so hard for anyone to accept unless you see it with your own eyes unless you&#x27;re actually there unless you experience it it&#x27;s so hard and it&#x27;s so easy to be incredulous it&#x27;s so easy to be skeptical but when you get people like david fravor yeah like i you know he&#x27;s so compelled he&#x27;s so compelling you listen to his testimony and you listen to the parallels of the observed technology the no wings and how baffled he was with the whole thing and then you hear the stories the same technology back in the 40s and 50s ago you should listen to him on i don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve listened to him on lex friedman&#x27;s podcast no it&#x27;s amazing because lex you know lex is uh he does uh art he did artificial intelligence work with mit brilliant guy and him and david fravor go on forever oh wow about the experience the encounter and also just his understanding and knowledge of aircrafts and and of just of air travel and it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s an insane story like i had him on my podcast with uh jeremy corbell and that was great but it was even better on lex friedman&#x27;s podcast because it was just lex and david together and they went deep into the weeds about the story yeah i mean apparently there was an object under the water which we were like ah did we cover that we kind of mentioned it quickly in the film there&#x27;s so many aspects of that the thing is he could only see the water breaking over the top of it he couldn&#x27;t see the actual object itself but there&#x27;s many stories about things that are in the water if you wanted to have a base or you wanted to have some sort of of a mother ship you wanted to hide it in plain view i mean 90 of the earth&#x27;s ocean is undiscovered or unexplored when it&#x27;s you could easily hide something in there no one would ever see it that&#x27;s one thing christopher mellon said he was disappointed with the new york times and i thought well gosh the new york times did something pretty brave i think and the due diligence they did apparently according to the authors was insane they had to cross-check everything make sure they had to speak to harry reid they had to see the government documents they had to verify the existence of atip i mean they really worked hard at it but christopher mellon said well they kind of missed it i said what do you mean they miss it he goes well it&#x27;s great they revealed the a-tip program that secret pentagon program but the bigger story was these things are real and they&#x27;re here this is happening now they&#x27;ve been going in and out of our oceans for 270 days out of 365 in 2015 and that they the navy finally just said we can&#x27;t stop them we&#x27;ve tried to intercept them they fly rings around us just leave them alone that&#x27;s crazy because that&#x27;s what when david fravor was communicating with the what was it the ship who was he communicating with there was telling them nimitz yeah we&#x27;ve been seeing these yes yeah on the radar going up from space yeah they would go from outer space 80 000 feet was the highest we could detect them and then they&#x27;d shoot down to the to like five feet over the water like that yeah yeah and then just you know you know shooting around and then of course getting visual confirmation but they didn&#x27;t even do anything for like was it days or weeks yeah leading up to that yeah it&#x27;s crazy well listen your document is fantastic i really enjoyed it i watched it twice it&#x27;s excellent your
