            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is channel dedicated toward uh education and uplift upliftment and hopefully um we will be reviewing various theories of everything all-encompassing theories cosmologies Magnum opuses from authors and researchers who spent their life whole life working on something and uh probably never really got too much credit or um recognition or money and uh but I feel like they have something important to say that can really contribute to your overall worldview and uh today is uh video number 336 that we&#x27;ve done on dwey B Larson and his reciproc iCal system of theory uh Mr Larsson was an engineer that lived in the 20th century he died back in 1990 but uh before that he put in about 60 years worth of work on um uh downloading and then uh IND inducing and deducing uh his reciprocal system of theory about halfway through that period around 1959 he uh put out his two fundamental postulates and then uh from there he uh derived through a process of deduction a theoretical Universe about you know how the universe would operate if his postulates were correct and then he uh in his books uh compared his theoretical Universe sized up uh you know his theoretical universe as opposed to the Legacy scientists uh you know the uh the newtonians and the einsteinian and the quantum mechanists and others and how um you know how they were all able to come up with answers to questions and um in the vast majority of cases the reciprocal system uh came up with identical answers to Legacy science uh with the addition that they generally that the reciprocal system generally uh pointed at the the relevant Concepts that underly the mathematics and the solution so-called whereas uh the Legacy science often didn&#x27;t uh they had the the mathematical answers but they didn&#x27;t have the reason why these things are as they are and then uh within the relativistic areas the areas that uh of the very fast very small in the very large uh Larson&#x27;s theories diverged from the uh kind of the mainstream and um especially the Newtonian universe but also to a certain extent the einsteinian universe and um so not only were the concepts different but in many cases the math was also different but the general idea behind the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe not made out of matter and not made out of energy but uh and not made out of force but made out of motion and uh motion for Larson was the relationship between space and time motion had a fundamental nature that was what he called scaler motion which is a a kind of motion that the Legacy scientist knew about but they didn&#x27;t understand that it had any significance they kind of recognized that it was a different Motion in kind an entirely different kind of motion but they didn&#x27;t really recognize its significance and uh a scalar motion is a motion that has no specific Direction it just has a magnitude it&#x27;s a scaling factor and and so um you know things move in scale um and you know so the the further out they go the further away they go in in scale in proportion and um a way to Envision that is using a balloon with dots on it you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other the farther farther away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction um the only thing that gives them direction is when you identify a reference point if you decide that one of those points one of those dots on the balloon is motionless then you can see that uh you know each one of of the other dots is moving away from that uh that motionless reference point and you can assign a direction to the direction the direction that that it is moving away um so the mo the direction itself is not a product of the motion it&#x27;s a product of a of a reference of assigning a reference point a reference system and so um the scientists they know about the expanding balloon uh for one reason uh that the Hubble telescope has identified that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other so unless we&#x27;re willing to accept uh the idea that the our galaxy is at the center of the universe um then all then our G Galaxy is also moving away from all other galaxies and um that is a scaler motion but nobody has really identified the significance of that until Larson as far as I know and um so Larsson calls that clock time and clock space the clock space all of the the space is uh incre ining U all of the uh dots and all the galaxies are moving away from each other but in no specific direction there&#x27;s more and more and more space they moving farther and farther and farther apart and uh clock time which we&#x27;re more familiar with is just that time is always getting later and later and later but in no specific Direction uh the time time is just getting later and um that is um you know H how you kind of look at a clock it doesn&#x27;t move in any direction just forward and that&#x27;s scalar motion to the extent that you could say forward backward in or out uh you can say that it does have a Direction but it doesn&#x27;t have a specific Direction like north or south or something like that now also in addition to this scalar motion uh we have uh basically a coordinate reference frame and so um space and time the two components of motion and two things that actually don&#x27;t exist other than when they are together in motion they don&#x27;t exist in and of themselves and they have a reciprocal relationship in motion um um as one gets greater the other gets smaller um and uh they basically [Music] are uh can be thought of as as a motion can be thought of as a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator and um they both so they both space and time have their coordinate aspects XY Z coordinates in space uh three dimensions so this is a concept that we&#x27;re very familiar with but this same concept also extends to time there&#x27;s three-dimensional time uh under certain circumstances and um that is uh something that we would have to you know adjust our Minds to but um so uh space and time have their coordinate aspects they have their clock aspects and they also have their discrete unit aspects meaning that they come only in discrete units you have to have a certain minimum amount of space before you have space and you have to have a certain minimum amount of time before you have time and you have to have uh if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you&#x27;re talking about the speed of light and so that is really the back one over one lson calls it unit speed and that&#x27;s really the background of the reciprocal system or the reciprocal Universe um it&#x27;s one instead of zero the numbers multiply to one so you think of the uh the speed of light moving outward in all directions as the reference point or the zero point the null point the origin The Ether of the reciprocal universe and that there is actually half of our universe that is moving faster than the speed of light um and so this is an entire kind of new universe to the Legacy scientist who believe that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe and so there is nothing moving faster than the speed of light uh lson identifies this as the cosmic sector and he identifies uh entities within this Cosmic sector as Cosmic atoms Cosmic particles Cosmic molecules Cosmic Aggregates of matter and um under certain circumstances we can observe these things um and in uh in larsson&#x27;s Cosmic sector uh we have the ideas of coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart because it is the reciprocal of the material sector the material sector is the sector that we&#x27;re familiar with the sector that the scientists Legacy scientists have made their measurements and their observations and what we have in the material sector we have coordinate space three dimensions of space and we have clock time the time is always getting later and later and later but when we cross that unit speed boundary the speed of light boundary the rules invert uh typical over IR reciprocal and the rule rules invert and then we&#x27;re dealing with coordinate time and clock space so that&#x27;s kind of briefly how the reciprocal system works and again he took those po that&#x27;s the first postulate the second postulate is basically that uh the universe conforms to the relations of ordinary communative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian and of some of Larson&#x27;s followers have had issues with that second postulate but in any case it is much less significant than the first postulate and um Larson took those two postulates and then through a process of deduction uh he deduced a theoretical Universe it was about 165 steps and if you go back about 8 or nine months months uh maybe even 10 months you uh will be able to see me uh do about 15 videos uh that&#x27;s based on larsson&#x27;s talk called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so I go into full detail about how how he derives each aspect of um of the reciprocal Universe now today we&#x27;re looking at um installment e or um the fifth installment of uh us going through larsson&#x27;s paper that&#x27;s called the mechanism of the universe this is a paper that&#x27;s primarily on cosmology the kind of the macro astronomical Universe um you know what is the origin of this universe uh is it a big bang is it going to be a big crunch is it an oscillating universe is it a steady state universe and uh he looks at some of those theories and then he also proposes uh what what the theoretical universe of the reciprocal system would uh would say that how How the Universe operates so if you want to start this at the beginning you want to go back about four videos and uh start with uh section A but this is here is a section e and uh we&#x27;re going to start it right now okay at this at this point I must report rather regretfully that the reciprocal system of theory is a great disappointment to the devotees of Science Fiction many of them are full of anticipation when they first hear that the theory involves Motion in time but their hopes are dashed when they find that time travel in a un Universe of motion is subject to exactly the same kind of limitations as space travel if we have sufficient time at our disposal we can always return to a specific location in space by means of space travel but we cannot return to the same place at the same time we can only get there at some later time similarly by means of travel in time it would be possible in principle to return to any time location but we cannot return to the same time at the same place we can only reach that time location at a distant place we likewise have to say no to anti-gravity devices Superman will have to stay in the comic sections gravitation is a motion and the only anti-gravity device is an opposing motion uh Larson for some reason kind of omits the fact that uh the progression of the natural reference system the motion outward at the speed of light in all directions that is really The Ether or the origin or the zero point of the universe the always existing before anything else exists uh which you calls the progression of the natural reference system that is an anti-gravity motion it is a motion that opposes gravitation you can Envision gravitation as uh just that same uh balloon with dots on it but this time you suck in the balloon and all of the dots are moving toward each other that&#x27;s gravitation modeled and so it is the opposite of the progression so the progression itself is anti-gravity and if so if there&#x27;s any way of harnessing that progression then you would have an anti-gravity device but uh Larson doesn&#x27;t seem that uh think that that is a possibility some of larsson&#x27;s followers uh do believe that that is a possibility okay so gravitation is a motion and the only anti-gravity device is an opposing motion now I will have to deepen the Gloom by consigning the antimatter energy generators to the same discard pile there are Aggregates of antimatter or Cosmic matter as we prefer to call it to be sure there are antimatter Stars clusters and galaxies but these are Aggregates in time not in space and we meet them only one atom at a time to make matters worse we will also have to discard what we may call the Sanctified science fiction the many products of the imagination ranging from the fanciful to the Fantastic that have been injected into conventional physical as astronomical Theory by investigators and theorists who have been frustrated in their attempts to solve their problems in an orderly scientific manner such ad hoc Concepts as black holes quarks the Big Bang curved space Etc are no more scientific than anti-gravity devices they have no place in the new system in fact this system outlawed ad hoc assumptions Al together returning to cosmology we now have the answer to the question as to the fate of the galactic fragments thrown off at speeds greater than the speed of light by the explosion of the Galaxy these fragments are observable for a time until the effect of gravitation is overcome after which they enter the cosmic sector the region of speeds above unity and the matter of which they are composed then becomes available for the building of cosmic galaxies these galaxies recede from each other uh they and their constituents age just as the material galaxies and the constituents do and eventually the oldest Cosmic galaxies explode and eject fragments of uh fragments at speeds less than Unity the fragments enter the material sector and become available as the raw material from which new galaxies are formed now I must say I&#x27;m not quite understanding why Galax Cosmic galaxies um where does it say um Cosmic galaxies recede from each other they and their constituents age just as material galaxies do now I would think that if material galaxies are aging meaning that they&#x27;re getting later and later and later in time or older and older and older in time that Cosmic galaxies would get farther and farther and farther apart in space not in time um I I don&#x27;t know there is there a disconnect there I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m understanding why Cosmic galaxies would age in time as opposed to moving apart in space um so anybody out there who uh wants to uh you know fill me in on that uh what I&#x27;m missing there uh would be nice I guess you know um I have to I have to read the comments a little bit more than I do though so I&#x27;m sorry that um I I only seem to get around to reading the comments about once a month or something and um as I probably said in the past here uh my um my budget for this uh video series is zero and my um spare time for um this video series is also maxed out so um please bear with me I&#x27;m kind of just doing the best I can with um basically no resources and um very very little time to work on this so um I um you know all I can say is I&#x27;m doing the best I can I&#x27;m and I&#x27;m also not an expert on this topic I&#x27;m trying but uh it&#x27;s a very hard subject matter and I&#x27;m trying to present it uh in a way that you can I I&#x27;m trying to present it in a way that you can get it from the primary sources I&#x27;m doing a lot of reading from the direct from Mr Larson and some of Mr Larson&#x27;s followers so that you can get it directly from them as opposed to me always just interpreting it because I&#x27;m not an expert of it I I can give you a summary of some of these things but um you know for you to really learn it I think you need to hear the uh hear it from the horse&#x27;s mouth so I do a lot of reading of various articles and books from U Mr Larson and and others okay um this then is the answer for which cosmology has been looking as the proponents of the steady state Theory have contended the universe had no beginning and it will have no end it has always existed in essentially the same form and it has essentially the same appearance from any point in space or any point in time but there is no continuous creation nor do the galaxies simply disappear over the time Horizon as the steady state Theory uh in a as as in the steady state theory in a universe of motion the large scale action of the universe is a cyclic process each half of the universe the material and the cosmic goes through an evolutionary sequence that begins with the entrance of matter from the invers sector and transforms this matter into compatible structures gathers it into Aggregates separates the Aggregates and finally Subs them to phenomena that result in the ejection of L back into the inverse sector a similar process in that sector completes the cycle so the universe is cyclical each sector has a an evolutionary a on directional evolutionary um motion but when kind of the um when the matter in that sector uh gets to the end of the road it goes into the other sector and becomes you know at the beginning of the road of that sector and then it evolves and gets to the end of the road in that sector and moves across into the other sector as the beginning of the road so uh that that&#x27;s kind of how it it is cyclical a two oneway motions okay uh let&#x27;s do one more paragraph here for the benefit of those who may be reluctant to accept the idea of a universe without beginning or end because of a conflict with the religious ideas of an active creation I will say that our findings do not affect repeat do not affect the creation issue one way or the other if the universe of motion came into being through an act of creation then space and time were the entities that were created there could be nothing Before Time existed and if it came into existence as a result of an Act of Creation the universe that was created could just as well be cyclic as open-ended okay we&#x27;re going to stop it right there and we will start up tomorrow uh hopefully I guess we have probably an an outside chance of finishing tomorrow um and uh if not then the day after uh with this article the mechanism of the Universe by Dy B Larson thanks for tuning in and have a wonderful day</p>
