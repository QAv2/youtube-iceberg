hard [ __ ] dude if they [ __ ] Soldier didn&#x27;t kill me also there was like a couple times where we had early deaths like some players be a little bit far for where you die early and then it&#x27;s like oh I think we should be focusing their demo I can cross keep them down the whole [Music] just can&#x27;t hit players for is there anything else that we need to comment about just double bomb demo on a I&#x27;m okay I&#x27;d be okay with that when when both of their soldiers go behind what do we do I to walk forward usually that happens I the demo so it&#x27;s like if I back up I the solders I go for the demo I could be wrong about this but I I noticed that um I look up at the our health of the top of my screen and I notice that everyone takes damage at the exact same time which tells me we&#x27;re probably clumping up a lot well we&#x27;re doing that because we&#x27;re asked to play behind Rock but then we don&#x27;t get spammed [Music] so the Strat this m is to double bomb their demo I would say if we can get some space off their Scouts then you can guys can bomb their demo or something like that or if you notice their Scouts on the wrong side or something like that ored yeah a right side yeah I good with that also I hit the I hit a sink rocket and I got damage numbers for 71 and 80 on their medic and they didn&#x27;t die and it was a sink I was so pissed what can&#x27;t [Music] probably already up think I&#x27;m ready like let&#x27;s uh yeah let&#x27;s get this demo thought of you tight right side remember right side connector I&#x27;m getting [ __ ]
