            <p>good day folks I&#x27;d like to talk more today about the energy systems we&#x27;re basically ignoring today because of the famous redacted Maxwell equations they&#x27;re simplified now and they took away you know they used to be at least 20 variables in the original Maxwell equations and without getting too much details into that I actually have previous videos if that interests you but some of those 20 variables for example talks about magnetics for example so let&#x27;s say that just like in electronics you would have something called a magnetic potential you know so uh there would be the equivalent of you know voltage where you know one plate has less voltage than another and it&#x27;s that gyro flow from one point to another that we see today as the electrical current however in the original Maxwell this is just one of them that&#x27;s very interesting but there&#x27;s a whole loads of them that can do really interesting stuff but the magnetics is what strikes me the most which is something I think we ignore and what I was saying is it&#x27;s like having a um so let&#x27;s say we were to actually incorporate this this according to these um equations we would be able to have those magnetic potentials just like voltage instead of electronics it would be I guess um agtronics you know so um what would happen is we would have to figure out a way to get one magnetic potential to see another and have a magnetic flow from one lesser you know and then we&#x27;d have to figure out the equivalence of you know the semiconductors like a magnetic resistor that would resist that magnetic flow at equivalent of the magnetic capacitor that could store these magnetic forces so this is just and I&#x27;m not making the sub this is all in the original Maxwell equations it was um heavy side unfortunately that arguably made a butcherized simplified version of this leaving most of all of this stuff the original Maxwell equations so um Tom beardum talks a lot about this and the way he refers to the static charge and the vacuum and how you know basically every generator battery whatever you want to call it as a source of infinite vacuum energy thanks to the forever Furnishing magnetic dipole in his theories which of course the magnetic dipole believe it or not is another one of the Maxwell theories that oops we&#x27;ll take that one out of there so taking that into consideration I guess the way Tom Bearden explains it is a pretty good way where you can look at a static field the name static is very deceptive because you know like he would say it&#x27;s like looking at a waterfall from far away at say I think the word he uses is a steady state dynamic system so as you see the waterfall from far away it&#x27;s it appears to be static it&#x27;s that same waterfall you see though it&#x27;s beautiful there&#x27;s water flowing down and it never seems to really move it&#x27;s just that one line that one flow of water but as you get closer and closer you notice that oh it&#x27;s actually individual particles that are in this very ferocious very active very energetic system as you get close you can feel the wind this thing is generated there&#x27;s a splash you know not one water droplet is at the same place one comes back and replaces it so that&#x27;s essentially Tom bearden&#x27;s way of explaining you know how the vacuum is as vast you know the direct sea and this is how you know it pops in and out and one always kicks the other one out and you&#x27;ve got what he considers the steady state dynamic system in the static field essentially so um a lot of people Overlook that and um I think it would be a major step forward in our understanding of electronics and possibly even new Energy Systems we can interact with so I want to give you an example here that you probably all know and before you jump to the conclusion please don&#x27;t roast me on this I don&#x27;t want to argue the debate that I put my hand there and that&#x27;s what made it move so I have an energy input so therefore it&#x27;s not over Unity I&#x27;m not talking about over Unity this time what I&#x27;m talking about is using new Energy Systems and interacting with those and obviously if you understand the vacuum energy you know this is a much denser source of energy if we could actually tap into it and use it so no it&#x27;s not free in the sense it doesn&#x27;t come from nowhere it&#x27;s just we can find ways to interact with this new and unknown Energy Systems so with that said I&#x27;m going to do a simple demonstration that could possibly prove exactly what Tom Bearden was saying here so you probably know this here&#x27;s a compass here and you know how a compass ride will react to it&#x27;s the magnetic feel of the earth that drives the magnetic north and exerts that Force through a magnetic field so even though it looks like this meter is moving on its own there&#x27;s actually an external Force driving it right and that&#x27;s totally okay that&#x27;s how the compass works is the magnetic field of the Earth right but something else we all know if we put another field even a static field near it anything stronger than the Earth&#x27;s field that it&#x27;s receiving just passively will interfere with that and the meter will either swing the opposite way or towards depending on what the polarity and what charge obviously more of the charge and the more ferocious the meter is going to react but it could be as little as a few volts and it could be a static charge not even an AC I&#x27;m not talking about AC I&#x27;m not talking about pulse I&#x27;m talking about a static charge so for example here&#x27;s your I&#x27;m going to show you right now here one point this is a brand new battery I took here&#x27;s the positive here&#x27;s the negative now I&#x27;m holding the meter and I&#x27;m shaking so it&#x27;s going to be hard so I&#x27;m going to place this on the table here and I&#x27;m going to move the camera towards the meter so you can see it here so here&#x27;s the meter right and here&#x27;s my battery so as you see if I flip the battery with the plus side on the meter you&#x27;ll see the meter well react to that I can make it swing back and forth see I&#x27;m doing this action with my meter that&#x27;s sorry the battery so it&#x27;s reacting to the static field of the battery and it&#x27;s moving the meter if I leave the battery like this the meter is going to move once and then stabilize and then when I take it away poof it goes back in the original Direction now if I do it like with the opposite see all of a sudden it&#x27;s the same I did but reverse so I flip the battery all of a sudden and now the meter works it&#x27;s going the other way it&#x27;s very hard to see I&#x27;m sorry but you could replicate the sun home easily but my point is what we observe here is folks is actual Force that was none as little as it may be folks there was something that moved the meter and there was a force that was exhibited on the meter the meter moved not only did it move from the initial change of static field but it stayed there it aligns with the new field so what I&#x27;m getting at is Not only was there a force to move it but there&#x27;s also a force and if it&#x27;s static you know how can it be keeping the meter in line right because you still have other forces at work here we have something called gravity that still works against this meter physically we have the external Force the magnetic field still coming here but we&#x27;re overriding it with this it still requires a force to counteract the natural force that&#x27;s on this meter that wants to flip it back the other way so not only do you have the force that triggers it but you have the back underlying system that not only moves the meter but keeps the meter in line until you remove the static field now many will argue and say well there&#x27;s nothing there you the battery is normal it&#x27;s a static field and there you only have that initial move once you put the meter and there once you put the once you don&#x27;t move it no more it will stay there unless the magnetic field obviously alternates but my point is it&#x27;s that moment that I took and I put in there the meter swing that doesn&#x27;t take any load off the battery you see what I mean we didn&#x27;t use any any current from the battery okay yes I understand we have to initially charge the battery up to produce the separation of electrons between the positive and negative causing this static field I get that but what I&#x27;m saying is by putting I could put one meter here or 100 compasses and they&#x27;re all Flicker and it&#x27;s not going to take one nanowatt away from this battery yet we have observable physical work the meter spins and not only spins but will stay in place so if the meter stays in place there is still you know there&#x27;s still a four satellite you know what I&#x27;m saying because you still have the Earth&#x27;s forces what not so you have that resistance not only being counteract but it&#x27;s keeping it locked there so there&#x27;s my what I&#x27;m trying to say were the dipole is continuously you know it&#x27;s another system it&#x27;s true the vacuum replenishing over and over and over this energy source or else you know how would the battery not drain and I can repeat this all day with 30 different compasses over and over again you know and the only energy of course I&#x27;m using is my crazy swinging hand here but it&#x27;s again I&#x27;m not talking about over Unity here oh my hand this is such a little work that it to cost me more energy to put the meter under the battery that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m trying to say what I&#x27;m trying to say is we&#x27;re tapping into an actual static energy source we&#x27;re actually getting noticeable work done and it&#x27;s not costing us any of our electrical load in a traditional sense that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m getting that and that&#x27;s more of the manipulation we should be exploiting we should be researching we should be building more Electric circuits and devices around this concept I added the meter it&#x27;s very minuscule but it&#x27;s just to prove the concept that physical work here was done it was maintained it didn&#x27;t take any power from the battery in a traditional sense even though the battery did provide the trigger for it the separation of electrons which created that charge in that static field which then in return but what I&#x27;m saying is and as many times as I go like this this is not an AC system it&#x27;s not going to magically drain my battery yet I still have observable work you want to take this concept even more make a big play put like a hundred of these compasses on and then feed like you know a thousand volt of static on the plane I&#x27;m telling you all your meters are going to swing for that moment at the cost of any electrical work to do that because it had to build the magnetic field anyways as part of the trigger so what I&#x27;m saying is electronics and magnetics they work hand in hand they work together they couple each other they complement each other and all of this folks is in Maxwell&#x27;s original equations if you&#x27;re more interested in this I could list them there&#x27;s like 20 of them and like Tom Bearden says the things you can engineer if you take this into consideration and right before our eyes folks you know how can you deny this and you know I would like to hear more from you and let me know what you think and you know just something to make you say hmm have a good day</p>
