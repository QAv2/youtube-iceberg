            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I&#x27;ve created episodes about UFOs and uaps for the channel a number of times before my first episode titled the truth behind the Super Hornet UFO encounters I described the Fleer imagery obtained by the Super Hornet Pilots that kicked off the current phase of public interest and concern about uaps what you see here and I have used the lantern pod which is a Fleer forward-looking infrared this is at Fleer which is the super Hornets Fleer Advanced targeting for looking in red and flares basically use not heat but heat emits light so it uses a contrast in light to paint the image you can see in this flare footage the uh wizzo in the back seat is able to get a contrast lock and if he loses it he can reacquire it he&#x27;s going between what we call White hot and black hot to establish the lock so sometimes based on atmospherics or whatever the heat signature is it&#x27;s easier to get a contrast lock using white hot instead of black hot or vice versa you see range to the contact you see depression angle you see altitude of the airplane you see air speed all kinds of other stuff on around the perimeter of the display and then also you see they jump between the TV picture and the the Fleer picture so this is undoubtedly something real and the aviators certainly were convinced that it was real and so I have no reason to disbelieve them you know being a guy from a similar career path and then I offer my Matrix of what the Unexplained objects could be it&#x27;s one of three things it&#x27;s either a domestic developmental program or it&#x27;s a near peer so that means basically Russia or China spy program or it&#x27;s aliens but in the three years since I posted that episode the general public is no closer to understanding what those Pilots recorded with their censors in spite of the growing demands of lawmakers that relevant agencies reveal what they&#x27;re hiding the most recent forum for airing those demands happened earlier this week on November 13th when a subcommittee of the House of Representatives oversight committee held a he titled unidentified anomalous phenomenon exposing the truth the subcommittee was chaired by Republican representative Nancy ma of South Carolina among the other lawmakers present were Representatives Robert Garcia Andy bigs and Anna Paulina Luna the Witnesses were Dr Tim gadet a retired rear Admiral who was the US Navy&#x27;s Chief meteorology officer Louise alzando who formerly headed the pentagon&#x27;s advanced Aerospace threat identification program also known as atip author Michael shellenberger and Michael Gold a member of NASA&#x27;s UAP independent study team the previous hearing on the topic of uaps was held in July of 2023 and witnesses that time included US Navy Super Hornet Pilots David fraver and Ryan Graves who both had those encounters with uaps that I mentioned before the Tic Tac and go Fest videos and the third witness at that hearing was Air Force intelligence officer David grush grush got all the Press attention by making Sensational claims of alien vessel crash sites and body retrieval programs Lando&#x27;s atip was replaced by the all domain anomaly resolution office a in 2022 and in February of 2024 following the witness testimony the previous summer and Associated Congressional pressure AO published volume one of the report on the historical record of US Government involvement with unidentified anomalist phenomenon the report States the following one a found no evidence that any us investigation academic sponsored research or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extra terrestrial technology two a found no empirical evidence for claims that the US government and private companies have been reverse engineering extraterrestrial technology for instance an interviewee claimed that a named former military officer explained in detail how he physically touched an extraterrestrial spacecraft was denied on the record by the named former officer who who recounted a story of when he touched an F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter that could have been misconstrued by the interviewee three AO assesses that all of the named and described alleged hidden UAP reverse engineering programs provided by the interviewees either do not exist are misidentified authentic highly sensitive National Security Programs that are not related to extr terrestrial technology exploitation or resolve to an unwarranted and disestablished program four the interviewees and others who have mistakenly Associated authentic sensitive National Security Programs with UAP had incomplete or unauthorized access to these programs discussion of these programs outside of secure facilities presents a high risk of exposing National Security information five a assesses that the inaccurate claim that the US government is reverse engineering extraterrestrial technology and is hiding it from Congress is in large part the result of circular reporting from a group of individuals who believe this to be the case despite the lack of any evidence and six a assesses that some portion of the sighting since the 1940s have represented misidentification of never-before seen experimental and operational space rocket and air systems including stealth Technologies and the proliferation of drone platforms and that gets back to something I discussed during the area 51 episode I did a couple of years ago which is back in the late 19 1950s airline pilots would see something at 880,000 FT tell Air Traffic Control about it and then make a UFO report and then nothing would happen and so they figured this must be some otherworldly phenomenon and then years later they correlated that sighting with an a12 test point and realized that that&#x27;s what they had seen because at the time nothing flew at 880,000 FT the same was true for the F-117 program people would spot a flying triangle a black triangle and they&#x27;d never seen anything like it and then some years later they realized that what they&#x27;d seen was actually the F-117 Nighthawk critics of the February 24 report including Dr gadad claimed that AO was waging a disinformation campaign physicist and intelligence officer Shan Kirkpatrick who was the first head of a at the Pentagon called the cycle of UFO sightings followed by Congressional hearings followed by Pentagon reports followed by claims of a government coverup a quote self licking ice cream cone end quote meaning that regardless of the evidence to the contrary a relatively small group of true UFO Believers promotes the idea that there is a government conspiracy to hide real evidence of aliens because those people stand to benefit from getting the government involved in the business of investigating aliens in an opinion piece at Scientific American Luis Kitano Samari and Juan ballister almost write that the US government UFO cover up allegations derive from in inadvertent or unauthorized disclosures of legitimate us programs or related R&amp;D that have nothing to do with extraterrestrial issues or technology some are misrepresentations and some derive from Pure unsupported beliefs in many respects the narrative is a textbook example of circular reporting with each person relaying what they have heard but the information is often ultimately being sourced to the same small group of individuals with possibly less than honest intentions who promote a whirlwind of Tall Tales fabrication and secondhand or thirdhand retellings all of that brings us to the most recent hearing earlier this week and let me give you some of the highlights the proceedings began with chairwoman mace daring the government to do something to her because she said the name of an unacknowledged special Access program out loud and I would now committee staff asked me to go ahead and I will do it uh to enter into the Congressional Record this 12-page document that Michael shellenberger brought today that describes the immaculate constellation government program um so we will do that now uh every member up here has a copy of it the first section talks about the unacknowledged special Access program called Immaculate constellation and the second section about uh USG imagery intelligence and uh representative Luna just told me if I say Immaculate constellation I&#x27;ll be on some list uh maybe if f a warrant so uh come at me bro I guess then congresswoman mace asked witness shellenberger to Define what Immaculate constellation is is I&#x27;m going to say it again to be very clear Immaculate constellation um what&#x27;s its Mission and how are they funded its mission is to as I stated its mission is to um it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s an unacknowledged special Access program its mission is to document uaps what&#x27;s the key takeaway uh just a few seconds about the M constellation document you provided us today I think that what the American people need to know is that the US milit intelligence Community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information still photos video photos other sensor uh information and they have for a very long time and it&#x27;s not those fuzzy photos and videos that we&#x27;ve been given there&#x27;s very clear high res high resolution how many how many visuals Graphics videos photos I mean I&#x27;ve been told hundreds you know maybe thousands I mean I also wanted to say because there was some there was some conversation around concern around uh the the revealing of these materials revealing the source collections but some of these are shot from helicopters using normal videos of oceans I just think that&#x27;s absurd that somehow you&#x27;re going to be revealing some secret us technology by revealing that you&#x27;ve sh you&#x27;ve photographed orbs off the coast of Kuwait Congressman ma then asked witness alzando what he knows about Immaculate constellation and he gave the classic if I told you I&#x27;d have to kill you response um Mr alzando were you read into the ulate constellation program and I would not be authorized to confirm nor deny the existence of any ongoing or past program especially as it relates to a special Access program either by name or trigraph and hearing that there was the possibility of getting on the wrong side of the law Colorado representative Lauren bobbert stopped by the hearing long enough to say this now that we have all been cautioned in this Committee hearing uh that the mention of pentagon&#x27;s uh Immaculate constellation program could uh put us on a list well um I already find myself on many lists I&#x27;m sure so um I speak my mind often so why not just keep going with it um may as well just go all out and say it the Earth is flat birds are government drones and uh we&#x27;ve never set on foot on the moon and Joe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election so uh let&#x27;s just see how many how many lists we could get on here today Florida representative Anna Paulina Luna asked these questions which included a focus on undersea uaps um this next question is for Mr go uh gadet to your knowledge have any Usos ever outpaced our submarines yes ma&#x27;am at what magnitude uh I don&#x27;t have the exact speed but again a witness came to me a credible submar former submarine officer who uh observed it on on Sonar data and um this was in the 80s in the North Atlantic during storm and uh it outpaced his summary Mar by orders of magnitude are you aware of any hotpots that currently exist off our Shores in North America not with a sufficiently um uh credible data ma&#x27;am okay we&#x27;ve heard reports of there potentially being hotspots maybe maybe enter and or entry and exit points have you heard of any of that uh I have not ma&#x27;am but I my colleague here Mr Alando does discuss some uh Uso activity that he&#x27;s observed in certain DOD data basis uh Mr alzando in regards to these aircraft being piloted by whatever they might be non-human biologics are you would you agree that it&#x27;s likely that they are being piloted by some Mind Body Connection ma&#x27;am I think it is safe to presume here that they are being intelligently controlled because they some cases seem to anticipate uh our Maneuvers and in other cases they seem to um you know I came across an email where the word stocked was used in a uh in a very secure email between Navy officers discussing their ships uh being pursued by a UAP in our previous panel we had grush and he had testified to say that some of these were interdimensional beings can you speak on that at all ma&#x27;am I&#x27;m not qualified certainly as a scientist or otherwise to speculate points of origin um I looked at everything from a scientific perspective so if you look at for example instantaneous acceleration which was one of the observables of the program that I belong to atip um the human body can withstand about 9g forces for a short period of time before you suffer negative biological consequences blackouts and ultimately red outs and even death comparison our best technology the F-16 which is one of this older platform but one of our most highly maneuverable aircraft Mann aircraft made by General Dynamics can perform about 17 or 18 G forces before you start having structural failure meaning that the airframe begins to disintegrate where flying the vehicles we&#x27;re we&#x27;re talking about are performing in excess of 1,000 2,000 3,000 GS so are you I guess would it be safe to infer that they&#x27;re living Craft um you know I&#x27;m not prepared at this point to State for the record um is something alive or not because even that definition is there was a time in science we we thought that um life required oxygen and we now know that&#x27;s not true there anerobic bacteria that thrive in oxygen uh environments that lack oxygen um and also same with photosynthesis when I was in in college I was told every everything is derived from photosynthesis uh as a form of energy um in reality that&#x27;s not true there are things that live off of chemosynthesis so we&#x27;re constantly H uh having to reevaluate our understanding of what what the definition of life is um do any of you ever come across reports from people that claim to have firsthand experiences with these entities whatever they might be or these aircraft and then as a result whether or not their religious find that these things will automatically disappear anyone and this is open to any of you on the panel so just real quick because I&#x27;m running out of time Lou uh ma&#x27;am um I&#x27;ve always been a nuts and bolts kind of guy when I was at a tip um I was focusing more on the performance Char characteristics and less on the the potential occupants okay um the reason I ask is because it seems like just based on our conversations that we&#x27;ve had people that say that there are good and bad of whatever these things are and so my concern from a national security perspective is is a that true B are you guys hearing the reports of that and see I think moving forward in regards to technology Mr Gold if you can answer this real quickly some of these aircraft it seems that they are operating off of energy that we don&#x27;t currently have uh but just yes or no in your opinion if we were able to obtain that would that impact Humanity for the better or negative would certainly save us some money on funding an aremis this is a national security issue that if there is technology out there we&#x27;re not the only country that might have access to it we don&#x27;t want to be on the wrong end of technological surprise and finally Arizona Congressman Andy bigs asked this for what purpose is the federal government over classifying because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing they&#x27;re over classifying and forbidding the public for getting access to this and and if you know if you have an explanation I&#x27;m I&#x27;m curious because um I I know what I&#x27;ve been told I just want to know from your perspective why do they over classify Mr alexand you look like you&#x27;re finger on the butt and ready to go yes sir forgive me um I think there&#x27;s several reasons um I think at the time when this first this this reality became evident to the US government we were um in the middle of the cold war with then Soviet Union and we did not want to tip our hands to what um our knowledge base was on this topic uh we did not want to broadcast that to uh Cold War cold war is long over it is her it is her um there&#x27;s also the philosophical argument that um the Department of Defense and the intelligence Community is solution oriented and when you don&#x27;t have answers it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a really tough spot to be in it&#x27;s easier to be quiet and suppressed than if you don&#x27;t have the answer indeed sir in the wake of this week&#x27;s hearing the new director of a Dr John klosi held a press conference critics like gadet have great hope that klosi will be more forthcoming than his predecessor but the press conference demonstrated that he was just friendlier about saying nothing that would shine any additional light on the UAP mystery he did tease out that there was new information in the forthcoming volume two of the report on the historical record of US Government involvement with unidentified anomalous phenomenon in that same Scientific American opinion piece the authors conclude this many serious people dismiss UFOs as a fringe interest or a pop culture distraction yes they are yet we maintain along with an increasing number of Scholars that there is much to be learned from studying UFO science ings while our own view is that UFOs or UAP emphatically do not represent any truly anomalous physical phenomenon such as an extraterrestrial presence this nevertheless does not consign ufology to insignificance we should explore its meaning rather than seeding it to sensationalistic Advocates employing shotty methodologies and pushing quasi religious otherworldly stories A a o and Academia are thus tasked with an important responsibility that could yield original and fascinating devel elments into how and why people interpret and react to things they see in the sky the other thing to look for going forward is whether or not the Trump 47 Administration coming into office with a mandate to shake things up will actually be able to reveal this here to for hidden information about uaps if say two Congressional hearing Cycles from now we&#x27;re still hearing the same things we just heard then we can deduce that all of this evidence is part of a government program as I suspected in my first UFO episode 3 years ago and that those in charge of the program successfully convinced even the hardest cases set on dismantling the Deep state that making the details public would jeopardize the security of the United States all right that&#x27;ll do it for this episode let me know your thoughts in the comments section below and if you&#x27;re not already a subscriber become one so you don&#x27;t miss anything going forward and in the meantime I look forward to talking to you again very soon [Music] w [Music] [Applause] [Music]</p>
