            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald W SATs founder and chair of the International Society of unified science and president of trans power corporation at commercial custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company we do science engineering management consulting and setup networks today&#x27;s screencasts will of course be about the reciprocal system of theoretical physics and we&#x27;re going to look at ten quote unexplained mysteries of stars and the reciprocal system explanation we&#x27;ll do five of these today and then five the next time this list of ten mysteries comes from the website list first calm December 12th excuse me at December 6 2012 so I will go through these mysteries and then I will explain the reciprocal system solution so here we go and by way this was by Michael Thomas and he says I typically do list on unexplained mysteries which have little scientific proof of existence such as hauntings well that&#x27;s garbage well these tales are fun read and maidens and sugar or two it was fine to me the greatest unexplained mysteries of all are about things that we actually know to exist and which defy everything we know to be possible at least parenthetically according to conventional theory and he continues I am a scientist by trade so it&#x27;s absolutely fascinating to me when I run into something that we can&#x27;t comprehend despite the vast amount of knowledge available to us today outerspace houses the majority of these real mysteries what historic matter and dark energy is there life on other planets the system we&#x27;ll look at ten signs of big mysteries contained within the night sky enjoy okay so the first one this is ten we&#x27;re gonna count down from ten to six today he says the star that shouldn&#x27;t exist soaring questions called SDS sj1 0 to 9 1 5 + 1 7 to 9 to 7 those are coordinates by the way for the record I must refer simply name stars as opposed to one&#x27;s name like this one the other names do serve a purpose though as they are typically coordinates for where to start can be found in the sky just like I said and he continues here in 2011 a team of European astronomers discovered this star in the constellation Leo it is the small star only about 80% the size of our Sun and leave to be around 13 billion years old and I&#x27;m gonna say here right now that&#x27;s just nonsense since the universe as we know it is itself thought to be around 13.7 during the result and that&#x27;s based on the idiotic Big Bang Theory he says this is considered one of the oldest surviving stars nothing is particularly unusual about this star except that according to all our theories you mean he means the conventional theory it shouldn&#x27;t even exist Nisour is made up of 99.9999 3% hydrogen helium but that&#x27;s only on the surface by the way and he says elements that are too light to condense to form store on their own when these figures are put into any store information supercomputer simulation there&#x27;s no it always comes back that such a store is not possible astronomers are puzzled as to how such star could have formed without the aid of heavier elements research is ongoing okay well let me explain that the heavier elements are on the core there&#x27;s gravitational segregation in a story it is nonsensical that the conventional scientists think that hydrogen helium work exists throughout the store and that the surface values are the same as what&#x27;s in the core that&#x27;s nonsense this gravitational segregation the lighter elements are toward the surface and heavier elements or toward the core now as I say here the universe is cyclic there was no Big Bang and there&#x27;s not gonna be heat death and incident those are two singularities singularities should not exist in the physical universe and if there were beginning to our cyclical physical universe then the originals of atoms and atoms would have been dispersed all over the place they wouldn&#x27;t have been concentrated into a dot smaller than that like the conventional sitters say and if there were beginning to our cyclical Universal it meant about approximately 100 billion years ago since since each half of the cycle takes approximately 50 billion years to complete the cycles 100 billion years so it&#x27;s at least 100 million years old not 13.7 billion years old and a spacetime progression accounts for the expansion not so called Big Bang or the so-called dark energy and ok here we go again heavy elements are not created in supernova explosions they&#x27;re created by a neutrino additional lighter elements so the star is perfectly normal it&#x27;s not really a mystery at least it&#x27;s not a message of the reciprocal system ok let&#x27;s go to 9 count down here so the author of this piece continues the Stars surrounded by spirals located four have light-years from Earth in the constellation Lupus si of two zero six four six to gain the attention of astronomers in 2011 what surprised them was not the star itself but what surrounded it it seemed to have spiral arms rotating around it now if spirals are no strangers to space when you know the common formations from galaxies but scientists have never observed one rotating I guess he means rotating around a store before the cause is still a mystery although widely accepted theory is that gravity from planets forming in the dust which orbits the store are responsible for the features how there&#x27;s not enough to support this theory and so planets are actually detected it&#x27;s likely named mr. well I say here in response it&#x27;s possibly a close binary system with one star having considerably more mass than the other and therefore drawing mass from from it or from the interstellar space what&#x27;s really going on you know there&#x27;s not usually a mass transfer between the two stars and binary system the reciprocal system is based on mass accretion it&#x27;s slow but stars gain mass over time they don&#x27;t lose mass they gain mass from interstellar space this happens to be a case where the stars and an area where there&#x27;s a tremendous amount of dust and gas so again it&#x27;s not a mystery to the reciprocal system now let&#x27;s go to number eight the eternally youthful star Messier four or m4 is a globular cluster about seven thousand inner light-years away from Earth if galaxies had human life cycles this monument would be an old-timer talk to my two billion years for any who are unfamiliar with astronomy this believe that all galaxies eventually become globular clusters once all the gas and dust used for star formation has been depleted what nonsense I say parenthetically this means all the stars expected to be very old stars in the late stages of their lifespan this is because I&#x27;m gonna interrupt here the conditional if there&#x27;s think that globular clusters are all whereas in fact they are they are volatile inu they form an intergalactic space they&#x27;re young not won&#x27;t okay so he says this means all sorts of acting very old stars in the laces of their life&#x27;s men well looking at stars in this particular galaxy in September of 2012 a team in Chile found a star rich with a material called lithium lithium is not an uncommon element for a star is a compound which burns off typically within the first three billion years of a star&#x27;s life cycle as most of the surviving stars in this cluster around 10 billion is about finding a star would this element was like finding a needle in a haystack it&#x27;s like a teenager living in a nursing home and just doesn&#x27;t seem to fit so I just think the store may have found a way to actually replenish its lithium supplies which in a way keeps the star from agent many have nicknamed it the Fountain of Youth story exactly how I replenish lithium supply is a complete mystery we&#x27;re still puzzled astronomers today and my response is popular clusters are actually much younger than conventional theory suggested that galaxies form from the combinations of popular clusters of course their elements have you then hydrogen helium and stars if we could peer into their course we would see all kinds of heavy elements lithium is not unusual this saw is something getting lithium from the surrounding dust and gas it&#x27;s on the surface it&#x27;s gonna proceed down into the star below where helium this simple now number step the stars that escaped a crook black hole so the author of this piece goes on this mystery deals with probably several million stars as opposed to just one and only 2.5 million light years away the Andromeda galaxies that closed a spiral galaxy to our own anyone with an Apple computer running Lions should have a good idea of what this galaxy looks like in the center of this galaxy is a supermassive black hole and I chuckle with that like one enormous vacuum cleaner so strong that even light cannot escape and he continues 2005 the Hubble Space Telescope zoomed in on the galaxy&#x27;s core and discovered a blue pancake shaped disc rotating dangerously close to the black hole further analysis showed that this was not just hot dad dust the glow is coming from millions of young blue stars these stars are zipping around the black hole more than 2.3 million miles per hour that is that&#x27;s enough to circle the earth at the equator in only 40 seconds thing about this disc is that given what we believe we know about tidal forces around black holes they should not exist the gas which formed them and the stars themselves should have been torn apart by the immense gravity the black hole how they were able to remain intact in such a close orbit remains a mystery they and the reciprocal system response is black holes are fiction yes there are not constitutions of matter in the Centers of galaxies and we call this matter white dwarf cores different of the explosions here are quite common stars can be ejected out some won&#x27;t leave the galaxy rogue stores or hypervelocity stars others will go into orbit simulators do not and cannot exist what goes into the galactic center eventually comes out the hot blue stars look like Excel are actually old not young okay number six last one today the Siam knees start Swift J eighteen twenty two point three - one six zero six is a special type of star known as a neutron star again it&#x27;s nonsensical located about twenty thousand light-years away in the constellation of of the yuccas these are generally there are generally three ways striking an assignment as white dwarf for small stars like our Sun as a neutron star for much larger stores or is a black hole for the largest again this is conventional nonsense the latter two were formed following the largest explosions known in the universe supernovas are the conclusions there are a few different types of neutron stars a magnetar with the strongest magnetic fields in the universe and a pulsar which beams of electromagnetic radiation from this pole someone like the white house for years everything we knew about these stars told us that they could only become one or the other class never but but in 2011 Swift was discovered to have the properties of both it&#x27;s only the second star found a have such qualities after discovery from another chance before the mystery so I must have no idea how star composite exhibit properties for both stars but the fact that we discovered - and missing years means that they are more numerous than once thought we&#x27;re still no question discovering the secret behind these mysterious stars again this is not a mystery to the reciprocal system and I say in my response here if the parent star I had high concentrations of iron which is quite likely because iron builds up with time the heavier elements build up of course unless they envision you know according to your particular time which the storm is at now the Pulsar here would also have high concentrations of iron it&#x27;s no big surprise when iron is fissioning in a supernova not all the divisions a lot of it is is dispersed into the white dwarf or the pulsar so hence the magnetism it&#x27;s spinning like a spinning magnet the Pulsar is not a neutron star is comprised of atoms just like any other star reciprocal atoms are the size of the so called nucleus of conventional theory incidentally and I bet that eventually spectroscopy cysts will find that in fact pulsars are comprised of normal atoms not nutriments so we&#x27;ll be waiting for that anyway by the way pulsars or their matter eventually leave the galaxies enter the cosmic center white dwarfs eventually moved back to the main sequence so there is no star jet everything in nature is cyclical for some reason my opponents and theoretical physics keep thinking and linear terms from the Big Bang to the heat this is nonsense everything in nature is cyclical okay that concludes the presentation today study the reciprocal system improve it for yourself for the simplest treatment on the reciprocal system see my book the unmistakable work see my work existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system true theory of everything and if you want to apply the theory and scientific and engineering practice I have reciprocal system micro cosmos database and macro cosmos database all these are available at amazon.com and transport comm you can see my other page at Amazon for all of my work thanks for your attention</p>
