            <p>software to die for the proma software Scandal and how the US justice department became software pirates in the name of National Security with Ted St green or teed if you prefer brought to you by Tor camp and TC con.org check them out www media archives.com proudly presents this material thank you for watching also check out www chromis scandal.com see we have a lot of problems you know with civil liberties it&#x27;s become kind of a gray area in uh you know in the entire uh you know hacker SL you know Electronics movement you know you know what&#x27;s crossing the line it used to be years ago you know you couldn&#x27;t do this lecture you know you&#x27;d be end up dead but now things uh it&#x27;s almost like they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve done it you know they they have the control now so cares you know here just do your drugs and have a good time go out and party on the missile base and we&#x27;ll take care of everything else cuz we we&#x27;re the government we&#x27;re here to help cuz we&#x27;re the octopus you know we want to um you know we want to control it and so you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s interesting this definition or something like into an octopus or such as an organization with many forms of far-reaching influence or of control which is basically exactly what this organization that Casto is researching and others he&#x27;s not the only one um and so it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s an interesting definition and so now um we&#x27;re going to shift gears and go to a place uh out in the desert anybody recognize that uh it&#x27;s actually just out of uh outside of Los Angeles on the way to Las Vegas they&#x27;re on Interstate 10 and it&#x27;s the Cabazon Indian reservation and um here&#x27;s another sign of it and uh a lot of people uh and actually they built this really nice casino that we&#x27;ll talk about in a minute but um this casino used to just be like a a a tin out there you know um but what&#x27;s really interesting about Indian casinos is their Sovereign territory and so things that the government or the NSA for an example or whoever the CIA can&#x27;t do legally on American soil quote unquote uh you United States Corporation 1897 um um they can do they can do it no they can do it on Indian land especially poor Indians that don&#x27;t have much better the thing to do you know hey you know work with us and so a lot of this uh a lot of this work that I&#x27;m going to be talking about here that&#x27;s that went on uh happened on various Indian reservations throughout the country um but mostly once again here in California for this particular story here in California at the Cabazon Indian reservation and um and so another uh another aspect of this entire story revolves around a guy named Michael ranoso um there&#x27;s his uh there&#x27;s his photo and um he was basically a uh a child genius uh he we&#x27;ll talk about him more in a minute uh but he basically invented all sorts of things and uh when the so-called octopus or the secret government some people call it um basically uh tied into that uh you know they wanted him on his team but what happens is sometimes you know you can become Expendable as many people in the story this story have U but for some reason he didn&#x27;t become totally Expendable they let him live for some reason but we&#x27;ll talk more about him later and so wow look at this this is actually a picture of the promis software wow um this picture wasn&#x27;t that hard to find but it&#x27;s uh not that uh not that easy and so and so they had trouble finding the original because once again uh what had happened this this leaa this Law Enforcement Administration uh Administration did this contract $10 million contract with this company called inslaw and basically what happened was that they had um they contracted the software and um then um the government got the source code uh and they were using it and there was also several other uh there was some other software here and there um and so but then the government decided for whatever reasons um the people involved with the government I should say government was officially sanctioned to do that uh they decided they weren&#x27;t going to pay all the contract it was like a $10 million contract they paid some of it most of it probably but then the last like million $2 million they decided they weren&#x27;t going to pay it and they weren&#x27;t going to continue to pay any royalties on it because what had happened is that this company inslaw had developed a software um and they basically decide and they licensed it the to the government for use um but they didn&#x27;t license it for modification or anything like that or resale as we&#x27;ll find out later that&#x27;s why in the title this is s the US justice department became software Pirates because not only did they steal the software but then they modified it on the Cabazon Indian Reservation we&#x27;ll talk about in a minute they modified the source code and then started reselling it to probably 150 200 different countries and uh organizations around the world and we sold it to mad they sold it to RCMP in Canada who launched a big investigation to see if they had this pirated software that had been stolen from this other company and went through all the court systems um see if I have any court pictures um but it&#x27;s all a very um it&#x27;s all a very tangled web and people have then made all sorts of flowcharts and diagrams and all sorts of crazy things about all the different um Iran contras and uh drug smuggling from Vietnam into you know all these different areas and and South America um and so people spent a lot of time just like making all the connections here um so but back to the Cabazon and so the Cabazon were this kind of just a rag tag band of Indians and and they were one time only 20 or 30 of them 50 of them maybe 60 of them and they were had some land out there east of east of um east of LA and this guy Michael rudo and some other uhu guy named uh Philip Booth M uh who was it John Philip Booth um John Booth Philip actually um went out there and basically assisted them in having them work with some of these covert Ops that you know basically um uh were performing stuff and so they were able on that Indian Reservation allegedly um if you follow you know the current research at promos scandal.com um you&#x27;ll find that they basically started developing a lot of these exotic weapons and and technologies that um you know were basically unheard of at the time and they really had no other where other place to do it and so ended up a lot of this stuff out in the deserts out in California in fact in this day I have another presentation I do on underground bases around the world really and undersea bases and you know there&#x27;s all sorts of underground bases string between the Los Angeles Bas in there and the Mojave there&#x27;s four or five of them there and then there&#x27;s you know of course Area 51 and the Edward conflex and all that other stuff but that&#x27;s a whole another lecture um but it is interesting to note that uh you know a lot of this technology was developed out in the desert and so back to rudo um he was actually you know as a child prodigy he developed something called the a neutronic bomb and um these are an example of what these Aid neutronic bombs do and they&#x27;re basically fuel fuel air explosives and um and here&#x27;s an example of one of the most powerful bombs in the world at the time um compared to you know the next step up is nuclear you know those little mini nukes that they have um and so at the time this was the way to kill a bunch of people and you know preserve some infrastructure and you know not really you know do fuel air of course today the most powerful bomb is this massive ordinance Air Blast the mo or Moab uh if yeah there you go um and so um so other projects they worked on there that promis was specifically and raudo uh who we&#x27;ll talk about more in in a minute was the programmer who actually uh claimed um that he basically was the one that modified the thing and what&#x27;s interesting we&#x27;ll talk about him in a minute uh more in a minute about what happened to him but in any case so uh so using these Technologies uh this promis likee software they were able to increase like double or triple the distance that they could have satellites out in orbit and still be able to pick up communications and pick up whatever uh thus thus almost of course until a few years ago when the Chinese started shooting satellites down you know at the time you know they we our satellites were Beyond reach of anybody you know now of course you know with anti-gravity propulsion uh you never know and so uh so you know satellites are a big part of this a big part of promis big part of this artificial intelligence software um thing uh I found this on the internet recently you know I have a Blog actually called Truth blog.org uh send your National Security directives to teds adventure.com and so um so I posted this recently my on my blog about somebody who wants to basically develop a GPS tracking system for dissidence um that has a CH killer chip involved and so if you don&#x27;t like what somebody&#x27;s doing uh you just press this button and they fall dead on the ground of course now with you know Strategic Defense Initiative and rail guns and all sorts of things going up in the sky you know that could probably beam a hole in our head anyway you know based on our brain wave frequencies even you know I don&#x27;t know if each of you know this because each of our SK are different different shape and so the resonant frequency of each of our skulls are slightly different and the the emanations or our brain waves are slight and frequenc so just like our fingerprints we all have certain brain wave frequencies that can be tuned in and tracked you know so you know you know that will be the new thing is like brain wave and training whoa okay so uh so they can kill you from space if they wanted to but um and so you know once again we have these advances in technology where um basically uh this promo software was perfect for because it was designed to go out and do this kind of thing get get the raw data bring it back and sort it all out and then spit out some information they could do all the other parts they could bring it all back and sort it out but spitting out useful information at the time was unheard of you know nobody knew what to do with the information and and Promises solved that problem for them and of course today we you know we call it social networking and you know it&#x27;s just real common today and so another thing that that that promise was awesome that was geomatics or um Resource Management as they call it uh going out and like probing you like uh Google Maps you know or Google Earth or or any of these kind of softwares that map terrain and GPS tracking all this stuff is basically what promos was perfect at because this is the kind of data that was involved a lot of data a lot a lot of data and then just a little bit of results but filtering those results exactly what Google does you know filtering those results so that you have usable information at it and of course this goes all into different and you know it basically a six dimensional software package you know doing a lot of GIS along with a lot of filtering lot and actually it&#x27;s a good thing you brought that up because um it&#x27;s not so much the filtering but there&#x27;s a great article on the internet uh and I didn&#x27;t have time to like include it here I&#x27;ll post it on my PDF page eventually but it&#x27;s called the last Circle just Google in quote marks the last Circle and then like promis or something next to it and if you want to know how promis was designed and how it was filtered and how Rono did it all it&#x27;s all right in there of course it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s like 600 Pages if you print it out but but if you just you know if you just find certain commands in there and so once again getting back to these neural networks that I talk about this is like an example of what a God helmet might look like um and so this is also what promis was excellent at it could basically go out and you know process these information from brain wave scans or you know fingerprints or the c i database that you know the FBI all this stuff it&#x27;s exactly what promis did you know 30 years ago and so back to Danny dear old Danny um Danny Castello uh my hero really U without him um none of this would probably come out um he was kind of a recluse unlike Jim Keith who would have been out here Jim Keith would have Lov this I mean he would have been here without a doubt um but unfortunately Danny ended up dead um right in the midst of his investigation on what he called The Octopus and actually the octopus was coined back in 1946 um after the fall of another I forget which Republic or there was some big coup or the the the OSS or whoever the intelligence services at the time had like lost some big thing and they said after that we&#x27;re going to we&#x27;re going to make our own um we&#x27;re going to make our own um organization that controls everything from now on so we don&#x27;t have to deal with this anymore and uh well it wasn&#x27;t the NSA it was like whatever it was this group of people it&#x27;s probably like in the UFO circles it&#x27;s called The Majestic 12 oh Google that term and um coun on Foreign Relations builds yeah that kind of stuff uh but but levels up from that you know levels up like not the top of the pyramid the world King as I call him whoever that may be but you know up the pyramid from you know governments and social orders and things and so basically they didn&#x27;t like you know they don&#x27;t like this story you know that&#x27;s why you know next week I may die in a car crash you know but I accept it I&#x27;ve done my work here um and so uh so Castello is kind of an interesting guy um Castello actually was heavily involved in the computer field I don&#x27;t know if anybody remembers computer age magazine um um but you know one of the very first daily magazines about computers uh was published by a uh magazine called computer age now it&#x27;s known as Information Age info age does the same thing okay but at the time it was known as computer age magazine it was owned by Casto Casto help found it that&#x27;s was his connection without castala we would not have what is the internet</p>
