            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Spy Collection, Digital Edition  where we’re looking at spy artefacts that only   exist in digital format. This is Anastasios  and today we’ll look at a slide deck from the   United States National Security Agency.  An agency that among others has one of   the largest Signals Intelligence, or </p>
<p>SIGINT, organisations in the world.   The slides we are going to see came from  Edward Snowden’s archive. Specifically,   they were publicly released for the first time  in March 2018 by The Intercept in this article.   One of the most stereotypical visualisations  of SIGINT organisations is photographs or large   dishes or domes which hide similar antennas. </p>
<p>Those domes typically have dual purpose,   one is to protect the antennas and the other  is to conceal their technology and orientation.   This a classic SIGINT capability. They are  basically used to receive whatever satellites   of interest broadcast, and then pass that data to  processing centres.</p>
<p>That could be a country’s own   spy satellites sending back data, or any foreign  satellite, commercial or government-operated, that   they want to spy on. This is also why multiple  antennas are needed and in multiple geographical   regions, to be able to capture many transmissions  from various satellites regardless of their orbit.   When that slide deck was leaked, this was part of </p>
<p>NSA’s GAO, or Global Access Operations division   under the Data Acquisition of the Signals  Intelligence Directorate. GAO had the Radio   Frequency Office and in there is where we find  the Foreign Satellites or FORNSAT. And this is   where we start.</p>
<p>As usual, we have reconstructed  the slide deck and here is this version of the   NSA’s “Managing the Challenge” So, the revelations  of that slide deck started quite early with this.   What you see here is a small collection of  commercial companies that offer satellite   communication services. Actually, you might </p>
<p>have heard of some of them like Iridum phones   or Inmarsat, Intelsat, etc. All of them offer  subscription services for anyone to buy phones or   radios that operate via their satellite networks.  Typical users of those are the maritime sector,   search and rescue teams working in disasters or  remote locations, hikers, and others operating   in remote locations.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not  unheard of that criminals, military personnel,   as well as intelligence agencies use them too in  case all other means fail. Especially considering   that this slide deck is from 2013 or so, it is  reasonable to see why the NSA would be interested   in spying on those communications. </p>
<p>That makes them the SATCOM targets.   But how was this done? Using the Foreign  Satellite Communication Exploitation Model.   This model involved a few different stages. The  first was the FSS, or Fixed Satellite Services.   As the title implies, those were things like  antennas, known satellite communications networks   like Intelsat and the former Soviet Union’s </p>
<p>satellites, other private satellite networks,   as well as a project that the FIVE EYES were  running between 2007 and at least until 2013, the   SV. SV or SHAREDVISION was a FIVE EYES project to  expand their satellite collection by adding more   antennas and utilising more sites around the globe  for better coverage on all satellite broadcasts of   interest.</p>
<p>As mentioned, some of those commercial  providers also offered mobile satellite services,   so that was the second target. The MSS, or  Mobile Satellite Services. So, assuming all   that infrastructure is in place and is collecting </p>
<p>broadcasts of interest, then comes the S&amp;S.   The Search &amp; Survey. The screenshots that you see  under the “GET IT” column were from a FIVE EYES   exploitation system codenamed as DQ, or DARKQUEST.  This was part of the SHAREDVISION that we already   talked about and what was doing was inspecting the  received data and making automated analysis on the   type of data.</p>
<p>For example, it could identify that  this was a phone call, that was a VPN connection,   this is a message, etc. In the SIGINT world, this  kind of tooling is referred to as automated survey   system. With this information at hand, the S&amp;S </p>
<p>model moves to the second stage, the “KNOW IT”.   Here the slide shows us that the collected  satellite communications are processed in the   EKB, this likely stands for Exploitation  Knowledge Base, and it has dual purpose.   One it is to add the newly acquired information,  and the second to correlate it with any existing   information. And finally, all that information </p>
<p>was available to the FIVE EYES SIGINT   analysts via a tool known as GLOBALVIEW.  You can see some screenshots of it here.   And that was how FORNSAT exploitation was executed  by the NSA and the rest of the FIVE EYES in 2013.   However, the presentation goes one step further,  giving us some real-world success stories of it.   Actionable SIGINT. In the world of spies, </p>
<p>actionable intelligence means an intelligence   product, like a report, that the recipients  can use to take an action against a target.   For example, details that can lead to the the  capture or assassination of an individual,   what exactly a foreign politician has  in his agenda for an upcoming meeting,   where will a person of interest be and when,  etc.</p>
<p>And the first example, was Mullah Dadullah   Lang who was a Taliban military commander and in  2007 was killed in Afghanistan. As we read in this   official NATO press release: As reported earlier  today by the Government of Afghanistan, Mullah   Dadullah Lang left his sanctuary into Southern  Afghanistan where he was killed in a US-led   Coalition operation supported by ISAF.</p>
<p>Well,  now we know that what led to his assassination   was foreign satellite exploitation. Meaning, he or  some of his associates, used a satellite phone to   communicate and that was picked up by the NSA who  made an intelligence package and passed it to the   coalition forces.</p>
<p>The next case study was Harun  Fazul. An Al-Qaeda leader from East Africa,   operating mainly in Kenya, who later became  an Al-Shabaab commander in Somalia too. He was   killed in Mogadishu, Somalia on June 7th, 2011 </p>
<p>while driving with another terrorist a car with   large amounts of cash in US dollars, electronic  devices, and fake passports. They were stopped   in a Somalia military checkpoint in Sarkuusta and  tried to escape. The soldiers killed both of them.   Based on this and the leaked NSA slide, we can </p>
<p>assume that the NSA had detected Harun Fazul’s   movements via foreign satellite exploitation,  passed the intelligence to the relevant U.S.   forces in Somalia and worked with the Somali  military to stop that car in that checkpoint.   Next Abdelmalek Droukdel was an Algerian  leader of Al Qaeda in Morocco and later became   the leader of the Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,  or AQIM.</p>
<p>He was also arrested and actually in 2020   he was killed in a French special operations  mission in Mali, Africa. And here we have Nader   Shah who was arrested. The JFK airport terrorist  from 2007.</p>
<p>That was a plot to blow up a system   of jet fuel supply tanks and pipelines that feed  fuel to the JFK International Airport in New York.   The plot involved 5 people and in the  photo shown here is Kareem Ibrahim who   was sentenced to life in prison. Suicide bombers  were arrested via foreign satellite exploitation,   and at last, the UK Airport Terrorist which </p>
<p>almost certainly refers to the the two   individuals behind the Glasgow Airport attack in  June 2007 that were also arrested. In this case,   a jeep loaded with propane canisters was driven  at the glass doors of the Glasgow Airport terminal   and set ablaze. And what did the NSA exploit for </p>
<p>most of those cases was the commercially available   Inmarsat constellation of satellites. This  is known, even to this day, as I-4 and it   provides Internet and telephony connections  anywhere on Earth, except the polar regions.   Back when this slide deck was written, the  official I-4 satellites’ description was:   Geosynchronous constellation providing mobile </p>
<p>communications at sea, on land and in the air.   BGAN stands for Broadband Global Area Network  and is a global satellite network with telephony   owned by Inmarsat using portable terminals.  FleetBroadband is a maritime satellite internet,   telephony, SMS and ISDN network for ocean-going  vessels using portable domed terminal antennas.   SwiftBroadband is an internet communications  network that provides an ‘always-on’ data   connection for aircrafts globally.</p>
<p>And ISatPhone  is Inmarsat’s handheld satellite phone.   So, those were the products that the company was  offering at that point. Actually, most of them   exist to this day too. But how did the NSA took </p>
<p>advantage of this company’s satellite services?   Via a program codenamed SEADIVER. As we’re  reading: SEADIVER is a system that collects,   processes, and forwards voice, fax and data  traffic transmitted over the INMARSAT-III   satellite systems from Foreign Satellite  and SCS/TRYST collection facilities.   SCS stands for Special Collection Service and </p>
<p>it was a covert joint operation between the NSA   and CIA to utilise US embassies around the world  to collect signals intelligence. Basically,   CIA has presence in most, if not all  US embassies, so the NSA made a secret   agreement with CIA to install SIGINT equipment  in those embassies to collect communications.   In a similar manner, TRYST was a codename for </p>
<p>British GCHQ spies operating clandestinely   in UK’s foreign embassies. Just like the SCS case,  TRYST was a joint covert operation to install   covert SIGINT equipment to collect communications  in those embassies. So, the NSA could use theirs   and their allies SIGINT stations as well as </p>
<p>embassies to install this spying equipment   to receive satellite communications, and it was  called the SEADIVER. Next was a program codenamed   ZODIACARRAY which is described as: the system  that targets Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN),   a digital service providing rates of up to 492  kbps.</p>
<p>It is IP based activity to include voice.   It is transmitted over the INMARSAT-IV satellite  systems. So, ZODIACARRAY was used to spy on the   BGAN product on Inmarsat and the last one was,  CANYONDUST. It says: It is a ground based INMARSAT   mobile terminal geolocation system that computes </p>
<p>geo-locations on all INMARSAT M, mini-M, M4, B,   and C terminals, within its coverage region. The  geo-locations are performed on the registration,   access request, response bursts, or SCPC. The  coverage region is defined as an area that is   serviced by at least two INMARSAT satellites. </p>
<p>This is a very interesting capability since the   NSA was able to use CANYONDUST to identify the  exact location of the terminal that was used to   communicate with the INMARSAT satellites. We can  assume that while doing the operations mentioned,   like access request, response bursts, or  Single Channel Per Carrier satellite links,   the data included the coordinates of the terminal </p>
<p>or something similar for the mentioned models,   thus allowing the NSA to know exactly where they  are physically located during the communication.   And that was this small slide deck on how the NSA  was exploiting commercial satellite communications   products for signals intelligence. We  went through the the Foreign Satellite   Communication Exploitation Model, the Search &amp; </p>
<p>Survey methodology, and even briefly described   several previously unknown SIGINT programs like  the SHAREDVIEW of the FIVE EYES, DARKQUEST,   GLOBALVIEW, CANNYONDUST and others.  We even saw how US and UK embassies   were clandestinely utilised to install covert  SIGINT equipment for satellite exploitation,   and finally, how even a private company,  like Inmarsat in this case, has to be putting   security first since minor issues could expose </p>
<p>even the exact location of their customers.   The next time you come across a satellite  product, an embassy with some concealed antennas,   or even while browsing the internet  in a cruise ship or an airplane,   keep in mind that someone could be  listening... Nothing is as it seems</p>
