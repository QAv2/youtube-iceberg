            <p>all right hello everyone I&#x27;m Thomas welcome to my channel uh primarily an educational Channel and today we are doing our 98th video on the reciprocal system of theory and uh this was uh discovered and uh refined by Mr Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 and uh he had his first uh intuitions about all of this about 1930 developed the theory over about uh 20 25 years through um induction and then uh came out with his fundamental postulates and uh the gist of it is that in Larson&#x27;s universe uh the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other meaning that they are basically inversions of one another the same way that three halves and two-thirds are reciprocals of one another and therefore they have the same qualities space is uh multi-dimensional three or more dimensions and so is time time has got three or more dimensions and um time is always flowing and progressing so it&#x27;s getting later and later and therefore true space is always flowing and progressing and things are always getting farther and farther apart uh observed by the Hubble telescope in the recession of the distant galaxies and uh so then um uh space and time are also quantized meaning that there is a uh only this they only come in discrete units there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space there&#x27;s no fractional units there&#x27;s no continuity there it&#x27;s all chunks little chunks of space and time uh although it&#x27;s not seen that way because space and time are only uh in motion uh so they only appear together you don&#x27;t see you know Space by itself or Time by itself they are always um you know accompanying each other and um but one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light the speed of light uh in Larson&#x27;s Universe of motion is the uh null point or the uh neutral point the midpoint the origin of uh Larson&#x27;s universe um unlike Einstein who says that the speed of light is the max speed of the Universe um the speed of light is the midpoint so there is an entire half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and then there is the Larson calls that the cosmic sector or sector two and then there&#x27;s half of the universe that we&#x27;re familiar with that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light uh Larson calls that the material universe or sector one and this is the universe of atoms and molecules and uh of matter material atoms and molecules and um because over on the cosmic side there are cosmic atoms and molecules um and that&#x27;s an important part of the reciprocal system what goes on in sector one is also going on in sector two except that you have to invert the uh time space relationships so over here you basically have space over time relationships and over here you basically have time over space relationships but over here in sector one you have your uh you know the common chemistry and physics of that we&#x27;re familiar with and um things uh grow by bonding aggregation up until their most complex level which Larson uh refers to as DNA a DNA molecule has several billion atoms and uh at that point it becomes eligible to be taken control of by a sector two entity um and the combination in the right uh proportion at the right configuration of a material and Cosmic uh Cosmic entities are what Larson calls the life unit so life is a combination of Imperial and Cosmic sector thing like manifesting over here and sector one and then that life unit uh which is you know controlled by sector two entity in the same way that uh a thermostat controls a room that sector two entity is just a tiny part of that life unit but it controls it and it motivates it towards survival and uh that sector 2 entity evolves and develops over time from the single-celled organisms like the amoebas and so on uh all the way up to the most complex level which is the according to Larson the intelligent human being and this intelligent human being at that point becomes eligible to be taken control over again by a sector 3 entity now sector three uh is in my view pointing at that uh midpoint there the speed of light boundary uh the origin uh this is what Larson calls the metaphysical region or sector three the area outside or beyond space and time and other people would usually call this the numinous or the religious or god or goddess or God&#x27;s um and uh it has to do with um in it controls and it motivates toward ethical Behavior or good behavior just Behavior right behavior and uh sometimes sector three is in competition or conflict with sector two uh in some many cases they work at they work the same they work in uh in harmony with one another but there are situations where uh you know our motivation toward good behavior is and cross purposes with our motivation towards survival and at that point the human being is kind of caught in the middle and needs to make a decision which is like a free will decision now the free will uh the sector 3 component communicates with humans um intelligent humans in many different ways but they&#x27;re all really the same they&#x27;re all sector three communications uh depending on their complexity uh and their form uh you have your ESP intuition uh religious Revelation scientific Insight beatific Visions uh probably a few others these are all Communications from sector three and um these communications are all correct and all all pointing us toward ethical Behavior but our ability to translate those messages and understand those messages is severely limited we have to look at ourselves as kind of like single celled spiritual organisms uh in the same way that an amoeba or whatever is a single-celled life organism we&#x27;re just getting started on our path on our spiritual path and so as a result we&#x27;re not able to understand these communications uh that well those of us who have prepared who have studied who have gotten ready and and tried to learn how to translate these messages are you know have a better chance uh and some of the messages are simpler than others depending on what kind of messages you&#x27;re getting if you&#x27;re looking for religious Revelations or scientific Insight the uh the level of preparation that is necessary uh is pretty high but the bar is pretty high to be able to understand those messages simple everyday intuitions uh have a much more Universal uh understanding okay now what we&#x27;re doing here with Larson is we&#x27;re looking at his final book uh that came out after he died in 1995 called the beyond space and time and so as you might guess this has to do with this sector three or this metaphysical region this is his only book that goes into metaphysics into philosophy religion and psychology um most of his earlier books have to do with uh chemistry and physics and astronomy and um we are in the middle of chapter 24 and this is called east and west and this has to do with kind of contrasting between the eastern and western approaches to sector three contact and how um in the uh because prior to this he hadn&#x27;t really delved into uh the characteristics of sector three he just talked about it as good and good behavior and that it has uh Divine qualities but did doesn&#x27;t really go into uh what those qualities are and what the what the ramifications are so um he just got done talking about how Eastern religions in general uh have a cyclical view of the universe whereas the Western religions are more of a linear View and he says that Eastern religions uh the uh the Ultimate Reality uh the cyclical view of the Ultimate Reality that is common to Eastern religions is correct as far as it goes thus the revelations sector 3 Communications from which this view was derived were in this respect authentic now we&#x27;re going to get into the Western meanwhile the Western religions this is Larson by the application of reason to the information derived from their authentic Revelations together with that derived from experience have extended their view of religious reality into the metaphysical region on the basis of this broader Viewpoint they have arrived at an interpretation of the religious aspect of religious of human life as a one-way progression toward higher levels that are independent of the physical universe this too is in agreement with the findings of the preceding Pages the apparent disagreement between East and West is due to the fact that each is concentrating its attention on a different part of existence as a whole by rejecting or at least minimizing abstract theoretical inquiry into religious subjects the people of the Orient have restricted the scope of their religious understanding in much the same way that they have until very recently limited the extent of their advances in scientific and other fields on the other hand the people of the West have been to some extent Carried Away by their enthusiasm over the discovery of the Transcendent reality and have tended to concentrate their attention on the Hereafter at the expense of the religious aspects of the Here and Now a self-defeating policy inasmuch as the only way by which sustained progress can be made toward the ultimate goal is through experience in dealing with the problems of Earthly life one of the significant results of the difference between the cyclic cyclical and linear concepts of human Destiny is a strong contrast between the attitudes of the Eastern and Western religions toward The Human Condition Western religious thought recognizes that the world is full of unpleasant and undesirable things but nevertheless regards human life on the whole as a reasonably enjoyable experience one of the primary human objectives as seen from this standpoint is to make this experience still more rewarding Eastern religious thought on the other hand regards um human life on the whole as difficult and disagreeable and emphasizes the existence of widespread suffering the first Noble Truth of Buddhism is the existence of suffering the second of these Noble Truths is that the suffering is due to man&#x27;s desires the remaining two stress the repression of these desires as the way of release from suffering similarly for the Hindu the good is not to be gained by manipulating nature altering Society or seeking pleasure for ourselves there is no indication that the actual conditions of life for the ordinary individual during the time when the major religions were in the process of formation were significantly different in one part of the world than in another but the linear view is inherently optimistic the religions of the West have diluted this optimism to some extent by raising the Specter of a final judgment but even so the individual has a certain amount of control over his ultimate Destiny and can at least see some promise of a better future the cyclical Outlook uh on the contrary is inherently pessimistic and uh he&#x27;s quoting a um a Westerner talking about Eastern religions to be endlessly bound to an endless wheel to be ground upon the road of life not once or twice or a thousand times but repeatedly and forever with all responsibility fault and error ceaselessly accumulating to one&#x27;s discredit is not a pleasant Prospect um and back to Larson with this kind of a prospect facing him the most that a person can hope for is some kind of a release mechanism that will liberate him from the Perpetual cycle such a release was the original goal of the major Eastern religions the goal of life in Hinduism Buddhism and Jainism is essentially the same maksa Liberation is the ultimate objective for Hinduism and Jainism and Nirvana is the goal in Buddhism the precise meanings of Liberation vary among the different schools but even among those within the framework of Buddhism and Hinduism but uh even among those within the framework of Buddhism and Hinduism but the essential meaning of both maksha and Nirvana is emancipation or Liberation from turmoil and suffering and freedom from rebirth that&#x27;s actually a quote from Radha Krishna the only Escape back to Larson the only Escape Route that is fully consistent with the cyclical theory of existence is extinction of the human personality either by total Annihilation or by absorption into some kind of a cosmic Essence and some of the Eastern beliefs particularly the earlier ones and those such as hiniana Buddhism that have maintained the earlier doctrines relatively unchanged Define their Nirvana or Maxa in terms that amount to or approximate Annihilation but this is not an attractive Prospect and as a result of the general General desire for more acceptable alternative together with the influence of contact with the linear religions of the West the earlier views of the human fate have been modified in most of the current religion versions of the Eastern religions the Nirvana of Mahayana Buddhism for example is described uh as a state of wonderful Heavenly Bliss on the question of human Destiny then the East-West test is inconclusive because of the basic difference between the linear and cyclic viewpoints this question will be examined in more detail uh in a few chapters this basic conceptual difference likewise accounts in large part for the wide discrepancies between the teachings of the different religions with respect to the existence of a deity and the nature thereof where the existence is asserted all of the major religions except the earliest versions of Jainism and Buddhism are theistic at least in the sense that worship of something or someone is a religious requirement but there is a bewildering diversity of views as to the number the nature and the powers of the deities the tendency to deify the founder of the religion is very marked and extends even to those cases where the founder explicitly denied any such status like the theoretical development in this present work the East-West test leaves all questions in this area unanswered East and West agreed that there is something in human life that is physically indestructible it is also agreed that there is some kind of a relationship between this indestructible human characteristic and the inherently metaphysical existences there is no consensus as to the nature and extent of that relationship but the amount of agreement that does exist is sufficient to confirm the theoretical conclusion that there is a non-physical component of the human personality all of the religions of the world uh this is a quote all of the religions of the world have the teaching that the spiritual life of the human individual continues Beyond physical death however the various religions differ widely concerning the details in their picture of the future life and even concerning the desirability of a future life okay back to Larson a similar lack of consensus is seen in the attitudes toward evil some religions see little evil in the world others regarded as inherent uh in physical and human existence and mainly Beyond human power to modify still others regard evil as an antagonist uh against which religion must continually do battle the concept of sin which is closely related to evil and Krishna thought is not so correlated in most other religions neither Buddhism which sees evil in all existence nor Hinduism which regards evil as illusory concedes the existence of sin in the Christian sense thus the Christian concept of the essential sinfulness of man and the need for some kind of an expiatory action either by himself or by a surrogate to achieve harmony with the higher existence gets no support from the East-West test the same is true of the problem of evil that looms so large in the thinking of Western people too many uh says John hick the most powerful positive objection to belief in God is the fact of evil but none of the Eastern religions accept the premises in terms of which this problem is stated in the West okay that&#x27;s it uh talk to you tomorrow</p>
