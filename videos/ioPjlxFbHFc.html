            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In 1957, a Russian scientist named Evani Pletenov claimed he had achieved the impossible. He built a rotating superconducting disc in his laboratory and claimed it reduced the weight of objects above it by 2%. He called this the gravity shielding effect. It was anti-gravity. If this discovery was true, it would rewrite physics and eliminate all rocket travel in favor of silent energyfree propulsion.</p>
<p>The paper was published, but it was immediately dismissed by the global scientific community. The initial funding for follow-up research was abruptly terminated by unknown agencies. The laboratory itself was quarantined and the entire project was deemed unreproducible. Was the experiment truly flawed or was the gravity shielding effect deemed too disruptive to the global economy and fossil fuel markets? The entire field of electrogravity was subsequently banned from most academic funding. The anti-gravity room still exists locked away under heavy regulation.</p>
<p>Now follow to unlock more forbidden science.</p>
