            <p>hello i&#x27;m dr ronald abusatz founder and chair of the international society of unified science and this is part two of my paper space-time dimensions and natural unit values of fiscal quantities if you haven&#x27;t played part one i suggest you do that first before resuming with part two we&#x27;re discussing magnetic units and we&#x27;re at magnetic polarization now this is this has the same dimensions as magnetic flux density so as usual we have natural unit values expressed in second squared per centimeter to the fourth see just highs and zero same squared and levers per meter squared that&#x27;s for the time space region and then similarly for the time division i&#x27;m going to go pretty fast through all the pages of this paper so be sure to download free copy at transparent.wordpress.com where you can study at your own pace magnetic induct inductance my recent uh consistency with the resistance units only the time space values apply here so you can see that conduction is the same dimensions as mass action unit value fsi comes out to be one point three four three nine out of eight times in the minus four henrys and here we have a check on energy calculations magnetization has the same dimensions that natural units as magnetic field intensity map very much the knight reluctance is the inverse of inductance and here&#x27;s a supplement on maxwell relations this is this expression that one of the square root of the free permittivity times the free permanent ability as space-time of course comes out to be the speed of light and you can see the calculations here incidentally the natural unit ratios and the conventional ratios are quite a bit different you can see that the si relations in particular are very arbitrary now we move on to thermal units temperature uh the gas constant is given and avocados number is the postman&#x27;s constant is calculated here we have national unit of energy is therefore the natural meaning of gas temperature is given by this expression here and that&#x27;s 7.202 to say times 10 over 12 kelvin larsen&#x27;s always slightly different it&#x27;s doing this thermal energy of radiation is proportional to the fourth power of temperature this is known as the stephen boltzmann law and thermal motion reaches the condition boundary of the thermal energy becomes proportional to the third power of the temperature and it&#x27;s for the vapor state the natural integral is 4.396 3157 okay larson points out reference two phase 59 that thermal motion is the motion of matter and involves the 29th vibrational addition to the rotationally distributed linear motion of the atoms this reduces the effective temperature by the factor one plus two divided by nine so with this modification we now get that the vape natural value vapor temperature is 3.597 244 times 79 okay mean answering the boltzmann constant we can keep using larson&#x27;s values again the differences and so not only this is this right here is used in stellar energy generation calculations for all the condensed states of matter of solids and liquids we reduce the above three dimensionally in each of one dimensional basis so for liquids and solids natural temperature comes to 510.742549 kelvin 10.8 kelvin again it&#x27;s close enough and both values are displayed too specific heat per mole and here&#x27;s the calculation and so we get for a nigel gas it&#x27;s two point seven nine zero one eight seconds percent and we&#x27;ll just pronounce okay and this comes out today two point nine eight zero three hundred cal per mole per gallon or twelve point four seven eight one two nine joules per mole per count note the specific heat at constant pressure i was saying that&#x27;s within the specific heat of constant volume for an ideal gas it&#x27;s equal to this constant specific constant pressure for an ideal gas calculations here and just it&#x27;s well known that the maximum thermal specific heat results is three times r which is equal to two natural units and this is also the basis for the specific heat calculation with c reference two microns ten different sauce in liquids the specific heat of constant pressure is really more fundamental the molar guys were specific enthalpy gas vapor solid liquid that pepper sauce and liquids there&#x27;s a little difference in specific heat of constant pressure and constant volume the specific heat of the constant pressure is just a little higher specific material energy for gas vapor and liquid so much of their family calculations and obvious episodes like this actual internal energy it&#x27;s just a little less than that specific molar entropy naturally you know specifically is the same as natural specific heat all right no more resistance this is the derivation here uh incidentally both thermal currents and electrical currents normal ordinary occurrence of degeneration electrons the difference is that in thermal currents the electrons cycle back the mountain within the same leg of the circuit whereas they do not electrically resistance there&#x27;s no distinction here between time space region time region the mass is charged as electrons in the slope of the gas thermal conductance is the inverse of thermal resistance thermal resistivity is thermal resistance times distance as with electrical disability here we have times the time value of space here we have this common unit used in practice is kelvin centimeter per watt giving imagination 0.213953 connectivity is inverse of thermal resistivity the common unit in practice is water for kelvin centimeter keeping international 4.673 and i&#x27;ll diffusivity by definition gases and time space reaching those highs and solids liquids now i move on to photonic units and i state here that reference six pages 12 to 14 gives a good review against units these are defined for large numbers of photons and so only the time space region drops first off we have energy of the frequency photon and finally get that it&#x27;s two points one zero seven three one percent when it&#x27;s getting germs in terms of dbase this equals 6.25.6 which is there now in terms of segments percentage that it&#x27;s got to be the same as before meaning energy pressure is to find this ratio of energy radiation falling on the surface to the area of the surface subscript e used here in here on out this paper can mean either exposure or emitted that&#x27;s the context which determines the script stay your beliefs were absorbed or finished so please keep that in mind an influx is defined as the ratio of radiation energy to the time interval the radiation transfers exceeds the previous oscillations okay luminosity is defined as the ratio of the radiant flux to the surface area from which this the radiance is an absorption it&#x27;s the ratio of radiant flux to the area by which this radiance is absorbed it says same natural looks as luminosity radiant intensity for steroiding is defined as the ratio of the radiant flux of the source to a solid angle of magnet which you go to disturb within which this radiation is propagated and incidentally cantaloupe which is an older unit is equal to one over 693 joules per second we&#x27;re still waiting there for the national human cannabis is six point seven zero zero one seven two times then to the eighth kilometers the common candle emits cannibal energy brightness for steroiding is defined as the ratio of gradient intensity of the surface element to the area of the projection of this element upon applying perpendicular to the observed direction there you have it guys luminous flux for solid angle once the rating is defined as the product of the white intensity and the solid and so now we eliminate the sequence of one candle at times this energy is equal to the luminous bloods produced over time during which the meaningless flux is submitted or perceived and actually it&#x27;s very cool naturally that number it&#x27;s simply times one story brightness in given direction phi holding this surface is defined as the ratio of luminous intensity in this direction in relation to the area of projection and they&#x27;re sufficient on a plane perpendicular to that direction we assume here they&#x27;re fine luminance radius is defined as the ratio when it is fluctuated by a luminous surface in relation to its area the illuminance is defined as the ratio of limits likes following the supersonic relation to the earliest element and this is absorption this is not only a lexus equivalent luminous exposure is defined as the luminance produced over time too during which the radiation occurs okay the taste here the photonic units now we have an interesting section around interconversion units given that all physical quantities may be expressed in space-time units it&#x27;s possible to convert units in one group of units to the use of another group we&#x27;ll give just two examples we have mass and inductance it&#x27;s tcp achieved over s b cubed so if we take the ratio expressed as kilograms to enemy you get one point two three four nine five times in the minus twenty third so obviously the enemy is really much smaller mechanical force and voltage share the same spacetime dimensions it&#x27;s t sub u divided by s and u squared and here we calculate that it&#x27;s three point five one four two zero six seven it&#x27;s ten to the minus twelve newtons per volts now we come to our summary table and working on our reciprocal system i and all of you will be making use of this table constantly i had it all arranged correctly i give the physical quantity here symbol here space time dimensions reciprocal system actually unit value stated in terms of centimeters second then stated in one cgs units and then stated last night units so this summarizes the whole paper i&#x27;ll just skim through this here there&#x27;s some notes on the table that is given to six decimal places but there&#x27;s uncertainty in fifth and sixth places this is so because there&#x27;s uncertainty in the true value of the speed of light the number of hydrogen frequency there&#x27;s number of volts etc which have been used in converting from the nashville institute of conventional humans two diets may be slightly different from those in other reciprocal system papers and books the differences that are the minimum three and some cells ocean and values are given again differences are dynamics four some physical quantities have only time space region values others have time region values and solvers have but and five given large number symbols are some duplications context determines which is conclusion reciprocal system supersedes all the physical theories and dimensional systems unlike other systems in the reciprocal system all physical quantities are expressed in some space s and time t only mass and charge therefore are derived quantities as everything else this paper adds to existing reciprocal system literature and providing the natural unit values and cgs and outside not only the mechanical electrical quantities but also the magnetic and thermal and photonic quantities our community tables included summarizing the percents acknowledgments funding for this work came from my company transpower corporation of course great thanks go to judy larson who served as my theoretical physics mentor from 1965 until his death in 1990 it was by far the most intelligent and most logical of any individual i&#x27;ve ever met and then we have references first uh larson&#x27;s first two books here and an xbox handheld version of fundamentals which is a very good description of dimensional systems and various physics books etc some of my papers come next and let&#x27;s go to the appendix one determination reciprocal system naturally die for atomic remember in diameter reciprocal system there are no circulating electrons around a nucleus the size of the atom is the same as the size of the so-called nucleus of conventional theory see reference algorithm for the derivation of reciprocal system of particle scattering equations the impact parameter which is the effective radius of the target atom is given by this expression here b where kg is the polishing coefficient in case of the energy of the alpha theta&#x27;s result results in scattering that proportion coefficient is expressed that&#x27;s three factor ln t m depends on the rotation here that&#x27;s the target importance here what we&#x27;re looking for is the coefficient for the equation the usual alpha part of the energy is 7103 times 10 minus 13 joules or 4.39 million electron moles these value phases usually said the point is 6.5 degrees to determine the effective sizes which are gonna happen therefore that&#x27;s statement plugging the numbers in and calculate that the diameter is three point three five nine times the minus 15 meters which is that i used in the paper properly we saw this value together with the calculation of l and t m so i spot on the diameter which we&#x27;re very close to this guy 35 2 times r0 times a which is the atomic mass up to one-third power the nucleus of the conventional theory of so-called family rate is next so we&#x27;re very close here now pennies too special dimensions where the atomic distance calculation is in the time region recently explains this very clearly in reference to pages six and seven as explained in introducing the concept of the time timing and chapter eight of volume one space one over t places space in the time region and velocities are from one over t squared energy the one dimensional equivalent of the mass which takes the place of mass in the time region expression force equation because three rotations of the atom x separately rather than jointly in this region is the reciprocal of this expression or t squared acceleration&#x27;s velocity divided by time one over t cubed the time regional equivalent of the equation f equals m a for the purpose of an atomic distance calculation is therefore f equals e times a becomes t squared times whatever t cubed is one over t in each distance reflection the reader can follow the remainder of the discussion reference too and nanotechnology force can be applied to individual atoms in the time machine and the cryptid natural unit would be f sub t u c g s or c t u s i it&#x27;s going to be paper proper but this force must be added to the anatomic force given by resistance expression that concludes this
