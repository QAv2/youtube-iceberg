            <p>welcome to video two in the expanded series of time and here we&#x27;ll look into a different form of the duality of matter and that is to take the idea of two universes that were introduced in the first series and look into it in a more rigorous fashion influences on my ideas so for many years there were two main influences on my concepts of electrodynamics and time and the first was tesla now tess is the one that will probably be most familiar to you tesla designed our electrical system as we know it and understands maxwell&#x27;s equations very well after tesla was finished with designing the electrical system at the end of the 19th century he focused his attention on some experiments and he said that this new these new experiments revealed a new form of electricity to him and he said that this was a non-herzian form of electricity he called this new form of electricity magneto-dielectric waves and this form of electricity behaved differently than the electricity defined by maxwell&#x27;s equations and so tesla opened my mind to new possibilities in electrodynamics and in physics the second influence was a book written by bearden called energy from the vacuum and in here um tom bearden writes a lot about the standard electrodynamics but focuses on times in ways i had never seen before and he triggered my own insight into electricity and magnetism tom spoke of mass and mass time and the inverse relationship between energy and space and energy and time and in these discussions he reiterated repeatedly that the energetic the energy density of time is c squared to that in space he said atomic energy is energy from time and because he focused a lot on the equations uh of maxwell and the shortcomings he opened my mind to different perspectives and he also linked back to tesla so he he had great admiration for tesla and tried to put in equation form what tessa was doing but never quite achieved it so the third major influence is dewey larson i came across a used book called nothing but motion by dewey larson in a second-hand bookshop in the book larson details his theory on an alternative universe of matter that is coupled to ours he called his theory the reciprocal system theory and i was immediately taken by his version of an internal alternative coupled universe that of multi-dimensional time since so many aspects fit how i imagine the dimensions the universe would be linked to our our existing universe he took the idea of motion the link of space to time and extrapolated to a whole new view of matter he did a tremendous amount of work linking our universe in this alternative universe to how matter behaves for those interested you don&#x27;t need his book since his information is available at www.reciprocalsystem.org but there was a part that i struggled with and i say that this was my personal experiences not necessarily a universal experience i have no idea and these were the postulates that his theory was based on and how it was presented i reviewed his material many times because for me there were significant insights but also significant challenges based on that i chose to approach larson&#x27;s very clever concept of two reciprocal universes in very different way based on the ideas i developed from previous decades of research into these topics and the influences as i mentioned before of tom bearden and nicola tesla so this is my personal approach that i&#x27;ll detail in the rest of these slides i&#x27;ll make a note here i have no association with the organization that presents the material on the the internet and i have had no communication so these are all my own personal approaches i&#x27;ve taken ideas from my own background and from dewey larson&#x27;s ideas and mixed them and i will let you know when these are dewey larson&#x27;s ideas and where i&#x27;ve diverged from his ideas and gone off on my own so our universe it can be captured with four variables these four variables are in space length width and height in units of meters kilometers feet miles etc and in time units of change in seconds minutes hours years etc so the three variables of space define vector space or local property associated with position the one variable of time defines scalar time and non-local property associated with momentum or the wave nature of matter time is distributed throughout all of space since time is everywhere in vector space i&#x27;ll call our universe four space since it takes four variables to define our space time this is based on bearden calling three variables of space three space and i just added the one variable of time to make it four space we can see matter in three variables of space and it changes due to the one variable of time now here&#x27;s i think of this alternative universe that dewey larson has proposed in this alternative universe there are three variables of time which we&#x27;ll are called vector time and it&#x27;s a local property associated with a position in time and there&#x27;s one variable of space that defines scalar space a non-local property associated with the momentum of the wave nature of space space is everywhere in vector time just like time is everywhere in vector space i will call this coupled universe four times since it takes four variables to define that space time and three of them are time it is possible that you can see matter in three variables of time and that this matter changes due to the one variable of space now this is a lot to take in right now don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t fully understand it just realize that there&#x27;s going to be two universes our universe is going to be called four space four variables to define vector space and scalar time and then there&#x27;s going to be an alternative universe called for time which has three variables in vector time and one variable as vector space and again i come back to this model where i use the local properties these glass objects as a representation of vector space and i use the holographic form as the scalar one so the idea of using this model is that both of these images represent the same matter uh matter is in both space and time but in different ways and so space is defined very locally and time is everywhere in space and effects all matter in space so it has this distributed property so i just wanted to reiterate that just as a constant reminder of a way to visualize these unique properties of matter so as i mentioned there were a number of postulates the way that this was formulated that i struggle with and so i fell back on my background as a physicist and i started to look at these two alternative universes and how might they be coupled together in a different form that might be more understandable to me i&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;d be more understandable to anybody else but i thought that it at least made sense to me and i could move forward in my own way and so i looked at the math operators of gradient and divergence and how the vector and scalar portions of space and time are linked and i&#x27;ll go through this in the next couple of slides and satisfied that this worked reasonably well i decided to look at how this would impact maxwell&#x27;s electrodynamic equations one of the foundational equations for the behavior of marine matter both tesla and bearden stressed how maxwell&#x27;s equations were not as complete as physics believed them to be tesla never left any equations but bearden wrote a book about what he had learned so based on larson&#x27;s coupled universe idea i used these two math operators of gradient and divergence and then i went additionally into maxwell&#x27;s equations to see what would happen if we expanded maxwell&#x27;s equations to include this alternative universe of vector time and scalar space so this slide i put in for those that don&#x27;t have a technical degree degree those that do have a technical degree will recognize the difference between vectors and scalars but this i just want for completion i want to put it in here so that people get an idea of how i&#x27;m thinking about these and also for the non-technical people just to get an idea that there is a mathematical approach that converts vectors to scalars and scalars to vectors you don&#x27;t have to understand it fully but just know that this is possible so on the left hand side we have vectors so vectors in space again we mentioned that a vector has a height width and lengths as three components and we see position on the very left hand side defined by x1 y1 and z1 and then moments later there&#x27;s a new position defined by x2 y2 and z2 and on the other side you have two scalars there&#x27;s one magnitude one and the second magnitude two two different magnitudes two different times two different locations but they don&#x27;t have three components to define them so the way that we convert is between these two when we want to go from vector to scalar we use an operation called divergence and it&#x27;s a math operator and it takes the vector and strips out all of the directional components and gives you one value representing that phenomena at each location so in other words the divergence of position one would give you magnitude 1 and the divergence of position 2 with those three components would give you magnitude 2. now in the opposite way if you just had magnitude 1 at a particular location there&#x27;s a math operator called gradient that takes the scalar and finds all the dependencies between neighboring points based on direction and creates a vector with these directional components for each location so if you take the gradient of magnitude one you land up with a vector at position one and here i have it as height width and length but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be that but that&#x27;s the more common form and the magnitude 2 would give you height width and length at position 2. so for instance magnitude 1 might be temperature and when you look at the neighboring points you see that the temperature in the height decreases faster than it does in the width direction and much slower than it does in the length direction so now you have a vector that has directional components it shows you how the temperature changes in each one of those directions so an example of going scalar to vector so let&#x27;s look at an electromagnetic potential so in the center is an electric charge so let&#x27;s say an electron the charge has a potential field measured in volts that has a value for each location surrounding the electrical charge now if the matter is very uniformly distributed around this electric charge you would have the ring of v1 v2 and v3 be perfectly circular uh and so you just have three rings but because matter changes and the type of matter and the density of matter around a particular charge changes the potential typically what you would see is potential that has at one radius v1 would look you know like the ring i&#x27;ve put together and it&#x27;s another one for v2 and another one for the radius at v3 so they have some shape to them and the gradient of an electric potential gives you a vector electric field so what you do is you take this potential and you find the dependencies based on each one of the directions and as you notice if you had to go up the page you would get one value if you have to go left you&#x27;d get another value and of course if you came out of the page you get something slightly different now here you wouldn&#x27;t get radically different because they&#x27;re not totally different but in some cases the distribution of matter might be so different that it has significant changes and so if we go to the right hand side you can see that if we look at the electric field let&#x27;s say at a point on the v3 circle the potential in volts you can see that you would measure them in three directions each one the electric field in in z in y and in x and when you combine the two the red arrow would represent the combination of all three now let&#x27;s look at position that&#x27;s much closer to the charge so here you would naively assume that the electric field should be larger because it&#x27;s closer to the charge and you can see that it&#x27;s much larger as it would be expected because you expect a stronger electric field the closer you are to the electric charge now an example of going from vector to scalar so we have these electric fields that were defined and we calculated before and now we use the math operator of the divergence of electric field and it gives you a value of the electromagnetic potential at that location so basically what it does is it takes the magnitude of the electric field and all three components and it sums them up and gives you a value for the potential at that particular location and as would be expected in this particular case um for location one which would be on the v3 curve the electromagnetic potential would be lower than the electromagnetic potential at v1 because it is much closer to the electric charge and the potential field falls off as a function of radius the further away you go from the electric charge now that i&#x27;ve taken some math operators and shown how you can couple these two universes together for space and for time let&#x27;s look at a little more properties of these two universes as they defined by larson so as i&#x27;ve mentioned before our four space universe three dimension space time is a scalar lessons called this time space motion is space divided by time they cannot be motioned without time since motion cannot be space divided by space this coupled universe time has three dimensions space is scalar lesson called the space time which is as i mentioned before a bit confusing since we often refer to our universe&#x27;s space time motion here is time divided by space because time is the vector numerator doesn&#x27;t always have to be a vector it can be a scalar but in this case it definitely is time divided by space they cannot be motioned without space since motion in this alternative universe cannot be time divided by time so motion in our family universe is equal to one divided by motion of this alternative universe this concept of two universes being reciprocal is the foundation of larson&#x27;s theory let&#x27;s take these two math operators divergence and gradient and apply them to our universe and see how we land up with this alternative universe so in four space we have vector space with three dimensions and we show this as the three components of space and dimension one two and three we apply a divergence and you land up with magnitudes and in this case i&#x27;ve shown them as symmetrical rings but they don&#x27;t as you saw with the the potentials it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way but you get unique magnitudes for each point in scalar space now in our universe we have scalar time so we have scale of time defined as t1 t2 t3 these are different components these are the as we move through the moments of now the most recent moment of now is t1 that&#x27;s called t2 the now and t3 the future now and we apply a gradient and we see that we land up with time in dimension 1 two and three and so you can see that the transformation using these it transforms your vector space with three dimensions in scalar time into scalar space and vector time and obviously you can apply that back the other way you would apply the gradient to scale of space to get a vector space and you&#x27;d apply the divergence to vector time to get scalar time so you can go both ways what might these universes look like here&#x27;s a naive assumption because we truly don&#x27;t know what that might look like but let&#x27;s start with our universe where we have an object with three dimensions in four space so we measure space has distance is measured in feet or meters area of a floor is measured in feet squared or meters squared and volume is measured in feet cubed or meter cubed and we measure change in units of clock time and that change is measured in terms of second hours and years now let&#x27;s go to this alternative universe in four time so now if you want to measure an object in four time you&#x27;re going to measure the distance is measured in seconds or minutes or hours area of a floor if they have floors as we understand them but an area would be measured in seconds squared or minutes squared and it&#x27;s assuming that they use seconds and minutes in units if in this coupled universe and volume is measured in seconds cubed or minutes cubed now what about measuring change so we know that space scale of space is the part that affects change in three-dimensional time and so we would let&#x27;s call this clock space it&#x27;s a term that was used in dewey larson&#x27;s uh theory as well to simulate the same thing as we measure change in terms of clock time so now you would measure change in terms of clock space and this is meters kilometers and miles and don&#x27;t be concerned if initially you find this hard to wrap your mind again think of this as this whole venture as a little bit of gymnastics for the brain you really have to do some stretching you have to go through this a number of times to open up your mind and stretch it a bit and then you&#x27;ll come into your own visualization of how these two coupled universes work here&#x27;s how i find it easier to visualize this so using those same images of the glass jug glasses in the sphere and the distributed holographic image and we have mickey mouse and the fourier transform of mickey mouse which is shown as the blob now in our three dimensions of space we see these objects these spheres and glasses and jugs and mickey mouse is pretty familiar now a person in four time would also have objects i don&#x27;t know that they have objects that obviously that look like these glasses and mickey mouse but let&#x27;s just use these images as representations of objects in full time now we can see 3d time we can&#x27;t even see scale of time but what it could be is that these objects get represented in a distributed form in our universe so we would detect them in their distributed form so that the glasses would show up as a distributed holographic light image or alternatively as a three-dimensional blob so that&#x27;s how we might interpret how objects look to us when we are looking at them from our universe so all matter is in motion so let&#x27;s look at motion between these two universes and that can help delineate where for space manifests and where for time manifest so motion in our familiar force space we know is distance in space divided by duration in time or space divided by time and in the next video we&#x27;ll show that scalar space expansion dominates scalar time contraction so there&#x27;s a net expansion in our universe of 4 space now what about motion in 4 time we know that it&#x27;s the reciprocal so motion in four time is distance in time divided by duration in space or time divided by space so here you have motion is in time is the same as one over motion in four space so mata would experience a contraction since the expansion of scale of space would be a denominator or a net contraction and this will start to make more sense as we go into further into this series but basically delineation is let&#x27;s look at where matter is basically in expanded form and where matter is very contracted and we see that round about the radius of the atomic nucleus because at that point matter seems to compress together and we say it&#x27;s the strong force that holds all of these positively charged protons together and outside of that we have the regular matter which is well i say regular matter but basically the matter that we&#x27;re familiar with which is typically valence electrons most of the biology and most of the chemistry that we are familiar with happens with valence electrons the atomic binding the molecular binding the sharing the ionic bonds all of these happen with valence electrons and so i&#x27;m going to propose here very naively to say that the matter portion everything outside of roughly the radius of the nucleus of our matter exists in four space and everything in the radius inside of this atomic nucleus diameter is motion or matter in for time and beard noise like i say repeated a number of times that atomic energy nuclear energy is basically energy from the time dimensions and one of the other things that&#x27;s kind of interesting too is we talked about in the quantum spin video in the previous matrix of time series we said that fermions are the blocks of matter and they basically have a spin of a half and fermions need 720 degrees spin to get back to their initial state and so bearden was the first one that i had read about that made this proposal well what if these fermions the building blocks of matter are rotating 360 degrees in four space and 360 degrees now he just said in time he never proposed to e larson&#x27;s ideas he never talked about multi-dimensions of time he just talked about one dimension of time as he put it in 360 degrees in time but i&#x27;m combining tessa bearden and uh larson&#x27;s ideas and saying that it now could be 360 in four space and 360 and four times and this would couple the two matters together so you would have in four space you would have the influence of four time in the atomic nucleus and atomic interactions and nuclei interactions and you would have four space interactions everything outside of that radius and then of course in four time it would be the inverse the effects of our universe would be that we it would manifest in the nuclei in that universe and everything outside of that would be how their matter is formed and how the objects in three-dimensional time are formed so in this slide i want to quickly revisit entanglement and see how we could visualize entanglement with these two universes so we&#x27;re pretty familiar with about the entanglement from our universe point of view is that you&#x27;ve got two twin photons moving in opposite directions at the speed of light and they could be up to 93 billion light years apart and they would still interact and that has caused some consternation of how something can interact over that much distance but if we recognize that there&#x27;s parts of our matter that are moving in our universe and there are parts of our matter that are moving in this alternative four-time universe then what do these two twin photons look in the four-time universe well basically the two of them would always be coupled because they would be joined together because at t1 t2 and t3 they would be always together in time because in time they&#x27;re moving together in space they&#x27;re moving apart so that if there&#x27;s an entanglement the fact that at a distance of billions of light years one instantaneous reacts to the other you if you now assume that the interaction is happening at the same time in four time it&#x27;s pretty easy to understand because it&#x27;s instantaneous it&#x27;s as if their localized property right here is happening they&#x27;re touching in three times in three dimensional time and that immediately manifests a reaction in for space we&#x27;ll come back to this again again so don&#x27;t be concerned if it doesn&#x27;t immediately make sense to you we&#x27;re going to be revisiting a lot of these ideas that i presented in the previous slides what i&#x27;m trying to do is just give you a brief introduction of where we&#x27;re taking this and how we&#x27;re going to do that and the last thing that we&#x27;re going to introduce is the concept of electrodynamics and then we&#x27;ll finish the series and then each video after this will take each one of these topics and expand it in much more detail as a quick aside i wanted to explain why i chose the logo i did with the yin yang symbol and the white part i feel represents vector space the blackish dot in the white space is scalar time and then on the opposite side the black part is vector time and the whitish dot in black time is scalar space and the rotations of vector space and scale of time with vector time and scale of space signifies how motion binds these two universes together the neural network signifies how one universe impacts the other take away messages our universal force base can be mathematically coupled to the universe of four time with the gradient and divergence operators the gradient operator transforms our scalar time to vector time and the alternative universe&#x27;s scalar space to our vector space the divergence operator transforms our vector space into the alternative universe&#x27;s scalar space and their vector time into our scalar time this allows transformation of the four key variables of space and time to be transformed between both universes matter has parts in both universes the hypothesis is that our universe has the atomic nuclei based on four time physics and all the space outside the nuclei is based on our familiar for space physics if matter is expanding in four space it will contract in 4 time with 4 time the instantaneous interaction of twin photons can be justified when they are billions of light years apart as seen in the phenomena of entanglement in the next video the coupling of scale of space and scale of time will be discussed if you want to hear more of the matrix of time videos this expanded one that you&#x27;re listening to please subscribe below to be notified of new presentations you can also go to my website www.multidimensionaltime.com and then you&#x27;ll see that there&#x27;s a book available there&#x27;s also some technical white papers and all the links to
