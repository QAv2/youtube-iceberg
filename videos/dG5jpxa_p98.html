            <p>if you had to assign a probability to that statement that you believe extraterrestrial intelligence has visited visited this planet what probability would you assign 100% 100% that&#x27;s just unbelievable Chris lato welcome to L files this is an interview from 2023 salt conference with Dr Gary Nolan and so perhaps can you give a little bit of your background sure um so I&#x27;m a professor in the department of pathology at Stanford uh the primary research work in my lab is cancer Immunology virology we also do a lot of work in biothreat so we&#x27;ve worked with ebola zika uh covid um when it was a big problem um and uh primarily the work in my lab is the development of instrument and algorithms to understand the complexity of the immune system in cancer and in the process of doing that we&#x27;ve created any of a number of Technologies which we&#x27; spun out into companies it&#x27;s now nine companies two of them are on NASDAQ uh and these Immunology instruments are used pretty much around the world uh in almost any advanced Immunology uh analysis and work okay so he&#x27;s world famous and he&#x27;s created a ton of amazing technology really with cancer and Immunology understood and I&#x27;m curious do you believe that extraterrestrial intelligence has visited planet Earth I think you can go a step further it hasn&#x27;t just visited it&#x27;s been here a long time and it&#x27;s still here uh and it has uh a basically um you know people talk about the wow signal uh looking for extraterrestrial intelligence the wow signal is that people see it on an almost regular basis that&#x27;s the communication that&#x27;s already here and and that statement seems so incredible that it&#x27;s tough to believe right people hear that and maybe a lot of people here hear that and they don&#x27;t believe it and so I&#x27;m curious if you had to assign a probability to that statement that you believe extraterrestrial intelligence has visited visited this planet what probability would you assign 100% 100% that&#x27;s just unbelievable you know this mirrors Colonel Carl Nell&#x27;s argument that nhi non-human intelligence has been here for a long time and he had all the clearances military clearances I did a reaction video to his recent salt conference interview you can check it out on the channel but this from Gary Nolan 100% I mean he is a renowned doctor esteemed doctor over the entire world to say 100% is just amazing you know not 99% not I&#x27;m kind of sure he says 100% puts everything on the line and that&#x27;s not just my opinion I mean look um the National Defense appropriation Act passed last year signed by by Biden in uh December 30 pages of that is the establishment of an unidentified aerial phenomenon office the establishment of looking into the harm that&#x27;s happened to any of a number of the individuals going back to 1945 and looking at the disinformation and misinformation that has been uh basically articulated over the decades 12 US senators have signed on to a document that basically it says we want the information the establishment of an office arrow in the department of defense has 25 people working in it right now and what&#x27;s their what&#x27;s their goal collecting the information across all of the uh all of the US Department of intelligence sorry Department of Defense intelligence offices and collation of that into a uniform format for the very first time and provision of that then to Congress the creation of a whistleblowers program specifically that allows people from the W from within who I&#x27;m going to say this who&#x27;ve been working on the reverse engineering program s reverse engineering of objects so that they can come in and break their Oaths but it&#x27;s specifically just to talk to Congress and give that information in classified settings and that the most recent one that happened was just last weekend and it created quite a hornets nest in Washington okay so yeah the National Defense authorization act for fiscal year 2023 really was fantastic and and the a created the arrow office we&#x27;ve seen really terrible results from that Dr Kirkpatrick who was leading it noted skeptic he said right from the beginning that there&#x27;s no evidence of nhi he&#x27;s been saying that ever since so the arow office hasn&#x27;t really lived up to any I guess hopes that we had in the UFO community at least for those people that want disclosure of UFO information UAP information but the NDA Act for fiscal year 23 did give a lot of protections to whistleblowers and that&#x27;s where we got the 40 plus whistleblowers now over 50 whistleblowers so it did start the snowball right and the fiscal year 2024 ndaa was totally shot down the UAP disclosure Act was was fully hamstrung crushed essentially by Mike Turner and Mike Rogers in the house but like you mentioned there 12 Senators man that is a lot of Senator signing off and Mike GRS recently said that he is furthering UAP transparency in the Senate and Tim burett has also created the UAP transparency act in the house so they&#x27;re still pushing on and and so let&#x27;s just create kind of like a logical framework here so we start at the top we say now there is 100% probability that extraterrestrial intelligence has visited earth now we have to go down to why that statement may be true why you believe that statement is true what what is the evidence and I think perhaps we all may have to read between the lines a little bit here you may not maybe divulge everything but in your opinion what do you believe to be the most compelling evidence to support that statement well I think the most compelling evidence is you just need to look at what your government is doing right now about it I mean just go and look at the number of uh politicians and this is interesting on both sides of the aisle who have come together and signed off on this statement I mean I was involved last year with putting together some of the wording of that uh of that uh the ndaa which was passed into law so I mean so what are they basing their opinions on they&#x27;re basing their opinions on the dozens of individuals who in one manner or another have come forward and talked to them in classified settings so that&#x27;s the first thing then my personal experiences with the individuals who are who well the one person who actually was involved with collecting a lot of that original information uh and then my experience with people who frankly I know have worked or are working on the reverse engineering programs I mean if you could imagine you&#x27;re a politician you know Marco Rubio Chuck Schumer Mike rounds these guys big-time Senators you know well-known maybe aspirations for president and now they&#x27;re saying yeah we support looking into UAP disclosure UAP transparency and Chuck shimmers stood on the senate floor and said that there is UAP information the government has that they are not releasing I mean you can imagine that it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to necessarily help your career so they must have a lot of people coming to them Mar Rubio even said that they&#x27;ve had many people in in high positions currently serving in high positions saying that all this is true that there&#x27;s a crash recovery program and that there&#x27;s actual biologics right nhi biologics however you can Define that so imagine it&#x27;s not easy for these guys just to come out say this not necessarily a huge career helper okay so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s take one step back reverse engineering programs of downed craft now the first question that people will ask is well if they&#x27;re so fraking Advanced why are they why are they crashing because what&#x27;s crashing is not actual living things I mean if you I use this example a lot if you wanted to study a tribe of cannibals in the middle of the Amazon are you going to go yourself and show up in the middle of the of the tribe and not hopefully become dinner on the other side of it so if you&#x27;re an advanced intelligence you know I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re all that advanced frankly um you&#x27;re not going to basically put your your uh life and limb at risk by coming here so mostly what you&#x27;re seeing here are either drones or some sort of advanced AI or whatever it is I mean look we&#x27;re we&#x27;re already we&#x27;re already dealing with a an alien intelligence in our own emails right our own uh you know chat GPT Etc we don&#x27;t even know what it&#x27;s doing so imagine if you were a million years ahead of us uh how do you how do you have a dialogue with something like that or what is it that that could possibly do yeah H that&#x27;s super interesting saying that these could basically be drones that kind of mirrors what David grush has said is that he they call it biologics because he said some of this may not have even been alive like we don&#x27;t know if it was actually ever alive and then you hear about the weird aliens like the Grays they don&#x27;t seem to have any like genetic transfer information they don&#x27;t have any sexual organs a lot of the times right also how do they digest food and you just hear strange stories about these possibly being like biological drones could they be just some sort of manufactured biologic organism in order to interact with us or communicate with us us and then keep the actual nhi so the real aliens the real non-human intelligence safe or can it not even interact with us maybe it&#x27;s on some whole different level of existence level of life that we don&#x27;t understand yet I&#x27;ve proposed scaler forms of life so larger macro life you know could that be one of the answers very strange that they would be drones that he argues and then you wouldn&#x27;t really care if they were crashed or shot down often they actually are just there totally unmanned I&#x27;ve heard stories like that where the the craft is just sitting there operational but no one&#x27;s in it it&#x27;s like a gift like they&#x27;re being gifted here or something I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;ve got some people here to witness these statements I think they&#x27;re very consequential and so we start with now 100% probability of extraterrestrial intelligence we go to evidence we now talk about down craft we see the mil the government moving in a certain direction presumably the craft is made of some material presumably we could test that material I know you&#x27;ve done a little bit of work firsthand you have seen some material do you want to talk about that a little bit right well um you know so what is it that you hope to discover out of a material so let&#x27;s just go back I mean just briefly uh and and why would you want to do it in the first place so basically a grain of silicon you know back in the 50s or 60s changed our entire culture and world right I mean so something is small as that the discovery of what you could accomplish with a little piece of germanium uh doped with the right uh elements changed our understanding now so we have multiple simultaneous sensor systems that have seen these objects go from 50 ft above the water to up to 14 miles and then back in less than a second all right I mean that&#x27;s just a truth the US government has confirmed that these kinds of measurements have done now they&#x27;re very careful with what they say they say well we have no evidence of ET well because you know no ET is going to come walking in here and say hello right but um if you read between the lines and the flip side of it it does stuff that we can&#x27;t do we know that the Russians and the Chinese are not doing and so if you can go from 0 to 5,000 m hour and take a a right turn and not end up squished like a bug on the wind screen on the other side if they have windscreens uh then uh what is the physics that accomplishes that so what that tells you is that we need to rethink our physics first of all to say that well you know we saw birds fly so it took us 3,000 years when we figured out how to fly but now we see these things doing this so what is it that that lets us do so I know some of the physicists on the inside who work at some of these big defense corporations who basically oh well here&#x27;s how you tweak even general relativity to accomplish that but then you say well how much energy is needed to do it well more than the whole nuclear output of the planet per day per movement so you start to backtrack and you say okay well who could do that well we can&#x27;t will we be able to do it in a thousand years but if we had a piece of any of this let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a thousand uh uh revolutions ahead of us or a million revolutions ahead of us even a tiny piece of knowledge from that could revolutionize what it is that we&#x27;re doing I&#x27;m always I&#x27;m me I&#x27;m always looking for the opportunity I look at the at the upside of this I&#x27;m not worried about them coming and you know raiding us or yeah taking our women and children and uh that&#x27;s not my concern my concern is how do we use it yeah yeah that&#x27;s a amazing statements there if you look at Material Science it&#x27;s probably the the biggest single benefit that you could reverse engineer right if you see it&#x27;s possible to make something where you see some material that can hold amazing energy just how it&#x27;s structured that could give a huge benefit to any military obviously right and this would be the main reason why they&#x27;re keeping this secret so they&#x27;re not allowing this information out and Gary says that we do have the information the the government does have the information if you look at the nimit Nimitz case Gary Vorhees he&#x27;s he radar technician said that when the nimts was captured by the actual Roosevelt so highly classified very accurate top secret radar on that ship an AIS class cruiser that radar data was taken it&#x27;s taken by people in Air Force Insignia which is highly non-standard right the captain actually came down and said yeah give this give it to them and we&#x27;ve heard nothing more about the nimit right so during that case they said that the uaps mooved from right above the water 50 ft up to 28,000 ft and then immediately so how could you move around like that I&#x27;ve argued that they know how to manipulate light so they they basically able to to turn their ships into light or somehow move like light would move right with no weight no inertia it&#x27;s the only way I can consider it so he says there we do have the information in the government and if they could get a small piece of that it would be a huge Advantage huge Revolution for our military that&#x27;s the main reason one of the main reasons they&#x27;re not going to share this information yeah and and and I&#x27;m curious do you have confidence that you us collectively will have material literal physical material to evaluate to analyze yes 100% 100% again it&#x27;s there it&#x27;s there it&#x27;s I mean I can say this I I was working with a group about 7 eight years ago and I literally got within a few weeks of gaining access to one of the um one of the objects and when the people who didn&#x27;t want us to gain access to it found out about it they pulled some bureaucratic administrative tricks and snatched it away it&#x27;s wild and that&#x27;s amazing so he says right there 100% that there were materials and he almost got to it again being protected by a small group of people it sounds like and so so now we have you Dr Nolan making this bold statement you are well positioned to make this statement now maybe we get into like some fun let&#x27;s like feel comfortable hypothesizing a little bit as to what is happening like what what is it right again nobody&#x27;s going to hold you to this right now maybe we go down from 100% probability to now we&#x27;re speculating okay now let&#x27;s speculate together what what do you think it is right so to to do that I&#x27;ll start with kind of a mantra I&#x27;ve had for the last while so you know individual experiences of what people see as an anecdote but an anecdote doesn&#x27;t convince a scientist what&#x27;s a convinces what is it that convinces a scientist data right what doesn&#x27;t convince scientists A inclusion so really the objective here and what has allowed me to actually talk to some of my scientist colleagues who first said Gary you&#x27;re going to ruin your career well okay whatever it&#x27;s too late for that um but I haven&#x27;t uh and um because I basically say look if you and I can agree that the data is real irrespective of what the potential conclusions might be the hypotheses then the onus is no longer on me to come up with an answer now it&#x27;s also on you because we&#x27;re having a discussion about this so it&#x27;s believe the data not the conclusion so you see the data and that&#x27;s what and that&#x27;s where the fun is that&#x27;s where the hypothesis starts so you know people have come up with all kinds of ideas everything from future humans future AI coming back to us because somehow they figured out time travel to What&#x27;s called the ultraterrestrial hypothesis that they are part of I&#x27;m sure some people here at least know what a vuman probe is right this idea of a self-replicating machine that could have been developed by a technology or a civilization on the other side of the Galaxy that even in just a few hundred million years would could make its way by conventional means all the way across the uh all the way across the Galaxy and when it gets there it basically builds copies of itself and it does what it&#x27;s doing and it basically some other civilization sent it out now aiob was here last year so I&#x27;m part of an Sab with avobe on a company called cernus space Corporation and guess what our objective is to build the first van Newan probes to go out and spread Humanity original presence across all reality so that&#x27;s one of the others yeah a third one is what do you Gary doctor Nolan you have to speculate what do you think it is let&#x27;s be bold I think it is an advanced form of intelligence something that we don&#x27;t understand that is using some kind of intermediaries however it is like I said about the you know the you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re not going to end up in the middle of the tribe the angry monkeys that are flinging muck at each other or nuclear bombs uh you&#x27;re not going to and you&#x27;re not going to show yourself in the middle of the ENT you&#x27;re going to send intermediaries you know it&#x27;s not that they walk amongst us that you know you uh you know wearing a skin suit are actually the alien right no you&#x27;re going to basically put something there that is I think of it as an intelligence test can you see what&#x27;s in front of you for what it really is can you see the anomalous data point that is there that you realize what is I mean when the uh South American um native tribes first saw the um Spanish Ships coming across the Horizon they didn&#x27;t realize what it was they couldn&#x27;t see it for what it was so you know this is as I said before this is the kind of the wow factor that they&#x27;re they&#x27;re showing up they&#x27;re saying well who amongst you are intelligent enough to realize what it is that you&#x27;re looking at they don&#x27;t have to land on the White House lawn we can make the joke about is their intelligence and see it all right you you just need to show yourself to enough to acculturate yeah now if you&#x27;ve been around for a long time and this is what something that I do think is they&#x27;ve been around for a long time they are affecting our culture right it&#x27;s actually often thought that many of the religions that we think of as the most important have been part of this process I mean there are so many tangents to go down we have about 1 minute and 45 seconds we&#x27;ve covered a lot though that seems like Jack Val&#x27;s argument is that the nhi is somehow affecting our culture affecting all of humanity that it&#x27;s a control system is what he&#x27;s argued to affect our culture it&#x27;s also interesting I didn&#x27;t know he was in business with ayope to create the first Von Newman probes the compus effort that&#x27;s quite interesting create our own Humanity human probes to go and spread throughout the Galaxy seems like that would be the next step of humanity right would be to spread out become multiplanetary multi solar arey he also highlights there again about what the nhi is I&#x27;m glad he speculates a lot of people will not speculate on that like he said he likes to just stick to the data but then he does speculate it comes from a higher intelligence some other intelligence and they use intermediaries that&#x27;s why we it seems so strange and could the intermediaries be through our Consciousness it seems like Consciousness seems to be a part of all of this people have weird effects weird time lapses you know is the interaction happening in some other part of our reality right maybe it&#x27;s not happening in the exact three-dimensional SpaceTime that we understand maybe it&#x27;s happening in some other Consciousness realm and that could lead to all of the strange weird effects that that we hear about extremely strange all the woo you know I think what you just said feels like it has strong parallels to religion to what&#x27;s happening with AI right now to the simulation hypothesis like they all are kind of saying something very very similar here right and I guess I&#x27;m curious right as we wrap this up what happens next well what happens next is I mean what you&#x27;re actually seeing is what&#x27;s happening next is the professionalization of this right it&#x27;s not just me I mean I have many now scientists with whom I&#x27;m working right there&#x27;s Ryan Graves who was one of the pilots that saw the some of the some of the objects in those videos he&#x27;s got the um American uh Institute of Aeronautics and um Engineers 50,000 strong organization he&#x27;s got a group within them as well as a 1c3 for civil aviation um you know we&#x27;ve used I&#x27;m just going to be honest we&#x27;ve used the threat narrative that these things are showing up repeatedly I mean this is today they&#x27;re showing up repeatedly around our our ships so I think we&#x27;ve the the objective has been to make it okay to talk about it yeah because because we made it okay to talk about it we opened the apertures on the filters on the sensor systems that&#x27;s what partly led to the seeing of those Chinese balloons you wouldn&#x27;t have seen them if it weren&#x27;t for that yeah right because we created laws that said it&#x27;s time to open the apertures cuz they were only looking at particular uh flight Paths of things that look like a missile or a or a plane so that&#x27;s the next part I&#x27;m frankly involved with the development of a 501c3 myself uh we&#x27;re calling it The Saul foundation and our objective is to actually write policy papers for government governments uh and Commercial Enterprises to basically give them the opportunity to to think about it it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to happen tomorrow it&#x27;s a slow release process we think uh but to basically give that opportunity and then to develop what I&#x27;m doing actually is developing novel kinds of uh materials analysis pipelines for uh basically and analyzing the material which is in the public sphere or the semi-public sphere but then also frankly as a go uh and a lore to bring in those who do have the stuff behind the scenes so that they can say oh okay because I want to see it published yeah I don&#x27;t want to see it behind the scenes anymore yeah and finally what you&#x27;re seeing is a lot of people who are within the Intel communities as well are frustrated and they want to bring it out because they haven&#x27;t been able to figure it out because the best Minds aren&#x27;t working on it yeah the crazy scientists at Harvard MIT Yale or wherever um are basically not allowed in because maybe they do a little bit too much of this or other things um and they couldn&#x27;t get a security clearance if they wanted to yeah so there there has been a lot of progress but there&#x27;s also been a lot of setbacks right the UAP disclosure Act was shot down arrow said there&#x27;s absolutely no evidence for nhi even though they have all access to the 40 plus whistleblowers Etc so there has been setbacks for sure and it&#x27;s knocked some of the wind out of the whole UAP disclosure effort but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s still going like Gary Nolan said I made a video on his material analysis project he gave a a great briefing on how he actually analyzed these materials and saw interesting isotope ratios Etc Ryan Graves is still pushing for American for safe Aerospace that act to try and get the FAA other commercial pilots as well as military Pilots to actually have an Avenue to report uaps but the sigma is still there right the stigma is still an issue Arrow hasn&#x27;t helped but I interviewed class Von in Sweden and he said just in the past 6 months the stigma there completely went away so now he&#x27;s getting requests from all over the place to actually speak and talk and people asking serious questions so like Gary said it it does take time it takes time for people just to change their views and start to accept that maybe this is possible you know that it could actually be the reality and like he said there he&#x27;s 100 % sure man that is that is pretty sure and he&#x27;s 100% sure that there are materials out there from nonhuman intelligence imagine that amazing stuff so incredible interview thanks to Gary Nolan for all his work and efforts on this hope you like this video if you did please smash the like button it really helps the channel just hit it it&#x27;s easy just hit the like button subscribe for future
