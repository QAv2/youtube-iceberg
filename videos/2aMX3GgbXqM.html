            <p>in Oklahoma where oil has been King for over a century inventor Troy Reed has been busy in his shop constructing rotating magnetic motors that he believes will soon revolutionize how we get around and it does work this is a new prototype of the magnetic motor and if I can explain a little bit about what you call a magnetic field all magnets the big old wooden prototype has a system as the motor went over it had attention to jerk jerk over like that if you take this motor here and you take your finger and rotate it it doesn&#x27;t have that jerking in it so what I&#x27;ve done I got rid of the crankshaft I got rid of the crankshaft I&#x27;ve got rid of of the the injectors and the system in this motor here as you crank this motor up and like you do the other one the motor will start running and uh what I&#x27;ll do I&#x27;ll energize it on this motor here if you can see these amp gauges over here this will come when we get it up to about 150 volts we&#x27;ll unplug it and we&#x27;ll turn the light on if you turn this around where you can see this side here all the working parts is behind this system here operates from a little computer takes this 5 volts it&#x27;s 150 volts what we&#x27;re going to do turn off all the switches make sure there ain&#x27;t nothing plugged into it there&#x27;s the plug there&#x27;s your 110 volts motor still running you can rorate this table Plum around still got energy running nothing tied up in the back of it nothing on the floor rotate around still running on running electricity so we&#x27;re looking hoping hoping this time next year that you&#x27;ll be able to use it in your home so that&#x27;s another and what&#x27;s good about this you talking about electric automobiles this car this right here can set in back of electric automobile and generate electrician charged batteries up in a [Music] car beautiful automobile you can drive it anywhere you want to it don&#x27;t blute the air all the other electric automobiles that I&#x27;ve actually seen has been nothing but just standard trans transmission this is an automatic transmission car there&#x27;s not a whole lot of what you call junk I would call under cars uh I&#x27;ve seen a lot of electric cars had a lot of stuff in it only thing that this has has a battery to run the uh radio uh the blower we&#x27;ve got two safety switches over here that can be mounted into an enclosed uh system but we did this where you could see where people can see this car with the technology it&#x27;s a safety switch system system this is a c controller box a Curtis control box it cuts the amperage down so with the ampage here&#x27;s what&#x27;s real good about electric automobiles all electric automobiles that has search technology with this in it they create heat they&#x27;ve got to have a fan to blow this blow this um this Curtis controller off because it gets hot we don&#x27;t want that to get hot we want to say that cold cuz once it stays cold you save on all the all the computer chips that&#x27;s in there this uh controller so that means you can go farther longer and you&#x27;ll have no problems this electric automobile has got two gauges in front of the shifter on the automatic transmission it&#x27;s called the voltage and the amperage that&#x27;s what I was talking about earlier about amperage on automobile let&#x27;s see if we can&#x27;t get the amperage to go down instead going up the voltage on this here should say somewhere around 120 volts when we start out there&#x27;s no amperage at all so the gauges is down below here and we&#x27;re getting ready to take and go drive the car and uh you can see for yourself what it does all you do is just take and put it in gear and the motor sounds like a little Sports calling shifts runs good fantastic automobile drives if you&#x27;ll see the amperage on the gate see it going down amperage goes way down that&#x27;s what&#x27;s that&#x27;s what I like about electric car if you floorboard the car the most it will do would just be about maybe 100 [Music] amps and that&#x27;s what we want to do is to keep the amperage down on electric car so it&#x27;ll go anywhere uh really anybody wants to go if you want to take a trip you don&#x27;t have to worry about it going and go plug in the house cuz it&#x27;s called The Surge technology uh it&#x27;s a beautiful automobile and I love it and I&#x27;ve put a lot of hard work in this car and we&#x27;re going to make it no oil no gas to F with and the technology is here it&#x27;s going to be here it&#x27;s going to go it&#x27;s going to work beautiful for the whole world for mankind see you around this is your future [Music] people as we have seen so far electromagnetism seems to be offering the most viable path for many contemporary inventors</p>
