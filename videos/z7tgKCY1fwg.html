            <p>For those who don&#x27;t know or maybe thinking about it, just a little bit more about that process like provisional like the step process that you take people through if they come to you and they have no experience with that, they&#x27;re just looking to get started, what that looks like. &gt;&gt; Yeah. About 95% of the clients that come to me uh don&#x27;t have experience with the patent process. Um and and much of what I do is educate [music] because of how the patent system is is structured and and globally the type of different patent offices across the world. What we recommend is filing a provisional patent application and a provisional is basically a priority document.</p>
<p>[music] There&#x27;s no examination of it in terms of patentability saying that your invention is patentable or not. It&#x27;s never published. It&#x27;s much less expensive than a full utility patent, but what it does is it it puts you in place [music] globally to basically say, &quot;I&#x27;ve invented this and here&#x27;s the date that I&#x27;ve invented it.&quot; Now, that&#x27;s particularly important because [music] the US is a first inventor to file patent system. We switched in 2013. We were first to invent, now we became first to file.</p>
<p>The idea is that you have real competitors. Our foreign competitors are using our own patent system against us. There are more foreign inventors filing in the US than US inventors right now. Right.</p>
