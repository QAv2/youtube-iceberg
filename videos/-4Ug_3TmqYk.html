            <p>I&#x27;m damn sure there&#x27;s nothing going on in my head other than what is allowed by the laws of nature as we understand you might believe in ghosts and things like that look at a ghost it is something that carries the imprint of you presumably it looks like you that means that it interacts strongly with the matter that is you because it carries a pattern if it carries a pattern it carries inflammation if it carries information there has to be an energy source that allows that information to persist in the pattern to persist and so on it interacts with light because if you think a ghost is the soul then it&#x27;s something that people see sometimes so that means it interacts with light but we know how light interacts so so here&#x27;s my arm right so it&#x27;s made of electrons and protons and neutrons if I have a soul in there something that we don&#x27;t understand but it&#x27;s a different kind of energy or whatever it is it interacts with matter because I&#x27;m moving my hand away we spent decades making high Precision measurements of how massive behaves and interacts and we look for example for a fifth force of nature with ultra high precision and we don&#x27;t see any evidence of it</p>
