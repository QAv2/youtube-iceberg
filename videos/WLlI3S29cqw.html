            <p>[Music] How does patent prosecution stay secret before public disclosure? Imagine working on a new invention that could change everything, but you want to keep it under wraps until you&#x27;re ready. How do you protect your idea during the patent process without revealing it to everyone? That&#x27;s where secret patent prosecution comes into play. When inventors or companies file a patent application, they usually want to keep it confidential until the patent is granted. But how is that secrecy maintained? First, if the invention involves national security or sensitive technology, authorities can issue a secrecy order. This is an official instruction that stops the patent office from publishing the application or granting the patent until the order is lifted.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like putting a lock on the application to prevent anyone from seeing it. These orders are issued only when the government believes that revealing the invention could harm national security. Next, the patent examiners working on these applications are often located in secure facilities. They have to pass background checks and hold special security clearances. This means only authorized personnel can access the sensitive information in the application.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s similar to working in a secure government building where access is tightly controlled. Once a secrecy order is in place, the law also restricts anyone involved in the process from sharing details about the invention. Employees working on the application are bound by confidentiality rules and they cannot disclose any information to outsiders. This keeps the invention under wraps even within the company or organization. Although the application is kept secret, the patent office still examines it for patentability requirements.</p>
<p>These include checking if the invention is new, useful, and non-obvious. The process involves reviewing technical details, but all of this happens behind closed doors. The application is not published or made public until the secrecy order is lifted or the patent is granted. For inventors working on sensitive or classified inventions, understanding these procedures is vital. It helps them navigate the patent system without risking exposure of their ideas.</p>
<p>These rules ensure that inventions with national security implications stay confidential during the patent prosecution process. So even before the public learns about your invention, strict rules and secure proceers keep your idea safe until you are ready to share it. [Music]</p>
