            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is a channel for educational purposes and we like to take a look at theories of everything and go deep into them and um you know just try to get a sense of them eventually put it all together um but today is our 315th video on doy B larsson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory and Mr Larsson came up with this Theory back in the 20th century worked it out over uh most of his life and uh wrote a lot of books toward the end of his life he died back in 1990 uh some of his followers took up the mantle and uh have put out some other books and articles since then but the theory is very very obscure and not well known and uh it threatens to Fall by the wayside if we don&#x27;t kind of raise our Consciousness about it recognize that it&#x27;s a beautiful thing and that it can uh help guide us uh in really every subject it is a system of theory meaning that if you understand the system you can apply it to any and every subject the basic gist of the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe made entirely of motion uh most people the ancient Greeks believed that the Universe was made out of matter and then Einstein came along and said well it kind of it looks like matter but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really energy um but for Larson both matter and energy are just two different varieties of motion and motion for Larson is the relationship between space and time now the basic Elementary kind of motion that we know of is speed the bicycle is moving at 15 miles hour well that&#x27;s 15 miles of space in one hour of time space divided by time is motion but um and so that is a relationship between space and time so as far as speed goes uh larsson&#x27;s Theory holds up now um we can plug in any kind of scientific quantity and determine its space-time uh kind of coordinates um acceleration I dropped the ball out the window and it fell at 9.8 m/s squared 9.8 M of space in 1 second squared of time that is space over time to the second power acceleration um and uh we can you can do that with other um quantities too such as uh energy it took me two hours to move that thing 25 ft two hours of time in 25 ft of space time over space is energy and so on um matter is time to the third power over space to the third power force is time over space to the second power pressure is time over space to the fourth power density is time to the thir power over space to the sixth power now density you you know density is basically Mass over volume so mass is time to the thir power over space to the thir power volume is one over Spa uh volume is space to the thir power so when you put it all together you get time to the third power or space to the sixth power um and you know this is a consistent system so that you can uh check your work by making sure that the units work out all right for example eal mc^2 energy time over space times uh e uh uh equals mass time the 3 over space to the 3 times the speed of light squared that&#x27;s speed s over t to the second power it&#x27;s s^2 over t^2 multiply it all out it work works out so uh that&#x27;s an important uh you know simplification of the units um now there are some caveats uh such as um time and space are both have their coordinate aspects meaning that uh they both have aspects that are three-dimensional or I would say three or four dimensional but um we&#x27;re talking about XYZ coordinates in space and some analogous thing to that in time and then space and time both uh have their clock aspects meaning that they are progressing like a clock it&#x27;s what Larson calls a scalar motion and this is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction like a clock a clock is always getting later and later and later and later it&#x27;s not getting later in any specific Direction and in space you think of it as dots on a balloon you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other that&#x27;s the progression of space uh in no specific Direction they&#x27;re all moving away from each other space is getting farther and farther and farther apart that is the progression of space or clock space um and this was also observed by the Hubble telescope that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and then u space and time Also are both quantized meaning that they come in one uh in a minimum unit there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have that thing at all so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you don&#x27;t have space and if you don&#x27;t have space then you have time because the universe is composed entirely of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time so everything has to be either time or space or both and so if you don&#x27;t have space you only have time Larson refers to this as the time region if you don&#x27;t have time then you only have space and Larson refers to this as the space region so the region of less than one unit of space is what Larsson calls the time region and the region of less than one unit of time is what Larson calls the space region and between those is when you have a exactly one unit of time in one unit of space uh I&#x27;m sorry uh exactly one unit of space in one unit of time they&#x27;re functionally equivalent because one over one uh can be inverted and you still get one over one but um that is what Larsson calls unit speed and we know it as the speed of light the speed of light is one unit of space in one unit of time and so in Larson system this speed of light is really like the background of the universe or the state of rest The Ether or the origin the reference point um the zero point of the universe of motion is the speed of light outward in all directions um the progression of space and the progression of time and and um this differs um massively from the einsteinian Viewpoint which is that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson contends that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light this is the half of the universe that Larson calls the cosmic sector and this is the half of the universe that the uh Legacy uh scientists don&#x27;t know anything about uh what they do know about is what Larsson calls the material sector this is the half of the universe that is moving slower than the speed of light and this conforms to Einstein&#x27;s dictum that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe now one when one crosses that boundary that speed of light boundary uh which is really only feasible in massive stellar and Galactic explosions um physically uh when that happens then um the rules invert and uh in the material sector you experience coordinate space three dimensions of space and clock time uh but in the cosmic sector you um experience coordinate time and in clock space you invert the relations of space and time uh that&#x27;s the reciprocal aspect of the reciprocal system of theory so that&#x27;s kind of how you put it together uh what we&#x27;re looking at today is I believe the uh third uh installment here of uh we&#x27;re looking at larsson&#x27;s paper that he wrote back in the early 80s that is called scalar motion again the scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction like dots on a balloon that is being expanded and as Larsson had said earlier in this paper uh scalar motion is a motion that scientists have known about uh for a long time but they have not recognized its significance in Larson system it holds fundamental significance and uh so and in particular what he calls a distributed scalar motion which is what you would consider if you have that those spots on the balloon you blow up the balloon but the balloon in addition to actually expanding the balloon is also rotating when the balloon is rotating those motions are distributed over that you know that uh circumference uh or Arc that the the balloon is rotating on so um that is what Larson calls a distributed scalar motion and he determined that electricity magnetism and gravity are all kinds of distributed scalar motions uh electricity in one dimension magnetism in two dimensions and gravity in three dimensions okay now we are again this is the third episode of this so if you want to go back to the beginning of this paper you want to go back a couple episodes and start there but we will take over here the insistence on viewing gravitation as a transmiss transmission process also involves a wholesale disregard of the physical facts that Viewpoint Likens gravitation to electromagnetic radiation and we hear about gravitational waves in the same way we hear about electromagnetic waves but the two processes are entirely different and it is very difficult to understand why anyone should ever connect the two electromagnetic radiation is an energy transmission process a photon leaves an emitting object with a certain amount of energy the energy of the emitting object is decreased by that amount so you know when a photon leaves the sun [Music] um you know the energy of the sun is decreased by the amount of energy that that Photon had and then when the the photon uh says the photon travels through space and reaches an absorbing object delivers the energy and the amount of the absorbing object is increased by that amount so you know the photon gets to Earth and it uh gets absorbed by the Earth the Earth&#x27;s energy increases by the amount of that Photon electromagnetic process it&#x27;s an energy transmission process the intervening space the distance has nothing to do with the process except in determining the time it takes for travel the process is independent of the distance so it doesn&#x27;t matter whether the photon has to travel from the Sun to the Earth or whether it has to travel from the Sun to Pluto as soon as it gets there it AB you know the the body absorbs the photon and the energy is transmitted doesn&#x27;t matter how far the photon has to go it still has the same amount of energy in it once it gets there so the process is independent of the distance in contrast to that process the gravitational process is totally dependent on the distance all you have to do is look at the gravitational equation it&#x27;s based on an inverse Square law the distance apart of squared is the amount of the force of the gravity in cont so in contrast to that process the gravitational process is totally dependent on the distance if there is no change in the distance that is if the two apparently interacting objects don&#x27;t change their separation then there is no change in the energy at all and even if an energy change does take place as happens in a in the case of a falling object toward the Earth the increase in the kinetic energy of the incoming falling object is not obtained at the expense of the earth it&#x27;s derived from the potential energy the energy of position of the falling object itself much the same considerations apply to electricity and magnetism there are n number of other direct consequences of the scalar motion existence that have an important bearing on various physical problems and I intend to cover them that is all those that I have so far identified in this new book but I don&#x27;t want to take the time to talk about them here because I want to leave time for adequate consideration of another very important finding which like the existence of distributed scaler motion is significant enough to justify classifying it as the equivalent of the results of a crucial experiment and that&#x27;s what Larsson he pointed out earlier here that that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s looking for he&#x27;s looking for crucial experiments that you know um you can that where the reciprocal system will provide one answer and the Legacy science system provides another answer um and so it&#x27;s a crucial experiment that can help determine um you know which one of these theories is correct if any and Larsson said that well we don&#x27;t necessarily have to dream up a crucial experiment we can look in the past and we can look at other experiments that have been done in the past and they might serve the same purpose um the second important finding is a result of a well-known experiment but it has not previously been recognized because a recognition of distributed scalar motion was a prerequisite for recognition of the new fact as a preliminary before starting to talk about that particular subject I want to say a few things about speed limits the present scientific view is that nothing phys physical can move faster than the speed of light that belief is based on Einstein&#x27;s interpretation of certain experiments in which an electric force was applied to the acceleration of light objects such as electrons it was found in those experiments that the acceleration did not continue at the same rate as might be expected from Newton&#x27;s second law of motion but decreased at high speeds at a rate which indicated it would reach zero at the speed of light that indicated of course that either the force must decrease at high speeds or the mass must increase at high speeds there is no physical evidence of any kind to indicate which is the correct alternative so Einstein had to make a guess and he guessed in favor of the mass alternative that at high speeds mass increases to Infinity to the point where you know you can&#x27;t accelerate it anymore and so therefore Einstein determined that nothing can move faster than the speed of light because you know the efficiency of the process turned to zero at um at the at the speed of light uh according to Einstein sence Theory the mass increases at high speeds and becomes infinite at the speed of light on this basis it is of course impossible for any higher speed to exist so far as present day theory is concerned it makes little difference which of these Alternatives is correct because there is obviously a limit on a one-dimensional basis in either case since present day Theory does not concede the existence of multi-dimensional motion um the which he demonstrated in the first uh two episodes here the existence of multi-dimensional motion that&#x27;s really multi-dimensional scalar motion the existence of a onedimensional limit is equivalent to the existence of a limit on speed in total but when we recognize the existence of multi-dimensional scalar motion then it&#x27;s equally evident that the limit on speed in one dimension can be reached in each of the three dimensions again he pointed out that for scalar motion one dimension of scalar motion one dimension of motion requires three dimensions of space so you need three you need a three-dimensional spatial uh coordinate reference frame in order to um Express one dimension of scalar motion but there are three dimensions of scalar motion the other two Dimensions cannot be represented in a reference system or at least not one that we have dreamed up yet yet that does not mean that it&#x27;s possible to achieve a speed greater than light by electrical means because as I pointed out a little bit earlier the electric force is one-dimensional that accounts for the fact that the electrical force was unable to reach any higher speed but it does not preclude acceleration to higher speed by means of some other process such as for existence uh for instance the release of large quantities of energy in violent explosions this brings me down to the second important physical fact that I&#x27;ve been talking about but I want to pause for a moment to emphasize the continuing factual nature of the development of thought the reason I need to do that is that the inclusion I am now ready to pull out of the Hat appears in the theory of the universe of motion as a postulate and it has some far-reaching consequences those who realize that both the conclusion itself and the consequences are part of the theory of a universe of motion are likely to suspect that I may have smuggled some theoretical considerations into the development of thought at some point along the line so I want to assure you that&#x27;s not the case we&#x27;re sticking entirely to the facts we know from observation that the electric charge occurs only in discret units we have uh such as uh you know planks constant is what I&#x27;m thinking is what he&#x27;s talking about um I I might be wrong about that we have identified the electric charge as a distributed scalar motion now there&#x27;s no difference between this scalar motion and any other scalar motion so far as the motion itself is concerned the difference is only in the nature of the coupling to the reference system once we have established that the electric charge which is a scalar motion is limited to discrete units it then follows that scalar motion occurs only in discrete units those of you who are encountering that conclusion for the first time may not be very much impressed by it in fact with all the buildup I have given it it may come as somewhat of an anticlimax but those of you who are familiar with the theory of Universe of motion will realize the great significance of deriving this conclusion from purely factual premises at one stroke it raises a very substantial portion of the conclusions that have been reached with respect to a universe of motion from the status of theoretical con clusions to the status of established facts the only property of scalar motion of a scalar motion is magnitude such a motion is a relationship between a space magnitude and a Time magnitude now we have further found that those are integral magnitudes so that the properties of scalar mod motion are the properties of integral magnitudes integers it then follows that we can derive the physical properties of scalar motion under any particular circumstances by translating the mathematical properties of reciprocal integers which we already know into the appropriate physical language this of course is a general principle of extremely wide application in our ordinary view of motion the minimum amount of motion is zero and zero is therefore the condition of rest the condition from which effective magnitudes are measured in a reciprocal speed system on the other hand the minimum speed is Unity because anything less than unit speed is not speed it&#x27;s inverse speed similarly the minimum inverse speed is Unity it in it follows that in such a system unit speed is the condition of rest the condition from which all speed magnitudes are measured expressing that in another way we can say that unit speed is the natural reference system the natural reference system for scalar motion is not a fixed system it is a moving system the motion of the time component is universally recognized we all recognize that now is not something that stays put it continually moves forward the essence of the new finding is that here is an entity of the same kind it likewise continually moves forward what this means then is that all physical objects are continually being carried outward at unit speed relative to the fixed reference system in most cases that outward motion cannot be recognized but where the gravitational effect is absent as in the case of the photons of radiation we can observe the outward motion photons move outward at the speed of light the same is true where the gravitational effect is practically negligible as in the most distant galaxies which are likewise moving outward at almost the speed of light another important consequence of the reciprocal relation that we have now established is the Symmetry around unit speed which means that there is motion in time as well as Motion in space uh I think I&#x27;m going to stop right there um and uh even right though we&#x27;re in the middle of a paragraph he&#x27;s kind of getting into a new idea there and uh we will take over at that point starting tomorrow U now this is uh important stuff obviously fundamental to the reciprocal system uh I understand most of it there&#x27;s a few questions that I have um but just hang in there if you don&#x27;t understand everything um just put it in the back of your mind and let it and mull it over um and don&#x27;t don&#x27;t uh reject anything right out of hand um just you know persevere just hang in there and um you know um it it it takes it takes a little while because you have to unlearn things at the same time that you&#x27;re learning new things new and different different concepts and they overrule some uh cherished Concepts that you may have um but as he says the facts are the facts and there certainly are plenty of facts out there in the history of science that don&#x27;t make any sense so he&#x27;s attempting to correct some of those things uh so I think he&#x27;s worth listening to for that M for if no other reason all right uh thanks for tuning in today we will talk to you tomorrow</p>
