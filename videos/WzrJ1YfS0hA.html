            <p>uh these are retrieving non-human origin uh technical Vehicles you know no kidding non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed let&#x27;s dive into this one so the quick version of this story is that an ex-military guy has come forward and spilled the beans about the government secretly hiding crashed UFOs and alien bodies this person&#x27;s name is David grou and it appears on paper he has quite the resume but here are a few red flags with this story number one no evidence has been presented at all normally this would be the beginning and the end of this video no evidence at all has been presented of extraterrestrial UFOs extraterrestrial bodies and Mr grou claims he didn&#x27;t actually see any of this stuff he just heard that this stuff is true another red flag before Mr grou went to the media with this story he had to clear with the Department of Defense what he could and couldn&#x27;t say because he did work in sensitive offices in the military things that are top secret you can&#x27;t just go out and tell everyone about and so as it&#x27;s reported he went to the Department of Defense to clear this it&#x27;s an office called the defense office of pre-publication and Security review or doser they review everything you want to say say in a book in an interview whatever medium and they say no you can&#x27;t say this this is top secret that&#x27;s what they do this is top secret can&#x27;t share it and it&#x27;s reported that he went through this process and they signed off on what he had to say what does that mean it means everything that he&#x27;s saying in these interviews the government doesn&#x27;t consider it a secret it doesn&#x27;t consider it top secret it doesn&#x27;t consider it something they don&#x27;t want revealed Mr grou is now a private citizen he has the right to say whatever he wants the Department of Defense is not going to dictate what kind of stories this now private citizen can tell they&#x27;re only going to dictate what is top secret and can&#x27;t be revealed so he didn&#x27;t reveal any secrets another red flag was when I personally called David grou for comment to get his input to ask him questions about all of this stuff and here&#x27;s how the phone call went hello hi is this David grou yes it is who am I speaking to this is Steven Green Street with the New York click he hung up on me I called back didn&#x27;t answer I left a voicemail I then texted him and sent him other messages to no response look if you&#x27;ve got a solid Story You&#x27;ve got to be able to talk to the national press if your story is true you shouldn&#x27;t be scared of hard questions you shouldn&#x27;t be scared of critical inquiry click another red flag is the source es for all of this it&#x27;s the same names that have been involved with this UFO story for years the authors of the original story are Ralph Blumenthal and lesie Kane in the UFO World these guys are superstars Miss Kane for example for many many years dating back decades has been a UFO activist a UFO researcher a UFO author a UFO believer and these two wrote the now Infamous 2017 new YK York Times front page article revealing this Pentagon UFO program our reporting at the post has revealed that most of that article is erroneous factually inaccurate deceptive and Miss Kaine actually went on a Showtime documentary and admitted that she had a specific goal and agenda with that New York Times article and that was to get people to believe in UFOs the angle that I was taking in my reporting was to try to get credibility for the subject and I knew that that was not the way to go that was not the first step in terms of getting people to accept this through my own research I&#x27;ve learned that other news outlets had this story were presented with this story did not publish the story Ralph Blumenthal in a tweet for example says the Washington Post had this story but they wanted to take some time he says they needed more time Washington Post needed more time for what could it be for factchecking background s checks intense vetting more factchecking and so on anyway they couldn&#x27;t wait so they just published it in the debrief now what&#x27;s the debrief the debrief is a low-level underground media outlet and they run lots of UFO stories they got their start running UFO stories breathless UFO stories thousands and thousands of words of UFO stories on the debrief so to recap a lot of red flags with this story but that&#x27;s not stopping the story from spreading like wildfire all of these UFO stories they just get copied and pasted in mass and I assume that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen with this story until someone on The Hill in Congress says wait a minute let&#x27;s get people in a room under oath and figure out what&#x27;s going on here</p>
