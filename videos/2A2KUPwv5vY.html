            <p>all right how is everybody doing uh welcome to my channel this is uh for educational purposes and uh we take a look at uh ancient and modern theories of [Music] everything all-encompassing theories um holistic World Views uh just things that can uh kind of round you out and and um give you a One-Stop shop and um we try to go deep into them and show you the ins and outs and um you know help you to employ them in your life uh with your Paradigm shifting and your um Awakening to 5D Consciousness today is our 482nd video on the reciprocal system of Theory from dwey B Larson and uh this is a system of theory meaning that um once you figure out how it works it&#x27;s an inner interlocking Theory it applies to all subjects um you pretty much figure out how it works and then you can apply it to whatever subject you&#x27;d like um now that is a pretty tall order there&#x27;s uh a lot of ins and outs and a lot of details a lot of um unfamiliar thinking that you have to do a lot of unlearning that you might have to do about how you thought that the uh you know particularly Sciences um were constructed and um but if you uh really learn the reciprocal system then you can you pretty much own it for life and then you&#x27;ll be able to use it in every aspect of your life in 1959 Mr Larson proposed his two fundamental postulates about how he believed the universe operated and then um he derived through a process of deduction a theoretical Universe about what the universe would look like if his uh two postulates were correct and then he uh wrote some books um that compared his theoretical Universe with the measured empirical universe of the uh Legacy mainstream scientists uh that they have you know acquired from their various laboratory and Observatory experiments and have um compiled in their table scientific tables and we&#x27;re looking at one of larsson&#x27;s books here called it came out in 1987 uh he died in 1990 but this book is called basic properties of matter and that&#x27;s just what it is mainly about chemistry and it&#x27;s about many of our the basic properties of matter um you know the melting point and the specific heat and the compressibility and Larson arrives at equations for all of these different Expressions um of matter and um then he plugs um the matter atoms and molecules into his equations and then he Compares his values with the values that have been um tabulated in these various tables uh we are in chapter 10 here which is called electrical resistance now um I&#x27;m not going to get into all of the details of going through Larson&#x27;s Theory I&#x27;ve done that 474 different times um so if you want to um kind of uh get a more detailed uh overview of uh how how Larson&#x27;s Theory operates just watch one of my 47 my first 474 videos on this subject and the reciprocal system of theory um that are all on that playlist uh I will just uh kind of read you off or I don&#x27;t have it in front of me but um recite to you the um two postulates Larson&#x27;s reciprocal syst system uh can also be called the universe of motion and Larson was one of the uh few scientists to propos to construct their Universe upon motion rather than matter or energy or Force Larson goes with motion and he says that the first postulate says that the Universe um is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and then the second uh postulate is really just for um how he&#x27;s going to apply his first postulate um in order to get his theoretical universe and that is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian and um I I don&#x27;t uh I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with the content of that second postulate but I don&#x27;t really think it matters that much I think that second postulate is just for it basically is just saying I&#x27;m using the um accepted um protocol of science you know I use math I use geometry I use logic and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using in order to arrive at my theoretical Universe from my first postulate which is that the universe is made out of motion in particular a kind of motion called scalar motion which is a motion that has a magnitude and has no specific Direction uh which you can Envision using a a um balloon that you put dots on and if you blow up the balloon all the dots will be moving away from each other and that is a a motion that has no specific Direction every every dot is moving in every direction outward every outward Direction and Larson calls that the progression that&#x27;s uh in a universe of motion this progession progression is always occurring it&#x27;s omnipresent and uh Eternal um and so the progression is always occurring at all locations and then that progression is the source of everything in larsson&#x27;s universe and um manifestation really happens by reversing that progression and turning that outward movement of the balloon into an inward movement where all of the dots are moving toward each other and that&#x27;s analogous to uh gravitation so turning and matter turning gravitation turning the progression into gravitation is a process of manifestation and then um you know so that is the motion that the universe is constructed upon and that motion is also the relationship between space and time space and time have no specific um um existence in and of themselves they only exist together in motion motion is a relationship between space and time that sets up a reciprocal relationship between space and time motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator but motion is not just speed um but it is really all our speed speed or velocity would be the you know directional form of spe of scalar speed but then there is also all of the other scientific phenomena they are all kinds of motion and they all uh can be expressed in fractions of either time or time over space or space over time uh with exponents it can be you know time to the third power space to the third power what have you and the UN is threedimensional um three dimensions of space three dimensions of time three dimensions of motion these are not all the same and I would really just say it&#x27;s really three three because three is 3 +0 so you know you&#x27;re kind of really talking about four dimensions but the fourth dimension is a zero Dimension and so 3 + 0 = 3 so you have three dimensions and uh then everything space time and motion also only are um come in discrete units you have to have a full unit of space before you have space you have to have a full unit of time before you have time okay uh there&#x27;s many other uh aspects and ramifications of all that uh but that is for those four our first 474 videos if you&#x27;d like to take a look at that we are going to try to get into the text here of chapter 10 on electrical resistance we left off uh we&#x27;re about to look at um chap uh table 25 which is internal pressures in resistance and compression and so uh Larson comes up with uh an equation for the internal pressure uh well he says table 25 is a comparison of the internal pressures in resistance and compression for the elements included in the study the symbols following or preceding some of the values indicates that there is evidence of a transition to or from a different internal pressure but the available data are not sufficient to define the alternate pressure level and again Larson has trouble here with these uh resistance uh measurements electrical resistance measurements because the scientific data that he&#x27;s comparing his theoretical data to uh is very uncertain um he he mentioned another number of reasons why that is but uh you know it&#x27;s pretty hard to do a comparative study uh you know comparing your theoretical system with the uh observed and measured system when the observed and measured system isn&#x27;t very accurate and so you know this is a Bugaboo of larsson&#x27;s in particular for this study here of um resist uh resistance resistivity now um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty hard to read this table the way that um my computer has it uh um configured and um I&#x27;m just trying to look through to see how Larson does you know whether his um his observed or his uh calculated um results are pretty much the same as the um observed results and it&#x27;s very difficult to really understand what he&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here um he&#x27;s got the elements listed and then he&#x27;s got a couple of numbers and then uh he has I guess those are the calculated numbers and then in some cases a couple more numbers and those are the observed numbers but then he has them in a sequence like so for atine he gives you the two numbers 274 and 548 but then um next to that for the observed numbers are 274 and 548 but then also 822 and those are you know 274 * 2 and 274 * 3 so I&#x27;m not sure where he&#x27;s coming from but he&#x27;s looking at the initial pressures uh so where I guess that just means that there can be multiple initial pressures depending upon certain factors and it looks like all the numbers are either multiples or three Hales of the first number that&#x27;s that&#x27;s written so um you know for gold I guess that that&#x27;s more of a factor of 4 over3 Gold the number that he gives is 866 7 but then the observe number is either 650 or 857 or 867 sorry um I don&#x27;t really get this because he seems to have the numbers all exactly right um but he doesn&#x27;t always have the X uh the multiplier there uh let&#x27;s see what he says about it the amount of difference between the two columns of the table should not be be surprising the atomic rotations that determine the AY factors now just keeping in mind that uh in Larson system uh the universe of motion all of the atoms are combinations of motions and every atom is really got three numbers uh a b and c the a number is a two-dimensional rotation the B number number is a secondary two-dimensional rotation and the C number is a one-dimensional rotation in the opposite scalar Direction and that is optional and those are the three numbers that Larson uses to make his calculations here but he for pressure um purposes um he and temperature he uses ay numbers which are similar but not the same and um you know so these are the numbers that he&#x27;s using to move from that outward motion of the balloon to the inward motion of the balloon that&#x27;s how you manifest is taking that outward motion which is the source and first reversing the motion and then moving the motion Inward and so those are done through rotations also vibration and rotation okay so the atomic rotations that determine the AY factors are the same in both cases but the possible values of these factors have a substantial range of variation and the influences that affect the values of these the of these factors are not identical in view of the participation of the electrons in the resistivity relations and the large impurity effects neither of which enters into the volume relations some difference in the pressures at which the transitions take place can be considered normal there is at present no explanation for those cases in which the internal pressure is indicated by the results of the compression and resistance measurements are widely Divergent but differences in the vment can certainly be suspected table 26 compares the relative resistances calculated from equation 102 with Bridgeman&#x27;s results on some typical elements the data are presented in the same form as the compressibility tables in chapter 4 to facilitate comparisons between the two sets of results this includes showing the a zy factors for each element rather than the internal pressures the corresponding pressures are available in table 25 which we just looked at as in the compressibility tables values above the transition pressures are calculated relative to an observed value as a reference level the reference value utilized is indicated by the simple R following the figure given in the calculated volume calculated in quotes so here table 26 gives the relative resistance under compression and I believe that he earlier said that the relative resistance isn&#x27;t really the number he&#x27;s looking for he&#x27;s looking for an expression that gives you um the relative resistance is I believe the resistance that occurs at a specific temperature um but you know this gives the relative resistance under compression so it shows the so instead of of temperature it&#x27;s under a specific amount of pressure but the uh numbers are all written up the same way they were in chapter 4 where it gives you know like the maximum volume is 1.0000 and then as the compression goes up the number goes down because that&#x27;s the volume uh the 1.0 is the volume and you know when you put on um a certain amount of pressure um that starts to decrease that volume um but I don&#x27;t really see any type of indication of resistance here so a relative resistance let&#x27;s see what he has to say about this table in those cases where the correct assignment of ay factors and internal pressures above the transition point is not definitely indicated by the corresponding compressibility values the selections from among the possible values are necessarily based on the empirical measurements and they are therefore subject to some degree of uncertainty agreement between the experimental and the semi theoretical values in this resistance resistance range therefore validates only the E exponential relation in equation 102 and does not necessarily confirm the specific values that have been calculated the theoretical results below the transition points on the other hand are quite firm particularly where the indicator ated internal pressures are supported by the results of the compressibility measurements on this basis the extent of agreement between Theory and observation in the values applicable to those those elements that maintain the same internal pressures through the full 100,000 uh kilogram per square cenm pressure range of Bridgeman uh Bridgeman&#x27;s measurements is an indication of the experimental accuracy the accuracy thus indicated is consistent with the estimates made earlier on the basis of other criteria in as much as the difference in the form of the compressibility equation pv^ 2 equal K pressure time the square of the volume equals a constant and that of the pressure resistance equation which is p^2 r equal K is a requirement of the general reciprocal relation between space and time um now I don&#x27;t exactly get where that&#x27;s coming from uh I don&#x27;t know if you do the dimensional analysis on that and that&#x27;s where you get this uh because uh this is basically substituting the volume for the resistance that&#x27;s the only well not the only distance the difference in the equation now pressure in the second equation is taken to the second power whereas in the first equation it&#x27;s only in the first Power whereas volume is in the second power in the first equation and it is replaced by resistance in the second equation Now volume is s to the 3 power pressure is time over space to the 4th power resistance is time to the second power over space to the third power so I don&#x27;t quite get uh what he&#x27;s saying here um The Joint verification of these two equations is a significant addition to the mass of evidence confirming the validity of this reciprocal relation the Cornerstone of the qu quantitative expression of the theory of the universe of motion um so I hate to leave you hanging but he&#x27;s left me hanging I don&#x27;t quite um maybe to go back and look this over again um how this exactly um is a um reciprocal relation um I think he does explain it um because he goes he goes through the theory as in the compressibility equation the symbol p in this expression refers to the total effective pressure yeah okay and um I can understand the second power part because that&#x27;s coming from the time region normally Bo&#x27;s law is PV equals K or pval E energy equal pressure time volume h k maybe comes in if you are just um holding the temperature at a constant and if you are in the time region which is in the region inside a unit of space then the um volume can be taken to the second power and that&#x27;s what happens in the um original form of uh form of boils boils law or that first equation the U PV or now pv^ SAR equals K and but now we&#x27;re going with re resistance and he said says because the movement of electrons electrons are rotating units of space moving through matter uh you can use something like effervescence to kind of visualize that although the space the electrons are not three-dimensional they&#x27;re really you know they are rotating units so they are you know flat but think of the concept of effervescence where you have a bubble moving through a liquid you know moving upward in a liquid that is kind of analogous to the idea of a hole or a a unit of space moving through matter and uh because the movement of electrons space through matter is the inverse of the movement of matter through space the inter Regional relations applicable to the effect of pressure on Resistance are the inverse of those that apply to the change in volume Under Pressure so that&#x27;s where he&#x27;s getting this inverse relationship from the reciprocal relation is the um is that the resistance the relations applicable to the effect of pressure on Resistance are the inverse of those that apply to the change in volume Under Pressure so see right there Larson says all of that in one sentence and I would have really just wished that he would have uh expounded on that uh over a couple pages and explained every step that he&#x27;s going through there um because I I can see that this is the key uh to understanding this but I can&#x27;t quite make the leap here from and maybe you can or can explain it to me the movement of electrons through space uh or electrons through matter is the inverse of the movement of matter through space I get that and because of that uh the internal reg inter Regional relations applicable to the effect of pressure on Resistance are the inverse of those that apply to the change in volume Under Pressure I just don&#x27;t make that leap I don&#x27;t see that reasoning now the next sentence is said we found in chapter 4 that the volume of a solid under compression conforms to the relations pv^ 2 equals K which is fine that&#x27;s uh in the time region and um volume of a solid under compression okay so that is so he&#x27;s saying that there is an inverse of that with the resistance equation and so he then uh by reason of this of the inverse nature of the electron movement the corresponding equation for electrical resistance therefore is p^2 R equals K and you know I see that pressure is common in that equation and the volume is being swapped out for the uh resistance and that that moves the pressure into the uh square m uh making it a square uh quantity but I do not see I&#x27;m just not making that leap from because the movement of electrons through matter is the inverse of the movement of matter through space the effect of pressure on resistance is the [Music] inverse of the change in volume Under Pressure [Music] pressure has some kind of effect on Resistance and somehow that is analogous to the movements of electrons through space I mean electrons through matter through time while the change in volume under pressure is somehow analogous to the movement of matter through space okay well if anybody can figure that one out please let me know um but I have to think about it maybe I&#x27;ll U put that into my meditation and uh mull it over see what happens but on the other hand sometimes when you just keep reading and you just accept that you don&#x27;t understand it Larson will say something later on that will clear it up so that that&#x27;s happened a lot and we&#x27;ll hope it happens this time thanks for tuning in today and have a great day we&#x27;ll start with chapter 11 tomorrow which is on thermoelectric properties</p>
