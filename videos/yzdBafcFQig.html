            <p>And this could be like a very quick answer. When everything&#x27;s spinning, does it cause any kind of radio interference? If you had a radio playing, would it pre? No. No. This uh installation doesn&#x27;t produce any bad effects. But if we speak about impulse gravity generator, we put a Faraday cage over the installation otherwise uh all the the computers in the surrounding area will be burned.</p>
<p>So there are some still unexplored fields which accompany these effects and we noticed them. One thing that I wanted to ask, I know it&#x27;s um it might be kind of off bounds as well, but you&#x27;re saying that you&#x27;re using different materials now um as opposed to superconductors like normal materials. Um what would they be? Uh I just uh wanted to emphasize that it is not necessary always to use uh superconducting materials for the gravity research but these materials are very good as model materials. We can uh practically create whatever magnetic fields we want and use the properties of Einstein condensate. As far as we understand how the system works, we can move to normal materials because uh the key to polarizing space is also rotating magnetic fields uh which work in uh a certain uh resonance cycle and uh in order to create these conditions we don&#x27;t need superconductors we just need normal materials.</p>
<p>This is more for like getting down on the layman side of things. Um, and kind of going back to like the applications and implications of your work. Um, but do you see it um what kind of what kind of like the vehicles of the future and the weapons of the future and things like that that may come through this or uh uh well first of all I&#x27;m a scientist. I&#x27;m not a military person and I try to uh keep uh the results of the research of my team and of my colleagues on the net. It&#x27;s open to everyone and uh I&#x27;m ready uh to have scientific and industrial contacts with any organization that is interested in this uh research and in this methods in these methods.</p>
<p>But definitely uh everything can be used for military purposes. Uh the planes, the UFOs if we build one, uh gravity impulse generator, but they can also be used uh for the purposes of defense. And uh if we speak about uh different uh space bodies that approach earth with big speed or if we speak about uh drilling um uh to very um deep uh level inside the earth. If we speak about propagation system, if we speak about communications, so there can be different um applications, military, scientific, medical, technical, uh whatever you say. Okay, great.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s perfect. Um I was just wondering as well um what are the general criticisms or like um I don&#x27;t criticism necessarily the right word but what are the things you generally come up against with your peers the um with this theory because obviously it&#x27;s a groundbreaking theory. What are the things that kind of um challenge people the most? uh frankly speaking I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ve never met any serious uh scientific opposition in this field uh because first of all these results are unique at present only several laboratories in the world tried some uh simplified approach to the same problem but uh people who worked in this uh area for several years or who contacted me. They are convinced that uh we are not creating any new science. We are just uh opening the pages which were not opened before us.</p>
<p>Of course, some people say you go against Newton, you go against Einstein and then these are usually the professors of physics and then we have a very interesting discussion and I say please uh professor could you tell me what exactly we are talking about and after half an hour or even 10 minutes of discussion we came to a conclusion that uh most of the professors of physics they did not study the works of Einstein. nor the works of uh Sir Isaac Newton. Uh I&#x27;m not an expert uh on their works, but I spent uh several weeks at the library of the British Museum in London and I studied the works of Sir Isaac Newton in the original. The language is a bit different but quite understandable. And uh uh I&#x27;m not very good at German though I can read but I used all the translations from the work of Einstein and his lectures and his books and his articles and I found that a lot of things uh my experiments the experiments of my team they prove a lot of theoretical statements that were made by Newton or Einstein.</p>
<p>and and people who want to criticize me, they practically um have no background in this field. So, um I was just wondering um it&#x27;s kind of not that direct a question, but obviously um you&#x27;ve had the interest from NASA that have approached you. Um is this something that worldwide everyone&#x27;s interested in or are you having to kind of really push the point to get people excited? Well uh NASA is interested definitely uh British airspace uh is interested uh people in France are interested. There is enormous interest from China because they have very good theoreticians in this field and uh they are building uh slowly but surely uh the research program in this field. Uh there are certain difficulties even for people who are working in this area because if we uh if we discuss the problems of gravity or anti-gravity it&#x27;s like a red flag.</p>
<p>people become excited. Uh they uh it&#x27;s too unusual to take it openly because for many years uh these topics were shown only in the scientific literature or uh science fiction and also in some films. So uh now we need a very good u scientific analysis of the situation and uh we need to accept experimental gravity research as one of the uh leading fields in physics that is important even in NASA. You know NASA is a very conservative organization much more conservative than British aerospace. A lot of people are working there.</p>
<p>They are normal engineers, rather good engineers, but they have also assistant directors and managers who would like to continue their work in NASA uh for several years more and uh they are not flexible. They try to base their research even with international space station and shuttle program uh on the technology of nuts and bolts and that&#x27;s not the way to explore space and uh the president of the United States Mr. Bush uh made an excellent uh program for NASA and he made a interview on the TV uh concerning the exploration of deeper space. Everything was right but one thing was missing. They don&#x27;t have the technology which allows this exploration.</p>
<p>So the the best thing to do is to concentrate on the modern aspects of physics on experimental gravity research and to put even 5% of funding which is available for the international space station to this research and in that case in 10 years we can get a new flying vehicle which will fly all over the globe. hope and even to deeper space. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on Eric Leweight&#x27;s gyroscopes and his um results in mass transfer. Okay, just a couple of Yeah. Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Uh I don&#x27;t want to criticize uh NASA people. They&#x27;re hardworking people and they&#x27;re determined definitely. But uh the administration of NASA uh has in my point of view poor understanding what should be done. And uh I have my greatest respect for John Glenn, the first American astronaut and the former member of the US Congress. And uh he uh supported with all his forces uh the uh breakthrough propulsion system research and the research which uh was begun with superconductors and each time he came to Marshall Space Flight Center he was met uh with joy and with respect and people promised everything and he is a very wise person.</p>
<p>he understands what uh the future is about. But then he left and uh the research was slowly uh stopped and now it is practically at zero point and sometimes people uh still remember John Glennon said oh he wanted this research to be continued but then modern administration</p>
