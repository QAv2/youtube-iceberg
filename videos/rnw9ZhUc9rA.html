            <p>hi everyone on the weekend my dad taught me about zero point energy and lots of other things about science today i&#x27;m showing you the blueprint of the energy multiplier i thought of this is a battery and the energy is being put through the pipe the two vacuum chambers work together and create more energy as it as the energy comes together it pushes out the end of the pipe and it multiplies the energy as the power of the battery doesn&#x27;t co-heat the bottom it just goes across and gets multiplied once the energy is fully multiplied you can put it back through and as the vacuum chambers keep working it can be multiplied a lot more thanks for watching</p>
