            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel we look at theories of everything and other things that might help you out in your life that you might not know about today is V uh video number 419 that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson and Mr Larson uh in 1959 proposed osed his two fundamental postulates uh upon which he constructed a theoretical universe so these two postulates stated How the Universe operated and then through a process of deduction he derived a theoretical Universe about okay if if my postulates are correct this is what my universe would look like and then he compared his theoretical Universe with the empirical universe of the Legacy scientist things that they had measured in their Laboratories and um compiled in their table scientific tables in particular um we&#x27;re looking at in this uh uh set of videos we&#x27;re looking at uh Larson&#x27;s book basic properties of matter which goes over chemistry so he Compares his theoretical results on the basic properties of matter with the uh tables that the chemist had put together uh for some of these basic properties such as uh the interatomic distance which is what we&#x27;re working on here also uh the compressibility and the specific heat and um melting point boiling point and so on um now the um major uh part of Larson&#x27;s theory is articulated in his first fundamental postulate the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two fundamental aspects space and time two reciprocal sorry I&#x27;ve done that twice in a row now two reciprocal aspects space and time and that&#x27;s why he calls it the reciprocal system because of the reciprocal relation of space and time in motion motion is a fraction that is uh got space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator but space or time can come in three dimensions as Mo as does motion and so it&#x27;s a little bit more complicated than just time over space or space over time they can uh have EXP components as well um when Larson refers to the concept of motion it&#x27;s a little bit different than what you would normally think of uh Larson is referring uh the contents of the universe are uh made out of scalar motion this is a kind of non-localized um U more generalized motion that has a magnitude but has no specific Direction you can Envision a scalar motion as a um if you if you imagine a balloon and then you put dots on it with a marker uh if you blow up the balloon all of the dots will be moving away from each other so that&#x27;s an outward motion an outward scalar motion but there&#x27;s no specific Direction each dot is moving away from each other Dot and there&#x27;s no real way to you know determine the directions uh not until you assign a reference point until you uh arbitrarily assume that one of the dots is motionless and then then you can start making um judgments about Direction and then Larson refers to this as the progression uh you could also think of it as the flow and then the inverse of that sucking in the balloon Contracting balloon all of the dots will be moving toward each other and that is analogous to gravitation and that&#x27;s why um people think that there are gravitational fields uh because they are stopping the universe by by assuming that one of the dotts is motionless when you do that then you can start determining the gravitational field or the field of attraction between two separate dots but in reality all of the dots are moving toward all of the other dots there&#x27;s no field there that&#x27;s why Larsson calls the uh force of gravity uh as an as if force it acts as if there is a field there but there isn&#x27;t it&#x27;s just a scalar motion uh this kind of motion was also observed uh in um by Hubble and his folks back in the 20s 1920s um that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other so the galaxies are also participating in this kind of motion um fortunately the scientist uh blamed that attributed that motion to the Big Bang as opposed to um the uh expanding balloon model and when you attribute it to the big bang you basically are um stopping the universe again and uh assuming that our un our galaxy is motionless so um this is you know an erroneous at least dubious U idea that our universe would be the one that would be our galaxy would be the one that would be motionless now [Music] um other aspects of this first postulate uh the universe is made out of motion particularly SC motion motion is the relationship between space and time uh all of our scientific quantities are fractions of space or time is the numerator time or space is the denominator speed is space over time energy is time over space matter is time to the 3 over space to the 3 and so on and uh that also simplifies matters a lot in terms of checking your equations and uh looking at Old equations from history to see if they&#x27;re balanced out right and just kind of getting rid of that mass component that the MK system relies upon getting rid of that mass and substituting a t t cubed over s cubed instead and then um both space and time are identical as reciprocals of one another uh and you can see that reciprocal relationship in speed um say you can say the bicycle is moving 12 M hour 12 mil of space and 1 hour of time but you could say let&#x27;s double the speed double the speed well okay uh this the bike is now moving 24 miles hour you double double the space or you can equivalently say the bike is now moving 12 m per half hour you can have half the time it&#x27;s a reciprocal relationship um then also uh space and time have not only their co uh not only their scalar aspects which Larson calls clock time and clock space us CL the clock is always the time is always getting further and further further apart space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart uh like on the surface of an expanding balloon but then when you stop the universe then you can also see coordinate space and coordinate time this is a three-dimensional um distribution of space coordinate space thre Dimensions like XYZ coordinates or volume in a still frame and so in our environment we generally couple the um coordinate space with clock time okay so we see three dimensions of space in a still frame and uh the clock is always moving forward always getting later and later and later or farther and farther and farther apart um from now and uh if we were in a different part of the universe we would see the reciprocal of that which is um three dimensions of time coordinate time U maybe you would call that J JK coordinates um in a still frame and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart the flow of space and um the reason why we can see those two or or know of those two different um kind of reference systems the spatial and the temporal reference systems is uh because of this uh discrete unit uh aspect of this postulate um time and space and motion come only in discrete units you have to have a full unit of space before you have space you have to have a full unit of time before you have time if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have what Larson calls unit speed and unit speed is the speed of light 1 over 1 equals 1 so the speed of light in larsson&#x27;s universe is the midpoint of the universe or the background of the universe or the um the initial point the empty Universe the origin the uh zero Point even though it&#x27;s one it&#x27;s serves as a zero point in this universe um half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light that&#x27;s called The Cosmic sector and that&#x27;s where you have coordinate time and clock space and half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light that&#x27;s the familiar sector of the universe that Larson calls the material sector where we have clock uh coordinate space SP and clock time and uh then that also that discrete unit uh part also creates two sub regions in there which are uh what Larson calls the time region and the space region the time region is in the material sector that is uh where the interactions like for molecules atoms and molecules where the interactions are occurring within one unit of space one unit of space is about 4.56 x 10us 8 MERS and uh when you have interactions that occur in less than what that one unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space and since the universe is composed of motion which is the relationship between space and time if it&#x27;s not space then it has to be time so um this is what Larson calls the time region and so when you cross that boundary that unit space boundary the rules again invert just like they invert when you cross the unit speed boundary so when you move into the time region all of a sudden the uh progression is not moving outward but it is moving inward towards zero space and the um gravitation is not moving inward but it is moving outward toward um unit space and the same thing occurs in the cosmic sector except that is called the space region and that occurs within one unit of time so gravitation and the progression again invert the but this is the progression of time so time now uh the progression moves toward zero time while Gra gravitation moves uh outward toward unit time okay now in chapter two here of this book we&#x27;ve uh done about four episodes here so and about 13 total episodes on this book basic properties of matter so if you want to go back to the beginning you know go back that many episodes uh but we are uh smack dab in the middle of chapter um two and he&#x27;s talking about the diff the distances interatomic distances in particular for the division 3 elements uh the division 3 elements are the elements um with veilance greater than four but they are on the uh right hand side of the periodic table um so the um electr negative elements uh with veence greater than four and or four great I I I&#x27;m not sure which it is but um he&#x27;s he&#x27;s uh we&#x27;re up to this part where there&#x27;s a table and the table is comparing the calculated values with the observe values and these are measured in angstroms um and so he went through the uh in Prior videos we went through the equation that he uses for this basically theoretically the way he calculates the interatomic distan is that is the equilibrium position established in the time region where the constant force of the progression the progression is always the same Larsson calls that the progression of the natural reference system U motion outward at the speed of light in all directions that is the progression of the natural reference system and that is always existence always existent and then gravity which is variable um based on uh what you call the inverse Square um you know the closer they are the more they attract um or the farther away they are the less they attract but that is in Reverse in the time region so the closer they are they um fur more they repel and uh so when that gravitational force is equal to the constant force of the progression that is where the interatomic equilibrium is established so that is what you would calculate for the interatomic distance and for elements uh in division three we&#x27;ve got copper calculated 2.53 observe 2.55 again this is an angstroms zinc calculated at 2.90 observed at 2.91 and he puts also the uh the three uh three numbers of that describe atoms in the reciprocal system so every atom first has uh two photons that are rotating around the same or rotating and vibrating around the same point at the core of the atom uh but those are those are photons so they move at the rate of the progression uh at the speed of light in order to slow down the photons uh to zero to get them to gravitate you have to rotate the photons and you need three dimensions of rotation uh just like you need three dimensions of anything in the reciprocal system um three dimensions uh XYZ coordinates or what whatever um too slow down and stop the uh before it is an atom and it gravitates and then it&#x27;s subject to this time region so um every atom has its three number signature the first number is primary two-dimensional rotations the second number is secondary two-dimensional rotations and the third number is optional um which is a uh one-dimensional rotation in the opposite uh opposing the uh two scalar uh rotations there these these motions are all scalar motion so they don&#x27;t necessarily have a direction or either in or out those are the only scaler directions that there are in or out okay so for example copper here its numbers are 438 uh copper is element 29 and so you know it&#x27;s uh the the first two uh numbers are they alternate so uh for example helium is 210 uh you you need two primary two-dimensional rotations and one secondary two-dimensional rotation and since it is a noble gas you don&#x27;t need any uh onedimensional rotation so 2 one0 that first one is to overcome uh you have to you have to establish a rotational Base by overcoming that first um motion outward at the speed of light the first dimension of that uh what when you overcome that that is what Larson calls the rotational base that gives you a base on which to build so uh that that extra uh rotation is extra two- dimensional rotation is always there uh and it is um so building up they alternate so uh taking the noble gas series you got uh helium is 2 one0 Neon the next uh noble gas would be 220 and then the next one argon would be 320 and then Krypton the next one would be 330 and then um you move up to uh for some reason I I feel like I&#x27;m I&#x27;m doing that wrong um but I I think that&#x27;s right there might be an extra um I know helium is 210 so neon 220 argon 3 uh 320 and then um Krypton would be 330 and then Xenon would be 430 Ron would be 4 4 z um and then it closes out at the end of that row um but I guess when you calculate the specific rotation which is what he&#x27;s got on this graph or on this table uh you put in an extra um an extra one because he has copper listed here for its specific rotation as 438 and I would think that it would be um three 28 32 uh I I and it would be negative it would be 33 uh 7 337 um but anyway um he yeah he has 4 3 8 through 10 so 8 through 10 is the uh specific rotation in the electric in the one-dimensional anyway uh we&#x27;ll kind of get we&#x27;ll get that worked out eventually here um so 2.53 observed 2.55 zinc 2.90 observed 2.91 uh the second uh orientation of zinc uh 2.66 calculated observed 2.66 Gallum 2.79 observed 2.80 second uh second gallium orientation 2.46 observe 2.44 silver uh up to the uh 3B uh row uh we got uh 2.87 observe 2.88 cadmium uh 3.20 observed 3.26 and then the other one uh or other orientation of cadmium is 2.94 observe 2.97 uh and so on he&#x27;s got many other elements here um going to the next row would start out with um half neum 3.26 observed 3.32 tantalum 2.67 observe 2.66 uh so on and so forth gold 2.87 observe 2.88 Mercury 2.98 observed 3.0 the other orientation of mercury 3.43 observed 3.47 and um okay so the secondary positive orientation is not possible in the electropositive divisions as 8 - x is negative in these divisions and like the negative orientation itself an 8 - x negative combination would be confined to a subordinate role in one or two dimensions of an asymmetric structure such a crystal structure cannot compete with the high probability of the symmetrical electropositive crystals and therefore does not exist in the electr negative divisions however the 8 - x displacement is positive and there are no limitations on it aside from those arising from the high uh displacement values the effective displacement again Larson uses the term displacement instead of speed because um the Legacy scientists measure speed because their reference point is is zero so they measure uh the difference from zero but Larson is measuring the difference from the progression of the natural reference system the uh the uh outward at the speed of light in all directions that is larsson&#x27;s Baseline his zero point that um because Larson has a universe of motion so you have to be able to conceive of motion without any thing moving motion precedes all of that and so the universe is in motion before there&#x27;s anything in that universe and so Larson makes his measurements from that and so he calls these speed displacements because there is already a speed outward at the speed of light in all directions his speed displacement is how how far away from that speed are we talking talking about and those are always in um integers occasionally halves but basically in integers uh quantized so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s talking about when he says speed displacement or the effective displacement of the secondary positive orientation is even even greater than might be expected from the magnitude of the quantity 8 minus X as the change of zero points for the two oppositely directed motions is also oppositely directed and the new zero points are 16 displacements apart the resultant relative displacement is 16 - 2x and the corresponding specific rotation is 18 - 2x um I&#x27;m a little bit lost when he when he does this 8 - x or 16 - 2x uh thing um I&#x27;m going to tr try to figure that out uh over time here but um I think it&#x27;s just the simple algebra um thing that&#x27;s got me uh discombobulated with this um basically though what it means is just if you&#x27;re talking about um the periodic table and you&#x27;re talking about you know going from uh from uh hydrogen you know hydrogen lithium burum boron carbon nitrogen oxygen Florine and you&#x27;re back to Neon that&#x27;s eight and so um you can either say plus three to get the Boron or you can say 8 - x 8 minus 3 which would be five to go this way so uh he&#x27;s saying that the the whole circle around is 8 and you can either use the positive orientation X or you can use 8 - x and then I guess he&#x27;s saying here that the zero points are 16 displacement units apart um that I&#x27;m not quite getting that uh because even though the spe the specific rotation is 18 - 2x um and that makes sense uh because those higher uh if you go up a couple rows then when you&#x27;re going from um argon to Krypton that&#x27;s 18 units and so you can either say you know if you&#x27;re going over to uh to Copper number 29 from 18 you could go 11 or you can go 18us 11 which would be 7 this way um I think that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying not sure I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll uh I&#x27;ll try to figure it out in division 4 the numerical values of the latter expression range from 10 to 16 and because of the low probability of such high rotations this again this is Larson doeses much of his deduction based on probabilities and there is within probability the idea that small numbers are more probable than large numbers I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s connected with benford&#x27;s law um but um small numbers have higher probabilities so these large uh these large numbers are less probable um than the short the smaller numbers so you always have a tendency to go toward that noble gas that is closer to you uh and because of the low probability ility of such high rotations the secondary positive orientation is limited to one or one and one/ half dimensions in spite of its positive character don&#x27;t know what he means by one and a half Dimensions um I&#x27;m assuming that he&#x27;s dividing by two uh here somehow but because the um Atomic Ori the atomic numbers are based on double units so that&#x27;s perhaps what he&#x27;s talking about uh like I said when you study this stuff a lot of it is uh detective work you know you have to speculate you have to guess and then you have to like confirm whether your guesses are right uh by looking at the later context um you know this is not uh uh fed to you on a silver platter you have to do the digging and you have to um you know sustain ambivalence and sustain ambiguity um you know you&#x27;re not going to U be able to understand this immediately it&#x27;s somewhat of a mystery but um Larson uh pretends at least like he he has it pretty clear in his head um I think he he has it way clearer in his head than he that it is in mine but I I think in some cases Larson isn&#x27;t he he in many places he does admit that you know this is speculative I&#x27;m not quite sure about this this thing but in some cases he&#x27;s pretty sure about it okay in division three the 8 - x displacements are lower but in this case they are too low a two unit separation ation of the zero points 16 displacement units cannot be maintained unless the effective displacement is at least eight one full three-dimensional unit that is 2 * 2 * 2 the secondary positive orientation is therefore confined to division 4 okay we&#x27;re going to stop right there and uh we&#x27;ll start trudging through this chat chapter uh again tomorrow and um you know this is only for the uh you know the uh strong-hearted folks who really want to learn this and are you know somewhat Bulldog is about it because um you know this isn&#x27;t uh this is just like all esoteric studies you have to um you know you have to put in a lot of work you have to do a lot of repetition you trying to change your Paradigm but the rewards will be there eventually everyone&#x27;s going to have to learn this stuff so you might as well get in on the ground floor thanks for tuning</p>
