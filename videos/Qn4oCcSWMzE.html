            <p>hello and welcome i came across many questions from you in the past what scalar wave is and what a scalar network is i produced the video in september 2012 on youtube where i demonstrated exactly both of them in this video you see the instrumentation from a radio and power engineering use this is the scala network analyzer which identifies the impedance of a transmission line and a filter i also demonstrated in this video that the dimension of a tesla coil has an impact of the wave velocity of the frequency or the speed of light in the wire so let us start simple the term is mostly used in long eternal procreations of particles so in the form of a famous example would be the vibration in air by a sound fog let me give you a picture of that i do not want to get too much into detail a full documentation of that will be provided for my members on my website so what you see here is the vibration of a tuning fork based on the position of a and b it is either causing the air molecules to compress or it will cause a refraction this kind of behavior happens in all matter and is a longitudinal property are also called a pressure wave in solid matter we have a similar behavior which is more complicated because it involves electron quasi particles in physics quartz quasi particles and collective excitations which are closely related are emergent phenomena that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as solid behaves as if it contains different weakly interacting particles in vacuum for example as an electron travels through a semiconductor its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interaction with other electrons and with atomic nuclei the electron behaves as thought it has a different effective mass travel unperturbed in vacuum such an electron is called an electron quasi particle in another example segregated motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor or a hole bend in a metal behave as thought the material instead contain positively charged participles called electron holes other particle causing particles or collective excitations include the photon at the particle derived from a vibration of atoms in the solid a plasmon a particle derived from plasma oscillatory oscillations and many others it is important here to understand that this phenomenon explains the mechanism we experience when we work with tesla coils professor dr mail explains that the scalar wave is existent in the near field of any broadcast because it it is part of it as it propagates as a vortex from dipole antenna let me bring you a picture that much shows you that the charged carrier oscillates with high frequency in an antenna rod from longitudinal standing wave as a result also the fields in the near zone of a hertzian dipole are longitudinal scalar wave fields the picture shows clearly how vortices are forming and how they come off the dipole the vortex decay however depends on the velocity of propagation calculated at the speed of light vortices already have decayed within half of the wavelength the faster the velocity the more stable they get they remain stable above one to six times the velocity these very fast vortices contract in the dimension they can now tunnel therefore speed faster than light occurs adds the tunnel effect therefore no faraday cage can shield such vortices since the field forces with particle nature following the high frequency oscillation permanently change the polarity from positive to negative and back they don&#x27;t have a charge on the average over time as a result they are almost unhindered penetrate solids particles with this properties are called neutrinos in physics the field energy which is collected in my experiment according to that stems from the neutrino radiation which surrounds us because the source of the radiation all the same if it&#x27;s origin or artificial or natural is far away of the receiver every attempt of near-field interpretation goes wrong after all the installed transmitter engineer field supplies only 10 percent of the received power the 90 however which it concerns here cannot stem from the near field zone now let us look here at the scalar network in a different way and i would like to compare it with the flow of water here in this short slides i want to demonstrate the flow of the energy of the waves in the coils and here i symbolize both coils with two water tanks which are filled with water so the water is representing then the energy level we have or yes the strength of um current or power which is um resides then at that very um same time on both sides so here in this first example we see here attuning to the resonance frequency and that is the hertzian frequency so the pressure is on both sides the same and we have a balanced power on both coils in the second picture we are out of tune below the herzin frequency we consume and reflect all the power we transmitting back to the amplifier the receiver here has no impact regardless if we connect it or not so technically here we are having all the power on the transmitter and nothing goes to receiver so on the third slide it shows the tuning to the scalar wave so all pressure is now on the receiver side and now if we change the pressure now on the receiver side it has now an impact on the transmitter the more pressure the receiver can take the lower the pressure is on the transmitter so in the last slide now here i show the impact an impedance transformer have so here i symbolize him here as a as a big tank on the side it hasn&#x27;t it&#x27;s an additional reservoir of water but needs only to swap a little bit over it to the transmitter to have a tsunami wave effect to the receiver increasing the pressure dramatically on the receiver side we are now capturing quasi particles or neutrinos which are giving the vibration and energy to the receiver the fluctuating of potential from positive to negative becomes polarized in the receiver now we measure is cop greater than one this example is equal is equivalent to any alternative energy system here energy flows from either direct direct connecting transmitter to receiver or in the near field of both important is that the herdstone frequency and standard resonance can not be used a tuning has always to be asymmetrical to the scalar wave so this concludes my little presentation and if you have any questions please come back or join me on my website to get further under updates of the latest findings i present in my videos thank you</p>
