            <p>it is consciousness chaitanya the word is chaitanyum in sanskrit or chit chaitanyum chit these are the words used and what he says is there is a consciousness in you this is chaitanya and you have a mind and you have a body this consciousness shines in the mind and through that in the body in all the organs of the body and you feel this consciousness this is the answer now the answer here is the thing to be noted here is the teacher presents consciousness in five aspects these five points you have to understand appreciate first of all consciousness is not a part of your body or your mind consciousness is not a part of your body or your mind it is apart from your body and mind here it&#x27;s different from science because modern science would say consciousness is a product of your body even your mind is a product of your body mind and consciousness all are products of the brain that&#x27;s what physiology would say today but here the teacher says consciousness is apart from your mind and body first point it is not a part of your body it&#x27;s not a product of your body second point it&#x27;s a part but it pervades and illumines the mind and body consciousness pervades and illumines the mind and body enabling it to function third point this consciousness is not limited by the mind and body it exists apart from the mind and body also it&#x27;s not limited to it it&#x27;s not something here in this particular brain in this part of the body it&#x27;s not limited by the body third this consciousness is known it is known in the functioning of the mind and body the functioning through the functioning of the mind and body we can know consciousness we can experience consciousness and fifth the last point to be appreciated is without the mind and body consciousness is still there but it cannot be known it&#x27;s not experienced example five points i&#x27;ll give an example there is light here from these tube lights there&#x27;s light here here is my hand and light is being reflected from this hand okay it&#x27;s being reflected from this hand the light which is being reflected from this hand you can see here the light being reflected from this hand the light is not a part of this hand it&#x27;s not a product of this hand okay first point the second point is it pervades the hand and illumines the hand third point is i can understand the light a third point is it exists it&#x27;s not limited by the hand other than the hand also it exists everywhere and the fourth point is it&#x27;s by the reflection in the in this hand that i can understand the light just now here i cannot understand the light but when i put my hand here and shines i can understand the light i can experience the light when it is reflected and the last point very interesting is if i remove the hand the light is still there but it&#x27;s not experienced now it&#x27;s experienced now it&#x27;s not experienced</p>
