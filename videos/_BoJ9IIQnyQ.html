            <p>we have already seen the effect of combining two or more similar vectors in the vector addition process however what happens when we combine two different types of vectors the answer lies in the mathematical operation known as Vector multiplication Vector multiplication refers to the process of multiplying two vectors to obtain a new Vector that represents some combination of the original vectors there are several types of vector multiplication including scalar multiplication of a vector dot product and cross product scalar multiplication involves multiplying a vector by a scalar value this result in a new Vector that is parallel or antiparallel to the original Vector with a magnitude that is multiplied by the scalar value for example if we have a vector a equals to A1 A2 A3 and a scalar value k then the scalar product of A and K is given by ka1 ka2 ka3 scalar multiplication is useful in a variety of applications including scaling vectors to change their length changing the direction of a vector and finding projections of one vector onto another</p>
