            <p>i&#x27;m tim ventura and we are joined once again by dr eugene poglinoff and we are talking about gravity so eugene thank you for joining us let me start right out by uh we haven&#x27;t talked in years so let me ask what you&#x27;re currently up to are you still working at the technology university in tampere yes my current job is at tamper university of technology in finland but frankly speaking my [Music] work in the field of gravity research goes a bit parallel to my main lectures so it&#x27;s kind of a hobby ah okay and you&#x27;re still teaching as i understand things right uh yes yes that&#x27;s right i&#x27;m an expert in the field of chemistry and material science oh okay okay that makes sense so so you essentially as a career then you&#x27;re teaching chemistry and and you&#x27;re continuing what&#x27;s been about 30 years of work now on gravity research on the side yes that&#x27;s absolutely correct more than 30 years in the field that we call experimental gravity research wonderful and i should also ask are you still conducting experiments at the moscow chemical institute because i know that you did some work there in the past well at present there are several places where i try to organize the research and moscow is one of the centers i also work and have some installations here in finland i lately [Music] completed my research in czech republic in prague and there are also some groups working in italy uh in canada in the united kingdom ah okay okay so you&#x27;re actually working with a number of different people and organizations as well as is working in a few different facilities now one of those as i understand it from past papers that you&#x27;ve written is dr giovanni modanis right in italy uh yes uh giovanni modernese is an outstanding scientist he is considered at present to be number one in uh quantum gravity he is an excellent physicist but he is a theoretician so that&#x27;s why we have very good uh understanding and uh i work for him and he works for me so it&#x27;s a very good thing yeah that makes sense and so the the breakdown i guess for the audience would be that really you&#x27;re you&#x27;re focused on experimental research and then he is is hopefully trying to provide some guidance from a theoretical perspective but he&#x27;s also trying to interpret that into models of of perhaps relativity quantum gravity things along those lines yes that&#x27;s right and i also have a very good and profound cooperation with dr paul laviolette he is from the united states so we have a very good common understanding of what is going on in the field of gravity and we have a joined plans and joined discussions on this topic ah okay well now i i guess i should get into your latest experiments um i was forwarded a couple of videos showing rotating superconductors and so it looks as if you&#x27;ve come back to your original experiments again this goes back 30 years where you&#x27;re rotating what appear to be ybco superconductors at high speeds and it&#x27;s creating what what was described in the past as a gravitational shielding effect can you describe those for me a bit yes we continue the work in this direction we do not call this effect gravitational shielding we called it a modification of the local gravity field and yes i began this work 30 years ago but if we regard the history of this rotating disks this technology was used by german engineers during the second world war they had those flying disks and now after many years of work i managed to learn their secrets how they made those flying discs and how it is possible to use the objects which rotate with big speed which have a part of superconducting components inside them but these superconductors are needed only to create a certain density of electrons so first we began with high temperature superconductors but now we&#x27;re working practically with very thin gold layers which can provide superconductivity at room temperature this method is much more efficient and so we started in detail the effects which take place when any object is rotating with big speed around its own axis according to einstein such objects create a gravity field around them we of course agree with einstein and also we think that it&#x27;s not only a gravity field but it&#x27;s a torsion field and for the first time in the history of physics we managed to demonstrate the existence of torsion fields these are quite powerful fields which can be called force fields they are not connected to electrical fields or magnetic fields so at first it was difficult for people to believe and to understand that they exist but now according to our experiments these effects can be easily uh reproduced and obtained in any laboratory at any university oh okay so so let me back up just a second if i understand things correctly i just want to clarify originally you were working with superconductors but but what you were saying is it&#x27;s the electron density or perhaps the cooper pair density that was really required and you were able to actually work with thin film gold foils on on normal conductors now is that how things have changed yes that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s right ah okay okay so now out of kerasi do these need to be cooled or can you work with these at a normal temperature no we work now at normal temperature there is no need for cooling oh okay amazing amazing um well now using your your newer methodology how much force are you able to generate [Music] well i can only some evaluations so uh i think we can reach about from 300 to 500 kilograms per square meter so this is the lifting force and what is interesting uh that our devices can easily work at under the conditions of vacuum which means that they can and will definitely replace uh their jet engines and turbo jet engines which cannot work at the height of 20 kilometers and more because the air becomes very thin and they cannot provide good combustion but our devices can work and they show the maximum lifting force under the conditions of vacuum so they can leave lift from the surface of the earth and go to the height of 200 kilometers easily okay so so the way that you&#x27;re describing this and and i&#x27;m not sure if i understand this correctly but um it sounds like this is a reactive force than a reactionary force so so rather than and again you&#x27;ve said that it&#x27;s not gravity shielding as you&#x27;ve said in the past where uh where again originally i think the belief was that it was a column um above the superconductor had lower gravity what you&#x27;re describing now sounds more like a repulsive force um and that might be how you use it in a jet engine right would that be correct that is correct and our technology allows to produce both uh the repulsive force and the attractive force it depends on the geometrical configuration but from the beginning or of course the term uh gravity shielding was not the best one simply we tried to explain somehow the experimental results that we got but uh in fact uh what we managed to do and what we are doing now this is the modification of the local gravity field that&#x27;s the way oh okay now would this work for instance in space where there&#x27;s no reaction mass to push against yes of course these devices can be used for space propulsion but still you should understand that these are mechanical models which use pretty heavy discs that are rotating with big speed so if we speak about real and serious exploration of space and inter-space travel it is better to use not rotating disks but rotating magnetic fields which is the second stage of the research that we are developing at present oh i see i see so you&#x27;re you&#x27;re actually able to potentially to create create a solid-state device based on this yes without any moving parts ah okay now i should ask about the scalability of this effect um how do you think in terms of aircraft or spacecraft things along those lines do you have any plans to to make a larger effect or to increase the efficiency in the future that you could describe well if we speak about uh the rotating disks uh we uh practically use the knowledge that we got from the german scientists uh so i don&#x27;t think that uh it&#x27;s possible to make reliable installations with a diameter more than six meters but if we speak about the devices which use rotation of the magnetic fields they can be uh pretty big and by the way they provide much better lifting force so we can talk about let&#x27;s say from 10 000 kilos to 50 000 kilos from square meter which is a remarkable result and definitely it it can be used for propulsion in space that is remarkable now you&#x27;ve mentioned uh german technology a couple of times and i i may be mistaken but i had heard a rumor that your father actually was familiar with some of this technology and that you may have learned about some of this through him is that kind of the path that you used to to understand what they were developing yes that is right and that helped us a lot but uh after the second world war both sides uh american scientists and russian scientists they got the drawings of the german flying vehicles but the drawings were very approximate and it took me 30 years [Music] to study the effect and [Music] to get all the knowledge that allows to use it for propulsion oh okay okay i think you&#x27;re talking probably about the real craft if i remember right i believe that was what they called them yeah that&#x27;s right yeah well i should ask um what brought you back to rotating i guess superconductors and now uh now the rotating devices that you&#x27;re working with after doing the force beam experiment well first of all [Music] the device which we call uh gravity beam generator uh it&#x27;s only a small part of the equipment that will be used for interspace travel it is mainly i can say it&#x27;s it&#x27;s meteorite gun or a gravity gun which is able uh to uh to deteriorate different obstacles when the flying disc is moving in space but if we speak about transportation on the earth and around the planet and if we speak about the energy production then of course our attention should be concentrated on what we call gravity generators and these both things rotating disks and toroidal solenoids where we have rotating magnetic fields these are the examples of gravity generators and having gravity generators and developing them for the population of the earth will definitely change the whole life or on our planet absolutely well now in the video it shows and i think you were probably doing this to demonstrate that the effect is is directional right but the videos that you sent show both horizontal and vertical orientations for the force that was produced can you describe that a little bit for me uh when the disc is rotating and it reaches some speed of rotation the density of electrons is increased because uh the whole structure is pretty complicated and is made by iron implantation uh so some forces appear that first of all produce the lifting force and also they produce a kind of gravity field or torsion field that [Music] envelopes the space around this rotating disk and yes these these forces are uh vector fields so they can be directed to any uh direction in space so uh the vehicle will follow uh these these vectors and in fact uh what is happening from physical point of view these gravity generators create or modify gravity in a very uh small space near the rotating object and they create a gravity well so the whole the whole construction the whole device is falling into this gravity well and we watch it as a flying vehicle which starts from the surface of the earth and lifts and goes to the skies ah okay okay now in the experiments itself and and again i&#x27;m just going by what i saw in the videos it appears that there&#x27;s an object that&#x27;s suspended over the rotating disk and attached to kind of an armature that allows it to move up and down and then it looks like you have a kind of a restraining string at least in the vertical configuration just to prevent it from scraping the disk as as the disk rotates um can you describe the actual experimental setup a little bit for me so we have a vacuum chamber we have a disc which is which has this special nano coatings the the disks the disk is rotating at the speed from 8 000 rotations per minute up to 12 000 rotations per minute and at these speeds [Music] we have that lifting force and all the objects not depending of what they are made we can use the samples made of glass wood paper metal whatever it is they&#x27;re being repelled from the surface of the disk oh okay and now one of the things and i&#x27;m sure that you&#x27;ve taken this into account but one of the things i wondered was have you been able to rule out experimental errors from perhaps vibrations in the in the machine in the assembly or from a conductive armature that might be creating an inductive effect uh yes it&#x27;s a typical question that people ask the samples that we use can weigh 30 grams can be 50 grams can be even more and using only vibration in the vacuum chamber it&#x27;s impossible to move these objects up to five or seven centimeters from the surface of the disk so no it&#x27;s definitely not the vibration and as i said that this experiment can be easily reproduced at any laboratory so people who are interested in this i mean who have serious interest they can ask me for help and uh i will make the demonstration yeah so so when the device works and and just to just to describe what i what i saw it appears that that the sample that&#x27;s attached to the armature begins to flap up and down past a certain speed i i guess the best way to to to rule out any kind of experimental error would be um when you try this with a disc that doesn&#x27;t use like the the iron implanted gold foil um probably nothing happens right all right yeah so and and so i guess that&#x27;s probably the easiest way to to determine that an effect is actually happening um no no no the easiest way is that when we begin uh rotating uh the disk we see how the speed of rotation changes and at speed of rotation let&#x27;s say of 7 000 rotations per minute nothing happens then beginning from 8 000 and more we see the effect and the vibration is practically of the same level so only at certain speed of rotation uh these effects take place oh i see what you&#x27;re saying i see what you&#x27;re saying i&#x27;m sorry um and so you&#x27;ve mentioned using many different materials you said you used plastic and metal and paper and and all sorts of materials and this effect seems to it seems to be consistent across all of these probably based on the mass of the material used right that&#x27;s right okay um now i i wanted to ask about torsion as well and and that that did intrigue me um because you&#x27;d mentioned in the past this could be like an einstein carton torsion effect is that something you could elaborate on a bit uh well the topic of a torsion field torsion fields is very interesting to the physicists all over the world in russia we have the scientific school of academician akimov he was a theoretician and all his life he was working with torsion fields and created a very uh profound theory but when he was alive he could not get any demonstration and i was lucky to make this demonstration so now we can use all the uh theories for torsion fields and to show to the to the physicist all over the world that these are new kind of physical interactions they really exist they should be studied in detail and explained and so on and in the united states though of course there are progressive scientists who work in the same field first of all help put off he keeps an eye on all my experiments and helps sometimes with his advice and also paula violet who is an expert in the field of ether or super small particles that fill all the space around us so the task is to develop the mechanism of gravity how it works because at present uh the subject is not studied at all yeah yeah and and i i&#x27;d wondered if um because you&#x27;re talking about torsion and gravity and i wondered if that might be involved with the past measurements you&#x27;ve had of 64c which which again seems to be different than the the scientific accepted speed of gravity uh well uh my experiments uh with uh the force beam and impulse gravity generator the measuring of the speed of gravity are a bit different they are connected to high voltage discharges through the superconductor and we don&#x27;t have any rotating mechanisms there so it&#x27;s a separate experiment but [Music] i think that for the first time in the history of physics we managed to measure with very big precision the speed of the gravity impulse that goes from there from our generator in our opinion it is the same speed as the gravity is propagating so uh this is uh an experimental result all um points of view on the speed of gravity that were that was mentioned in scientific literature they are based on theoretical uh research and different calculations and each author has his own but from experimental point of view i think that our results are quite impressive yeah i i thought that it was very i thought that was very impressive to see the videos and i know that&#x27;s generating a lot of a lot of interest and then a lot of questions about how you&#x27;re you know about how you&#x27;re generating the effect so in addition to the the actual effect itself have you noticed any other anomalous effects um of any kind anything unexplained i guess that would be the that would be the question well of course there are uh different uh phenomena that [Music] we can observe during our experiments but uh frankly speaking our task is not to study and not to make a big scientific research our task is to build the installation or the device which can propagate in space which can uh bring us to other planets uh to the moon to mars to different stars and planets and therefore our main attention is present is concentrated not on the science and not on the research but on engineering tasks and we&#x27;re sure that the knowledge that we have at present is quite enough so that we could move from the stage of research to the stage of engineering and try to build the first flying vehicles which will help the humanity to conquer uh space yes yes well now this since you&#x27;ve come back to the the rotating disc work um this is in some ways this seems like an evolution of work that originally you had done and nasa attempted to recreate and as i understand things they they gave that to dr ning lee um have you heard anything from her lately is she still continuing her research uh frankly speaking i have no idea because these works belong at present to the department of defense and uh i have i have not heard from them okay okay they they haven&#x27;t heard from her either that was what i asked so it sounds like perhaps she&#x27;s she&#x27;s kind of given up um well i should ask what your plans are for future experiments uh well that&#x27;s a very good question uh taking into consideration that the interest to experimental gravity research is extremely big in every country as it opens new possibilities for transportation and energy production i think that me and my group all people who are working in this field should concentrate on the task of engineering and just stop the research that was going on and to try to go to practical implementation of the this current knowledge that we have so that we could begin our travel to space and boldly go you know the rest yeah yeah well it is intriguing um i mean that was all the questions i had but you know it isn&#x27;t it is intriguing and so it almost sounds like it&#x27;s come full circle you know you&#x27;ve started working with mechanical devices and you&#x27;ve come back to um it seems like you&#x27;re pushing towards a solid-state device where it&#x27;s just rotating the fields um i guess i guess the question is where where the model is for how to how to generate those fields do you have a good model to work from like in terms of how to set up field coils and rotate the fields that&#x27;s again a good question a bit strange one but i&#x27;ll give you a very direct answer there is uh a temple in india which is called a vimana temple it is not a usual temple it is practically a replica in stone of the installations that existed many thousand years ago and the main part of this temple uh these are let&#x27;s say toroidal solenoids or toroidal solenoids in stone which are of different size and a bit of different configuration but they are there in different parts of this temple [Music] so uh what uh people managed to do many thousand years ago this is an example for us how to make these things work so this can be used as a model and of course there is a lot of things to think about but with modern technology and with the efforts of the best scientists of the world i think it is possible yeah it is intriguing um i know there are a lot of uh there are a lot of different approaches one of those that i&#x27;ve heard about might be gabriel crone that that perhaps some of the work that he did um might show a way to to create these interactions and as i understand things and this may not be correct he would he was looking at an engineering perspective he was trying to eliminate inefficiencies in magnetic motors and and field coils but what i&#x27;ve heard is that perhaps those same inefficiencies could actually be what causes these effects uh that&#x27;s a pretty complicated field but uh i would also like to know to mention the works of marco rodin because what he made with his coils is also quite impressive and we can use his approach also in this field but as i mentioned we should use the approaches of different people and knowledge is never enough so combining all different approaches i think we can make something practical yeah yeah it is it is intriguing and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very interesting to see um you know i&#x27;m just thinking about so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like a thin film ion impregnated gold foil it sounds like and and then just over uh probably just a steel or aluminum armature or a disc yes but we can use these things mainly from my point of view mainly as a model so the future belongs of course to rotating magnetic fields so especially wounded solenoids this is the key to success yeah yeah so it sounds like if if i understand right the the the ion impregnation is that to give it kind of a net charge so that you&#x27;re actually rotating i i&#x27;ve read in the past that maybe actually moving electrons through space is what creates some of these effects and yes i can agree with this yes that&#x27;s right okay i i wasn&#x27;t sure well again that was everything i had for today but um do you have any do you have any anything else that you&#x27;d like to talk about uh no i think that&#x27;s quite enough thank you for your efforts and speaking about practical things if if and when you have a possibility to speak to the people who can rule this world for example elon musk well he uses the principle of chinese fireworks that were invented 3000 years ago and they were made for fun as all fireworks and he wants to go to mars i can help him to go to mars but not with the chinese fireworks but with a bit different technology so [Music] if you managed to get his interest that would be a great help</p>
