<p>Where are we? NARRATOR: But what is quantum physics? NARRATOR: But what is quantum physics? It arose as the solution to a problem. It arose as the solution</p>
<p>to a problem. Science during the 19th century had investigated smaller and smaller amounts of matter and energy. smaller and smaller amounts</p>
<p>of matter and energy. But by the first two decades of the 20th century, the existing line between the physics of particles and the physics of waves had grown murky, had grown murky, especially when trying to understand the fundamental nature of light.</p>
<p>the fundamental nature of light. KAISER: Sometimes it really is important to describe light as a wave, as an extended object that sort of waves in space as a wave, as an extended object</p>
<p>that sort of waves in space and travels over time, analogously to an ocean wave in the water. Other times, as people like Albert Einstein and others began to, to find, they really, really had to describe aspects of light as if</p>
<p>it was a collection of particles that traveled almost like miniature billiard balls. NARRATOR: Ultimately, the answer was a new kind of physics, NARRATOR:</p>
<p>Ultimately, the answer was a new kind of physics, quantum mechanics, which included an amalgam of ideas about both particles and waves. Its earliest formulation dates back roughly 100 years.</p>
<p>Its earliest formulation dates back roughly 100 years. This 1927 conference in Brussels is where the world&#x27;s leading physicists met to discuss the newly formed theory.</p>
<p>(people talking in background) NARRATOR: And there was a lot to discuss. Because quantum mechanics represented a radical departure Because quantum mechanics represented a radical departure from the previous paradigm</p>
<p>of physics-- what we call today &quot;classical physics.&quot; what we call today &quot;classical physics.&quot; CARROLL: In classical physics, handed down by Newton, we had determinism.</p>
<p>We had the clockwork universe. So if you throw a ball-- that&#x27;s a classical object-- with the same force, the same speed, the same angle, it&#x27;s always going to go to the same place, right? In principle,</p>
<p>if you knew exactly the state In principle, if you knew exactly the state of the whole world all at once, and you knew the laws of physics, you could exactly predict what everything was going to do arbitrarily far in the future and into the past.</p>
<p>arbitrarily far in the future and into the past. NARRATOR: In classical physics, even events that we think of as random aren&#x27;t, really.</p>
<p>even events that we think of as random aren&#x27;t, really. HAKEEM OLUSEYI: There are things that appear random in our everyday lives, like rolling dice.</p>
<p>It looks random, right? But actually, it&#x27;s a deterministic set of events which leads to whatever outcome the dice shows. If I told you exactly how I was going to roll the dice... OLUSEYI:</p>
<p>...you could predict, based on that initial throw, what the final outcome is going to be. It&#x27;s a very hard mathematical problem, but it&#x27;s not intractable.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanically, that&#x27;s not the case. NARRATOR: Quantum mechanics tossed out the certainty NARRATOR:</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics tossed out the certainty of the classical clockwork universe for one that only allowed for probabilistic predictions for one that only allowed for probabilistic predictions about potential observations.</p>
<p>about potential observations. Probability in quantum physics is different. Because even if we have the most complete description that the laws of physics will allow us to have, typically,</p>
<p>we&#x27;re unable to predict precisely what we&#x27;ll see when we observe a quantum system. CARROLL: Quantum mechanics says we can know everything there is to know CARROLL:</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics says we can know everything there is to know about the setup right now. And still, when we want to make a measurement of it in the future, the best we can do is say, &quot;There&#x27;s a 50% chance</p>
<p>of getting this outcome, 30% chance of that, 20% chance of that.&quot; In the quantum theory, probabilities are not a measure of what we don&#x27;t know. probabilities are not a measure of what we don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re just intrinsic to the quantum theory. We cannot get around them. That is impossible. NARRATOR:</p>
<p>Some physicists, raised on determinism, had trouble accepting this new probabilistic view. had trouble accepting this new probabilistic view.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein famously said that he didn&#x27;t believe Albert Einstein famously said that he didn&#x27;t believe God plays dice with the universe. God plays dice</p>
<p>with the universe. But there is another related, even stranger aspect But there is another related, even stranger aspect to quantum mechanics. to quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>In classical physics, external reality is independent of the observer. Looking at the moon doesn&#x27;t change the moon. Looking at the moon</p>
<p>doesn&#x27;t change the moon. And if you look away, the deterministic laws of physics continue to guide the moon on its path. continue to guide the moon</p>
<p>on its path. But in quantum mechanics, things are weirder. But in quantum mechanics, things are weirder.</p>
<p>CARROLL: The basic idea of quantum mechanics, the thing that we really struggle with to get our heads around, even as professional physicists, is that unlike any other version</p>
<p>of physics, quantum mechanics separates what happens in a system quantum mechanics separates what happens in a system when we&#x27;re not observing it from what we see when we measure it. NARRATOR:</p>
<p>A few rare exceptions aside, quantum mechanics says that we can&#x27;t know the position of a particle like an electron when we&#x27;re not observing it. when we&#x27;re not observing it. At best, it can only</p>
<p>be described mathematically as a wave, its exact position given in probabilities. its exact position given in probabilities. But at the moment</p>
<p>that the particle is observed, the probabilistic wave function collapses to one specific location. to one specific location. To the observer, who never sees this wave-like quality, it is like the particle</p>
<p>was a particle all along. it is like the particle was a particle all along. That opens up a whole world of questions, you know? What happens to the</p>
<p>observational outcomes that are not observed? What picks out which outcome is going to happen? This is still what we&#x27;re thinking about today. NARRATOR: During that mysterious period, when the particle is considered</p>
<p>neither here nor there, it is said to be in superposition-- it is said to be in superposition-- in a sense, a combination of all the possible outcomes. in a sense, a combination</p>
<p>of all the possible outcomes. But what does that really mean? Is the electron everywhere at the same time? Is it nowhere at all? Is it at one particular place and we just don&#x27;t know? All of those questions are actually outside of what quantum theory itself</p>
<p>actually can answer. It&#x27;s not part of the theory at all. So if you ask me, your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>(chuckles): Unfortunately, that&#x27;s the best I can do. (chuckles): Unfortunately, that&#x27;s the best I can do. ♪ ♪ NARRATOR:</p>

<p>synchronized on the beat. It&#x27;s also the synchronicity between the beats that&#x27;s important. That&#x27;s the real beauty in it, in finding that connection through, stretching out that second.</p>
<p>♪ ♪ NARRATOR: Tara Fortier is a tango professional and a physicist deeply involved and a physicist deeply involved in the science of time. So, we have a number of systems in this lab.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: She works here... These systems are used to characterize atomic clocks, and also compare atomic clocks. NARRATOR:</p>
<p>...at the Boulder, Colorado, laboratories of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, home to some of the atomic clocks that help set the official time for the country.</p>
<p>that help set the official time for the country. Over the centuries, we&#x27;ve tracked time a variety of ways: by the sun&#x27;s movement, the swing of pendulums, the oscillations of springs, and, in the 20th century, the vibrations of quartz crystals.</p>
<p>But since the 1960s, time has been officially determined using atomic clocks and the quantum characteristics of atoms. And the idea is that the laws of physics are unchanging, unlike something like</p>
<p>the rotation of the Earth. The rotation of the Earth itself can change because of plate tectonics, because the moon is moving away from the Earth. Its physics</p>
<p>is not truly fundamental. JUN YE: The reason why we love atomic clock, it&#x27;s a universally defined time. No matter who does</p>
<p>the experiment, no matter where you do the experiment, you know, in principle, once you&#x27;ve corrected for all the systematic effects, you should produce the same time no matter where. you should produce the same time</p>
<p>no matter where. NARRATOR: The consistency of atomic clocks arises from the very nature of atoms. from the very nature of atoms.</p>
<p>Atomic clocks depend crucially on the quantum physics of atoms. You have a nucleus, You have a nucleus, around which there are electrons in certain energy levels. And these energy levels are possible energy states that the electron can have inside the atom.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: Since an electron can only be at certain energy levels NARRATOR: Since an electron can only be at certain energy levels and not in between,</p>
<p>to get to a higher level, it needs to encounter a very specific helping hand, it needs to encounter a very specific helping hand, such as a particular photon. such as a particular photon. If it were to absorb</p>
<p>an incoming photon, it would have to be of just the right energy to jump from one level to a higher level. to jump from one level to a higher level.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: That special relationship between the electrons of a particular atom and a photon of a specific energy level is a unique signature for that atom.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s called a &quot;resonant frequency.&quot; It&#x27;s called a &quot;resonant frequency.&quot; JOHNSON: So this characteristic signature of this atom gives us a very specific</p>
<p>frequency standard that we can use to build a time-keeping device. that we can use to build a time-keeping device. NARRATOR:</p>
<p>Atomic clocks work in different ways, but they all use a specific type of atom or molecule as a reference to lock in the frequency of an electromagnetic wave, whose oscillations provide</p>
<p>the &quot;ticking&quot; of the clock. Today, a second is officially defined by counting the oscillations of the primary resonant frequency of a cesium-133 atom. of a cesium-133 atom.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s over nine billion oscillations per second. That&#x27;s over nine billion oscillations per second. And you interact</p>
<p>with that time reference more than you might think. For example, through the Global Positioning System: For example, through the Global Positioning System: GPS. ♪ ♪ GPS:</p>
<p>Turn left. FORTIER: I think that GPS is actually kind of crazy, when you think about it. How did we do anything</p>
<p>before GPS? NARRATOR: The U.S.-based GPS system uses over 30 dedicated orbiting satellites, each with multiple atomic clocks. When you use the GPS</p>
<p>on your cell phone, its receiver checks the signals from four or more satellites. The signal contains information about the satellite&#x27;s position and the time it sent the signal. about the satellite&#x27;s position and the time it sent the signal.</p>
<p>That time stamp is critical. Your phone uses it to calculate how long it took to receive the signal, and from that, knows the distance to the satellite.</p>
<p>With that information from multiple satellites, it is possible to triangulate the phone&#x27;s position within a few yards. But the whole system depends on knowing the time.</p>
<p>But the whole system depends on knowing the time. FORTIER: In the end, I find it amazing, how strongly we&#x27;re committed and tied to atomic clocks and how much we take it</p>
<p>for granted. Even though I build atomic clocks, but when I&#x27;m driving, being guided by this GPS service, you don&#x27;t really become aware of how much atomic clock technology has permeated everywhere in modern life.</p>
<p>everywhere in modern life. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Have you had a chance to look at more systematically varying the V-Z? NARRATOR: Jun Ye is a physicist with joint appointments: with NIST, the University of Colorado-</p>
<p>Boulder, and their joint institute, JILA. What if you locked exactly on top of each other and see whether that peak disappears completely? NARRATOR: He works on the new generation</p>
<p>of atomic clocks, NARRATOR: He works on the new generation of atomic clocks, known as optical atomic clocks. known as optical atomic clocks. While cesium clocks use microwaves, optical clocks use lasers, which run at higher frequencies.</p>
<p>That also means using a different atom. Instead of cesium, Jun&#x27;s work mostly uses strontium atoms, Instead of cesium, Jun&#x27;s work mostly uses strontium atoms, along with a laser</p>
<p>carefully tuned to one of strontium&#x27;s resonant frequencies. It puts one of the strontium electrons into superposition, It puts one of the strontium electrons into superposition, so it is both excited</p>
<p>and unexcited at the same time, so it is both excited and unexcited at the same time, creating what Jun calls a quantum pendulum. creating what Jun calls a quantum pendulum.</p>
<p>This pendulum is swinging at a speed of nearly one million billion cycles per second. It&#x27;s going back and forth, back and forth.</p>
<p>And this superposition creates this quantum pendulum. NARRATOR: And when it comes to accuracy, more swings or higher frequency equals more precision.</p>
<p>If you think of swings as marks on a ruler, the more marks you have, the more exactly you can measure. the more marks you have, the more exactly you can measure.</p>
<p>So, compared to a cesium clock, Jun&#x27;s strontium clock So, compared to a cesium clock, Jun&#x27;s strontium clock is around 100,000 times more precise. is around 100,000 times</p>
<p>more precise. And that much sensitivity makes all the more apparent some of the stranger aspects of time, including one first predicted by Einstein: including one first predicted</p>
<p>by Einstein: gravitational time dilation. In the movie &quot;Interstellar,&quot; part of the crew of a spaceship descends in a shuttle to a planet orbiting a supermassive black hole. orbiting</p>
<p>a supermassive black hole. When the shuttle returns, those on the mission feel they&#x27;ve only been gone for three hours, but not the crew member who remained in orbit. Hello, Rom.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve waited years. CASE: 23 years, four months, eight days. NARRATOR: The difference in time is another effect of the black hole&#x27;s warping</p>
<p>of the fabric of space-time. of the black hole&#x27;s warping of the fabric of space-time. The warping not only means gravity gets stronger closer to the black hole,</p>
<p>but time gets slower, too. closer to the black hole, but time gets slower, too. And you don&#x27;t need a black hole to be able to measure it.</p>
<p>And you don&#x27;t need a black hole to be able to measure it. Even on Earth, gravity varies, Even on Earth, gravity varies, and so does time, based on the distance from the planet&#x27;s center. So a person at the top</p>
<p>of the Empire State Building So a person at the top of the Empire State Building experiences weaker gravity and time going faster than a person at street level, where gravity is stronger. But all that happens imperceptibly. Our wristwatches</p>
<p>just aren&#x27;t accurate enough to show the difference. But Jun&#x27;s optical clocks are so accurate that even a small difference in elevation between two clocks that even a small difference in elevation between two clocks will reveal a discrepancy</p>
<p>in the passage of time. will reveal a discrepancy in the passage of time. When the clock changes elevation by a few hundred microns, basically size of a human hair, you will start to be able to see that time is actually running</p>
