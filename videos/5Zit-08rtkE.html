            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Good day and welcome back to Reality Check. I&#x27;m your host, Ross Kulart, and today it&#x27;s my honor to bring to Reality Check for the very first time the filmmaker who has probably done more than anyone else to elevate public awareness of the legitimacy of UFOs, UAPs, as an authentic mystery worthy of intense investigation. Filmmaker James Fox is an English-born American filmmaker whose first UFO documentary was made nearly 30 years ago. He&#x27;s done Out of the Blue, I know what I saw, The Phenomenon, Moment of Contact, and The Program. That&#x27;s his most recent one.</p>
<p>They are brilliant, credible, factually driven presentations that stand out because they dared to take the UAP subject seriously. Now, it&#x27;s James&#x27;s 2022 film, Moment of Contact, that brings him back here today. That film is James&#x27; investigation into the 1996 Virginia UAP incident, often called the Roswell of Brazil. Now, James has just finished updating that film with major new evidence. I&#x27;m very excited to bring this to you today.</p>
<p>He has explosive new details that we are going to tell you about today for the very first time. I caught up with James at Contact in the Desert way back in May and he whispered in my ear over a coffee about what he had in this film update and boy I&#x27;ve been waiting for months. He he called me literally yesterday and said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got it. I&#x27;m ready to go.&quot; And I&#x27;m so excited that he&#x27;s asked us to help lead art this film because it&#x27;s very exciting what he&#x27;s got. James has obtained an exclusive interview with a neurosurgeon who says he quite literally touched and telepathically communicated with what he testifies on the record to James was a live alien being held in captivity by Brazilians and then apparently handed over to the US military.</p>
<p>James, I&#x27;m very excited to bring you here to Reality Check. Welcome, sir. Maybe we could start off by giving us a bit of a summary of what the Virginia case was all about. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me on, Ross. I I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t know if that was deserved intro, but I appreciate it very much. So, so thank you. Um, well, let&#x27;s see how far back I can go here. Um, I was making my second UFO film in the late 90s out of the blue with a partner. It was probably circa 1999.</p>
<p>And uh, remind your audience, I was making my second documentary on UFOs. And we were mapping out the film and we were going to cover Bentwaters and the Phoenix Lights and and a various other cases around the world. and and my partner at the time who was a former BBC correspondent, Tim Coleman, he said, &quot;Oh, mate, we got to we got to get this, you know, Brazilian case, you know, it was absolutely unbelievable. These aliens walking around in the live, you know, and I thought, h I picked the wrong partner for this film. This guy&#x27;s out of his mind.</p>
<p>Like there&#x27;s no way that happened.&quot; So, I just want like everyone to understand like that&#x27;s how I was introduced to this case. Fast forward over 10 years. I am God, more than 10 years. Yeah, probably. In any case, I&#x27;m invited to Brazil on a separate account.</p>
<p>I just finished a film called uh I Know What I Saw, which is a 2-hour special for the History Channel. And um I get invited to give a presentation in Brazil in a place called Perui, which is sort of the south of Sao Paulo. And Stanton Freeman is there. I love Stanton Freeman and I respect him tremendously. He&#x27;s the guy that, you know, thanks to him and a handful of others, we know about Roswell.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m there with Stanton and and I&#x27;ll back up a second. Right before I left, there was a very good friend of mine who was very high up in the entertainment industry, Jeff Saganski. I&#x27;ll use his name. He&#x27;s fine with that. And he said, &quot;Oh, James, you&#x27;re you&#x27;re going to uh you&#x27;re going to Brazil.</p>
<p>You have to look into that Varia case.&quot; And I was, &quot;Oh, God, not this, please.&quot; But I had a lot of respect for him. And I said, &quot;Jeff, yeah, sure. I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll look into that for you.&quot; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll definitely do that. Click. And I said to myself, I&#x27;m not wasting one second on this case. So, I fly to Brazil and I&#x27;m there at this conference with Stanton Freriedman and the topic came up. I think there was like a witness there or something.</p>
<p>And Stanton looked at me and he said, &quot;Oh, James, yeah, you don&#x27;t know about the Virginia case.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, I know about it, but live aliens walking around in town like please.&quot; He goes, &quot;Not so fast. you know, there&#x27;s a lot of very compelling firsthand testimony. So, that was the impetus for me to say, &quot;Okay, let me have a look. Let me let me poke around a little bit.&quot; And so, the more I looked, the more I found, and here we are 16 years later. And uh we&#x27;ve got the most compelling, in my humble opinion, firsthand eyewitness testimony the world&#x27;s ever seen.</p>
<p>And if you if Yeah, sorry. Go ahead. No, I was going to say, so to kick off the events, would it be fair to say that probably the defining event that kicked this all off is the testimony of a pilot, Carlos Duza, 13th of January, 1996, and he spots a cigar- shaped object about the size of a school bus emitting smoke, losing altitude over Virginia, and he follows it to a field. What happens, James? &gt;&gt; So, he was very early in the morning. He was an ultralight pilot.</p>
<p>He was a history professor in Sa Paulo. Uh Carlos Dosoza and he sees what this strange looking perhaps it was a prototype. He didn&#x27;t know it was a cigar- shaped aluminum, you know, colored very early in the morning and it was clearly in distress. It had a big gash on the side. It had a vapor type smoke coming out the back.</p>
<p>Not typical smoke. It was like more like a vapor. And he thought, &quot;My gosh, that looks like it&#x27;s going down.&quot; And um he was right near what&#x27;s called the Mayolini farm which is roughly 10 12 miles outside as the crow flies from Vargia. And um he drives off this freeway and he follows this dirt road up to what he describes as an impact site. He said he saw this thing struggling to stay in the air.</p>
<p>It impacts the ground. Half of it stays somewhat intact and there&#x27;s rest of debris over a very large area larger than a football field. And does he see the craft crashed on the ground? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he sees it go down into the ground and then he lost sight of it, but he saw it go down and crash. Yes. &gt;&gt; And when he when he gets to that location, what happens? Can he get onto the site? &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>So, he arrives he arrives at the site with his car. He gets out of the car and he sees this. He said the smell was just so horrendous that he grabbed his t-shirt and he put it up over his mouth. It was like sulfur, like uh ammonia. eyes watering, &gt;&gt; very very strong.</p>
<p>He said it was so strong he could barely like tolerate it. &gt;&gt; And then he saw these lots of like little bits of aluminum. There was one piece of the craft that was intact that was about half of it, about half the size of a large school bus. And and lots of bits of debris of various sizes. And he said he picked one of the pieces up and he said it was as light as a feather.</p>
<p>You you couldn&#x27;t really feel it in your hands. And he crumpled it up. And when he opened his hands, it took the shape back up again. &gt;&gt; Just like Roswell. &gt;&gt; Just like Roswell.</p>
<p>And so he was just but he wasn&#x27;t thinking alien. He he really didn&#x27;t know what he was looking at. And then the military trucks rolled in from the military base as a from the exact opposite direction that he arrived. &gt;&gt; So he&#x27;s absolutely categorical that the Brazilian military intervened, took over a site where what appears to have been an alien spacecraft has crashed. Does he does he see a body? Does he see any live beings? &gt;&gt; Nope.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t see any body. I did ask him. I said, &quot;Was the remaining part of the craft large enough for beans?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes, but I didn&#x27;t see any beans.&quot; &gt;&gt; And do the military take the piece of metal that he picked up off him? Do they allow him to &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. They they came and gun I mean they were telling him to leave to leave to leave to leave and then he was like, &quot;I&#x27;m just, you know, try to help.&quot; And they took out their rifles and they threatened him. That&#x27;s at that point he didn&#x27;t he didn&#x27;t have the peace anymore.</p>
<p>He got back in his car and left. &gt;&gt; Were there any American soldiers with the Brazilian military in that intervention? &gt;&gt; Not that he said no. &gt;&gt; So you&#x27;ve got an obvious crash. I I guess in the sequence of events, the next event that that has always intrigued me, by the way, I I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve got to show my personal interest in the Virginia case, James, and this is your fault. [laughter] I I I I I&#x27;ve got a little uh a little alien being from Virginia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. &gt;&gt; That a guy that a guy from the United Kingdom who makes models. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh, you&#x27;ve got one as well, I suspect. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Okay. I I wasn&#x27;t going to share this, but I [laughter] one too.</p>
<p>[gasps] &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We have somebody coming. No, I&#x27;ve had this in front of my audience now for months and nobody&#x27;s picked up on it. So, I thought it was time to reveal to the audience that I have an alien being in my set. So, [laughter] &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s really funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s really great. But, let me &gt;&gt; can I can I just I&#x27;m just interested in the sequence because I&#x27;ve always been struck. You&#x27;ve got that crash about 10 miles out of town and then as I understand it on the morning of January the 20th, there&#x27;s a couple who report seeing a damaged craft which presumably is another different craft flying low over the city of Virginia. &gt;&gt; No. No.</p>
<p>Okay. So that&#x27;s we made that much clear in this cut of the film and we also have uh footage that we&#x27;ve put together of of of such a craft. I know this is hard to to to grasp and to wrap your mind around, but if the claims are true and the witnesses are to be believed, what we were seeing with the craft over Varia was a was a rescue operation &gt;&gt; by humans. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because they all said, and I had a hard time believing, but I interviewed a lot of people and they said it was looking for something.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;How do you know it was looking for something?&quot; because it was doing a grid search slow and low and methodical going over stopping back and forth for for like a long time. &gt;&gt; So it wasn&#x27;t a damaged craft at all. It was a craft that was that was looking for its comrades. &gt;&gt; No, there were So there were now we have new witnesses on the on the cigar- shaped craft. We have the two farmers, Enrico um I&#x27;ll think of her last name in a second.</p>
<p>They both saw the same thing that Carlos described, a cigar- shaped craft with vapor coming out the back early in the morning, maybe two o&#x27;clock in the morning, something like this. We actually got a map and we figured out, okay, we have a sighting. We have we have Vargia here. We have the farmers that see the craft here. We have another witness that sees the craft over here and it crashes and it ultimately crashes right in the middle.</p>
<p>It actually makes a lot more sense now that we have that. So, we have new witnesses where he was in his farm. We we shot there and he said he heard something very strange in the sky and he looked out the window and he saw this big cigar- shaped craft making a weird noise like it was in trouble and it landed on his farm and that was so we have that testimony now as well. &gt;&gt; Right. And so that&#x27;s a completely different craft cuz that&#x27;s the thing I could never understand.</p>
<p>How could the craft have crashed in on the 13th of January and then a week later people are saying they&#x27;ve seen the craft again? &gt;&gt; We don&#x27;t know. No. So yeah, the craft that that people have described was a discshaped craft that we&#x27;re doing as a grid search operation. Everybody talks about that. The the monument over Brazil, sorry, over Virginia up at is a big discshaped craft.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the craft that people saw that was methodically looking. And I specifically asked all these witnesses, how do you know it was looking for something? They said it was low and it was going out, coming back, stopping, going out, coming back, stopping. It was clearly looking for something. And we really make that distinction this time in the craft because it&#x27;s like, wow, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s crazy, you know. &gt;&gt; Do you have any intelligence, James, on how the the the craft that did crash, the cigar- shaped craft on the 30th of January, 1996? Is there any evidence to suggest that it was attacked by us humans? as we now know is the case that the US apparently has been using high pulse microwave weapons and indeed in some cases artillery to try and bring down these craft.</p>
<p>I I&#x27;ve thought about this for a long time, a long time, well over a decade. And I&#x27;m thinking to myself, all these witnesses described this craft as having this gash in the back struggling to remain in the air and and smoke. So it collided something collided with it. Okay. Was it a meteor? Was it uh an asteroid or I don&#x27;t know something? I mean, it collided with something.</p>
<p>Something hit it. So, your guess is as good as mine. I know that there have been orders over the decades of shoot first, ask questions later. Would it surprise me? It It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me, but I don&#x27;t know because I don&#x27;t I you know, the case goes somewhat cold once gets on the American side. But the Americans apparently, according to the Brazilians, knew it was coming.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&#x27;ll get to that. I&#x27;ll get to that. So, in terms of our chronology, I&#x27;m trying to keep you to a good chronology. On the afternoon of January the 20th, 1996, around 100 p.m., three young women, sisters, Lillian, 14 years old, Valkaria, &gt;&gt; Valkyia, &gt;&gt; Valkyia, who&#x27;s 16, &gt;&gt; and Katya who&#x27;s 22. &gt;&gt; They encounter something.</p>
<p>What do they see? So I my understanding it was about 3:00 in the afternoon and uh it was a very hot day because January is summer and uh they were uh taking a shortcut through like a little it was a it was an area of Venia that was being developed. There were some construction sites and there was a cinder block wall and a little gate and they could go through this field and kind of cut across as a little shortcut and all three of them were walking together and um one of them said they saw like uh like some graffiti on the cinder block wall which caught their attention and they&#x27;re looking at this graffiti and then they see what looks like maybe a statue or something slouched up against the cinder block wall. They&#x27;re looking at it. They&#x27;re getting closer and closer. Got within 10, 12 feet of it, again in broad daylight, all three of them.</p>
<p>And this little creature that looked like it was feeble and suffering went from a crouch position, staring ahead to turning and looking them right in the eyes. And that sent one of the girls, I think it was uh uh Valkyia and her sister uh Lilani running freaked out like scream. She said she screamed and ran and left Katya. So Katya is locked eyes on this creature and she&#x27;s having telepathic communication with it. And Lilani and her Liliani who I think was was uh 16 and and uh Vyuria was probably 14.</p>
<p>Lilani realizes Katya is still back there. I got to go back. And they didn&#x27;t know what that she didn&#x27;t know what it was. She left her sister and went ran back to get Katya. She was just locked eyes on this thing.</p>
<p>And it was basically telling I need help. It was feeble. It was scared. It needed help. And um she grabbed Katya by the hand and yanked her out of there.</p>
<p>Um and and and off they went and that exploded in the headlines. &gt;&gt; Now that&#x27;s a correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here. It&#x27;s four to five feet tall. It&#x27;s a hairless creature with oily brown skin. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And and crucially it it had three head bumps which &gt;&gt; Yeah. It had like little little lumps. Three of them. Yes. &gt;&gt; So that that&#x27;s pretty much what &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s pretty much what they saw.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s squatting like that, looking directly at that young girl. &gt;&gt; Now, you&#x27;ve interviewed you&#x27;ve interviewed the young girls, haven&#x27;t you? &gt;&gt; Mult multiple times. Multiple times. &gt;&gt; And they&#x27;re adamant that this is what they saw. &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>No. Absolutely. No question. They worked with a woman named Betto Rodriguez who who is a uh artist and and and they got together with her and they created that inf now infamous poster of of the drawing of of the creature. and they said it was is exactly what it looks like.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Cuz I I noticed that in the official debunk of the whole Vaginia case, there&#x27;s a a claim made by the military in the Brazilian government that it was likely a a homeless man named Madinho who was who was known for crouching in the area due to a mental disability. &gt;&gt; What What do you say to that assertion? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve seen him. He&#x27;s he&#x27;s a known character in the town. you. He&#x27;s still there.</p>
<p>Like I just saw him just a month ago and everybody knows who he is. Like he was like, you know, he was a pillar. Everybody knows Medino. It&#x27;s like it was just so laughable. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>It was It&#x27;s absolute. Yeah. So, with with some certainty, you&#x27;ve got triple corroboration there from the three young girls, now women, and they&#x27;re adamant that what they saw was clearly some kind of alien being, not a local homeless man. &gt;&gt; 1,000%. 1,000%.</p>
<p>I mean, they just they just cringe when you know, you hear that. And the the girls are saying like they don&#x27;t know exactly what they saw, but they said it wasn&#x27;t a human and it wasn&#x27;t an animal and it had telepathic communication through the eyes. It was it was not something of this earth. It&#x27;s like, you know. Yeah.</p>
<p>The thing I find fascinating, James, is a [clears throat] lot of folk mythology talks about the devil. And isn&#x27;t it interesting that they describe an oagynous figure that that essentially could pass for devilike from our &gt;&gt; uh mythology. And and it it&#x27;s interesting because the story gets thicker, more intense. Later that day, there&#x27;s a police officer, Marco Elie Chariz, &gt;&gt; a young police officer. He he actually reportedly captures a similar creature &gt;&gt; just a couple blocks away.</p>
<p>Couple blocks away. A couple hours later, just a couple blocks away. &gt;&gt; Is it the same creature? &gt;&gt; It one would only assume that it had to be. It was like two blocks away. Two couple hours later.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What does he do with it? &gt;&gt; So So So it&#x27;s interesting because Marco Shrezy was military officer and Eric Lopes, also another military officer. They&#x27;re both friends. Marco apparently was off for the night and they get this sort of he gets an APB that hey there&#x27;s something out something really unusual out lingering to go capture whatever this thing is. They didn&#x27;t say it was an ET or something very unusual. So those were the orders given to to Eric Lopes.</p>
<p>Eric calls up his buddy who is off the night. He says, &quot;Hey, you want to join me? I&#x27;ve got this crazy mission of looking, you know.&quot; So Mark Marco Shre jumps in the car with him and off they go. And uh they actually see this creature two blocks from where the girls encountered it just a couple hours later running across the road. So Marco Shares without a moment&#x27;s hesitation just jumps out of the car and goes and grabs it. And in the process of grabbing it and it didn&#x27;t put up much of a fight.</p>
<p>It was pretty feeble and he put it in the back of the car and he got a little scratch under his arm and he had some weird oil on his skin. They go to one little tiny hospital. It was more like a clinic and the doctor apparently came out and took one look at and said, &quot;Uh uh, I don&#x27;t know what that is, but you&#x27;re not bringing it here.&quot; So then they go off to regional hospital and they drop it off at Regional Hospital. So yeah, sorry. &gt;&gt; No, that&#x27;s good.</p>
<p>So you set this up perfectly now. Is is this where Dr. Italo Ventureli comes across to being? &gt;&gt; Exactly. Yes. Yep.</p>
<p>So we had up until this point we had testimony from a military officer who we found that he took a creature from Humanitas Hospital because it went from the first little clinic didn&#x27;t get out of the car then it went to regional got out of the car was delivered taken indoor in fact I was just at regional hospital like two weeks ago and I went to the front desk the the main entry point and I said hey you know this incident and they got a big plaque out front. This is where an ET came. It&#x27;s all right out in the open. Nobody&#x27;s hiding the story. And I asked the the people at the desks coming into the to the ER.</p>
<p>Hey, have you guys heard? Oh, yeah. One of the people that was there that night still working here now. &gt;&gt; And they said the creature. No, I&#x27;m not kidding you. I swear to you.</p>
<p>And they said they got a big plaque outside. I can I can share you a picture of it talking about the events, but they took the ET in the back entrance. They said they did not come in the front. They took it in the back. &gt;&gt; Did the person you spoke to, aside from Dr.</p>
<p>Alo, did they also see the alien being? &gt;&gt; Good question. We were we we only had 24 more hours for flying home. We we got the details. We got the the contact information of that individual that was there that night. Don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t have a chance to talk to them. I don&#x27;t know if they &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what I love about this, James, is you you&#x27;ve been coming and going from this v this city now for years and each time you go back, you get more layers of factual information that corroborate what you originally uncovered. You got to hear like so now so now we have for the first time ever because we have this military police officer who we got to come forward and he drove a creature from Humanitas to Eza military base and then Eza Campinas and that&#x27;s when the Americans came in right so um now for the first time ever we have firthand eyewitness testimony from the lead neurosurgeon still at the hospital who describes face-to-face contact with the live alien for 4 minutes. It&#x27;s incredible. &gt;&gt; At this point, James, with your permission, we&#x27;re going to roll the the little sizzle grab you&#x27;ve given us from Dr.</p>
<p>Italo Venturelli. Here&#x27;s Dr. Italo. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! for speech. What I love James about Dr.</p>
<p>Italo is he&#x27;s very open about the fact that this being touched him. He seems quite emotional about the experience. So, okay, I&#x27;ll tell you how this came about because it&#x27;s extraordinary what happened. We knew we knew that the live alien was at regional hospital. We have people that we are in touch with over more than a decade that work at both hospitals that we meet privately with.</p>
<p>Every time we go to Virginia, it&#x27;s always quiet, off the record. They come and there are certain secrets they talk about during surgery and only during surgery. So we knew and from other testimony that that creature was it so the other neurosurgeon who was on duty that night was his sort of protege. It was Dr. Italo and Dr.</p>
<p>Marcos Vinesis. Dr. Marco Vinesis did a little procedure on the creature. Apparently it was had some damage, some swelling, something happened. did a little procedure on the creature and uh I don&#x27;t want to go into too much detail because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an ongoing thing.</p>
<p>Uh and then he had a heart attack and died in 2018. Okay. So now he&#x27;s So now he&#x27;s gone and his partner who&#x27;s the lead neurosurgeon, Dr. Italo himself had a heart attack just a few months ago and he&#x27;s in the ICU staring at the ceiling thinking that he was going to die. and he thought, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m taking this to the grave.</p>
<p>I this is not right. If I survive this, I&#x27;m going public.&quot; And then &gt;&gt; Yep. And and so he said, &quot;I&#x27;m doing this for my grandchildren and I don&#x27;t care what the consequences are. I don&#x27;t care.&quot; &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what he said. &gt;&gt; Such a raw act of courage.</p>
<p>Those are the kind of whistleblowers we need, James. And full credit to you. &gt;&gt; Full credit to you for persuading him to speak to you about it. I I just take my hat off to witnesses like Dr. Italo Venturelli for having the courage to come forward.</p>
<p>Was he threatened not to speak? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. So, so what happened was and and I want to send a shout out to Alini Crass who&#x27;s our lead translator and one of our co-producers. She has a very disarming presence and she calmed him and he snuck us into the back of the hospital. Snuck us in and we&#x27;re going, &quot;What? What&#x27;s happening? What&#x27;s going on?&quot; kind of sneaks us into the ICU exactly where it happened. We we get masked up because you can&#x27;t be in the ICU without it.</p>
<p>So, we get all of our masks on. I don&#x27;t know where this is going. And all of a sudden, he just starts telling all and uh and it was extraordinary. And then the the the the hospital staff caught us filming and what are you doing in here? You&#x27;re not supposed to be fil. Nobody has any permits.</p>
<p>Nobody, you know. So, they kick so they kick us out, but we&#x27;ve gotten the we gotten the goods. And he&#x27;s like, I think I just lost my job. And so, they kick us all out. So, we leave the hospital and we go into a c.</p>
<p>We didn&#x27;t know where we&#x27;re going. We just went into a cafe next door and we&#x27;re filming at this cafe. We&#x27;re all like magically crying. And I asked him how it felt after 29 years to come forward. What it was like, what it was like to look into the eyes of this creature.</p>
<p>Tell me what it was like. I WAS DYING to know. And he said it was a higher level of intelligence. So much higher, more advanced. Even though that it was in captivity, it had control of the room way.</p>
<p>He said an intelligence way beyond it was like an angel. But he describes his skin as more white with the big red eyes and the little horns exactly the way the girls described. And I just thought to myself, was that sort of a defense measure? Did their skin react to the hot sun? &gt;&gt; Do they when they&#x27;re when they&#x27;re scared and freed? I don&#x27;t know. I I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; So is this particular being damaged? Are they injured? The &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>every being that I might and here&#x27;s an interesting thing is is that I remember when I was first going to include a whole scene from varia in the phenomenon right so I was covering like Rua and Sakuro and uh and a number of other cases in the United States and I was covering Varia and Dr. uh Roger Lear was adamant it was like 2012 maybe 2013 and Dr. Roger Leer was just adamant about getting on camera. But at the time I had just flown, we rented this h this this filming space in Los Angeles and we had all these witnesses coming in from different corners of the world about the Africa case Rua Zimbabwe for the 20th anniversary. Bringing those guys together and I was hyperfocused on that.</p>
<p>I was dealing with Kenneth, Kenneth Arnold&#x27;s daughter, Kim Arnold, getting her to go on camera for the first time, revealing all these incredible things about his experience. And then Roger and I was back burner varia for the time because I had my hands full. Like was working 17our days. And Roger Lear kind of got upset and he says, &quot;Well, if you&#x27;re not going to, you know, if you&#x27;re not going to film me, at least take my tapes.&quot; And so he gave me his tapes and then I digitized them and I don&#x27;t know what the exact time span was, but I gave them back to him and then he died. So fast forward when I was producing the when I was because I ended up deleting all of the scenes from Vargia.</p>
<p>I mean it was a very painful day out of the phenomenon because I just couldn&#x27;t squeeze it in. It was too much too complicated. Too complicated. We were still missing critical testimony. We couldn&#x27;t find Sa like a number of other people.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Okay, I&#x27;m going to make a movie on this case alone. The heck with the rest of it.&quot; And I deleted the whole thing out of there. So fast forward all these years later and I thought, &quot;Oh my gosh, I&#x27;ve got the Roger Lear tapes.&quot; So, I went and found them and then I bought his book and I&#x27;m reading the book and I have this incredible encounter and the tapes were basically a transcript of the the book was a transcript of the tapes because I had the tapes. However, there was one scene where he&#x27;s in Humanitas Hospital talking to doctors that worked on another allegedly worked on another alien and he gave this incredible description of the of his interview with these two doctors and that was at Humanitas Hospital. But he talks about communication with this with this creature like high level communication.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s phenomenal. So we&#x27;re talking here is this alien that you&#x27;re talking about that was at Humanitaras Hospital. Is that a completely separate being from the one that Dr. Italo is saying that he was trying to treat? &gt;&gt; I I I believe so, but I don&#x27;t know for sure. But I believe so.</p>
<p>But the implications are if this is all true and correct that there are at least two bodies of alien beings so-called biologics in the possession now of what we&#x27;ll learn to be the US military or intelligence community. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, I just we also just interviewed the former chief of police uh mean of u the the area all around as a military base and we&#x27;ve been trying to get him for years and we would just show up at his house. We just kept doing it year after year after year and we finally got him a couple months ago and he says &gt;&gt; I see the guy where you turned up and he was at a window on a a house that was elevated above you guys looking up at it and and you were really worried you were going to get shot because he had a gun. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, he said I will shoot you. That guy, that&#x27;s a different guy. I was P2 military police. But Pedro was the former chief of police and it&#x27;s like we finally showed up at his house and we were going over there maybe it was like six o&#x27;clock and I we were all in a kind of a hurry. We&#x27;re trying to get continue north to get up to Venia.</p>
<p>We had a lot of filming to do and I said, &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s stop and get some pizza, you know, and it was like, well, we got a job to do.&quot; And I just I wanted to stop and get some pizza. We met this great restaurant owner, pizza, and we had pizza and we had a little wine. We had a great dinner, but it really like cost us a good 90 minutes. And so we were showing up at the former chief of police, Pedro Auar, uh a little later than we wanted to. As it turns out, it was perfect because when we arrived, he had just gotten home 10 or 15 minutes earlier.</p>
<p>So it was absolutely divine. Like it was perfect. And we eventually got our way into his house and then it&#x27;s like, &quot;Hey, you mind if we take a couple pictures?&quot; you know, they got the camera in there and then we got the audio going and then he g he&#x27;s like, &quot;You know what?&quot; And he gave us an interview and he said that he heard that there were three. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what he heard.</p>
<p>Yeah. And he was he describes he saw one of them under a tarp that was probably deceased. Um he was at the military base, Eza. He describes all the helicopters and all the activity. He said he saw more brass that day at Eza Military Base than he&#x27;s ever seen in his life.</p>
<p>More brass. He talked about the brass and so we got him to go &gt;&gt; senior officers basically. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And uh so we got the former chief of police now for the first time and and the military officer Marco Sharice who died a couple weeks after allegedly handling this creature.</p>
<p>He dies. Well, the people that did the autopsy is IP I think it&#x27;s IPD. Two forensic pathologists Dr. Janini and Dr. Armando both went on the record for the first time for us on camera just recently and said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never I did the autopsy.</p>
<p>The guy that did the tissue samples, Dr. Janini, who founded the company, he said, I&#x27;ve never seen bacteria behave in the way that bacteria behaved. It&#x27;s never before and never since.&quot; So, just to remind our audience, this is the policeman, the military policeman who got a scratch under his arm when he was retrieving the body of or the alien, the live alien and taking it to the hospital that night in the original 20th of um January incident. And he&#x27;d got that scratch. It had become infected and developed an abscess.</p>
<p>And so, the pathologists couldn&#x27;t help him at all. They couldn&#x27;t treat him. &gt;&gt; Well, so he was treated in a number and I talked to another doctor who also treated him just recently. He didn&#x27;t go on camera, but we met with him privately and he said we threw the kitchen sink at him and there&#x27;s nothing we could do. That bacteria was just the most resilient bacteria they&#x27;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Nothing reacted to it and it killed them. Now, James, I just want at this point because our audience may be sort of reeling from the number of people that you&#x27;ve cited here. There are multiple corroborative witnesses. People who saw craft, people who saw beings, doctors, military police. How many of these people do you think would be willing to testify publicly to an inquiry under oath? [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; All of them.</p>
<p>And I I I&#x27;m uh okay. So I I can&#x27;t go into detail right now, but let&#x27;s just say that that uh I&#x27;m working with uh certain individuals in the government to make that happen. I&#x27;m very excited to hear because I mean I mean the thing that blows me away about what you&#x27;re revealing here and there&#x27;s much much more to come is you&#x27;ve done layered quality investigative journalism. This is not something that&#x27;s easily debunked. You have corroborative multiple corroborative witnesses supporting a consistent claim.</p>
<p>I have a neuro the head neurosurgeon of that runs the entire department at regional hospital today willing to take a public lie detector test and testify that everything he&#x27;s saying is true and then there are other doctors that we&#x27;re talking to now like we&#x27;re in &gt;&gt; Did he lose his job because you did the interview or was it okay? It it it was tumultuous, but he was so in demand that it they couldn&#x27;t like he&#x27;s the lead guy, so they they couldn&#x27;t shoot themselves in the foot. So, it&#x27;s been rough, a bit of a rough ride with him. But he said to me, he goes, &quot;James, I I don&#x27;t care the consequences. The world needs to know this happened. This being that I encountered communicated with me telepathically.</p>
<p>It was a highly advanced intelligence, way more than anything he&#x27;s ever seen here on Earth. He called it almost like an angel. And it was despite the fact that it was in it sends chills like despite the fact that it was in captivity, it had control of the room. Now, one more thing I think you were asking me about. So, he said it was because I asked him, &quot;How long did you spend? Did you show the trailer of the film yet?&quot; &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re going to show the trailer at the very end.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to tease the trailer at the very end. &gt;&gt; So, I asked him like, &quot;How long did you spend with this creature?&quot; You know, I&#x27;m I always want to like I want to experience the witnesses. I want so badly to be there in the room with them and know every detail. So, just like put me in that room with the what did it feel like, you know? And and I get all those little just details. I want to hear it all.</p>
<p>And um he said after about four minutes, he stepped out to do something and the military burst in took the burst in. I think exactly what he said. burst in and took the bean and threatened everyone with secrecy and then left. &gt;&gt; So the bean&#x27;s still alive at that point? &gt;&gt; Yes, the bean was alive and the military grabbed it and left. &gt;&gt; And this is the Brazilian military.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no US officers with that Brazilian military team. &gt;&gt; There are others claiming, excuse me, that they were in contact with Americans, but that was later, &gt;&gt; a little bit later. &gt;&gt; And do we know where the being was taken from the hospital where Dr. Italo had attempted to treat it. &gt;&gt; We we we unfortunately I I know that the beans ended up at me at at Eza and definitely Campinus, but I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>And then of course we have the flight control officer who said that the USAF, which is the United States Air Force flight, came in and it didn&#x27;t have authorization from the Brazilian government to land. And a higher level government official, Brazilian, walked in and said, &quot;Let the plane land.&quot; So, we put out a foyer request for all air flights in America that came into Brazil from the 14th, I think it was the 13th to the 27th or something like this. And it took three years for our team to get that response. And it would came back from the CIA. And it&#x27;s like basically it&#x27;s a national security issue.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s classified. And you&#x27;re your your your request is denied. &gt;&gt; So, let me get this very clear, James. Normally aircraft movements like that would be the subject of very little controversy and they would be released. &gt;&gt; One would imagine but what do I know? All I know is I asked and I was told it was like national it&#x27;s in the film.</p>
<p>You you&#x27;ll see it. &gt;&gt; So So you know from a military source, an air traffic controller that a plane a US Air Force plane came into the ESA military base &gt;&gt; very very close to Vina. Uh they came to Campenis. &gt;&gt; Campenis. Where whereabouts is that relevant relative to Virginia? &gt;&gt; I would I show it on the map in there.</p>
<p>I I have to say it&#x27;s to the south maybe two hours, three hours south. &gt;&gt; But we know Virginia. &gt;&gt; Your witness told you that US military helicopters were part of that deployment. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Multiple military witnesses. Multiple people.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. And even the chief of police described those helicopters just recently. &gt;&gt; Can I ask you this? This is what I never understand is I I appreciate that the Brazilian government at the time and probably now is very close to the US military and the intelligence community. And for a large period of time, the CIA practically ran a lot of governments in South America and Central America.</p>
<p>But why on earth would the Brazilian government have allowed an American retrieval team to fly in and take away what is probably the first definitive evidence of a non-human intelligence? &gt;&gt; You know, I asked that very question to uh I don&#x27;t know if I should use his name. It&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a name that you&#x27;re familiar with and he said because they can. &gt;&gt; Really? Yeah. That&#x27;s what he said. Yeah, we can do whatever we want &gt;&gt; because the implications of this are that the Brazilian military and presumably other militaries around the world are colluding with the US military and covering this up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean, &gt;&gt; I was shocked. I was shocked when I found out America was involved. I HAD NO IDEA WHEN I STARTED THIS INVESTIGATION. NONE. &gt;&gt; I was Oh my god.</p>
<p>And not only that, &gt;&gt; they were there intimidating witnesses. &gt;&gt; I have people on camera talking about it. Yes. So the US the US was going around intimidating witnesses. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>You remember I there was a whole family of witness I all Yeah. A whole family of witnesses and you know they saw the what if to take their account at face value. Right. They lived right near where the girls saw the creature and where the capture occurred. There was a discshaped object quietly and silently and methodically maneuvering through the neighborhood low.</p>
<p>And they watched it. He goes, &quot;I watched it for 30 minutes.&quot; The whole family did and they all talk about it. And so, and then they said the Americans came and they, you know, they it&#x27;s Americans with some Brazilians and he said maybe NAZA. He wasn&#x27;t sure if it was NAZA. They didn&#x27;t know, but he said maybe Naza and they were told don&#x27;t, you know, this conversation never happened.</p>
<p>We were never here. There were other the mother of the of the two girls got the visit. That was like one of the first times, you know, from men in suits and uh she&#x27;s like, I don&#x27;t know if definitively that it was two the Americans, but they looked like Americans and then one that had a strong accent that spoke Portuguese. &gt;&gt; Didn&#x27;t they offer her money? &gt;&gt; Offered her money to tell the girls to go public on TV that they were lying and they saw it was a dog or something other. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And the mother refused. &gt;&gt; Did the girls ever retract the story? &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Wow. And has the family suffered any retribution from anyone as a result of speaking out? &gt;&gt; They said that they&#x27;ve been mocked and laughed at yes for for decades.</p>
<p>Nothing to gain, everything to lose. This is not a career enhancing, you know, thing, especially back then. &gt;&gt; So you&#x27;ve actually got US officials, possibly not military, maybe intelligence, gaslighting and intimidating, bullying, threatening people to try and stop them from talking about what they saw. No question. And and you know, that was one of the first times where I really went all in on reporting on these so-called men in black or men in dark suits.</p>
<p>I know it&#x27;s got a lot of baggage that that term is used, but um I also and this individual is going to have to be completely nameless, unfortunately, and I can&#x27;t even use it, but this individual claimed on the behalf of someone that we&#x27;ve heard of to fly into Brazil and get a piece of that UFO and fly it back to the United States. And this individual swore to me up and down. He did. The individual did it. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So he was part of the he was part of the retrieval team. &gt;&gt; I all I know is that on the behalf of somebody that&#x27;s pretty high up, he went and he brought and he smuggled a piece of an alleged UFO. Didn&#x27;t say that it was from that particular case, but the timeline is would imply that it was of that particular case. But I don&#x27;t know. But there&#x27;s more stuff coming out.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s going to continue to come out. That&#x27;s Yeah. I I just want to come back a little bit, James, because it&#x27;s quite tragic the story of the military police officer, Cherzi, who picked up the being and tried to get it medical treatment. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; His family that they&#x27;ve got the the records and you&#x27;ve mentioned that the pathologists couldn&#x27;t do anything for him.</p>
<p>What kind of bacteria did they say it was? Was it known within human bacterial understanding? &gt;&gt; It was. So I I we have uh just as of like a week or two ago, we got the full report with comments of the autopsy and we&#x27;re in the process of having them because our translator, it&#x27;s very technical, but it was a variant of a particular bacteria that&#x27;s never that he&#x27;s never in his life seen and he&#x27;s done thousands and thousands of biopsies. He said it was a variant, like it was an evolved bacteria that was resilient and was doing things that he&#x27;s never seen do before. And &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s that that&#x27;s important because one of the debunks on the Cherzi case that&#x27;s been put out by the officials in the Brazilian military and intelligence community is that this bacteria was nothing unusual, that it wasn&#x27;t an anomalous bacteria at all. You&#x27;re you&#x27;re categorical that the pathology records that you&#x27;ve newly obtained do verify that this was an anomalous bacteria.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I have him on camera going into total detail about it just recently looking right at the camera. I&#x27;m the guy that did the tissue samples. I&#x27;m the guy that saw it. This is what I saw. I&#x27;ve done thousands and thousands of biopsies never before and never since.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right now. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m very excited to see this new film, James. It sounds like you&#x27;ve nailed down some great information. Can I ask you also about Dr. Italo&#x27;s telepathic communications with the being? I don&#x27;t want to take away from what you reveal in the film, but is there any more that you can tell us about what the being communicated to him? I said to him, I said, um, because I&#x27;m very curious, you know, when you looked in the eyes, because I always, everybody always says when you look in the eyes, that&#x27;s when it happens, you know, and so what happened when you looked in the eyes? Was there any kind of communication? Yes.</p>
<p>Yes. He said yes. And then he said fala which is speaking speaking without speaking which I thought was interesting that it was calm. It was uh it was um uh relaxed and calm and communicating that that it was okay to him and and there was and the way he described it and I and I did another just a couple weeks ago I did another full sitdown one and a half hour extremely detailed interview with him with every possible detail I could possibly extract that I&#x27;ve yet to um uh completely transcribe and put out into the world, but I will and perhaps we&#x27;d do that with you guys. But um where he goes into great detail as much as he can about it, but he said that it was it was an elevated advanced intelligence.</p>
<p>This is the way is the one thing that he said he just he never there&#x27;s nothing like it here on Earth. It was &gt;&gt; the the other detail I don&#x27;t know if it was your documentary or one of the other reports I&#x27;ve read was that the whole hospital smelt of this ammonia &gt;&gt; that Yes, that was that was us. Yes, that was one of the guys at Regional Hospital and it seemed to have been one of the deceased uh beans and the smell was just and people had described the smell even when the girls came in in in within 10 12 feet of it. the smell lingered in that area and the mother had come within minutes of of and the creature was gone but the smell lingered in her nose and they all said that the smell was really really intense and I don&#x27;t know if that was I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s I I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know if that was some sort of protective thing that they would excrete when they&#x27;re scared and feeling threatened. I I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t it tragic that the first contact with a non-human intelligence is is is so acrimonious that that essentially a military agency is forcefully removing that alien from receiving the kind of treatment it needed to survive. &gt;&gt; I mean it&#x27;s horrible. I mean I find the the the emotional and moral implications of what we&#x27;re talking about here quite profound. Oh &gt;&gt; believe me. I mean I do too.</p>
<p>And when when I asked Dr. Echelo on camera what it felt like after 29 years of this bottled up. He started crying. He just you know he&#x27;s been sitting like you imagine the weight of that on his shoulders and he he felt so much compassion for this being that was in captivity. He was so he just the love the compassion the elevated consciousness is what he said.</p>
<p>He said, &quot;We have so much to learn from the eyes of that being.&quot; And yet for 30 years, it&#x27;s going to be 30 years in January next year &gt;&gt; since this incident occurred, &gt;&gt; which is why the timing of your new film, your updated film, is so important. &gt;&gt; The Brazilian government and military have persisted with the claim that this is all fiction. Uh they&#x27;ve dismissed any kind of claims that extraterrestrials were recovered. They&#x27;ve classified the events as routine exercises. They said that the creature was likely this homeless man, Medino.</p>
<p>That the military vehicles were for standard maintenance, not retrievalss. They said that the This is my favorite one. The hospital aliens were debunked as a dwarf couple. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Seeking medical care.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I heard that one, too. I know. Uh they also said there was no evidence supporting alien bacteria causing Cheratee&#x27;s death, which you &gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s you&#x27;re going to you&#x27;re going to hear directly from the people that did the autopsy and and studied the samples from this from the founder of the company that did the autopsy directly. Janine, Dr. Janini, and he said the same thing.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m coming. I&#x27;m I don&#x27;t care. He&#x27;s he&#x27;s older now and he&#x27;s like, &quot;This is what I saw and I can&#x27;t explain it and I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before and I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it since.&quot; Oh, God bless these people for having &gt;&gt; and there are other things there. There are other things like we&#x27;re contacting the lead general who&#x27;s now retired and there we are actually engaging with this general right now. &gt;&gt; Well, that was that was my next question is I mean there&#x27;s obviously been political change in 30 years.</p>
<p>Brazil has become a slightly more progressive society. Um the government&#x27;s a bit more open-minded. What is is there any likelihood of military officials opening up and telling more about what they know? &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a lot more a lot more going on behind the scenes. There are um members of I think it&#x27;s parliament with it, you know, senators um that are reaching out directly and indirectly for possibly hearings in Brazil. Um there are efforts going on internally uh about meetings in the United States.</p>
<p>Um there are doctors that are deciding you know contemplating joining Italo coming forward. I had meetings just recently with the whole inner circle of of those doctors and the people that run those hospitals. So this is in my opinion I think this is the beginning of the beginning. So I I could I could I be wrong? I could be wrong but I don&#x27;t think so. There is a movement happening unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s not just on Virginia. I I I think people have realized that to some degree Congress isn&#x27;t going to take the initiative. It has to come from people who&#x27;ve had direct knowledge and experience, which is actually this is probably a good time to promote it. We&#x27;ll do it at the end. James, if there are people, military personnel who were part of the retrieval operation who want to speak to you confidentially and exchange information, how can they get information to you? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a great question. Thank you so much. I I have a um Proton email and I&#x27;ll give it to you right now over the uh it is moment of contact. me moment of contact at proton.me and we will be very mindful of any national security issues or secrecy or whatever the request is. Clearly there are people who are operating under TSSCI top secret compartmented clearances who are forbidden from speaking about this.</p>
<p>And this is something that when you went to Washington, you&#x27;ve also in this moment of contact film, you&#x27;ve also gone to Washington DC and covered the congressional hearings where multiple witnesses have given evidence of what they know, what they saw. One of them is Dr. Eric Davis. He&#x27;s a friend of both of us. He&#x27;s an astrophysicist.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s been heavily involved in investigating paranormal UAP phenomena for many decades. Uh he worked with uh Robert Bigalow at the National Institute of Discovery Science. He was part of the BASS investigations, the federal government funded investigations into the subject. This is what he told you in this exclusive interview. &gt;&gt; Where&#x27;s the proof? We have alien spaceships in our possession.</p>
<p>We have bodies. Where and why can&#x27;t I get the specifics to verify those claims? &gt;&gt; If the president of the United States issued an executive order that absolves me of all of my TSSCI NDAs. NDAs are non-disclosure agreements. Those are the agreements we have to sign for every compartment in our SCI clearances. So if the president waves or absolves my obligation to those NDAs and I get subpoenaed by Congress, some somebody on Capitol Hill, some committee either in the Senate or the House or the both to reveal everything I know that I learned from my investigations both unclassified and classified into the legacy UAP crash retrieval and hardware reverse engineering and NA NHI programs.</p>
<p>I would do so if I could be waved from that or absolved in some fashion by presidential order. And if Congress subpoenas me, yes, I would go and tell him everything I know. &gt;&gt; Dr. Eric Davis makes it very clear there, James, that he [clears throat] knows stuff. He, as you know, investigated the claims that there was this legacy UAP, NHI, non-human intelligence craft retrieval program, and he became aware, he&#x27;s testified before that there has been this ongoing reverse engineering program.</p>
<p>What he&#x27;s saying though is very significant because he&#x27;s essentially saying if the president if Donald Trump was merely to say you know overnight I can wave those secrecy orders I can wave those NDAs he Dr. Eric Davis and presumably many other witnesses could come forward. So how significant is Eric Davis&#x27;s comment? It&#x27;s extremely significant and you know I I asked them those specific questions because I feel the frustration among the community among people that have seen for instance you know Dave Grouch uh Dave Grush back in 2023 making these extraordinary claims and not really providing publicly the extraordinary evidence needed to verify those claims. So I&#x27;m constantly thinking as a filmmaker a documentary filmmaker how to address those issues. Okay.</p>
<p>So, you&#x27;ve got someone with all these clearances and you signed NDAs. How how do we circumvent that? So, I&#x27;ve been asking a lot of people like Eric Davis, would you be willing, provided under the right circumstances, we make a plea to President Trump, whoever the president is, the president of the United States, wave the magic wand, provide immunity, which they can do immediately. would you testify under oath to a bipartisan group of lawmakers and give the details needed to verify the claims? And they&#x27;re all saying yes. So, let&#x27;s do it. What? And if there&#x27;s nothing to it, then hey, you got nothing to hide.</p>
<p>And I can tell you, James, I know multiple people who would fall over themselves to come forward like that. They&#x27;re patriots, so they&#x27;re never going to breach their secrecy oath unless they&#x27;re authorized to do so. Um, some of them have actually given evidence in confidence to the uh Senate Select Committee for Intelligence privately in a skiff, but they really want the public to hear their evidence. And at the moment we seem a bit hamstrung because Congress isn&#x27;t passing the disclosure laws that would allow the protection of these whistleblowers to allow particularly contractors, government contractors, not military employees, but government contractors to feel safe about coming forward. &gt;&gt; You imagine it&#x27;s like, okay, there&#x27;s nothing to see here.</p>
<p>Fair enough. Pass the act. Pass the bill. The the disclosure, you know, UAP disclosure act. Like, pass it.</p>
<p>I mean, why? Think do you think James from your knowledge of what&#x27;s going on do you think President Trump&#x27;s been got at on this issue or do you think as JD Vance the vice president indicated uh just very recently in an interview with Miranda Divine I think her pod force one he he he admitted that he&#x27;s actually interested in the subject matter but that they&#x27;ve been distracted by so many other issues but they&#x27;re going to &gt;&gt; so I&#x27;m I&#x27;m only speaking from personal experience I I&#x27;ve interviewed Carter and Ford and indirectly President Clinton Clinton and uh they all basically said that they made inquiries into the UAP or UFO phenomenon and were not happy with the answers they were getting. So, it&#x27;s extraordinary to think that the president, the commander-in-chief of the United States could get an intelligence community to basically steer him away from, you know, any information. However, I think we&#x27;re living in different times now. I think there are enough people talking about it. We&#x27;ve had four congressional hearings in the last several years.</p>
<p>Um the the word is out. The implications, global implications are so profound that um I think creating the right circumstance and really making a plea to the president, I think he just might do it. So, I&#x27;m optimistic. Well, so am I. I mean, I I I must confess, I do think it&#x27;s time for the public to actually see what these witnesses all know.</p>
<p>And there are I mean there are witnesses who want to come forward with direct evidence. I mean I I&#x27;ve actually spoken to people who&#x27;ve touched these craft James. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m very sure that the legacy program is a reality. And what&#x27;s stopping them is these top secret SCI clearances that require them to keep it confidential, even to lie about it if they&#x27;re asked about it publicly. So, I I think the president really is the ball is now in his court about whether or not he wants to be open about it.</p>
<p>[gasps] &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s one of the reasons why I put the quote from Eric Davis at the end of the movie. I want the world to see like these people are willing to come forward, wave the magic wand, provide immunity, and we will give the details needed to verify these claims. You can&#x27;t say no to that. Like, if there&#x27;s nothing to hide, give them immunity. Let them let them let them talk.</p>
<p>So James, obviously your film is coming out. When when will your film be coming out? &gt;&gt; Later this year. We don&#x27;t have an exact date, but we will soon. Later this year. &gt;&gt; But essentially, the 30th anniversary of the Virginia incident is in January next year, 2026.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes, the film will come out just before that. &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s take a look at your trailer, which we&#x27;re now going to show exclusively here on Reality Check. Have you been exposed to undeniable confirmation of a non-human [music] intelligence craft? &gt;&gt; There is something out there and we should know as the people what it is. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that the federal government is knowingly concealing evidence about UAPs from the public? &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. When you say crash retrieval, what do you mean? &gt;&gt; Non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed. &gt;&gt; For the first time in history, the names of alleged companies and gatekeepers analyzing recovered alien technology are [music] being exposed. &gt;&gt; Are any of you willing to name specific individuals? &gt;&gt; Dr.</p>
<p>James Ryder, [music] Ed Lockheed, Glenn Gaffne, CIA. &gt;&gt; For decades, we&#x27;ve heard allegations of the retrieval of objects of alien origin. in 1933 [music] saw discshaped object crashing. &gt;&gt; It was not anything from this earth. &gt;&gt; A UFO [music] crashed in Kingman.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Didn&#x27;t drop out of the sky. It had to come in [music] on an angle. &gt;&gt; The feeling I had during the encounter was like no type of aircraft that I&#x27;ve ever seen before. &gt;&gt; I saw the evidence. It&#x27;s a crash retrieval.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a craft [music] and there&#x27;s alien bodies. But one of the most well doumented UFO crash retrieval [music] cases involving live aliens took place in Virginia, Brazil. There&#x27;s a crash [music] vehicle. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s why [music] Now, for the first time in history, &gt;&gt; we have the most compelling firsthand testimony of communication with a live alien in captivity. How much time did he spend with the alien in the room? &gt;&gt; Wow, James, that trailer is extraordinary.</p>
<p>Dr. Italo Venturelli, he oozes credibility. &gt;&gt; You know, Dr. Helo is willing to put his right hand on a Bible and take a public lie detector test tomorrow. He has everything to lose and nothing to gain.</p>
<p>And he&#x27;s not coming forward anonymously. &gt;&gt; Well, I would love to see him and so many of these direct witnesses that you found in Virginia come forward to both the Brazilian Parliament and the US Congress and give their evidence in open public hearings under oath. Uh yeah, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s things going on behind the scenes right now to facilitate things events like what you&#x27;re talking about. &gt;&gt; And let&#x27;s hope that President Trump or someone close to him, maybe Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State and the acting national security adviser who does have a strong interest in the UAP subject and has admitted that this is a subject that needs to be taken seriously. Um maybe maybe JD Vance who indicated very recently in another podcast that he was also interested in the UAP issue.</p>
<p>Maybe we can see some leadership from the new administration and show some guidance to the public about what&#x27;s really been going on.
