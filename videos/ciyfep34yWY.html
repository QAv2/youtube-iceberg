            <p>Sometimes inventors hit on a national security or they&#x27;ll hit on a a topic that the government, the Department of Defense says, you know what, we&#x27;re going to actually put a secrecy order on this. Congrats on your invention. We need to make sure that the old government here is in the know before your information gets public. And so there can be those can go on for years. Sometimes if your invention really heads on say you know communications right weaponry maybe even something more dosile AI cyber security a lot of different aspects where things won&#x27;t be be allowed to be published so there is kind of the purview the government does get to put their hands in once in a while and it really is under the the guise of I want to make sure everyone&#x27;s safe and not not be exposing or publishing inventions that uh could put the public at at risk.</p>
<p>So other than that, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really up to the the individual to make it happen. And if they&#x27;re out there hustling and they get some money from the government to do so, I think they should should sure gain financial benefit from that. I I don&#x27;t have any problem with it personally.</p>
