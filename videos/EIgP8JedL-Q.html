            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[Music] One of the the the things I did about 20 years ago is we were looking for a place in the country where I could keep books and we could spend time, you know, with our kids who were young at the time and so on. So, we we bought a property in the in the redwoods in Northern California, not not far from the the place where this Nobel Prize in biology had that meeting with the raccoon, you know, who um essentially desensitized his brain um and engaged in a dialogue with him. And uh we we live, you know, about an hour from there in the Redwoods. And I built an observatory there, a small small observatory with a um you know, a library and a bedroom and uh a a work room and a a dome on top with a telescope. And I thought, you know, we&#x27;re uh over half a mile from the nearest neighbor.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s completely dark at night. The sky is completely open. And uh this could be a a signal that could be interesting to the phenomenon. So the phenomenon could manifest uh there and we would be the only witnesses but we could record something and and nothing happened. No nothing happened until the very last day and I mentioned that in the book in in in this book in number six.</p>
<p>Um we we sold the the property. Our kids were grown up by then. we wanted to go back to the city. Uh and um my I I was I was at work uh in the city and my wife was taking uh the the the last couple of things out of the property. Everything had been cleaned up.</p>
<p>We sold it to our neighbors who were wonderful people running a winery in Menosino County. So, in the middle of the night, there was such a bright light that that woke her up and there were no curtains anymore. There was nothing on the windows. There was a light that brightened up the whole forest. It was intense white tending to the ultra violet, the the blue and purple.</p>
<p>And um it was large condensation center with again the light all over. But going down the the the dirt driveway in in front of the the ranch uh that went to the to the small road uh down the valley. and she saw this and um then told me about it and it was like something very much alive saying goodbye and that you know there there is a sense of humor in all the manifestations of UFOs. a a sense of humor at a level which is difficult for us to accept because we we have very little opportunity to respond. It will choose its own time.</p>
<p>It will choose the most you know unusual I mean they have that in you know in Nevada and in in Utah at the at the Utah ranch. uh things that happen all of a sudden and and right in front of you in front of your car and um with that element of surprise and and sometimes an element of humor which is I I think indicative of a of of a system that&#x27;s at at a different level from us but that understands humor which is I find that encouraging you So if at least we have that in common with them. Now you know many animals understand humor. Um certainly apes do. Um certainly dolphins do and and many of the the the higher you know the higher animals have a sense of of of humor that they can they can share with us.</p>
<p>Uh the people training, you know, uh they they they hire uh um you know uh animals in both in circus and in in nature uh will will tell you that you know including including lions or including and those uh those are essential throughout life. So to see those reactions from which are hard I mean know why didn&#x27;t that light manifest when we were there with the telescope and with all the the scientific instruments we had in the tower you know. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit it&#x27;s a bit shocked as if it it&#x27;s a bit as if it winked at you. &gt;&gt; We have to be to pay attention to to those moments because those are the the you know the moments that could initiate communication that would be meaningful communication. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a bit as if uh it&#x27;s a bit as if uh the system winked at you.</p>
<p>Well, it if you think that we are in a control system, what you need to do is is disturb it, you know, you can disturb, you know, the the uh the environment system by lighting a fire, you know, or by or by changing a dial and and then observe what happens. So we have to think of experiments we can do to disturb the UFO or UAP phenomena not just observe it and you know document it. &gt;&gt; Well Jacques this is extraordinary and I want to say this before we go to our break is is I I think people don&#x27;t often appreciate this about your thinking is that uh you know this isn&#x27;t philosophical speculation for you. It&#x27;s a scientific hypothesis that you hold as an information scientist and you&#x27;re saying if I&#x27;m right about this hypothesis then then certain acts that would be disturbing to the system will allow me to test uh whether it&#x27;s there and to understand it better which which is really if we think of you as a scientist it&#x27;s a very very remarkable point.
