            <p>have I seen an alien body no have I seen a craft on the ground no I can&#x27;t hand as of yet to a colleague of mine the definitive proof I can show them a library full of evidence uh all of which points to that there&#x27;s something here is it evidence is not proof data is not evidence evidence is contextualized data proof actually only really happens in math you know the important thing I think for your audience to understand if they&#x27;re not a scientist or or an engineer is that a scientist is meant to be wrong every day what you put out is part of the story of a search for truth and so what I say today will be recontextualize tomorrow when I collect more data and we&#x27;ve seen that in physics over the decades you know everything from Newton through uh Maxwell&#x27;s equations through uh Einstein and then quantum mechanics we still don&#x27;t know what the answer is but tomorrow or next week or next year there&#x27;ll be a new theory that maybe gives a better picture of what is so I think the the audience needs to understand that the objective of a science scientist is to be wrong today but wrer tomorrow</p>
