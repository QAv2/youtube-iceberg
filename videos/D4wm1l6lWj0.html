            <p>so we&#x27;ve kind of come to this point now where we&#x27;ve identified what emf is we&#x27;ve identified that blocking or trying to completely block emf may not be the most effective or even the best thing for us so that brings us to kind of where blue shield comes in and and where scalar technology comes in and i know you&#x27;ve kind of gone ahead and and uh utilized the words longitudinal components or scalar components and transverse waves so maybe let&#x27;s just see if we can break down in like its most simple components even though i know that&#x27;s quite a task and not easy to do what is what is scalar technology like if you had to summarize it in a very simple way how how would you how would you give your elevator pitch on scalars do yeah there&#x27;s there&#x27;s really no elevator pitch and it becomes a little bit tricky in the sense because there&#x27;s so many words that often refer to scalar energy in different ways so you know you have zero point energy is the classic standing waves or tesla waves which are kind of more the classical scientific way to say it you know you also have tachyon you have oregon you have radiant energy you know all these things refer to the same energy so essentially at its core if you take if you neutralize all electromagnetic frequencies like let&#x27;s say you had a way to make them disappear you wouldn&#x27;t hit a net zero so there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s not not energy in the universe so even if you take all of what we know away there&#x27;s still like a standing field or a gravitational wave a graphitic wave so essentially what we&#x27;re what scalar technology does and most of them are still kind of like old school and are compared to what we&#x27;ve done with blue shield using crystal photonics um you know they use radio frequencies you can use any type of magnetic field radio frequency there&#x27;s different ways to create scalar but what you&#x27;re doing is you&#x27;re creating a neutralized field and you know a lot of companies are still doing you know you know phasing these 45 to 90 degrees to 180 degrees out of phase with each other and what you&#x27;re creating is a neutralized field that creates a field that if you can visualize this in your mind&#x27;s eye it&#x27;s like a circle or a sphere i should say in this you imagine a sphere and now that sphere expands in all directions or omni-directionally and then collapses back in on itself that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening with these different ways of using you know high voltage or low voltage or however people are doing it these days to create a scalar wave so that scalar in and of itself isn&#x27;t good or bad i mean we we show uh clear evidence that it you know increases the zeta potential and the vitality of the cell um you know blood looks way better in the presence of it but we were in blue shield we use it as a carrier signal because what&#x27;s really great is that um these longitudinal scalar waves don&#x27;t lose um power over time space so if you have a transverse hertzian frequency like with a cell phone right the reason we have to have repeaters is that it loses power over distance so distance really with modern technology is your friend the further away from it you are the less power it has an influence on cellular coherence it has um you know but what&#x27;s nice about blue shield is you can put this in the center of your house and it&#x27;ll go through walls you know concrete wood anything metal in your house and it&#x27;ll basically it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re 2 feet away from it or 20 feet away from it it&#x27;s going to have the same intensity because it doesn&#x27;t lose power over time space it&#x27;s moving through the subatomic structures between atoms right so it&#x27;s going straight like the physical matter with the same level of intensity and the same there&#x27;s no distortion in the information on that uh longitudinal wave um that&#x27;s not really a simple way but basically it&#x27;s it&#x27;s 4d you know so we have 3d uh dimensional space which is measurable on the electromagnetic spectrum and then um the longitudinal component um which does not usually exist in 3d space and we can&#x27;t create it by the way that&#x27;s another misnomer about scalars like we&#x27;re not actually creating scalar out of anything we&#x27;re basically amplifying this naturally occurring scalar that um is exists in all things and we&#x27;re amplifying it essentially so that that scalar or longitudinal wave moves along the axis of time itself in the fourth dimension which sounds completely weird and mysterious and like pretty without like really having a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics essentially um but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s simply like compressed energy to the factor of the speed of light squared i mean if you want it like a mathematical yeah that&#x27;s easy enough right [Laughter] no that&#x27;s that&#x27;s uh yeah i think it&#x27;s interesting i think that you know a lot of my listeners too are probably going to want to know okay so like let&#x27;s say i go out and i buy a a blue shield device whether it&#x27;s a cube or i buy you know one of the portable devices or the one that goes in the car all of these can found be found on your website that i&#x27;m going to link on to so is is it now like amplifying the scalar signal so that the body is listening to the scalar waves and not listening to all the emf around us is that a very over simplistic way of looking at this um no actually simplicity there is is pretty appropriate it&#x27;s no different than tuning a the dial on your am or fm radio so we&#x27;re resonant beings so the body is most influenced by the strongest signal in the environment so at the cell level what&#x27;s happening is that if you can imagine all of these cells having antennas or being tuning forks when when you when you dial your radio on like an fm station um you&#x27;re that you&#x27;re basically twisting a coil essentially and what&#x27;s happening is it&#x27;s picking up different bandwidths of carrier signals and when you dial it into a resonant frequency you&#x27;ll get a clear transmission of one of the carrier signals that has your favorite song on it right so it doesn&#x27;t mean that the other stations aren&#x27;t bouncing around the airwaves they&#x27;re certainly there but you&#x27;re making a coherent audio sound that you can follow with your song by tuning the dial into that so what blue shield is essentially doing is it&#x27;s transmitting signals that are strong enough to compete with the emf and the environment and over you know a 10 to 14 day acclimation period your body starts to sympathetically resonate with it see blue shield is not on all the time it pulses it pulses a three second pulse every half minute and the longer you&#x27;re exposed to that especially the home units which your body does the main entrainment with your body starts seeking out the signals in the environment and what happens is that the body stops perceiving the emf as a threat so it stops mounting an immune response and it reallocates the immune power back to the body to regulate and just balance itself your body knows how to heal itself it&#x27;s just you know obviously you you know probably better than anybody it&#x27;s like the lack of movement lack of proper nutrition hydration all these other things that really stand in our way and then people just don&#x27;t get that there&#x27;s an electromagnetic component to that that they might be doing everything else right but then if they&#x27;re not protecting themselves at the cell level from emf that that could be hindering a lot of the results they could be getting potentially right good point and [Music] thanks for listening to the hanu health podcast we hope you enjoyed the show this podcast would not happen without listeners and supporters like you and the best way to support us and the show is to head on over to itunes and provide us with a five-star review this helps us reach others and spread the good word of breathing and stress resiliency if we read your five star review on air please reach out to podcast honorhealth.com with your name and mailing address and we will send you some sweet hanu gear until next time breathe better and stress less</p>
