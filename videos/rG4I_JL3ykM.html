            <p>Fundamentally, this comes to what we&#x27;ve been told is the biggest question, which is, is humanity alone? The answer is no. The secrecy that has been defended uh is at the cost of in my mind human dignity, freedom, and progress. And it is no longer permissible or acceptable in my mind to uh to continue this course to deprive another generation of not just Americans but humanity of their birthright to know who they are, where they came from, and what&#x27;s with us.</p>
