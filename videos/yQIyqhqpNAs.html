            <p>foreign questions just uh just because I want to know have you personally you ever had contact uh well let me rephrase that have you ever seen face to face an alien being yes I have absolutely how how old were you uh that was the event in 1973 so I was 18. I just turned 18. okay so you&#x27;re old enough to know the difference between right and wrong between fantasy and reality yeah uh never do any drugs this was not on LSD in this okay that&#x27;s what I was about to ask you you&#x27;re coming out of the 60s LSD I never touched it I just took place you&#x27;re not on any any magic mushrooms or anything at the time nope nope no okay can you describe actually this ET I&#x27;m talking about is probably about four to five feet tall I didn&#x27;t know what the heck was going on uh and I was up on this mountain in uh outside Boone North Carolina up in the mountains and this at first I thought it was a deer on its hind legs looking at me and or the head uh deer-like eyes and it came over and touched my right shoulder so firmly I could see the indentation and with that there&#x27;s electromagnetic field all my hair stood on it&#x27;s when I had hair and all my hair stood on in and it was this amazing event that happened with this with this being so uh you know it was not at all frightening to me it was beautiful but uh and I think that what the interest of that particular experience what the those et&#x27;s was a young guy 18 who had had a near-death experience who understood Consciousness and understood the central role of what&#x27;s called in physics entanglement where everything&#x27;s connected uh and the Consciousness field but also in physics and so in order to understand going from a far distance star system to hear you&#x27;re not going to do that in a straight line at the speed of light you&#x27;re going to do it through understanding what the physicist is called non-locality where nothing has to be fixed in space-time and this gets into very some very advanced concepts but the ultimate non-local field is you right there you&#x27;re awake and conscious your conscious mind is if you were to calm it down that&#x27;s what meditation does and calm it down is actually connected to this field of Consciousness that&#x27;s everywhere simultaneously everywhere this is why the CIA had a very successful prod project dealing with what&#x27;s called remote viewing where people use certain techniques in Consciousness and be able to see remote places I got to know a lot of the really accomplished remote viewers who worked at the in that CIA program back years ago um and that program ran for 20 30 years uh and uh you know people say oh that can&#x27;t be I said oh yeah it is it&#x27;s like a Seer it&#x27;s like a a shaman or a Seer who has the ability to see remote places uh or the future in with Consciousness now think about Technologies where you&#x27;re dealing with civilizations that are hundred thousand or more years advance than us many of them they&#x27;re all their Technologies we&#x27;re using electromagnetic system here at speed of light right 186 000 miles per second they&#x27;re using technologies that are interfacing with Quantum thought it&#x27;s sort of like really Advanced what Elon Musk is working on with neurolink but not with wires and stuff but where it&#x27;s a Consciousness field and thought interfacing with machine and there&#x27;s been a lot of research done by various scientists in the last few decades on this where Consciousness and thought can affect a machine or a random number generator and which are quantum machine basically uh like Dr John did at Princeton at the Princeton engineering anomalies research lab the peer lab people should look that up he&#x27;s brilliant I knew him uh and uh he he really understood this whole idea of the Consciousness field and matter and electromagnetism and being interconnected so when you&#x27;re dealing with extraterrestrial civilizations they have perfected that the way we have perfected a cell phone or a video call or FaceTime so that&#x27;s the other thing people have to understand you&#x27;re not dealing with your granddad&#x27;s Oldsmobile here you&#x27;re dealing with some really advanced technology uh which the good part of it is that a lot of those Technologies if they&#x27;re brought forward and this is why I&#x27;m here in La for this premiere of The Lost century and how to reclaim it this new documentary that just has come out it&#x27;s about all these Technologies but if those were brought out you know in in 10 to 20 years we&#x27;d have a new a new civilization here uh but they have to be brought out wisely and they have to be brought out for peaceful applications and a lot of them have to be held back for a while the things that fly you know uh the things that are you know anti-grab things that fly around but the ones that just generate energy uh that that would you know get us off oil and gas and coal and eliminate the poverty that&#x27;s in the world very quickly uh but you know you&#x27;re going to have certain losers too in that you&#x27;re going to have you know countries and corporations and powerful people who have interest in the the conventional Energy Systems of oil gas coal Public Utilities you&#x27;re not going to need a public utility you&#x27;d have a box at your house that would be pulling energy out of what&#x27;s called a zero point energy field or Quantum energy entangled field and it&#x27;d run your house with no power bill ever same thing with your car you have to win that to plug it in like a Tesla it&#x27;d be a real Tesla nikla Tesla had one he had an electric car and never had to be plugged in so the point I&#x27;m making here is that we really could restart civilization and put it back on track but there are a lot of headwinds against it I mean think of the powerful interest that do not want that to happen I mean they&#x27;re controlling wealth that is way worse the entire budget of the United States way more orders of magnitude more so that&#x27;s the problem uh and this is so you saying are you saying the cover because that&#x27;s the heart of the cover-up right there yeah because I was always under the assumption that the cover-up man wasn&#x27;t ready for it it would challenge everything we&#x27;ve ever been taught about uh God about the Creator it would challenge we just didn&#x27;t have the mental aptitude to to understand and accept that there was life beyond what we knew well are you saying in the early days no I think in the early days there was concern about that I think certainly now since what 60 percent of the population believe there&#x27;s life out there uh and and more than that number now believe that the UFOs are real now that the Pentagon is admitted those objects that they have on sensors and cameras are real and I&#x27;ve talked to the F-18 Hornet pilot who took that footage so I mean you know this is this is getting to be a subtle question I don&#x27;t think I I think back in the 40s 50s there was some of that concern there&#x27;s still some of that concern from your more fanatical religious elements who don&#x27;t want to accept that there&#x27;s life Anywhere But Here uh but that&#x27;s the lunatic fringe 10 15 I think most people accept that you know I was at the Vatican talking to um the the one of the chief theologians for the pope some years ago and he said God is not so stupid to have left all of his hopes for uh intelligent life in the universe and just humans it was very funny it was a senior Balducci we have a great interview with him by the way uh he&#x27;s passed away but he is a wonderful guy uh so you know I think most of the of the religions of the world would be able to incorporate this into their paradigm because it doesn&#x27;t detract from the say the glory of God the fact that there&#x27;s intelligent life throughout an infinite Cosmos uh I think it&#x27;s more humans hubris and egotism that might take a hit because we think we&#x27;re the top of the food chain in the whole Cosmos and we&#x27;re sort of at the emerging level we&#x27;re an emerging civilization um and there are some they call them our brothers and sisters more advanced that are you know thousands to millions of years more advanced and do we just have to accept that but that&#x27;s okay you know we just have to accept that</p>
