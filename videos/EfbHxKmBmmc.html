            <p>so we put uh remote viewer with an interviewer in the laboratory we show him our careful procedure we go to the division director he uses a random number generator he goes into the safe he pulls out an envelope he gives it to us we drive to the site we&#x27;re there half hour we come back the guy has described it to a te we&#x27;re ecstatic he mumbles you just told him in advance I said but you saw our procedure no no I I I your division director could be inclusion too let&#x27;s do another experiment only I&#x27;m going to pick the site fine so we do another experiment he picks the site we come back another hit we&#x27;re ecstatic he mumbles it&#x27;s got to be a fraud and I think I know how you did it you had the car bugged and we were talking about the site on the way out there let me pick another site and we&#x27;re not going to talk about it in the car we&#x27;re not even we&#x27;re just going to drive to a site I&#x27;m going to pick it at random while we&#x27;re driving okay fine so we do that it&#x27;s a 30 minute experiment 15 minutes into the experiment he says quick jump in the car we&#x27;re going somewhere else I said oh wait the experiment&#x27;s not over he says yes but you might have had somebody following me and they&#x27;ve rushed back to tell them where we went so I want to go to a second place meanwhile the poor remote viewer back in the lab is saying it&#x27;s only 15 minutes into the experiment they&#x27;re getting their car already anyway describe both sides we&#x27;re ecstatic he&#x27;s sure that it&#x27;s still a fraud we we couldn&#x27;t believe what he had in mind now says well let me think about this overnight and I&#x27;ll come back tomorrow and I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll somehow guard against what you&#x27;re doing well Russell and I were commiserating with each trying and say you know nothing is going to change his mind we&#x27;ve got to pull out our trump card we&#x27;ve got to make him do it if he does it then he&#x27;s got to deal with his own data he can&#x27;t blame us because we had done that a couple times and we were beginning to see that people normal people apparently can do this so he comes in the next day and he says okay I want to see another one uh where&#x27;s the Remer and we say well today you&#x27;re the Remer he says what do you mean I don&#x27;t believe in this stuff he said it much more strongly than that I got tell you we said well look I mean at least you&#x27;ll see that uh it&#x27;s not harmful we&#x27;re not stressing the person out etc etc so anyway he agreed to do it so this time I was sent off to a site by the random protocol Russell&#x27;s there he says okay close your eyes uh tell me what you see with regard to where hell is he says okay my eyes are closed it&#x27;s dark I see the the back of my eyelids said well I mean let&#x27;s face it this is a mental thing you have to use your imagination says I&#x27;ve got a great imagination I see him at a at a bridge over a stream but that&#x27;s just my imagination so I come back from the bridge over the stream Target we take him out there he&#x27;s absolutely flabbergasted we&#x27;re ecstatic of course again we&#x27;re driving back back and say okay well we nailed it this time and he says it&#x27;s a trick and I know how you did it and we said now wait a minute you did it we didn&#x27;t do anything he says let&#x27;s do another experiment and I&#x27;m going to foil your trick all right how do you want to do it I don&#x27;t want any interviewer with me okay so I put him in the experiment room taped the door shut because he didn&#x27;t trust him anymore he trusted us sent out to a site we come back take the take take the tape off the door open the door he&#x27;s sitting crouched in the corner of the room with his hands over his ears he&#x27;s made a little drawing it turns out by the way he really nailed the sight and we say okay well what&#x27;s this thing about sitting in the corner and why didn&#x27;t you want an interview it&#x27;s better with an interviewer and he said well I had two hypotheses my first hypothesis was that the interviewer who of course knew the site would use subtle shifts in body language that sort of guide me into what to put down so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t want an interviewer my other idea was that the chair you had me sitting in had speakers in the cushions that were sublimely Whispering a description of the site to me and that&#x27;s how I was getting it so that&#x27;s why I sat in the corner so he said well okay well you see that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not it work static he&#x27;s mumbling it&#x27;s a trick and I just figured out how you do it hey all right let&#x27;s do another experiment this is what I want you to do you go to the site while you&#x27;re at your site you take pictures you make tape recordings you do all that and when you come back you show me that stuff before I then show you what I drew he said okay this is a result of that experiment it&#x27;s got the sort of pie-shaped sections show up here uh arches and so on uh he turned it into C cupula he didn&#x27;t actually recognize it as a playground device but he had to admit that there were definitely correlations and we said well what was this thing about us taking pictures and so on he said I finally figured out the only thing left was that when you left you didn&#x27;t go anywhere you just sat in the lobby you would come back and see what I had drawn and then take me to a site that looked like that okay well now about this time we had by the way he went back he he was convinced now as you&#x27;ll see later on he became one of our great alltime remov views anyway we had another problem about this time you have to realize that the only thing secret about this program was that it was secret and who are we doing it for but you know we had volunteers come in and try out experiments and they&#x27;d go out and they would talk to people I mean my own my one of my own personal problems was the intelligence people were scouring the neighborhood uh asking if I ran around if I drank a lot and all this kind of thing to get my next level of clearance and so all my neighbors were coming to me and saying was that a secret project all these people been well the only thing was secret was it was secret so about this time people were beginning to speculate so we really pressed on our sponsor CIA and said look you you&#x27;ve got to let us publish something you know we&#x27;ve done a lot of experiments here we could publish something um otherwise people going to keep uh this whisper campaign that&#x27;s some secret project but if we publish something in the open literature that&#x27;ll dampen that down so they finally agreed we could do that so we decided to write up some experiments we had done and publish them in a journal where both my colleague Russell tar and I had published many times the Institute of electrical and electronics Engineers proceedings we both published papers on vacuum tubes and lasers and microwave tubes and so on so we sent the uh the uh manuscript off it went to Bob lucky at was director of communications of bell Labs he was the editor he comes back and says you know I don&#x27;t know what to do I said why are is everybody trashing the manuscript he said no actually almost everybody thinks it should be published I said well what&#x27;s your problem well one really heavy hitter very Leading Light in in the engineering industry simply wrote this is the kind of thing I wouldn&#x27;t believe in even if it were true so I don&#x27;t know what to do I&#x27;m afraid that the engineers will go up and smoke if I publish this paper and I say okay how about this let us come to Bell Labs we&#x27;ll present it to your engineering staff if they don&#x27;t throw tomatoes publish it if they do don&#x27;t so okay well that&#x27;s fair so we went to Bell Labs we made a big presentation they loved it everyone was trying to figure out how it could possibly be in engineering terms so we thought that sort of sewed it up and uh again uh he got cold feet and so once again we pull out our trump card we say okay why don&#x27;t you do some experiments here in Bell Labs if your experiments work publish it he did them they worked and we published but of course there&#x27;s a story that goes along with everything this journal this engineering Journal is routinely published translated and published in Russia so Russians uh came back on this particular Journal issue and said uh by the way we&#x27;re going to leave out that paper on ESP stuff and uh fortunately the proceedings the it e editors said well no no it&#x27;s you take the whole Journal issue or nothing I said okay uh well we want to at least leave out the references to the Russian work that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re really afraid of that their own country men would realize they were doing research in this area but they the I they they held their ground said nope got publish the whole thing</p>
