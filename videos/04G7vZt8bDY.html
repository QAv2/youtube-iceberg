            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>we were able to reverse engineer at least half of what the ET uh uh propulsion system was and placed in the ET craft and they got it to fly could you explain to the audience the amount of people and pro you know those projects are split up just for that one project I mean what are we talking about here how many different contractors involved well that&#x27;s where the problem develops because the more people that knows about this particular project the more chance of it getting out into the public right and I give you an example a highly classified project pertaining to a Communications device that we had an alien Communications device they were able to communicate long distances with from one planet to another or from Earth to their planet and we were trying to figure out how it worked we were in a very very very early stages and there was a number of contractors involved in this tectronics motor Ola many others so there was I I think seven or eight different contractors wow involved in this so now you&#x27;re talking 60 or 70 or 80 people okay but going back a little bit we had a fantastic Counter Intelligence net built up around Area 51 in fact believe it or not every single prostitute that was in NY County and and some in in as Marella County were on on the government&#x27;s payroll and meaning that we wanted to know every military person that went in to be serviced by them and we want to know what they were told and lo and behold we had one of our assets or one of the ladies of the night call us and say we just had this guy come in here and he&#x27;s talking about some kind of Ray that was they could shoot up to another planet and send all these messages on it now that bit of information is is highly classified so we had to go out and find out who this person was and then track that person down now we got an Espionage investigation going on and we find the person and we confront the person and the person&#x27;s trying to build up his status with this this lady of the night who was a he was a regular there by the way I work with Ray Guns ma&#x27;am right exactly and so his Prestige so to speak well number one he was a contractor right um he was fired obviously a prime a contractor he was fired we were able to shut her down by saying every bit of information he gave you is baloney right and she said I&#x27;ve kind of figured that you know people come in here and boast about doing this and that but okay all right now we got to get him shut down and that information never did get out anywhere that&#x27;s just one example of what we do as special projects to protect a special access program so what are the most secret investigations that the PJ Branch performs the most secret investigations are UFO UAP investigations incidents that happen that we don&#x27;t we can&#x27;t understand or we can&#x27;t explain such as a landing that occurred at some particular place near a military installation involving military people and the ETS wanted specific information from that military person now that would be somewhat of a a Counter Intelligence or maybe even a counter Espionage investigations but it&#x27;s pretty hard to run one of those cases against an ET race that flies away you know we can&#x27;t go and interview him or go and do any background investigation on them so then we have to concentrate on the individual the individual that that why they specifically you know pick that individual which is he was in the right place at the right time obviously there&#x27;s something where they wanted this to happen right outside the base well I A lot of times they pick the person because he&#x27;s military right and the ETS want to know what&#x27;s going on they see us flying they see us flying crafts they probably have the the most advanced reconnaissance system that any any entity could have on Earth why choose a military police or security police officer people probably not briefed on the stuff that we know about why choose them well maybe a stepping stone you know it&#x27;s hard for us to get inside of an et&#x27;s mind we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t know anything about the ET we we don&#x27;t know how they think we don&#x27;t know how they they can react their personalities or anything like that so to try to rationalize uh how what their behavior would be uh where we could with a with a KGB agent or or a GRU agent well we can rationalize we have a lot of data about them we can look in a data base and know exactly how they function but an ET race coming here and asking this particular security policeman for instance the randam force incident or the Ellsworth Air Force Base incident or the Edwards Air Force Base or the luring Air Force Base incident why they ply picked that security policeman and why they ask him these questions or ask them to do something for them uh and we can&#x27;t understand that were you briefed on that exact you know what took place there do you know what those questions were yeah luring Air Force Base incident a security policeman&#x27;s walking a perimeter in the weapon storage area and the wsa of course is nuclear weapon storage area the Air Force doesn&#x27;t identify it as a air a nuclear weapon storage area and this security policeman is walking guard Duty and he sees his craft land he goes up and tries to challenge it thinking it&#x27;s a helicopter first because it hand it landed in a little hilly area uh Northwest of the weapon storage area at lauring Air Force Base and he radioed in that it was a helicopter and they said no there&#x27;s no helicopters in the area it can&#x27;t be a helicopter so he as he walked up he sees these two entities walking towards him and these entities were not human and he described him as large helmets and long arms and one of them as carrying some kind of an object which he thought was a weapon and so he challenged them with his M16 and he kept challeng they kept walking walking walking up to him and then next thing you know his weapon is taken out of his hands floated he says floated away from him now he does have a a sidearm a 38 caliber handgun so he went to reach for the handgun but it&#x27;s not there that went with the M16 now he is disarmed now he doesn&#x27;t know what to do [Music]</p>
