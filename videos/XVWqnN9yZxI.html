            <p>people there&#x27;s the observer effect and is your Consciousness affecting the experiment oh my gosh let&#x27;s hand it over to the new age folks and let them solve it and this is a complete misunderstanding of quantum physics and so when you explain it and you say well we are big macroscopic objects if you&#x27;re want to take a picture of us turn on the lights and we take a picture but the smaller you are no longer are you so immune to the consequences of being illumin at by photons mhm that&#x27;s right right and so if I&#x27;m a particle and I said I wonder what the particle is doing let me take a picture and then you turn on the light the particle&#x27;s doing something else yep so there&#x27;s a limit to how much you can know about the system just because the act of observing it changes what it is you think it&#x27;s doing so that made complete sense to me but that&#x27;s a foundational tenant of quantum physic</p>
