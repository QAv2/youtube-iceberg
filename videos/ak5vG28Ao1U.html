<p>But, um, I wanted to talk about the UAP summit that Reed Summers uh, put out over the last couple of days. And I posed a question because I don&#x27;t know if you guys remember last year, uh, Patrick from Vedit released a video where he was talking to Mr. Carl Crusher. And Carl said something that probably he shouldn&#x27;t have said maybe, but Patrick got the scoop. Uh, it was Crusher saying that he knew that an alleged landing happened uh with people from Skyer and that a guy who worked at NASA was there.</p>
<p>It was later confirmed that this guy who worked at NASA was not witnessing this event in the name of NASA. He was doing it independently. Then it was also later confirmed that this man was Dr. Adam Yingling. The case was obviously um dismissed by many as not true because of Skywatcher and the lack of communication they&#x27;ve done and the lack of transparency in many cases because yeah they&#x27;re more than likely protecting their brand but there were also many rumors going around.</p>
<p>Uh we know that people like Mike Batista and others who were alleged psionics in the in this project broke away from Skywatcher and they signed NDAs. I wanted to know uh because of Reed Summer&#x27;s UAP Summit conference. I hadn&#x27;t realized that Dr. Jingling was part of the people organizing that. He was not just a speaker but a host of the show.</p>
<p>And I wanted people to ask him about this alleged landing. And guess who came to the rescue? Everybody asked though. I know that uh good friends of mine who were part of the summit and witnessed it did ask. So the very first question that Rich Dolan asked Dr. Gary Nolan today was that and just a few things before I show you what Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan said. I did get the sense when I kept asking people. I am pretty aware of the possibility that none of this is true. I am very well aware of that. But I am going to have to report on what I&#x27;ve been hearing and that&#x27;s the reason why I asked this question which is that since nobody&#x27;s asking publicly yet, I will.</p>
<p>Dr. Adam Yelling will be part of the UAP Summit event and he will have a prominent role. To those who don&#x27;t remember, he&#x27;s a person from NASA who was supposedly present when Skywatcher allegedly landed a a UFO. So, I sure hope this is asked during the event because it is literally what everyone wants to know. If this event is even real, it needs to be discussed way more than it has been.</p>
<p>In fact, it hasn&#x27;t been discussed. People have actively tried to cover it up and not even mention it. Why is that? And I asked Reed Summers and I told him, I sure hope you can get that question in there. Even a non-answer will be helpful. Wouldn&#x27;t you agree? And they did ask the question, but they didn&#x27;t ask it to Adam.</p>
<p>Uh, funny enough, when Rich Stolen was asking the question to Dr. Gary Nolan, I think Adam was present. um he was listening to the conversation and nobody even acknowledged him. So I&#x27;m guessing that the question wasn&#x27;t asked to whom I expected it to be asked. Regardless, Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan did answer. And uh it&#x27;s very easy to have plausible deniability if you weren&#x27;t part of one of the many or a couple of these events that happened because Dr. Nolan did go into detail as to which event he did attend. It was in Southern California, but there were other events. And I&#x27;m told that some of these events were not official Skywatcher events.</p>
<p>And the rumor around is that there was a landing and that it was about 100 meters away from the people who saw it, that a craft or an alleged craft landed, and that there were beings inside of it. And I, as I told you and I repeat, I am well aware that this may not be real at all. So, we have three options. Either it did happen and they&#x27;re trying to cover it up, either it didn&#x27;t happen and somebody is not telling the truth, or it didn&#x27;t happen because the whole thing is a scop. So, I don&#x27;t know what you guys uh think about this.</p>
<p>Where do you side on this? But let&#x27;s hear what Dr. Gary Nolan said and then we&#x27;ll talk to you about it afterwards. &gt;&gt; Uh there were quite a few and I I took the liberty I hope people don&#x27;t mind of consolidating and condensing some of them because there were several that uh seem to overlap but I&#x27;ll try to get them all in. I&#x27;m going to start with this one which is one that I have wondered about as well uh rel relating to field encounters and alleged landings and essentially just there have been claims that skyatcher field operations may have involved craft landing or close physical proximity or not just aerial observation. Is this anything that you know about? Is Skywatcher ever documented or been present for a UAP landing? &gt;&gt; Uh and if not or Yeah.</p>
<p>What what&#x27;s the story with that? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m go stepping out of school to say that nothing ever landed, nor was anything materially collected. And if it was, it was something that I didn&#x27;t know about. But I I look, I wish it something was, but the short answer is &gt;&gt; you know, if if if that&#x27;s a rumor, it it should it should stay as such because it&#x27;s &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s not. &gt;&gt; Now, there was &gt;&gt; and I&#x27;ll just toss this in. Um, oh, go on.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry. &gt;&gt; No, I mean interrupt you. The the the one event that I showed there, the picture unfortunately happened the day before I got to the site. So, I wished I was there for that aerial uh object. But in Southern California, the event that I was at that uh got a fair amount of publicity um where an object was seen and we have we have pictures.</p>
<p>Uh I remember the commotion when everything was going on. Uh I didn&#x27;t see any of it personally but the pictures and the time at which the pictures were taken and the person who saw it and the events that I was seeing on the ground all correlated to there is something over the ranch that we&#x27;re at. Uh, and then we had some photographic documentation of of said moving anywhere from 5,000 to 30,000 miles an hour. &gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s definitely interesting. And your your characterization of that I thought was very responsible and um but still very intriguing all at once.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, very intriguing. And yeah, if Dr. Gary Nolan wasn&#x27;t there, he&#x27;s okay to say that that there wasn&#x27;t any landing because he didn&#x27;t see any. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m pretty sure that the rumors uh are something that he&#x27;s heard. And I do got to say that there were many people from Skywatcher who are alleged psionics who did leave Skywatcher in bad terms.</p>
<p>I saw Mike Batista recently on Gaia TV and I got to tell you, Mike, um that&#x27;s an instant credibility killer. If you want to do whatever you&#x27;re trying to do and remain credible, Gaia is not the place to do it. That&#x27;s just a personal opinion. Nothing against you, but maybe you don&#x27;t know uh the landscape as well. So, I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>What I heard is that there is video of this landing and it&#x27;s 100 m away. And if Dr. Nolan is saying that it didn&#x27;t happen, somebody should talk to these guys who are like spilling information that may or may not be real or true because the rumor is there. Like I&#x27;ve spoken to a lot of people that keep saying, &quot;Yeah, uh, apparently something did land and apparently somebody did witness it.&quot; I did hear recently that it wasn&#x27;t a sanctioned Skyatcher event. It was something done independently, but I do hear that Dr.</p>
<p>Yingling was there. So, it was interesting that neither Nolan nor Dolan acknowledged Dr. Jingling uh as part of that rumor because he&#x27;s at the middle of it. So, I don&#x27;t know what happened. I&#x27;m just telling you the information that I have.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m giving you the report. Dr. Nolan also made it seem like Skyatcher is no longer active, but he&#x27;s open and willing to keep working like that in order to get more reliable data because he thinks that the data that they collected is not reliable enough to present to the masses. So, more than likely, we&#x27;re not going to see anything from Skywatcher, and this is as best as you&#x27;re going to get in terms of a report or update on Skywatcher. Uh, I&#x27;m obviously not going to show the entire thing.</p>
<p>It was just um there was a recording uh there that you could download and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using, just this little snippet. when it comes out. I&#x27;m going to leave a link in the description to where it&#x27;s going to come out on and so you can check it out because it is also going to be for free for people. Um, but the event I think it&#x27;s already done for the two days. Let&#x27;s see what happens, man.</p>
<p>Uh, I don&#x27;t know if any of this is true. Just telling you what I found out. Allegedly, and according to some of the people who either are or were on Skyatcher, there was a landing. There is video of it. It&#x27;s about 100 meters in distance.</p>
<p>And what gives me more confidence to tell you that something did happen is that whenever I asked the people that I&#x27;m talking to who are part of Skywatcher were part of Skywatcher, they never said no. They never were as definitive as Dr. Nolan was right here. They just said no comment or I can&#x27;t go into that or you know. So that&#x27;s the reason I I&#x27;m like okay.</p>
<p>So, either you&#x27;re keeping this rumor alive for your benefit or something did happen and you were forced to sign NDAs or something like that. And I just wonder who has that video if it isn&#x27;t officially from Skywatcher. Who has the video? Could it be one of those psionic assets that broke off from the team? And could it be the reason why they were forced to sign NDAs because they knew that somebody had a piece of footage and they may release it soon? Or could it just be not true at all? That&#x27;s also a possibility as you well know and I&#x27;m sure a lot of you are a little fed up with Skywatcher and with everything they&#x27;ve done. And I&#x27;m sure uh the majority of you think this is not true at all. Just a scup possible.</p>
<p>Yeah. But I&#x27;m just reporting on what I&#x27;ve been hearing because I&#x27;ve been trying to look into this because it&#x27;s really interesting. I mean, [ __ ] landing allegedly and beings allegedly. So, I think we have to keep looking into it whether it&#x27;s real or not, just to see where this rumor came from and who originated it. And if it is real, where&#x27;s the video? Let&#x27;s see it.</p>
<p>Apparently, it&#x27;s pretty shocking. So, let&#x27;s see it. Let me know what you think about this in the comment section down below. What do you think about Dr. Gary Nolan&#x27;s response about this alleged landing that it didn&#x27;t happen? But what do you think about the information that it wasn&#x27;t necessarily an official Skywatcher event? It happened with people from Skywatcher and allegedly Dr.</p>
<p>Yingling, too. What do you think is going on? Do you think it&#x27;s nothing is real of that? And why do you think Skywatcher seems to be dead now? Could it be a SC up? I&#x27;ll be reading in the comments. And that&#x27;s it for me today on this video, but I&#x27;ll see you guys in the next one. Remember, stay curious and inquisitive like Richard Dolan always. Bye.</p>
