            <p>covering the life and work of Thomas Townsend Brown he was the Pioneer on electrographics and gravitated device and I will be covering more of the interests and aspects of his work and then I will cover some of his bio history at the end a story goes that one day he noticed how violently a x-ray tube was vibrating like it was trying to escape the equipment when it was charging that he wanted to investigate it further and found that the electro-re tube um which is shown here also known as the Coolidge tube had some sort of thrust when he was experimenting with him when it was charging up the plates because it uses a capacitance I believe Tesla was also experimenting with the same tube</p>
