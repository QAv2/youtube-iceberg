            <p>they&#x27;ve been using shame against people who had honest experiences and telling them that it didn&#x27;t happen the psychological burden on people like that is tremendous that you know that you saw something and they tell you that you didn&#x27;t that to me is what bothers me about the military stance on this is that if there&#x27;s something so dangerous there that we shouldn&#x27;t know about it then maybe the danger is not that we don&#x27;t know about it the danger is that you&#x27;re actually telling people that they&#x27;re wrong what&#x27;s more damaging to society telling people that they&#x27;ve seen something and making them unsure about it or hiding some Grand secret if there is a secret is it because the people who have the secret to using it or because there truly is a reason we don&#x27;t want anybody to know about shame is used by Society to control you it&#x27;s a Control Function it&#x27;s useful in certain circumstances but when it becomes a societal control problem then that&#x27;s when people need to get together and say no I&#x27;m not going to listen to this anymore</p>
