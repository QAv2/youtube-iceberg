            <p>What if you could live in a room where the lights never dimmed? What if your stove cooked your meals and your heater kept you warm through winter without a single bill arriving in the mail? What if no fuel was delivered, no wires stretched across the sky, and no power company controlled the switch that kept your life running? It sounds, it sounds like something you would only see in the pages of a science fiction novel. But for one man, born in America in the early years of the 20th century, it wasn&#x27;t fiction at all. For him, it was a vision. A vision that kept him awake at night. A vision that drove him into lonely workshops filled with metal shavings, sparks, and the hum of unseen forces.</p>
<p>His name was Howard Johnson, and he believed the universe had been hiding a secret in plain sight. A secret that could free humanity from the grip of oil wells, coal mines, and endless electric bills.</p>
