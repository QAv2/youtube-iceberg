            <p>You took those videos that you managed to get from Border Protections Archives to Andy Bob. That&#x27;s correct. What happened after I gave them to him? Yeah. You decided to publish. I didn&#x27;t publish right away.</p>
<p>I basically posted the cell phone videos first and then after realizing what I had tried to convince him to uh get me the originals. So, what was your impression? What was your first impression of those videos? I mean, I&#x27;ll be honest with you. Initially, I thought they might be balloons. I I knew right away what what what I had in my hands. Why was that? That it was something anomalous.</p>
