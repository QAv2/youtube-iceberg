            <p>[Music] now this is going to sound crazy but there is actual evidence to suggest that the US military was experimenting with anti-gravity technology starting in the early 2000s and continuing until at least the mid-2010s strap on your tinfoil hats because I want to talk to you about the anti-gravity research of Chinese American physicist ning Lee and her work with the US Army out of the Redstone Arsenal this is hands down the strangest story I&#x27;ve ever discussed on this platform because you SE not long after Dr ning Lee signed a contract with the US military to move her anti-gravity research out of the realm of the theoretical and into practical experimentation she disappeared creating what&#x27;s become among the most pervasive mysteries in modern internet history let&#x27;s talk about the enigmatic anti-gravity research and The Disappearance of ning Lee I&#x27;m Alex hulings and this is a pretty weird episode of air power ning Lee was a physicist who was born in China in 1943 but by the age of 40 her and her husband decided to leave China and immigrate to the United States in 1983 she found her way to Huntsville Alabama Alabama now Alabama may seem like an unusual choice for a physicist but in truth Huntsville Alabama has a long and stored history of being at the Forefront of space and Military Technologies in the days following World War II the US Army&#x27;s Redstone Arsenal out of Huntsville Alabama became the centerpiece of ongoing experimentation with recovered German V2 rockets that would go on to become the basis for both American space programs and ballistic missile efforts and today Huntsville is still the centerpiece of numerous ongoing technological efforts with numerous research facilities throughout the city limits established by the University of Alabama and the Department of Defense not to mention more than a dozen Aerospace contractors with offices inside Huntsville including Lockheed Martin northr Grumman Boeing General atomics and more put simply Huntsville Alabama is where a great deal of groundbreaking research is done and ning Lee wanted to be a part of that by right around 1990 ning Lee had managed to secure herself a position as a research scientist at the University of Alabama&#x27;s Center for space plasma and aeronomic research and it was in this position that she would soon find some degree of celebrity you see the following year in 1991 ning teamed up with fellow physicist Douglas T to publish a series of peer-reviewed papers outlining their theoretical approach to beating back gravity in these controversial papers ning and Tor described their theoretical approach to what they called a quote practical anti-gravity effect now in this context practical doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean something that would work well right out of the box but rather something that based on their Theory could be done outside of laboratory settings and as such would have really practical use cases now unsurprisingly their Theory reads as fairly complex to a Layman like me outlining how through the intentional rotation of ions they could create a gravimetric field perpendicular to the access of the ion Spin and by aligning those rotating ions properly into a lattice they call a Bose Einstein condensate you could produce a strong repulsive force that could in theory counteract gravity now it&#x27;s important to remind you here that while these papers were written by respected physicists and were published by respected journals after going through the peerreview process they were nonetheless theoretical neither ning Lee nor Douglas T were claiming to have already beaten gravity instead they were claiming to have devised a theoretical road map toward doing so the inevitable Next Step was experimentation and in 1997 ning Lee now joined by physicists David neever Tony Robertson Ron costore and Whit Brantley published another paper this new paper entitled static test for a gravitational force coupled to type 2 ybco superconductors outlined very real results to ning Le&#x27;s theoretical approach to anti-gravity now to be clear they weren&#x27;t making anything float around the lab but they did report what they considered to be anomalous fluctuations in the weight of a static test mass that they had suspended above a spinning superconductor I&#x27;ll just go ahead and explain it in their words from a portion of the abstract of that paper recent experiments have reported anomalous weight loss for a test Mass suspended above a rotating type 2 ybco superconductor with a percentage change of 05 to 2.1% Independent of the test masses chemical composition and diamagnetic properties in other words these test masses they had suspended above a rotating superconductor actually lost weight not much weight mind you just 05 to 2.1% of its own overall weight but nonetheless that&#x27;s pretty incredible stuff and by stuff I mean legitimate scientific research with actually substantiated evidence to suggest that this process really could reduce gravity&#x27;s pull on an object now within just two years of this paper being published ning Lee decided to leave the University of Alabama and strike out on her own establishing a new business called a AC gravity LLC now I know that in the Alabama Secretary of State business entity records for ACG gravity LLC which I&#x27;m likely showing on screen right now you may note that the entity type for this company is listed as a foreign limited liability Corporation now that caught my attention too but it&#x27;s important to know that in the context of American corporate law a foreign LLC just means that this company conducts business in States outside of the one in which it was originally established it does not denote a company that was established outside of the United States in other words in this context a foreign limited liability company just means that this company sometimes conducts business outside of the state of Alabama and she was not alone in believing this burgeoning technology was promising enough to State the rest of her career on when she left her job at the University of Alabama the chair of the University&#x27;s physics department a physicist named Larry SMY quit with her taking a job at AC gravity LLC and just about 2 years later it looks like that gamble paid off according to news reports AC gravity received its first defense department contract in 2001 worth a reported $448,900 which adjusted to today&#x27;s inflation is just shy of 800 Grand now initially I couldn&#x27;t find any record of this contract being awarded other than Freedom of Information Act requests that were filed after Dr ning Lee disappeared but then I stumbled across the Department of Defense annual report on Cooperative agreements and other transactions entered into during fiscal year 2001 and as boring as that may sound I hit the jackpot on page 64 of this report we can find a program entitled gravito electromagnetic superconductivity experiment that goes on to outline the contract awarded to AC Gravity by the US Army Aviation and Missile Command I&#x27;m going to go ahead and read you a direct passage from this document from the section with the heading extent to which this Cooperative agreement or other transaction has contributed to the broadening of the technology and Industrial base available for meeting Department of Defense needs quote this other transaction will allow the principal researcher Dr Lee to attempt experimental confirmation of a theoretical model of forces generated by type 2 semiconductors and the possibility of generating and controlling significant gravitational forces via this new theory if successful the payoff would be enormous I.E the ability to generate gravitational forces artificially would allow for new forms of propulsion new ways of controlling missiles and gun-launched Munitions the lowering of the weight of heavy Vehicles I.E making a 70 ton tank appear to we much less and the potential of deflecting or countering the guidance systems of missiles which rely on inertial guidance like theater or intercontinental ballistic missiles if unsuccessful this Avenue can be eliminated from future efforts and would put to rest the controversy surrounding these theories you see that contract was reportedly good for a year concluding in 2002 and the last time anyone in the academic world got a good look at ning Lee or her research was a year after that in 2003 when she attended a miter conference now merer is an organization that manages federally funded research efforts and ningle not only attended this conference but she gave a presentation entitled The measurability of AC gravity fields and maybe even more interesting than that she was joined on stage in this presentation by one of her colleagues a US Army Officer from the Redstone Arsenal reportedly assigned to the US Army&#x27;s Aviation and Missile Command now that means pretty unequivocally that more than a year after the conclusion of that initial contract ning Lee was still working with the dod but then ning Lee just fell off the academic radar she stopped publishing papers stopped making public appearances and before long people began to wonder if this promising physicist who seemed to have unlocked the secret to anti-gravity had gone missing or maybe worse we did get some tacit confirmation that ning Lee was still working with the Department of Defense in 2004 when a journalist investigating her disappearance named Tim Ventura didn&#x27;t manage to hunt down ning Lee but did manage to get in touch with one of her colleagues another scientist named Eugene pitov now politov relayed that she was doing fine and was still working with the US military but could not offer any further details into the nature of their work but after that the trail pretty much went cold and by 2008 4 years later people were beginning to fill in the blanks with their own conspiracy theories starting with a scientist named Jack sarfati who took to social media to post that he knew for a fact that ning Lee had made significant strides in her anti-gravity efforts but had since decided to leave the United States to return to continue her work for the Chinese government now this idea that a Chinese citizen would come to the United States to work work their way into a position helping to develop Advanced military Technologies for the US government only to leave and take those Technologies back to China with them very quickly started making the rounds online because well it&#x27;s pretty believable and this idea got another boost in traction from the UAP UFO Community because of the nature of her work but I can say pretty conclusively that based on my research this never happened in fact ning Lee lived in Huntsville Alabama until the day she died in 2021 in July of 2023 a journalist named Noah Logan working for the Huntsville Business Journal decided to see if he could get to the bottom of the disappearance of ning Lee after watching an excellent video about the topic published on the YouTube channel barely sociable I highly recommend that video I&#x27;ll include a link to it in the description below now Logan&#x27;s research very quickly brought him to the same conclusion that mine did and OB uary for one Dr ning Lee published on July 27th of 2021 by the Barry Hill Funeral Home out of Huntsville Alabama and this is definitely the Dr ning Lee that we&#x27;re looking for the obituary States very clearly that ning Lee was quote one of the world&#x27;s leading scientists in super conductivity anti-gravity but the obituary offered very little else in the way of details except for the name of ning Le&#x27;s son George men who still lived in the Hun area Logan soon managed to get a hold of George men and put at least part of this mystery to bed we now know that Dr ning Lee continued her work with the US Department of Defense for the remainder of her life in fact at one point her son even asked her about the secrecy related to her work and she gave him an excellent answer I&#x27;ll quote him directly here first off you don&#x27;t know anything second off if you even think you might know something you forget about it and he said okay that&#x27;s fine her son also shed light on why Dr ning Lee stopped publishing her work according to him once she started working with the Department of Defense and secured her top secret security clearance she began working on classified programs and was no longer allowed to publish her findings which Dr ning Lee seemed to not like very much she loved publishing her work and we also learned that there was at least a kernel of Truth to the idea that the Chinese government wanted ning Lee to continue her research in China according to her son CCP officials visited ningi at her home in 2008 asking her to leave the United States to return to China to continue her work there ning Le rejected the offer and as a result the Chinese government barred her from entering the country to attend her mother&#x27;s funeral unfortunately ning&#x27;s story has a tragic end she continued her work for the US military At Redstone Arsenal and on the University of Alabama campus until 2014 when she was walking with her husband and she was struck by a car her husband who wasn&#x27;t hit was so shocked by what he saw that he had a heart attack and passed away ningle herself suffered brain damage which was later compounded by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and she spent the remaining six years of her life bedridden and being taken care of by her son she ultimately passed away in his care in 2021 of course the real mystery here how far along ning Lee got and her anti-gravity efforts and whether or not her theoretical models ever proved to be truly effective remains a mystery and likely will be for some time to come to tell you the truth I don&#x27;t even know what to make of her publicly available research I just lack the technical competency required to really assess how realistic it might be but the one thing I do know is that Dr ning Lee was no quack she was not a pseudo scientist she wasn&#x27;t chasing Fame or even a paycheck this woman immigrated to the United States at 40 years old and dedicated the following decades to research and development of new technologies to benefit the United States government and Military and while I can&#x27;t say whether or not ning Lee ever did manage to unlock the secrets to anti-gravity I can say that the pervasive narrative surrounding her name that you can find all over the place online that this woman snuck into the US to steal American Secrets only to bring them back to China is wildly inaccurate ning Lee may not have been born in the US but that woman was a patriot and to call her anything but that is not only inaccurate it&#x27;s pretty crappy too and as for whether or not anti-gravity is real I don&#x27;t know you guys tell me and with that ends this very weird edition of sandbox news I&#x27;m Alex hulings make sure to swing by sandbox
