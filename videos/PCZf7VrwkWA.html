            <p>The rotating liquid mercury motor is a very unique design. It is a fluid at room temperature and is electrically conductive. In the right setup, a current is applied and a magnetic field generates a lorren force that causes the mercury to rotate. There&#x27;s also the extreme claim that a rotation and a refined state of mercury can cause anti-gravity effects, which allegedly has been utilized in the TR3B and the Nazi bell. Yet, none of these propulsion systems have been publicly replicated.</p>
<p>Today, other liquids are utilized, such as gallium and even a reactive sodium potassium alloy that is more conductive than liquid mercury. These liquids can be utilized in MHD systems, which can range from pumps, cooling, and even power generation without any moving parts. Ultimately, the liquid metal motor does not have proven anti-gravity effects, at least so far. But the concept has many diverse applications that are utilized today.</p>
