            <p>what&#x27;s the relationship between geometric algebra and tensors I&#x27;ve been asked this question many times so I thought I would address it here my answer is that they&#x27;re not really related at least on a fundamental level while geometric algebra can make the study of tensor simpler by removing the need for fiddling with components in many situations this is just a particular application of geometric algebra and not any fundamental relationship also while it is technically possible to construct a geometric algebra from the tensor algebra this is only one of many constructions and I personally favor other constructions over this one so again I would say that this is not a fundamental relationship so in the end there is no fundamental relationship between geometric algebra and tensors</p>
