            <p>what is up all you highly intelligent and truth-thirsty and science-hungry souls out there tonight we&#x27;re gonna play the name game and we&#x27;re gonna talk physicists physicists astrophysicists solid state physicists condensed metaphysicists you name it we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna go run the gamut and we&#x27;re gonna start with you know some of the more popular names and some of the more recent then we&#x27;re going to go to some of the more recent names and and how it relates directly to the ufo file and all the disclosure that&#x27;s happening now and then we&#x27;re going to go deep dive deep dive folks on all the cool scientists and we&#x27;ll name some names and and talk about some stuff so most people have heard of neil degrasse tyson right this guy&#x27;s pretty famous he&#x27;s been on a number of shows astrophysicists from the hayden planetarium down in new york city another guy from new york famous physicist real famous tv personality michelle kaku some great papers on you know how we can break the limits of space time and you know lots of interesting theoretical work that he&#x27;s done on on discovery channel and science channel on you know hypotheses about ufo and alien technology that go back you know 20 years ago i was watching this guy growing up um thinking about alien technology and how it might work reading his books and stuff carl sagan of course was the you know real famous guy before them uh as a tv personality that made physics kind of homey and friendly and uh more open to to the average person you know because to the average person when we they look at physics you know when you start really getting into it um the equations and calculus can be quite overwhelming so these guys kind of broke it down and made it easy and relatable and took things like scale and size uh in carl sagan&#x27;s book cosmos it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just some of the best well thought out and written descriptions of our universe and the natural history thereof another awesome book by a physicist is a guy named bill bryson a brief history of everything a short history of everything of nearly everything yeah this book is uh this book will change your life if you if you&#x27;re really a high school student trying to get into science trying to get into physics and um or college student you know and you want to you want some good books to read or you want or you&#x27;re maybe you&#x27;re an uh a parent maybe you&#x27;re a and you&#x27;ve got a cousin or a nephew or a son or a daughter that&#x27;s uh in high school and you want to get them interested in science give them this book this book will uh surely um introduce them to the the whole world that is the scientific world and where we are now is at this point um it&#x27;s really an awesome point in history um we&#x27;re we&#x27;re reaching the eight we&#x27;re in the age of entanglement and uh oh man solar marshall&#x27;s here dude you gotta jump in you gotta jump in the frickin you guys gotta jump in and get some people on here but uh i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t want to distract from the topic though this is this is really important we got to stay focused on the physicists and the names um because some of the some of the real interesting things that have come out right is is in all this new um disclosures that have happened within the scientific realm of of defense intelligence reference documents and all the um all the research that was done as part of these ufo programs is really just um awesome and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s given us a window into some of the stuff but the thing is that ossap didn&#x27;t start until 2008 okay so we know these programs for a fact we know that these programs go back earlier than that so we have the these um defense intelligence reference documents from 2008 and um let me just uh let me just find this real quick because i want to play this video for you all here we go this video so we have these defense intelligence reference documents from awsap that started in 2008 that talk about quasi crystal i mean they talk about quasi crystals they talk about metallic glass they talk about metamaterials and a lot of this stuff but what&#x27;s interesting is a decade before that edgar and i was looking through this and i couldn&#x27;t find it in his 1998 presentation i thought that he had talked about metamaterials and some of these and quasi crystals in his 1998 presentation maybe he didn&#x27;t have a slide on it and he didn&#x27;t emphasize it enough because i i didn&#x27;t find that but i found this and this is this is really quite interesting um i wanted to play this for people let me see if i can&#x27;t turn down my mic quasi chris energy lens and epr quantum receivers i was told by both gerald and a couple of people i talked to at groom the quasi crystals were the key to a whole new field of propulsion and communications technology to this day i&#x27;d be hard pressed to explain to you the unique electrical optical and physical properties of quasi crystal and why so much of the research is classified even the unclassified research is funded by agencies like the department of energy and department of defense why is the u.s department of energy in ames laboratory so vigorously pursuing research and quasi crystals a quote from the doe our goal is to understand and facilitate exploitation of special properties of quasi crystals these properties include but are not limited to low thermal and electrical conductivity high hardness low friction and good oxidation resistance that&#x27;s the unclassified part what are quasi crystals in 1984 a paper was published which marked the discovery of quasi crystals two distinctly different metallic crystals joined symmetrically together by 1986 several top-secret advanced studies were going on funded by darpa with leading scientists already working in the field in classical crystallography a crystal is defined as a three-dimensional periodic arrangement of atoms with transitional curiosity along its principle axes says closet excuse me since quasi crystals lose their curiosity in at least one dimension it is not possible to describe them in three-dimensional space as easily as normal crystal structures this is because this becomes more difficult to find mathematical formulas for interpretation and analysis of the diffraction data after the discovery of quasi crystals in 1984 a close resemblance was noted between icosahedral quasi crystals and 3d penrose tiling penrose tiling basically is nothing more than if you saw a tile floor that had two uh two different tiles one say has five sides and one has seven sides that match up and repeat continually but once you get into a three dimensional pin rail solid then you just if you can you have to imagine these things repeating in three different dimensions the british mathematician ron roger penrose devised a way to cover a plane in a non-periodic fashion using two different types of tiles a simple example of 3d tiling can be seen on this slide the tiles are arranged in a way that they obey certain matching rules this is called 3d pinrose tiling which makes which is made up of rhombohedron a dozen years later penrose tiling became the prototype of very powerful models to explain the structures of quasi crystals discovered 14. to explain the quasi-crystal discovered 14 years of quasi-crystal research has established existence of a wealth of stable and metastable quasi crystals with 5 8 10 and 12 volt symmetry with strange structures and interesting properties new tools had to be developed for the study and description of these extraordinary materials i&#x27;ve discovered that classified research has shown that quasi crystals are used for high energy storage materials metal matrix components thermal barriers exotic coatings infrared sensors high power laser applications and electromagnetics some hive strength alloys and surgical tools are already on the market using quasi crystals the reason i&#x27;ve presented this in detail is since i barely mentioned quasi crystals last year um i&#x27;ve been asked by so many honey so for those of you just tuning in because we got a bunch of new people and i also brought just uh solar marshall on uh to the stream me and us were actually new ed from trey personally um talked to him on the phone many many times man i wish i just i wish he would have been here today to ask i have so many more questions for him now after the deck how did he know in 1998 when i when i first heard this in a hexagon shape how how do you know that the chromatic panels in a hexagon shape and that&#x27;s exactly they&#x27;re using on tanks and all kinds of other stuff to change the the the the actual shape of the object i mean you can show what they can make it look like a car bigfoot so who knows what they&#x27;re doing you know they can do it in the sky i believe too but how did ed know if that was full of crap how did you know that dude how did he know about the foggles too the other thing i know with the foggles and also foggles what&#x27;s the guy&#x27;s name you had on your show the area 51 guy td barnes eddie barnes verified he was there he said i cannot confirm or deny if he wouldn&#x27;t have been there he said just like lazar no he wasn&#x27;t there right i knew ed was there all the credible people who worked out at area 51 that we&#x27;ve talked to all the security guards say that you know bob lazar wasn&#x27;t there that you know he he&#x27;s making it up and um ed foucher published a book back in 1998 which had a lot of this information in it i got to go back and re-read my copy and just see actually everything that he says about quasi crystals do you have the extended version i have the full version the there&#x27;s an extended version yeah that&#x27;s unedited oh yes that&#x27;s right he sent he sent it to us the pre-edited copy yeah man i have it on my one laptop i gotta open it up i can it&#x27;s gonna window is gonna take a while to probably update yeah make sure you find that and back it up i i i know i have it somewhere but i have to go and look for it i just really put it on scribe for free towards the end there yeah there&#x27;s another version that you can get for free so you don&#x27;t have to buy it on amazon um but anyways uh yeah ed foucher um interesting guy he actually has the credentials to have worked out at area 51. he was very humble he didn&#x27;t brag about much but he was very certain of what he did talk he was very he was kind of pissed off at certain times towards the end because the frauds were getting so much attention drive him crazy i i i would too yeah you and i knew ed very well i i was the last person to speak that alive i talked to him for five hours the night before he died and it was very interesting it was almost as if he knew when he&#x27;d known credentials as an air force avionics specialism you qualify him with the exact sort of background to have been assigned to area 51. i was there to repair and do a couple modifications and i went up every day on f15s before sunlight there are rumors that the aurora project is responsible for many ufo sightings in the vicinity of area 51. ball shaped craft and strange hovering lights there are those who believe that aurora has produced a revolutionary breakthrough in advanced technology edgar fuschia thinks he knows what it is [Music] to me the most fascinating vehicle from the aurora program has been the tr-3b it&#x27;s a triangular-shaped vehicle it uses a circular accelerator as you imagine a circle within a triangle that rotates a mercury-based plasma at 60 000 revolutions per minute pressurizes 250 000 atmospheres and super cooled to 150 degrees kelvin jeremy believe that all the triangular shapes i hope not oh they might have uh i hope they didn&#x27;t kick us off they might they might have brought down the stream temporarily for using this content so i&#x27;m gonna i&#x27;m gonna pull that off um we&#x27;re just going to pull up our our our stream for now i want to say something about that video right there there&#x27;s a point in that video where ed says something very interesting he says i went terry if he saw my area 51 he goes i caught this um and i talked about this he says i went up in the morning before sunlight came back every night after dark after dark there&#x27;s a place called the defense advance research center d-a-r-c is the uh acronym yep dark d-a-r-c real place he was there he was going in and out of this place he had technology he dropped that he dropped that sort of secretly it was like a tongue-in-cheek type why would someone say i come back every night after dark that makes no sense unless you&#x27;re trying to tell somebody something he was trying to say hey i was at the dark facility the defense advanced research center he would drop stuff in there and i&#x27;d catch it he would laugh he&#x27;d be like you picked it up i was like and that was when we first started talking i was like i want to ask you a couple of questions because ed talked about the dark facility remember that at the end of the 1998 uh iufoc guys are up there questioning him okay so that was the old documentary if people want to know um that was getting good and people were like oh what was that so that was um an excerpt from a documentary part two right say it again was it riddles of the sky part two riddles of the sky i think that was it yeah there&#x27;s a really good tr3b video in the daylight uh filmed in the united kingdom over there it&#x27;s awesome there&#x27;s the high def version you can find like we found it years ago and got and actually got it from the from the producers so we actually we&#x27;re friendly with those guys and we have permission and rights to actually show that footage and and any footage of ed foucher we have full rights to show so they cannot like legally shut that stream down just so people know um so what youtube just did there was you know violation of our rights um one thing interesting is they ended ed&#x27;s entire youtube channel lesson 8 what was it jeremy about a year after he passed away i used to check all his stuff out and every now and then i just click on his videos make sure everything was all right or whatever and uh yeah man remember that when they got rid of his youtube channel for no reason whatsoever was just completely gone and he had a lot of stuff on there he talked about uh he would shadow band he was one of the first people i&#x27;d ever seen it was shadow band like big time well he was the real deal and i don&#x27;t talk about stuff that&#x27;s not the real deal i try to focus my information and my research um around you know doing quality you know digging work and and digging through the you know the science for people and breaking it down for for people that um want to get involved and and don&#x27;t know about this um you know it&#x27;s a good thing too what i want to do is reach out to more college students and high school students because people aren&#x27;t interested in science or physics because they don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any future in it because all this stuff&#x27;s been classified you know all the real research and all the real interesting science has been [ __ ] just hidden from people you know it&#x27;s sorry i dropped the f-bomb because it just pisses me off so much that so much great information and so much great technology has just been you know whisked away and we&#x27;ve been given this crap view of science from these you know celebrity physicists that everybody knows these people&#x27;s names but you don&#x27;t know names of guys like lake marabou one of my favorite scientists who headed the um that he he worked for nasa and well first he worked for rensselaer polytech as as an engineer and technician and they just they go to these small technical colleges these small tech schools and they recruit out of there often and they&#x27;ll start up these little programs like they did with this star wars sdi defense initiative where they had these guys look into using lasers to propel craft and that&#x27;s where it started back in the 80s and it just warped from there and this guy like marabou was the head scientist on that project so again you have to know the names of the scientists and then you can look up what&#x27;s called their cv or curriculum vitae okay the curriculum vitaes are important like this is what they teach you in in college one of the basic things about doing research and writing papers and stuff and it&#x27;s super super important what&#x27;s up bernard thank you for joining and and weighing in on on these topics as well so it&#x27;s good to get a couple uh people um in different perspectives on this in here man but i want i want to get back to the ed fouche thing i don&#x27;t want to get too distracted on this but i want to talk about i want to talk about the science curriculum vitaes are important bibliographies are important and naming these scientists are important let&#x27;s talk about uh who gerald was because if we go back to that ed foucher thing to the um you mean gerald and harold yeah well he&#x27;s he mentions that gerald harold you know i think that gerald harold was hal put off and and you know what&#x27;s interesting is that we&#x27;re getting this discussion about atip and asap and all that right so awesome i have to interject uh jeremiah was saying with us the other day it or was it you that how his name is put off like is that just like a cia spook alias you know like he&#x27;s just putting everybody on the real info well that&#x27;s the thing the caa loves to when they see your name it&#x27;s literally becomes your like identity and and they love picking people with certain names for certain tasks and stuff you know like just like there were two george bush&#x27;s during the kennedy assassination just like there&#x27;s a jeremy court or cowbell now because uh you know they they have to take away from the real alien scientist just like yeah well that&#x27;s the thing that they they want to distract from the people that are doing the real research and that&#x27;s a kind of slap in my face that they selected someone named jeremy um you know because then there&#x27;s everyone uh the the bin laden kidney failure stories where you hear that uh he had to be on dialysis and was in a hospital in in a certain country in 2000 what too or something like that that was all put out as counterintelligence so that when anybody came to them and said hey we had a bin laden citing they knew they were lying if they said yeah and the dialysis machine was right there with him they knew right then and there they were lying they put that information out there to see who&#x27;s telling the truth and see people believed that [ __ ] and bought it and people were lying and running the government saying hey i want money because i saw this guy over here in pakistan or wherever that&#x27;s how it works man that whole ufo game is cluttered with that [ __ ] yep well hey um try to keep this the uh the curses down to a minimum and stuff yeah i&#x27;m trying because i know it gets it gets frustrating at times uh but hey this is um a great thing by the black vault john greenwald put this this page out i just linked to it in the description of this video so people can go check out what i&#x27;m showing right now is an awesome awesome um journalist he&#x27;s a real journalist he does a real deal and he he gets the foias and stuff and and he he does a great job of keeping it all together and in one spot and sourceable i got to get my websites back online and i&#x27;m working on it um so that i can get more more references to the science end of this because he&#x27;s not a scientist and he doesn&#x27;t understand that whole part of it and hasn&#x27;t done the research and been involved and what do you think of jeremy the the battle going on between him and uh him and lou alzondo i think it&#x27;s um he seems pissed too it&#x27;s kind of petty and manufactured and stuff and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of a distraction because you know they&#x27;ve got they&#x27;ve got john greenwald they know how to mislead him and lead him around and stuff and he knows he has to obey certain rules in order to get like in order to do what he&#x27;s got to do and you know because like he he he blocked me and didn&#x27;t like um my criticisms of him um but over the other other things like other conspiracy topics where i was like he called me like oh you&#x27;re just this truther and i was just like well you know like you don&#x27;t have the the the company documents that i i described and i named the companies and you search for these numbers for nothing and they don&#x27;t come up and i&#x27;m like hey you know you just got mad at me over nothing i&#x27;m just saying that you don&#x27;t have these documents on your page and you probably should so that people can find them and they&#x27;re searchable and it would help you collect it would help you connect a lot of dots if you had you know just these company files like people learning how to take constructive criticism he didn&#x27;t want to take constructive criticism he&#x27;s really like got a glass i don&#x27;t know i don&#x27;t know whatever it is he just broke and and blocked me couldn&#x27;t take it and he just said you know this guy&#x27;s you know but i know more about he&#x27;s got all these great papers posted on here can you see this stuff this is excellent he does but he doesn&#x27;t understand the science right isn&#x27;t it he has no clue about the science and he hasn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t know how to go through all this stuff and find all the because you can go in each one of these and there&#x27;s a bibliography in that and you have to in in order to be a real scientist to do the real research you have to go through all those bibliographies and read all those papers to see what kind of science make sure you understand all the science that they referenced and how they figured it out to get up to there because that&#x27;s what happened what do you think of tic tacs man what&#x27;s your opinion well this is interesting how put off um has been involved because because you got to remember ed fouche knew hal put off yes he did and i gerald who is his source and and you know that he always talks about gerald the quasi crystals the materia meta materials and stuff gerald his source is is awfully close to harold you know yes i know the whole story about it they&#x27;re they&#x27;re two different people ed was involved with the aviary but not as involved as let&#x27;s say um dodie yeah dodie or uh he was also really good friends with the colonel john alexander ed knew all them guys i sat in a uh uh a uh not a skype session what was that thing ed used to run oovoo me hal put off an ed on ubu one day for a few hours i never had met the man before and ed and him were talking about all kinds of [ __ ] and um there goes that s word again yeah ed knew all those guys so you know before anybody had heard of them about the in it you know people know about bob lazar too and i want to talk a quick thing about bob lazar i don&#x27;t want to get too deep into it but i just want to point out one one um one thing about bob is that uh yeah well the element 115 oh god the uh oh god it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s causing more damage in the scientific community than good um and i i now forget i&#x27;ve gone blank on what i what the point i was going to make because i wanted because i got dan here and when when i get dan and we go and be careful you just mentioned bob lazar have to seal my lips i can&#x27;t yeah yeah anymore it&#x27;s too much it&#x27;s too much bull crap out there man um i think it&#x27;s interesting is that at the same time there was two site fours this is what i wanted to mention yes what i think is the best proof that the bob lazar case was richard dodie involved osi disinformation and that it was connected to that ufo tv live episode that aired the year before in 1988 and richard doty was falcon though the leader of the aviary and he he was basically he he roped um he ripped ed fouche into that s4 thing too and and the whole um part of the one that that convinced ed that like he should he should kind of like talk about this more and uh ed ed retracted that later remember he told us that like he was he was roped into that by this aviary group actually there was uh several people at the iufoc that actually pulled ed to the side when he was going to do his presentation and we&#x27;re like look this s4 thing we believe it&#x27;s at papoose lake and you know next thing you know ed and bob they have bob conver ed convinced that bob&#x27;s real ed didn&#x27;t even know who bob was in the 90s bob was not known back then at all uh so you can go to site four at otherhand.org this is this is a good this is a good reference i&#x27;ll post this in the description of the video so people can check this out because the s4 thing is i think is like the best proof that bob lazar is um disinformation he is and they send him drags for money that are meaningless that&#x27;s how they pay him and this uh this um this whole thing the site fours right because they&#x27;re talking about the titanopod site for right now site four that did electronics research okay so they built they built mock uh radar stations of soviet radar and tested uh soviet radar eccms like counter radar measures uh so like basically they&#x27;d build these things on the planes so that they&#x27;d make the planes invisible to that frequency or whatever the the radar was doing it would beam it would be able to pick up the frequency and beam back um a block signal to basically cancel out the the return signal of that radar and um there was a lot of research that classified research that was being done out at tonopah that was like the that was like the eccm research station where they were doing all that research and there was a lot of classified stuff and they didn&#x27;t want the russians near that um and the other site four was actually out at plant 42.</p>
<p>in that insane we caught that on no yeah jim goodall jim goodall posted that i couldn&#x27;t believe it in a picture i&#x27;m just looking at the picture and it says site four on there where they built the b2s i i was blown away yeah so i a number of other people on twitter and other places have confirmed that you know they worked on this project out at plant 42 and the place was called site 4 during the 80s and and how they thought it was a joke that when bob lazar came out and talked about the site for place where they were doing alien technology how they knew it was just they knew it was like a government disinformation program all the people who were working at at plant 42 building those beauty v2 bombers we these people are on twitter dude and i&#x27;m going to find them and i&#x27;m going to interview these [ __ ] because they&#x27;re real unlike mike figpen and all these other people that jeremy corbell talks about saying or his sources you know his fake sources there were two places that were doing real classified research called site four okay and one was doing classified research on anti you know radar systems and eccms and the other one was building you know stealth aircraft and they were both called site four and they were and guess what the site four and tone upon was working on a stealth quote-unquote spaceship so when bob lazar came out and talked about s4 we said it was down at papoose lake in the middle of nowhere where there&#x27;s nothing we&#x27;ve shown that there&#x27;s nothing there&#x27;s no records at all of anything like if there&#x27;s something down there it&#x27;s a and it&#x27;s also it floods in the in the winter months during the wet season so as we&#x27;re showing those look at that interview that uh victor did with uh oh man i&#x27;m the one that set it up the security guard out there but right here this shows this is what my question was to um steven green street because stephen greenstreet was posting about you know how on twitter about how awesome was started in 2008 that&#x27;s where he dated it back to ossap actually started in 2008 so that&#x27;s when they they began this whole research project into um you know free energy anti-gravity you know advanced materials and all zero point energy all this stuff is it&#x27;s in the it&#x27;s in the dir defense intelligence reference documents the science is here um it&#x27;s there for people to study um so you know based on heisenberg uncertainty principle and and base and and wave function quantum mechanics there&#x27;s lots of you know back documentation on all this but hal put off and eric davis were central in a lot of this research and it&#x27;s interesting that they were involved going back you know eric davis says he was involved going back to 1996 i believe um he said i&#x27;ll put off and john alexander never ever once said that ed was a fraud nope never debunked him never said one bad word about him ever no that&#x27;s key um just just laying that out there by the way if victor&#x27;s in the crowd from australia why is the fred dunham interview not up anymore it&#x27;s uh says it&#x27;s not found 1994 was when mikael alcubierre published that paper on the warp drive okay and then two years later is when um eric davis says he was recruited into these you know government black projects so it&#x27;s just shows me that you know when they saw the theoretical physics come out that gave them the prompt to go and hire some scientists to look into this and their choice was how put off in eric davis suspicious who they choose right it&#x27;s like how do these people always get the contracts or the videos made or the public spotlight so i challenge any scientist or historian to to track this down further than i have because i&#x27;m i&#x27;m i&#x27;m pulling this all through and and breaking this all down for people where the origins actually are and where it all kind of started because it didn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t start before here uh how put off was involved in some other research and there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s an older interview with uh hal which goes back to you know how put off remember ed was in all that neuro sync mime software and all that hal was involved in that too remember ed was involved in all that brain narrow brain stuff i don&#x27;t know the neural stink and then that&#x27;s aerosynthetics and the wave functions on the that was all real stuff it was it was really used and how put off was involved in that stuff uh ed was involved in ed believed in remote viewing um him and warren york i want to find that i do i gotta find that older i&#x27;m looking for it but i can&#x27;t find it right now but there&#x27;s an older um version of this where hal put off talks about a breakthrough that happened in 1984. and i&#x27;ve traced this back to uh some really interesting research because you know in stephen greenstreet&#x27;s interview with um eric davis eric davis talks about uh you know his work on the on on like the warp drive physics paper for the u.s air force and one of the things he mentions is the sweet these squeeze dates and squeeze states um you know you got to pay attention to the the the vocabulary and and the word the key words because they say more they say enough they don&#x27;t need to say any more to the right peop to the people that are intelligent and can pick this stuff apart and they don&#x27;t want to say much more because they don&#x27;t want to they don&#x27;t really want to reveal i don&#x27;t know maybe we shouldn&#x27;t reveal this information and i shouldn&#x27;t be doing this publicly it should all stay classified but i think it&#x27;s for the better option that people know what kind of stuff they should be studying when it comes to these advanced materials which i believe were you know reverse engineer you know the guy who studied so ed foucher he mentions this whole scientist that discovered quasi crystals in 1984 and and goes back to the paper on all that and mentions it but he doesn&#x27;t mention the guy&#x27;s name the guy&#x27;s name is the scientist&#x27;s name is daniel shachtman and daniel schechtman is from technion university he&#x27;s an israeli scientist he and he was brought to the us in the in the 70s and given a postdoc after he got his doctorate in material science and showed a lot of promise and ingenuity and different ways of looking at things i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t know why they chose him but they brought him to do his post-doc at wright-patterson air force base at um the air force institute of technology and i think that this was a rare opportunity where they get that they brought some of this project blue book metals out of the repository and took a second looking at them in the in the in them in the mid 70s um because they hadn&#x27;t really i as we know they closed project blue book file in 69 after i think i what i think happened is they realized that they couldn&#x27;t they they just felt overwhelmed with the computational ability of the of the time and their ability to actually engineer or reverse engineer these materials or figure out what they were or how they even worked because we barely i mean some scientists knew about exciton physics and that goes back to solid state physics work of the 30s even didn&#x27;t checkmate get the noble uh prize for fit or science in 2012 or because i got a nobel prize it goes back years way before that remember so these exciton polaritons which are a focus of this squeezed light generation and and some of the scientists who worked on this um a lot of this research took place at uh university of rochester in new york in upstate new york um which is where a lot of a lot of classified research into this kind of stuff continues today and um is a good place to go if you want to get recruited into these programs and and learn how to you know the cutting edge science of how what this stuff is and how to work on it because a lot of industries are going to open up in the next 25 to 50 years the defense department&#x27;s hugely interested in this um the people that are intelligent enough to know what they&#x27;re talking about and aren&#x27;t just you know fooled by the ridicule and the current whatever the heck is going on in modern ufology um but these um these physics are about nano layers and quantum mechanics quant and and building things on the nanostructure in order to optimize material properties and um as ais are being programmed you know these quantum com these artificial intelligences are basically being programmed with quantum physics and trying to and they figure out these materials and how to build them because they know like all the properties of how all these things align they&#x27;d be like oh well lead and antimony or you know defense advance research center that&#x27;s what ed said but um the bomb lazar stuff is popular for a reason and it&#x27;s put out there as the popular story for a reason and otherhan.org this guy exposes it he&#x27;s a physicist who you know investigated the bob lazar stuff and jeremy remember all the stuff made at the at the at the site four out in california was tested at area 51. the b-2 stealth bomber was tested there right yeah so it confuses everything if people start talking they&#x27;re like hold on i meant no you&#x27;re messed up this guy there&#x27;s a spaceship nine hangers bob lazar oh really that&#x27;s yeah that&#x27;s how they confuse the world as to what&#x27;s really going on yeah so harder with the internet the internet&#x27;s made everything there&#x27;s not really any secrets out there it&#x27;s what&#x27;s true and what&#x27;s false so we&#x27;re understanding learning more about how to nano print through macro printing actually a lot of 3d printing is being done in building these meta materials and meta mirrors that can reflect sound in any direction so these are macro meta materials they&#x27;re physical scale so they they would interact with like microwaves of these wavelengths you know these day-to-day wavelengths which are also incredibly dangerous because they resonate with um your body&#x27;s geometries and can ionize your cells and and weird things um so yeah microwave you know not good to microwave your body uh but they do work as materials with microwaves but the smaller the metamaterial works with like higher frequencies of light you know up in the spectrum so the the finer the material you can nano print the more interaction it will actually have and there&#x27;s a lot of material being done at duke university you know duke duke&#x27;s one of the leaders in metamaterials research and stuff and they do these sound wave meta materials which are really good for modeling and understanding how quantum mechanical uh light waves will work in with similar printed systems so bubbles are interesting to get you get involved in this but the real research that went on is much more i think interesting once you get into it because daniel schechtman you know doing his post doc at uh wright patterson and then coming up with this whole idea of quasi crystals it&#x27;s just kind of i want to know more about that muslim crystals are just fascinating hey like they&#x27;re the bridge to higher dimensional energy and matter from what your research has been saying hey yeah well if you want to resonate a chris if you want to resonate higher dimensions you know a quasi crystal would be that uh um a pathway to that what is that are you what did it say about you bernard there uh asking if i&#x27;m ever on the auto didactic channel and yes uh i remember what an auto didact is explain that once uh self-educated is autodidactic or the definition of it they&#x27;re geniuses there&#x27;s another um bernard that i want people to know about his name is bernard and he worked shortly after he was recruited by lockheed martin to work on this similar classified research in the late 90s so you know well the u.s air force dod um was recruiting hal put off and eric davis for you know awesome um bernard hayes was recruited by lockheed martin skunk works to also look into the physics of this and he wrote several interesting papers alongside hal put off and i got another physicist named alfonso rueda who&#x27;s uh i believe he&#x27;s come on um who is talking about david wilcock on here man take that somewhere else alfonso rueda came on um on apec before and he actually defended bob lazar and came up with a whole presentation where he who did he supports bob lazar i remember he does al put off no alfonzo rueda i was going to say how put off was one of the first people to call him out now he doesn&#x27;t because they all were working for the same people it was a conflict they were working for the above the stars academy because bob or what&#x27;s the singer&#x27;s name man the guy from the band blink 81 what&#x27;s this right remember his sister&#x27;s the one that gave babazar the book contract so it became a conflict of interest to say that bob was full of crap well if you were part of to the stars academy which didn&#x27;t last long now did it yeah i&#x27;m lucky by the time i die i will reach the levels of bernard haiti&#x27;s uh excellent excellent amount of work and research and contribution that he has done to the science uh faculties really yeah go watch some of these got the god theory and some of these other presentations that um has given me they&#x27;re super interesting this guy deserves way more you know recognition and attention that he gets can you play a clip of it i don&#x27;t know man i don&#x27;t want to play other content on the channel dude i just they freaking youtube this is bad how risky it is these days like youtube based off of sharing like what i understand it what happened to sharon the wealth and the knowledge man i just want to share the knowledge that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s just french if you share a post it doesn&#x27;t have an ad i think it&#x27;s okay is that what it is i can&#x27;t remember anything i don&#x27;t know dude but anyways this this entanglement cookie is is the key to this business and i think with these quasi crystals and meta materials we&#x27;re going to be able to see massive improvements um especially once the ais can figure out just what to do and how to build them you know but then we need to figure out the metallurgy of how to actually construct them in real time um in the lab because that&#x27;s the next step right is is getting the laboratory equipment and then actually manufacturing these materials and and if we could be the first people to to do this and come up with the rest of the right recipes and and stuff on this [Music] you know it seems to be the business zinc aluminum sort of combination of uh materials that turn into this metamaterial structure and i really have to start sending off some of the samples from my electrolysis experiments that seem to be making these different crystallized nano layers and metamaterials out of just very basic raw materials and just a little bit of electricity it could be the key to cracking it no way stranger things it&#x27;s that the upside down that can&#x27;t i think is too real like the parallel universe aspect of multiverse you know like where where does the consciousness exist the dream world the essential akashic record or different cultures use different words for it but it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s it seems to that there has to be this other realm of consciousness somewhere yeah there&#x27;s an interesting area on that well it&#x27;s like this massive quantum bookkeeping through time that takes place it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like all of time is is entangled and encoded through the rest of eternity hey bernard you know that you know the tic tac sighting over the ocean with with david fravor i&#x27;m pretty sure so the key to the apec interview of that i found really fascinating okay listen to me real quick though i think the key to the entire story is why was there a white cross formed over the ocean and it kept bouncing around over that cross there&#x27;s something that has something to do with that white cross reserve of the ocean and i think that has to do with heat and that explains how that thing&#x27;s there what it&#x27;s doing here everything about it let&#x27;s just before we get on this i want to i just before the hour&#x27;s up i don&#x27;t want to waste people&#x27;s time that came here for a physics lesson i want to give a gamut of top secret scientists let&#x27;s just throw names out there everyone we can possibly think of don&#x27;t know any um i&#x27;m gonna put up my presentation because i got a whole bunch of them on here so we got daniel scheckman that was a good one um i want to talk about you know everyone knows about nikola tesla um people don&#x27;t know about um walter dornberger and hans comler um walter russell&#x27;s another one that i love germany apparently was best friends with tesla and bell laboratory still has his research classified where he was achieving cold fusion in different plasma tubes over a hundred years ago what was his name again bernard einstein theory was supposedly what was behind this whole idea they had this guy named uh a guy named henry william wallace believe it or not you know not braveheart but you know henry william wallace from [Music] he was actually from pennsylvania from valley forge pennsylvania and they had this coal research for general electric on rotating mercury and spin gravity you know research because general electric was building you know mercury plasma light bulbs at the time so they had like a lot of the setup to beat and equipment and and infrastructure for doing um you know the mercury experiments so that&#x27;s why they chose ge um but bryce do it 1960s uh wrote papers on quantum gravity grandfather of quantum gravity and he wrote papers on superconductors and gravitational drag which uh you know project outgrowth uh which was um headed by dr robert geisler and uh then also robert goddard involved in some of that stuff uh before that um what&#x27;s it donald ross some some interesting names you know if we just want to drop pure names these are the people that were involved with some real projects john watson wrote this whole uh paper out of grad school and got picked up went you know it was class it was classified in his his you know his graduate school thesis was classified for a while but then became unclassified you know so if bob lazar really did you know graduate with a degree in magnenohydrate hydrodynamics and it was classified in his research it would have it could have came out it would have came out it would it would have been somewhere it&#x27;s got to be somewhere on file they didn&#x27;t just erase it and disappear i mean yeah like a sunset claws or something that like may be long enough that it would have to come out mercury really is a very fascinating one though like the fact that it&#x27;s found in all the ancient pyramids and like just throughout history and then isotopes so i think it&#x27;s an isotope that&#x27;s of the mercury that they extract and it&#x27;s about the spin it&#x27;s about the spintronics so spintronics was a key element in the awesome literature and it was one of the key 38 papers of atip that they studied um i don&#x27;t want to get you know too deep on it but um it&#x27;s all about the spins and and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what started it all in 1946 with edward mills persol and one of the scientists that started the he discovered you know nuclear magnetic resonance and that&#x27;s pretty much what started the whole revolution into this you know felix bloke and a number of these other scientists who worked on this um john archibald wheeler of course you know john pendery who who ed fouche did mention in that earlier clip but did not mention daniel scheckman um and then thomas townsend brown and bonson at the bonson labs towson brown is excellent excellent work that it what like more and more of it&#x27;s been coming out from the sunset clause finally and like that started in 1913 with rhoda started it you know before a decade before and they were working on this research it&#x27;s just not well known or or talked about or expanded on a lot of this was controlled under you know export control of technology act and and this is how it&#x27;s controlled today nowadays mike mcculloch of course nick vomivakas you know um mike mccall dr mike mcculloch in his theory roger shoyer with the m drive you know um we go down the list of all the apex scientists who presented to you know guys like david serrata who got me into this back in the you know early days right 2000&#x27;s much respect for david and he&#x27;s actually i&#x27;m talking to his booking agent he&#x27;s agreed to come on your channel do a special interview with us as well as uh come on the next science of sound podcast episode that i&#x27;m putting together uh that uh hopefully you&#x27;ll also be a part of that we can get live on all the channels and uh i&#x27;ve got a couple of uh music producers uh joining us for pr special performances for that but they also have this revolutionary uh sound system that they just bought a winery and they&#x27;re using speakers to help distill and uh separate the wine so it&#x27;s gonna be an excellent episode and perfect for combining david seretta and all of his work that he&#x27;s been doing with the different coils and resonant frequencies in those experiments well this is the scientific community we&#x27;re the underground scientific community and we&#x27;ve been working on ufos with the dream the hope the hope that someday we&#x27;ll be able to actually build one and figure out the science and this technology and i believe that if we work together as a community and um you know try to you know figure out all the best ideas and weed out the crap um david nathan inanne great uh lecture here definitely check that one out jack sarfati all his stuff um watch john brandenburg tony uh robertson podclick eugene pod clinton off you know paul murad no longer with us um great that we interviewed some of these guys before they left this world um like the first apec of all what was our first apec it was um our first apec was uh mark mccandlish who&#x27;s no longer with us uh you know so we in we in we got the chance to get these guys on and put them in front of a team of physicists and engineers to just throw questions at them you know what i mean so we got everything that we possibly could intelligence wise and and out of these these people you know this is core intelligence we&#x27;re working for you we ain&#x27;t dealing with like physics we need to be at the jetsons level already it&#x27;s enough for these stupid rockets i know yes uh stuck on earth like we should be we need to be a society a civilization that is going to throughout the solar system as well as the universe it&#x27;s far too long heck yeah that&#x27;s the goal that is the plan and um i want to uh thank you bernard thank you solar marshall for for joining in and uh and and chiming in a whole bunch of scientists i even have another video called you know 20 other scientists other than bob lazar who who actually have phds and you know our physicists and did classified research richard feynman one of my favorite ones he&#x27;s the guy that got me into this i was gonna say you didn&#x27;t mention him that&#x27;s your favorite yeah i&#x27;m trying to think of who else but yeah richard feynman one of the funniest guy read his books if you if you want a book to that&#x27;s actually the book that got me when i read richard feynman&#x27;s autobiography um that was that was the book jeremy what did he do that was illegal or something or what did he do what&#x27;s he famous for i can&#x27;t remember a number of things he he cracked he used to crack safe so um he went and looked up got books on safe cracking and learned how to crack safe so he used to just hack all the secrets at los alamos and then he&#x27;d he&#x27;d go and he&#x27;d go and steal intelligence at los alamos and then bring it down to the security desk in office and be like hey you know you guys uh might want to do a better job of uh you know keeping you know these are our nation&#x27;s secrets and you might want to do a better job you know yeah so they loved him at the base because he he exposed all these security flaws and helped them like establish better security because he was just like dude if i was a spy you guys would be [ __ ] done like so done you know there was something else he was very famous for i can&#x27;t remember man what is it feynman here yeah richard feynman he um he won the nobel prize in quantum electrodynamics that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s most famous for of course and uh he he um was recruited out of mit at age that&#x27;s right his schooling was compared to lazars because he didn&#x27;t he was recruited on mit right just like he was already known that&#x27;s what it was he already hey he already had like a college graduate level education as a freshman when he went in so they were just like this guy&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t need to be here um it&#x27;s more it&#x27;s more beneficial that we he continue his ph you know his phd remotely actually he graduated with his you know undergraduate degree at mit and went for his phd at princeton um so he he um and he studied to be recruited and do you know who richard feynman&#x27;s phd advisor was oh john archibald wheeler that&#x27;s interesting go figure um yeah so qed is the theory of how light interacts it&#x27;s based on this with matter it&#x27;s based on these this path integral formalism and he&#x27;s and he&#x27;s real famous for feynman diagrams with which are these diagrams which simplify the path integral notation and um how to set up the basic you know computational so each one of these things is like uh a part of the mathematical quantum function so they never understand that sorry yeah that shit&#x27;s you know that&#x27;s how he figured it out he back back engineered it from maxwell&#x27;s equations and relativity and uh dirac uh field theory quantum field theory it&#x27;s it&#x27;s good stuff but if you want to get deeper into it a good physicist to look up who i think we haven&#x27;t mentioned yet is david chester john hutchison somebody mentioned what&#x27;s going on with him is he still around or not yeah no i&#x27;ve been talking to hutchinson and bob greenier has been doing a lot of work verifying under the microscope the different effects of hutchinson&#x27;s experiments so you know although it seems that at least some of his work is legit you know like i i won&#x27;t speak for all of it but it bob greenier has done a lot of work in verifying a decent amount of it i heard that his apartment is just filled with the old electronics equipment from the very front to the very back and they&#x27;re surprised that the floor didn&#x27;t cave in because of how heavy it is did you ever hear about that yeah he actually moved and he&#x27;s been setting up he&#x27;s got an acreage now and a giant warehouse that he&#x27;s been setting everything up and like he uses a lot of old navy radars the sonars and stuff so it&#x27;s higher stuff he&#x27;s using so just that alone you know it&#x27;s quite possible that he is getting some real effects and it seems like yeah there actually is proof now to support it that&#x27;s really interesting to hear um what i don&#x27;t like about john hutchison is that he says he he did everything by feel and that he couldn&#x27;t really describe you know which frequencies to use or or an active science for how to how to achieve these effects yeah right i agree with that so um when we when he did his apec though i was talking with his wife nancy and they did describe the method that they use to be able to measure it measure the resonant frequencies of specific elements and i&#x27;m really hoping and waiting that he does come on a stream with us to be able to explain it further at which point i think that will really verify whether you know he knows what he&#x27;s doing or if it&#x27;s just all random coincidence and chance i always found the way the metal was torn apart like the fingers it left went from one piece to the next it was like impossible to replicate that it was almost different those were the samples that bob has been looking at now and putting under the microscope and verifying the different evos that appear in them all the work that&#x27;s going on in cold fusion right now i got some other cold fusion scientists who i&#x27;ve you know i went to an iep course at on cold fusion at mit um put on by um i remember that two years ago right sorry why am i having trouble remembering the guy&#x27;s name so um peter hagelstein so you think that you think cold fusion&#x27;s legit right jeremy yeah i think there&#x27;s a lot more we don&#x27;t know about it i think that&#x27;s i think that&#x27;s what ufos use for their power actually yeah their propulsion systems i really think that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s legit mitchell schwartz um dr mitchell swords and he is uh dr mitchell schwartz how why do i know that name dr mitchell schwartz this guy right here and he uh he&#x27;s an mit cole fusions researcher um doing so you know i gotta i gotta get him on for an interview soon i&#x27;ve talked to him recently so another word for cold fusion that&#x27;s like the real term in science is l-e-n-r low-energy nuclear reactions yeah or it&#x27;s kind of a code word that they use to get by so they don&#x27;t have to really admit that it&#x27;s real or structures like structure structured lattice the us navy is the term lanner which is lattice assisted nuclear reaction um that&#x27;s uh dr larry forsley he&#x27;s the spay war scientist who did some of the fine some work on cold fusion he investigated uh uh larry four that&#x27;s a term i haven&#x27;t heard in a while spay war go the living moon dot com man there&#x27;s tons of stuff on spay war over there yeah spay war is um ron schmidt aka john let&#x27;s mention some organizations as scientists too so like so like spay war is a good one uh jason group right you know with the jason group right jason advisory group have you guys heard of that before it was a like a team of the elite scientists that would advise the department of energy and u.s intelligence community on all scientific matters that&#x27;s key very key very very very very very key did you ever know anybody worked in the jason group oh we should interview some of those guys dude that&#x27;d be great there&#x27;s basically that was shut down under dick cheney too so um guys we&#x27;re gonna shut down the stream the live stream it&#x27;s just going on i don&#x27;t want to keep it going on past an hour people just don&#x27;t have the appetite when they see it they get overwhelmed um and it is overwhelming man this is like stuff that takes a lifetime to learn sometimes if you really we gotta do it we gotta do a show about it one night i&#x27;m getting a lot of messages from people want to hear dude ed was the real deal and i&#x27;m glad we had a chance to talk to him about him tonight because i want to explore i want to explore that a little more too at a later date because well how about we set a date up and put like out how do we get it like we&#x27;re going to talk about ed maybe i&#x27;ll get woody or somebody to come on ad new about the hexagon panels for the you know the stealth technology that was being developed he knew about the foggles he knew about so much stuff and these metamaterials and quasi crystals that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the weird thing is that we know about that and and obviously what did he predict that like an element so everyone&#x27;s like oh well what was a tip before what was the group before um uh atip in 2008 obviously this stuff didn&#x27;t start in 2008 no well look at how put off&#x27;s career he was the head scientist on a lot of this stuff so tracing back his career is going to be key to finding out you know a lot of other stuff and when you trace back you know put off&#x27;s career you find a lot of these other scientists um that were involved with with put off with put off um you know john alexander who headed that program then jack sarfati and some of these other guys this is the lecture guys we&#x27;re all involved with nids too if you can find this lecture on here um that&#x27;s the one where he talks about the breakthrough that happened in 1984 which i believe is related to those squeezed states of light because that&#x27;s the biggest breakthrough that hap that was when they first discovered that a silly scientific just big discovery that was is related to anything involved with this um that happened he&#x27;s got his hands involved in all that stuff too oh absolutely research bigelow at all good nids all that stuff a tip bass awesome what&#x27;s going on with bigelow they shut down it&#x27;s weird man he like shut down nasa gave him contract so i think closed him up he had to shut his mouth after that yeah i think they they they screwed him they like had his main business and or something yeah that whole thing with now so like really he really messed up i&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s not allowed to although although what&#x27;s really strange is is all the ufo reports go to bigelow from nevada why is that right why would all the why would all the ufo reports go very suspicious lots of answer questions but where were these scientists before that and what was the program called before that that&#x27;s the key and these scientists are the going to be the ones who are going to know and um that&#x27;s why i was saying a tip would have probably been mids before that nist i mean something is in the national wait a minute ah nids was uh he&#x27;s chasing off all those guys eric davis when they studied skim walker ranch years ago uh that&#x27;s exactly exactly right because what what was hal put off doing before i kind of look it up i can&#x27;t remember what it is he&#x27;s involved with a lot of crazy stuff including scientology and and like trying to prove scientology for the cia and yeah early on scientology the biggest scam ever well of course was the national institute for discovery science i love studying con artists and scams that&#x27;s how to get over [ __ ] over on people that&#x27;s what they that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re into um in any case thank you all for watching and uh have a good night and uh thank you for having me join me join the live stream i&#x27;m going to post a link down there for people who want to hang out they have to party all right peace</p>
