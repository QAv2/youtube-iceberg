            <p>Okay. So, today we&#x27;re going to jump into something uh pretty wild. Yeah. We&#x27;re talking about government investigations into UAPs and then like the strange stuff that&#x27;s been going on for a long time at Skinwalker Ranch. Yeah, Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
<p>Definitely. It&#x27;s one of those things where like a lot of strangess. Yeah, it&#x27;s so strange. It&#x27;s almost like, you know, is it really true or is this just, you know, right? But there&#x27;s so much there&#x27;s been so much written about it. And then you sent me over this book review.</p>
<p>Yeah. from the Journal of Scientific Exploration. And I got to say this is a fascinating review of this book called Skinwalkers at the Pentagon. Yeah, it is a it&#x27;s a really interesting deep dive into how the government got so interested in UAPs and the role that this one ranch might have actually played in all of this. Yeah.</p>
<p>So, just as like a backdrop for people, you know, back in 2017, the public found out, right, that the government had been investigating, you know, they call anomalous aerospace threats, right? And we all found out because about $22 million had been allocated to this program. And most of that money went to Robert Bigalow&#x27;s aerospace company. And that was all because of Senator Harry Reid&#x27;s, you know, long-standing interest in UFOs. Mhm. Don&#x27;t miss the full episode on our YouTube channel, Randomness Reloaded.</p>
