            <p>Why do so many scientists who discover or work on clean energy suddenly find themselves killed? Well, this is a strange story. Noo-Noo lio. Yeah. He was until yesterday MIT&#x27;s leading nuclear fusion scientist. His plasma research led to incredible clean energy breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Clean tech, no fossil fuels. He was murdered at his home on Monday. Here is the news report. shot dead at 47 years old. Noo-Noo lao.</p>
<p>Am I saying that right? The Portuguese. &gt;&gt; Lero. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I know. I I was pra practicing it all morning. Lero.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Lorero. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I lived in Portugal for 5 years and you think I&#x27;d be able to nail it. Anyway, he&#x27;s from Lisbon originally. Uh, one could argue like Tesla before his ultimate untimely death that Noo-Noo&#x27;s plasma physics research could have changed the world.</p>
<p>You could argue that sources have confirmed to redacted that he had made a few energy giants very nervous.</p>
