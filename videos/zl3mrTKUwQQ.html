            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this channel is for educational purposes and uh we like to look at Great theories of [Music] everything ancient and modern and uh go deeply into them uh help you to understand how to use them so that you can um awaken to 5D Consciousness form your holistic worldview and change your paradigms so uh today is our 513th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey be Larson and Mr Larsson was an American engineer who lived in the 20s Century died back in 1990 but not before he put out many books articles and um got a little bit of small following going um some people who also wrote uh very interesting things that we&#x27;ve covered on this channel and uh in 1959 Mr Larson proposed his two fundamental postulates about how we believe the universe operated and uh from there he derived a theoretical Universe what his Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then he compared his theoretical Universe with the measured empirical universe of the modern scientists and um the results of that um some of those results are written up here in this book that we&#x27;re looking at today called basic properties of matter primarily on chemistry um and um we&#x27;re in the middle of chapter 22 of this book called The Magnetic materials um if you like a a rundown on the reciprocal system how it uh Works what the fundamental postulates are how it operates uh how what the ramifications of those postulates are uh then you want to watch one of my first 474 videos on this topic uh for the purposes of this video I&#x27;m going to assume that you have some type of knowledge of the reciprocal system if you don&#x27;t uh go back and watch one of those videos if you don&#x27;t want to do that hang on tight you still might get something out of this uh cuz Larson sometimes explains himself along the way but uh we&#x27;re just trying to uh get through the material um and so I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time U you know repeating um you know the basics just to get everybody up to speed okay so we&#x27;re here in the uh in the middle of chapter 22 uh he&#x27;s talking about the um refraction constant I believe and uh we&#x27;ll start right here the average difference in initial level for a molecular a molecule of rotational mass m is then M Prime Over N over 9 m in table 34 this value shown as Delta I over M change in current um is applied to the refractive constants of Representative groups of simple organic compounds to arrive at the internal magnetic susceptibilities the corresponding values from observation are listed in the last three columns of the table values marked with asterisks are taken from a recent compilation where no measurement was available from this source a representative value from the earlier reports as shown in the same column the last two columns shown in the range shown the range of results reported from the earlier measurements okay so uh he shows these um this table and he&#x27;s got several different columns here um and and uh the last two are calculated and observed um and so we&#x27;re looking at the [Music] paraffins and it looks like he&#x27;s not right on target but uh within a few thousands here uh with uh the paraffins he&#x27;s pretty much exactly right with uh [Music] and um [Music] butane and then we move down and it looks like the values are consistently very close but not exact to the um you know compiled uh values for the paraffin um now that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that Larson is off it could be that the um the values uh determined in the laboratory are off as opposed to larsson&#x27;s values which he&#x27;s determining in his mind uh in theory um then uh we go to the acids and LaRon is uh pretty accurate on those as well uh go to the alcohols uh there&#x27;s a few values here that look like they&#x27;re a little bit low so there might be a glitch in some of Larson&#x27;s equations here looks like his values are consistently low for the alcohols uh usually by about two 300s uh monobasic Esters again a little bit low uh oh well he&#x27;s right on target here with propy [Music] um and you know moving through all that now we&#x27;re headed to the die basic Esters um pretty consistent values here [Music] um well a little bit uh little bit off but uh you know within a 100th there aines aans um off by a little here uh with diethyl but uh cyclanes benzines and yeah so hopefully he&#x27;ll sum it up here in the normal paraffins the association between the ch2 group and the lone hydrogen atom at the negative end of the molecule is close enough to enable the ch2 combination to act as the N group this means that there are 18 rotational mass units in the end group of each chain the value of delta I change of current for these compounds is therefore 18 over 9 equals 2 branching adds more ends to the molecule and consequently increases Delta I the two methyl paraffins add one ch 2 uh end group raising um Delta I to three um the two three dimethyl compounds add one more bringing this quantity up to four and so on very close Association similar to that in the ch2 combination modifies this General pattern in two methyl propane for instance the ch ch3 combination acts as an interior group and the value of a change in current for this compound is the same as that of the corresponding normal paraffin butane the C uh ch3 the quantity 2 combination likewise acts as an interior group in two two methyl propane and as a unit in uh with only one end group in the higher two two dimethyl paraffins each of the Interior ch2 groups with the higher initial level adds nine rotational mass units rather than the eight corresponding to the group formula this seems to indicate that in these instances a ch2 ch2 combination is acting geometrically as if it were ch3 CH in the ring compounds the ch2 and CH groups take the normal 8 and 7even unit values respectively the behavior of the substituted chain compounds is similar to that of the paraffins but there is a greater range of variability because of the presence of components other than carbon and hydrogen the alcohols typical family of this kind have a ch3 group at one end of the molecule and a ch2 group at the other the value of delta T for the longer chains is therefore 26 [Music] over9 in the lower alcohols however the ch2 portion of the ch2oh group reverts to the status of an interior group and Delta I drops to two the methyl alcohol molecule goes a step further and acts as if it has only one nend a similar pattern can be seen in other organic families such as the Esters since we have found that the effective units of some of these compounds and certain of the phenomena pre previously examined are double formula molecules it appears likely that the magnetic Behavior of methyl Alcohol and Other compounds with similar characteristics can be attributed to the size of the effective molecule no similar studies of paramagnetic materials have yet been made unlike diamagnetism paramagnetism is temperature dependent for an explanation of this dependence we need to recall that magnetism is a motion one of the significant advantages of recognizing its status as a motion is that its effect on other motions can be evaluated in terms of a direct addition or subtraction rather than having to be approached circuitously by means of some hypothetical mechanism diamagnetism uh which is motion in time or negative has no connection with the thermal motion which is motion in space positive but paramagnetism is positive and has an imputed Direction opposite to that of the thermal motion thus an increase in temperature reduces the paramagnetic effect the internal magnetism which has been the Principal subject of the discussion thus far in the present chapter is of Interest primarily because of the light it sheds on the nature and properties of magnetism in general from a practical standpoint magnetism is synonymous with pherom magnetism F no systematic study of pherom magnetism in the context of the theory of the universe of motion has yet been undertaken there are however a few points about the place of this phenomenon in the general physical picture that should be noted pherom magnetism exists only below a temperature the cury point which is specific for each substance in as much as this type of magnetism is restricted to positive elements and some of their compounds pherom magn ferromagnetic materials are also paramagnetic and exhibit their paramagnetic properties above the Cur temperature in this range the susceptibility is linearly related to the temperature but the relation is inverse that is the relation is between temperature and um one over uh s which uh I believe is that Greek letter and I don&#x27;t remember what it means so um it could be the um uh susceptibility in one respect there is a significant difference between the magnetic susceptibility and most of the physical properties discussed in the earlier Pages the specific heat of Any Given substance for instance decreases with decreasing temperature and reaches zero at a particular temperature level there is no specific heat there is no negative specific heat consequently the specific heat of the individual atom is zero at all temperatures below this level but magnetic forces act upon magnetic substances at all temperatures below the critical temperature as well as above it what we have here is a difference in the significance of the zero point as explained in volume one the true datm of physical activity the natural zero is unit speed the speed of light natural physical magnitudes extend from this natural zero to the Natural unit of speed in space our zero in One Direction and to unit speed in time inverse speed in the other these two speed ranges are identical except for the inversion most of the physical magnitudes with which we deal are in the range from our zero to the speed of light but there are some quantities that extend beyond the natural zero levels this introduces some modifying factors into the physical relations as the natural zero levels are are limiting magnitudes of the kind discussed in chapter 17 that is points at which an inversion of most physical properties take place for example a property such as thermal radiation that increases with the temperature up to the unit temperature level the natural zero does not continue to increase as the temperature rises still farther instead as we will see in volume three it undergoes a decrease symmet symmetrical with the increase that takes place between zero and unit temperature a somewhat similar reversal occurs in the case of these properties that extend into the region inside unit space the time region as we have called it because all changes in this region take place in time while the associated space remains constant at the unit level ferromagnetism is a phenomenon of the time region and its natural zero point the cury temperature is therefore a boundary between two dissimilar regions rather than a center of symmetry like the speed of light the natural zero of speed instead of following the kind of a linear relation that is characteristic of the properties of the Region&#x27;s outside unit space the relation of ferromagnetism to temperature has a more complex form due to the substitution of the spatial equivalent of time for actual SP excuse me for actual space in this region where no change in actual space space takes place no detailed study studies in this area have yet been undertaken but it seems evident that in the more regular elements the magnetism is subject to the um quantity 1 - x^2 uh to the 1/2 relation that applies to other time region properties examined earlier and to a square root factor which may also be inter Regional it can therefore be expressed as M = K uh time the quantity 1 - t ^2 um the quantity to the 1/4 power if the magnetism if the magnetization is dated as a fraction uh is stated as a fraction of the initial magnetization and the temperature is similarly stated as a fraction of the curry temperature the constant K is eliminated and the values derived from the equation apply to all substances that follow the regular pattern within the limits of accuracy of the experimental data the reduced magnetizations thus calculated are in agreement with the empirical values as reported by DH Martin because the internal magnetic charge is applied against the basic rotational motion of the atom its force is symmetrically distributed in the same manner as the gravitational force but as we have seen pherom magnetism is a motion of an individual specifically located component of the atom the directional distribution of the ferromagnetic force in the reference system is therefore determined by the atomic orientation if each atom acted independently the orientation of the atoms of an aggregate would be random but in fact each magnetically charged atom exerts a force on its magnetic neighbors tending to line up these neighboring atoms with its own magnetic directions this orienting effect encounters mechanical resistance and is ordinarily Limited in scope for this reason and because the relation of each magnetic aggregate to its magnetic environmental changes from time to time uh let&#x27;s try that sentence again for this reason and because the relation of each magnetic aggregate to its magnetic environment changes from time to time the magnetic orientation of an aggregate is not usually uniform instead the aggregate is subdivided magnetically into a number of um sections generally called domains ordinarily the domains are random rly oriented and the effective magnetic force is reduced by the distribution over the different directions application of an external field forces a reorientation of the atoms to conform with the directions of the field the extent of which depends on the strength of the field this reorientation concentrates the magnetic effect in the direction of the field and result results in an increase in the effective magnetic force reaching a maximum the saturation level when the reorientation is complete okay that&#x27;s the end of chapter 22 on magnetic materials chapter 23 starts up um and that is called charges in motion and we will get into that tomorrow um today I guess we&#x27;ll call it call it short here by 10 minutes or so and um start up here with chapter 23 tomorrow thanks for tuning in today and have a great day</p>
