            <p>while the world is drastically dependent on fossil fuel researchers at NASA langle research center are working on another way of producing energy efficient nuclear power this other form of nuclear power releases energy by adding neutrons eventually they gain sufficient number of neutrons that they spontaneously Decay into uh something of the same mass but a different element the different element is cleaner than traditional nuclear fuels and can be produced by raw materials such as nickel carbon and hydrogen it has demonstrated ability to produce excess amounts of energy cleanly without hazardous ionizing radiation without producing nasty waste this clean form of energy is also powerful able to support everything from Transportation Systems to infrastructure the easiest implementation of this would be for the home you would have a unit that would replace your water heater and you would have some sort of cycle to derive electrical energy from that and then it would dump its waste heat into the water or air handling system for the building so it&#x27; be a dual use dual use thing it would would be sitting there producing heat and you drive electricity from it to to run your your electronics power the house power the building power the Light Industry and then the waste heat would be used for environmental control and and uh warm water NASA&#x27;s method for enhancement of surface plasm polaritons to initiate and sustain lenr and metal hydride systems a clean nuclear energy for your power operated technology</p>
