            <p>hi I&#x27;m Dr R W sads found and chair of the international Society of unified science this is part two of my paper theory of unit space time and displacements from unit space time material and Cosmic photons sub atoms and atoms if you haven&#x27;t viewed part one I suggest you do that first okay we&#x27;re on page 19 part D ukian versus non- ukian Space time in the reciprocal system space time is isotropic homogeneous and ukia the curvature is zero so Kappa sub space time is zero general relativity posits non- idian space time and so the curvature is not zero Penrose in reference 33 page 1023 says that in some versions Capa space time is greater than zero and in other versions cap of space time is less than zero Pen Rose himself seems to favor cap of SpaceTime less than zero page 1005 but reference 56 gives us a fairly definitive observational result the shape of the universe is the local and Global geometry of the universe in terms of both curvature and topology though strictly speaking it goes beyond Bey on both although the shape of the universe is still a matter of debate in physical cosmology based on the recent Wilkinson microwave and isotropy probe the acronym is W map measurements we now know that the universe is flat with only a point 4% margin of error according to NASA scientists this refutes general relativity and supports the reciprocal system other tests of general relativity include the following reference 47 page 149 one light deflection in the gravitational field of the sun two rotation of this ABS line that&#x27;s the line connecting the aelion with the parion of the inner planets such as mercury three red shift of Starlight reciprocal system can explain these situations just as well as general relativity one light deflection light rate passing a minimum distance R subot from the center of a star of mass m will be deflected by the angle see reference 39 page 95 Theta = 2 * 1 + gamma * G * m / R * c^ 2 in radians and general relativity gamma equals one whereas in Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation gamma is zero arson says reference a page 36 the photon has no mass and therefore no gravitational motion toward a massive aggregate a star for instance but the gravitational motion of the star is distributed scalar motion and this scalar motion of the star toward the photon AB is inherently nothing more than a decrease in the distance between the objects it can equally Well appear in the reference system as the motion of the photon toward the star ba on the basis of probability the total motion is divided between the two Alternatives the total motion of the star toward the photon is distributed among so many mass units that the motion of each is unobservable but the photon is a single unit and it is deflected a small but measurable amount toward the star end quote therefore for the reciprocal system gamma equal 1 in equation 11 so the factor 2 * 1 + gamma = 4 which is twice what it would be for Newtonian gravity it&#x27;s simply because of how the reference system works the deflection is not due to space-time curvature number two rotation of the absolon for example of Mercury from reference 19 and based on equation six above the orbital motion of a planet around a star of mass n is given by Y and you can see the equation there equation 12 where s is equal 1 over r that is one over the mean radial distance and H equals the radi of change of I with respect to time / S2 and 5 is angular displacement that N Sub s equals the right hand side of equation 12 for any gravitational Theory the advance of the par healing of the planet is given for small values by 1 12 times the rate of change of n of s with respect to S as the planet advances through F radians its parion advances through P * 5 radians now equation 14 gives the expression for rate of change of n with respect to s for mercury we have these values Ral 5.79 091 * 10 10th meters as I&#x27;ve said s is equal 1 / R and so s = 1.72 6844 * 10-1 per meter uh D5 by DT is 8.26 6835 * 10us 7 radians per second and then the value of H is 2.77 225 3 * 10 15 so then uh you get that major factor which you can see in equation 15 it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s not much greater than one you can you can see that now for a circular orbit G * m = v^2 s and therefore DN by DS is going to be V ^2 s * c^ 2 * that factor from the previous page 1.004 Time s and then we get p * 5 and for one revolution 5 = 2 * pi so p * 2 * piun is = b^2 c^ 2 * that factor * piun fraction of the Revolution per Evolution now reference 45 page 294 gives the mean value of the velocity of mercury as 4,000 excuse me 47 8725 m/s so putting that in the expression we get the fraction of the Revolution per Revolution and then multiplying through by pi * 60 * 60 * 360 we get the arcc for revolution now Mercury&#x27;s siderial period is 248 4445 Julian years that&#x27;s reference 4594 therefore over a century you finally get the result 43107 076 seconds of AR calculations with general relativity C reference 40 page 579 gives 4311 plus or minus 45 so we&#x27;re very close on it this extreme Defence from the standpoint of the reciprocal system the advance of the parhelion of mercury is not due to a gravitational effect it is due to the relatively high velocity of the planet and therefore due to coordinate time number three red shift of light coming from a large Mass according to general relativity energy is quote spent by light to leave the gravitational field of the star planet so the frequency is reduced but this effect is really due to coordinate time like that of the advance of the pelan of mercury given above except that we are not dealing with an orbit so the orbital factor and Pi do not apply here this just leaves the half factor in b^2 over c^2 here V must be the escape Velocity from the Star Planet equation then is frequency new red shift = 1us 12 * V Escape 2 / c^ 2 time the original frequency for the Sun the scape velocity is 6177 * 10 5 m/s and hence the ret frequency must be 1 - 1 half the Escape sun squ over c^ 2times the original frequency and putting this into U the red shift Z which is defined as new original minus new red shift over new original we finally get that subg is equal to 2.12 2676 * 10us 6 this is a very small effect reference 40 page 579 says the calculation general relativity is 2.17 * 10- 6 the same reference says the gravitational reg is not a definitive test of general relativity however for the Newtonian theory of gravity predicts the same red shift assuming that the photon energy is H new and that the principle of equivalence and the law of conservation of energy hold so there cical system general relativity and even the Newtonian Theory are tied to this effect and so it is no quote proof for general relativity therefore the proposition of the universe is ukian stands but general relativity has other issues it is in conflict with quantum mechanics as Penrose points out over many pages in reference 33 it is difficult to see how a quantized space time could be consistent with a non-zero curvature it&#x27;s also difficult to see how Mass can affect space time in any manner the theory provides no mechanism so it&#x27;s difficult to see how space can be curved or warped or folded or any other crazy ideas of modern physics a gravitational astronomical objects like quazars often appear to be in two different locations at the same time the conventional explanation of this phenomenon is quote gravitational lensing the reciprical system explanation which is given in reference to page 301 is as follows specifically in regards to quers quote and this comes directly from lson incidentally in as much as the outward motion of aaser has a specific direction as seen in the spatial reference system the lateral motion is confined to one specific perpendicular line as noted earlier however scalar motion does not distinguish between the direction ab and the direction ba the lateral recession outward from point x is therefore divided equally between a direction XA and the opposite direction XV by the operational probability matter moving translationally at upper range speeds thus appears in the reference system in two locations equidistant from the line of motion in the coincident Dimension the optical line of sight in those cases and separated by 33.8 seconds of Arc please see referencing for more details at uniform rate or non-uniform rate of space time in the reciprocal system space time Flows at a strictly constant rate c a contemporary Theory called quote infation says that shortly after the big bang or I shouldn&#x27;t say alleged Big Bang there was a period of time in which SpaceTime flowed faster than the speed of flight this is necessary in conventional Theory because the universe is reportedly 93 billion light years in diameter according to reference 57 but there was actually no big bang and so the universe could be vastly older than currently estimate she unit space time and displacements from unit space time vacuum properties SpaceTime cannot be physically changed in any manner existing physical displacements from unit space time such as photons sub atoms and atoms therefore have the character of quot postulates if there were a creation of the universe both unit space time and displacements unit space time were created together the displacements cannot revert back to Bare space time displacements are conserved there are no virtual particles in the reciprocal system the acceleration due to the SpaceTime progression outside unit space and an opposition of gravitation is 1.144 * 10us 13 Newtons per kilogram reference 17 in contrast quantum mechanics supposes that the quote vacuum is a very busy place with all manner of virtual particles popping in and popping out of SpaceTime but these are unobservable according to reference 42 Page 1239 on page 1240 of this same reference the authors boldly Proclaim that the energy of the quot vacuum is Believe It or Not 10 to the 111 power Jews per meter cubed obviously this is utter nonsense it&#x27;s principle of equivalence the reciprocal system and general relativity agree gravitational mass and inertial mass are perfectly equal the reason for this and reciprical system will be explained later in this paper but it&#x27;s obvious that gravitation is accelerated motion all special relativity and paradoxes as is well known special relativity has the clock Paradox and the twin paradox which can be resolved only by utilization of a fixed reference system see reference one second Pages 85 to 88 therefore emotion cannot be purely relative it is ultimately absolute see the discussion Below on the cosmic microwave background of radiation get to that in a moment J general relativity and coordinates arson States very clearly in reference 5 page 94 here we have the essence of general relativity special relativity accomplished its objective of providing a mathematical correction for the conceptual erar in the conventional view of time by abandoning the idea that the magnitudes of time and space intervals measured with respect to coordinate systems of reference had fixed values and introducing a fictitious variability in these magnitudes to meet the additional problem of accelerated motion Einstein simply prescribed a bigger dose of the same medicine it took him seven years to figure out where the additional flexibility could be introduced but finally he created more latitude for a numerical variation by depriving the coordinates themselves of any meaning so far as mensturation is concerned of course in the reciprocal system coordinates have meaning okay ulten lson explains the reality of simultaneity in the reciprocal system reference 5 Pages 11 and 112 quote in earlier days when physical science de only with relatively low velocities the contribution of the coordinate time to the total time interval and any physical process was negligible and it was possible to car out all calculations involving motion on the basis of clock time only the Adent of high velocity measurements particularly those concerned with the velocity of light showed that there was an error somewhere in the system and there was a study of the background of this discrepancy that led Einstein to his conclusion that quote there&#x27;s no such thing as simultaneity of distant events if we are referring to total time this presentent study is in full Accord with Einstein&#x27;s conclusion but for most purposes the useful definition of simultaneity is that which regards events as simultaneous if they Ur at the same clock time that is at the same stage of the time progression and this kind s withy definitely does exist continuing with this quote from Larson Einstein and his colleagues accepted the quote operational point of view in this instance and rejected the concept of an objectively real simultaneity because of its lack of an operational basis as Mohler explains the concept of simultaneity between the two events in different places obviously has no exact objective meaning at all since we cannot give any experimental method by which the simultaneity could be ascertained the present work shows that this conclusion is an error that simultaneity defined as the same clock time is something that can be ascertained by physical means and this concept can therefore be legitimately employed in any connection in which it happens to be useful the category that includes most of the applications in which the ID of simultaneity is normally employed in this sense the only sense that is of any particular importance to us Einstein is wrong and there is such a thing as simultaneity of distant events L summ the conventional theorists need the Big Bang inflation dark energy and general relativity to explain the observations whereas the reciprocal system just needs the space-time progression and Newtonian gravitation Modified by coordinate time to explain the observations including the acceleration of the universe see the appending and reference 17 for the numerical calculation of this acceleration which increases with time now moving on to section two photons and radiation A Spacetime nature photons and radiation maximal relations the SpaceTime progression is uniform translational motion the first kind of displacement from this is linear vibration motion this linear vibration knocks out the SpaceTime progression in the dimension of the vibration leaving two Dimensions available one of which is used this Dimension is perpendicular to the progression therefore this object is a linear vibration moving at the suet of light in a perpendicular Direction resulting in a sign curve quite obviously we can identify this combined motion as radiation and we can identify the linear vibration as a photon uni frequency frequency may be identified as the redir frequency for hydrogen isotope y r = 3. 28806 * 10 15 Herz displacements above R are considered to be quote high frequency whereas displacements below R are considered low frequency the first displacement above R is 2 R whereas the first displacement below R is 1 12 R there&#x27;s nothing electromagnetic about radiation Max will reference 55 incorrectly deduced to his theory of radiation as electromagnetic by his famous relation Cal 1 / the SC of Epsilon KN times mu where Epsilon KN is the electric primitivity of space time fre space time and mu0 or mu is the magnetic permeability of space time of course in the natural units of the reciprocal system these parameters have the value of exactly one that&#x27;s just C the dimensions of Epsilon KN are s over T and there is of m not or t Cub over S 4 C reference 11 and so the dimensions of C or S over T of course there&#x27;s nothing electric or magnetic about space time and so there&#x27;s nothing electrical or magnetic about radiation the textbooks are all long table one gives the spectrum of photon frequencies and you can see uh radio waves microwaves infrared Rays visible white ultraviolet rays x-ray gamma ray I have columns for energy and electron volts frequency and Herz wavelength variable unit some millimeters some kilometers natural frequency based on R and the inverse name that&#x27;s table one okay section B planks Quantum of radiation energy and calculation planks constant the sypical system except of course Plank&#x27;s concept of the Quantum of radiation energy the photon and planks and Yen&#x27;s radiation laws the energy of a photon is a linear function of its frequency the perpendicular translation of space time contributes nothing to the energy equals H * new none of the conventional references give a derivation of the value planks constant H but we can derive this constant by means of the reciprocal system or convenience CGS units will be used here one observers in our sector material or time space sector measure Photon frequency in cycles per unit time such as cycles per second in this sector time appears to be onedimensional and Progressive two observers corresponding to us in the cosmic where space time sector measure Photon frequency in cycles per Space Unit such as cycles per cent in this inverse sector space appears to be onedimensional progressing three from statements one and two it follows that to have a definition covering both sectors we must combine the two equations and measure Photon frequency in cycles per space-time unit such as cycles per centimet second in application to the time space sector the numerical value of the space factor in the general equation such a unity and application of the space time sector the numerical value of the time factor in the general equation of such a Unity but it&#x27;s important to realize that the dimensions of these factors are still present in our section with energy and URS the dimensions of the energy equation are = second s / second per cimer / * 1 over CM second an inverse sector with energy in Rays inverse of verbs the dimensions of the energy equation are gral CM s / cm/s per gray * 1 over CM second from these two expressions it follows that Plank&#x27;s constant in our sector has the dimensions of ver cenim second and Plank&#x27;s constant in the inverse sector has the dimensions gray cim per second with the space Factor unity in our sector and treating the frequency here cycles per second the units of planks constant become or seconds with the time Factor unity in the inverse section treating the frequency there cycles per centimeter the units of planks Conant become Ray C five the ratio second for cenim Ur and cenim second for gray and the equations well are simply conversion factors from the natural system to the CGS system and SGC system the equivalent of the CGS system in the inverse sector the ratio of second per centimeter for her is 2.2 36055 * 10 Theus 8 and that&#x27;s from reference 1 second edition page 161 six the factor per second squar and the expression for our sector comes from the national unit time expressed in the seconds squar similarly the factor for cim squ and the expression for the inverse sector comes from the natural unit of space expressed in cim squar these terms are the keys to transforming the frequency to energy and must be included seven final the interv regional ratio between the time region or the time space region between the space region and and the space time region in the cosmic sector must be included because the oscillation the photon takes place within a unit of space time so the result for AG in our sectors T sub u² / I subr which is the inter Regional ratio time 2.23 6055 * 10 - 8 and that gives us H = 6.61 0263 * 10 - 27 seconds with frequency given in cycles per second or as 6.61 0263 * 10 27 per CM seconds with frequency given the cycles per CM second the resulting quantity energy and is identical in both cases and of course there are similar values for the cosmic sector accepted value 6. 626 * 10- 27 B seconds and this value has been used in most papers and books on the reciprocal system depending clarification of the small discrepancy the ratio of the calculated to accepted value is 9976 or approximately 99.8% the respected experimentalist physicist R Milan found H to be 6.57 * 10us 27 second reference 4 somewhat lower than we set the diet today see calculation of the stepan boltzman constant reciprocal system accepts the Stefan boltzman law and the thermodynamic calculation of the Stefan boltzman law you can see the references there the stepan bolman law of radiation energy from the black body radiator is expressed as the Sigma * T 4 power where Sigma is the constant one unit of radiation leaves per unit of area per unit of time uni thermal vibration expressed in CGS unit is use of 1al 1 cycles per CM second for reason it&#x27;s given the section B above unit areas the square of the natural unit space S Sub U and CGS reduced by the inter Regional ratio of I sub R Thal Motion in the time region is affecting only half the time because the space time regression XS inward here therefore observing dimensional consistency we obtain this value for Sigma and you can see the expression there for Sigma so we calculate 5.88 2079 * 10us 5th per cm squ per second per Kelvin to the 4th power set of value is 56704 * 10us 5 from reference 50 page 1 one .7% lower than that calculated possibly any so-called black body May really have a Touch of Gray th the measure Val slightly underestimate true that the dividing Lane between atomic translational Motion in space and motion and time although unit radiation frequencies are this value is not necessarily the frequency which divides the emission absorption of photons due to translational Motion in space material sector and time cosm sector over all cubes of coordinate space and coordinate Time the numbers of and types of photons from matter and photons from cosmic matter must equal the standard references give a range of values for the energy of radiation per cubic centimeter for our purposes here we can assume roughly .5 electron volts per cubic cm from matter staright and 05 electron volts per cubic centimeter from cosmic matter Starlite that is the cosmic m way background radiation incidentally the energy from cosmic rays is estimated to be one electron volt per cubic cm so we can assume that the energy from matter Rays to the cosmic Center to the cosmic sector is also one electron volt per cubic centimeter so the universe is inbalance because the cosmic sector localized in coordinate time rather than coordinate space we cannot see Cosmic stars and galaxies but the phons from either sector are perceivable they reduced by the proper distribution factor between the two sectors arson says referen in page 202 that this distribution factor is 128 meaning that R is reduced by 128 giving a wavelength of 11.67 nin so therefore we get that the dividing line is 2.5 68797 * 10 to 13 Hertz or in wavelength is 1.1 16754 Theus 5 m reference three page 204 our findings show that what is needed is is a recognition of the existence of the unit boundary 11.67 microns strong radiation in the FL infrared Beyond 11.67 microns comes from matter with speeds in the upper ranges above the speed of light not from the relatively cool thermal sources like those that radiate weakly in the far infrared as we will see in the pages that follow strong infr spread emission is one of the conspicuous features of the objects that we will be identifi as involving motion up arranged speeds quazar C galaxies the cores of other large galaxies exploding galaxies such as M82 Etc the infrared radiation from the quazar is estimated to be a thousand times radiation in the visible range the association between infrared emission and radiation in radio range which we identify with upper in speeds is another feature of these objects which like the infed emission is unexplained in current astronomical Theory the significance of the results of the surveys of the infrared sources within the Galaxy such as the one reported by ly Bor and beckin is that they demonstrate the existence of the line of demarcation between the far INF red of EMP range speeds and near Red of the speeds below unit table one shows the names with inverse values Cosmic observers would see a shift to Shorter wavelengths higher frequencies or r dividing line times 128 okay that concludes part two of the paper and you may now proceed to part three</p>
