            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. wrong w sats founder and chair the International Society unified science and president trans Power Corporation a commercial and custom software manufacturing company and certified systems engineering company I work as a systems and mechanical engineer and as a theoretical physicist today as and most of my weekly screencasts we&#x27;ll be discussing the surgical system and how it compares to the conventional theories out there this is quite interesting today there&#x27;s an article back in not actually 2013 in The Washington Post of all places and headlines this quote quantum mechanics is an embarrassment to science well from one&#x27;s life the Washington Post got something right so let&#x27;s take a look at this link and it says here back in 2011 a survey was taken of various physicists and mathematicians at a conference on quantum physics and the nature of reality in Austria 33 of the world&#x27;s top experts are asked to list their favourite interpretation of quantum mechanics the result not a single one of the interpretations could even garner a simple majority vote 90 years after the theory was first developed there&#x27;s still no consensus on what quantum physics actually means quote I&#x27;ll go out on a limb to suggest the results of this poll should be very embarrassing to business wrote cosmologists john kerr oh he&#x27;s a college professor by the way washington&#x27;s videos he&#x27;s a pure physical list he he&#x27;s a complete believer in conventional physics and they say parenthetically on the plus side 30 nonsense that&#x27;s what these conventional people keep saying but they&#x27;re dead wrong in the video below carol breaks found the basics of why scientists can&#x27;t seem to agree on how to interpret quantum mechanics explains why so critical what is quantum mechanics really i mean that&#x27;s like saying what is the universe well quantum mechanics is really just a mathematical form of the nuclear theory of the atom now let&#x27;s go let me explain something when I was 12 years old I began to read my father&#x27;s college textbooks in physics and chemistry yes I was a little precocious at one point I discovered this diagram of a uranium 238 isotopes it was a model and it claimed that there were 92 electrons 92 protons an 146 neutrons in this structure I said to myself man I still believe now that this is an abomination this is an impossible object it&#x27;s complete garbage so anyway the International side of unified science which I founded in 1971 we&#x27;ve been saying for for many decades now the quantum mechanics is nonsense the theory was thoroughly refuted by Dulli the larson is possibly the case against the nuclear atom so at the time when I was 12 I&#x27;m looking for alternative theories to the nuclear atom theory and after two years of hard work by the way my father was a college professor and so I was working with the physics department at that time to see if there were you know alternatives they told me that you know being professors they had to teach the consensus so they weren&#x27;t going to look into it but they did refer me to the North Pacific publishers they had received the flyer on a case against the nuclear atom by doing the arson so Wow I read that I thought wow this is really logical so then in 1965 it began actually to work with Dewey Larson on the reciprocal system of theory and I worked with him directly until his death in 1990 and since then I&#x27;ve been responsible for expanding the theory and making it fully computational so you know my reciprocal system micro cosmos database is covers all the properties of matter and all the major properties of matter I could not have used quantum mechanics to do that database it&#x27;s impossible engineers up until the state-based engineers had to use empirical regression equations like those developed by Carl Gauss in his chemical properties handbook now engineers can use the reciprocal system microcosm aceite base to calculate the properties of matter now you&#x27;re wondering well how can you get the case against smooth thereat good news you can read this amazing book online here it is it&#x27;s gritty calm ok scan sneak around so you can read this book for yourself online and I just want to read this little quote here let&#x27;s see if I can find it this comes from Louis de Broglie who&#x27;s the famous physicist back in the day he says history shows clearly that the advances of science have always been frustrated by the tyrannical influences of certain preconceived notions which were turned into unassailable dogmas for that reason alone every serious scientist should periodically make a profound the examination of his basic principles so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re calling on the scientific community to do please reexamine your basic principles the nuclear atom theory and quantum mechanics are dead wrong it&#x27;s a mythology it&#x27;s been foisted on students for over 100 years thousands absolutely rubbish the reciprocal system is now verified science due to my reciprocal system database so please read this book the case against nuclear atom online okay so if you want the simplest possible treatment of the reciprocal system and the critique of modern physics please read my work the unless you numbers plane diagrams very few equations it just teaches the concepts step by step now if you run all the mathematics and I&#x27;ve got thousands of equations here in my work it&#x27;s a software ebook called existence and interactions a computational treatise of their signal system the truth theory of everyone so please read that I&#x27;ll take you months to go through it some kind of loving pages thousands of equations numerous diagrams it&#x27;s quite amazing if I say so myself and then after you finish that you&#x27;ve go on to the two database modules the first as I&#x27;ve said it&#x27;s the micro cosmos module which handles photons sub atoms atoms compounds and alloys and the second of course is for the macro cosmos which handles all the phenomena of astrophysics and astronomy that&#x27;s galaxy clusters galaxies star clusters stars planets moons nebulae minor bodies no comments asteroids and of course of the voids so you get those two modules and you&#x27;ll be able to use the reciprocal system we practice not conditionals there you can&#x27;t do this can&#x27;t be done so please study the reciprocal system and prove it for yourself thanks for your attention</p>
