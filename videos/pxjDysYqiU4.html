            <p>hey everybody this is tim with presto engineering tonight i want to show you a fun experiment you can do with your kids this is a simple neodymium magnet and a piece of copper tubing and there&#x27;s nothing in there this isn&#x27;t a trick or anything and a piece of PVC pipe and we can show you an experiment we&#x27;re dropping the magnet down the PVC pipe of course it goes straight through down out the other end but there&#x27;s some strange principles at work with copper tubing the copper kind of eliminates the magnetic field around the neodymium magnet so the magnet just kind of floats down the pipe and comes out the other end it takes a long time for it to come out the other end and it&#x27;s not scraping the pipe or anything like that it&#x27;s actually floating down the pipe you can look down in there and see it and again it&#x27;s not a trick or anything it&#x27;s a lot of fun to do this experiment with your kids of course Isaac Newton discovered gravity but he could not explain some principles of gravity and we&#x27;re going to show you a fun a fun experiment tonight with this ok helping me with the experiment are my two sons on the right is Ryland and on the left is Cal Cal what&#x27;s going to happen when you drop your magnet down through the copper pipe well people might not believe this but watch now I do not have magic I know people are out there I&#x27;m thinking man I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t okay right you drop it magnet down through your pipe it won&#x27;t be the same it fell right out okay what do you think it&#x27;s happening cow what happens when you drop the magnet down your pipe well why don&#x27;t you drop the magnet dollar pipe now this may look like normal um no but it actually when you drop a metal Mammon um a mountain down here um something slows it down we don&#x27;t know really what okay try it again hold the pipe up I thought I did not use magic okay took a long time for that magnet to come out of there so even though Isaac Newton discovered gravity and he explained that objects all fall at the same rate of speed you can defeat that law of gravity somewhat by dropping a magnet through a copper pipe pretty good huh you can try this everyone just get a copper pipe like this and then get one of these magnets okay thanks for helping guys hi don&#x27;t but don&#x27;t fear Meg&#x27;s like this okay very strong here a warning there very strong and once you put it on a piece of metal it will barely come off so you can pinch your fingers right you will tense your fingers okay good advice okay thanks guys yeah later</p>
