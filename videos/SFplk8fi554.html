            <p>with video projectors images can be displayed that are larger than the devices themselves however we have to give up living space and ambients to set up artificial canvases that have to be as large as the desired image smart projectors are able to display Correct images onto arbitrary existing screen surfaces like wallpapered walls or window curtains our smart projector combines camera feedback with structured light projection to gain information about the screen surface and the environment the calibration is fast robust and fully automatic geometric and color correction is done in real time on a per pixel basis this shows the entire calibration process with the example of a textured curtain a time multiplexed line strip scanning technique is used to compute the displacement of every projector pixel to its corresponding camera pixel position the resulting lookup table is stored in a 32-bit texture the entire process takes about 30 30 seconds during the calibration step the environmental light the surface reflectance and form factor components are measured on the Fly these parameters are also stored in textures all parameter textures are then passed to a pixel Shader that performs per pixel geometric warping and color correction of incoming video frames in real time the underlying surfaces disappear and the effect is similar to a projection onto regular projection canvases here the color correction is alternately turned on and off to show the difference this is a projection onto a scruffy room Corner the image appears as being displayed onto a plain projection screen multiple projectors can complement each other to achieve higher light intensities and to cancel out individual Shadow regions in this example two partially overlapping projectors generate a high resolution 16 to9 format here is a projection onto a natural stone wall turning the color correction on and off clearly illustrates the advantage video frames do not have to be displayed in their original rectangular format but they can be clipped to adapt to the shape of the display surface here we see a correct projection onto a wallpapered wall thanks to an ongoing miniaturization smart projectors will become compact devices that are as inconspicuous as light bulbs they might make it possible to convert your bookshelf into a TV screen or your kids closet into an interactive virtual playground</p>
