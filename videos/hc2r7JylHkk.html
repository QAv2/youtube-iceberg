            <p>the importance of the time domain we realize that we have the energy entering three space from the time domain the basic charge every charge every dipole and every dipolarity already accomplishes broken symmetry in both in in energy flow in three space and in the time domain individually but there&#x27;s a four space symmetry that&#x27;s maintained in other words exactly as much energy comes in in compressed form in the time domain to the charge As Leaves it in three space in expanded form so we still maintain the conservation of energy law but we have also discovered the basic fundamental giant negentropy operation of nature every charge has been doing it since the very creation if it&#x27;s been around original matter some 14 billion years that&#x27;s good enough for me so so if it&#x27;s going to fail it&#x27;s going to fail sometime in the future this mechanism continues you do not have to put any energy in once the uh broken symmetry is established it goes forever uh that&#x27;s been in physics since uh 1957 now the way you get it to a single charge from the dipole you realize that in Quantum electrodynamics any isolated observable charge is clustered by virtual charges of oppos opposite sign clustering around it they have to take into account the shielding of that that charge and they speak of the bar charge plus uh plus the observed charge being different numbers because of the shielding and they calculate that standard thing not Tom beon but if you take one of those virtual charges while it is existing and you take a differential piece of the so-called isolated observable charge you have yourself a composite dipole for a moment that&#x27;s all right it&#x27;s real while it does exist it&#x27;s fleeting but it&#x27;s real and there&#x27;s another one the next moment another one and so so I can really treat treat to charge is a set of dipoles and anything I work out for dipole applies to the charge so all the stuff between the agreement between reinterpreting the Whitaker decomposition of the scalar potential there&#x27;s a scal potential between the ends of every dipole that agrees with a Quantum field Theory uh approach as mandal and Shaw showed in Quantum field Theory using Photon Theory but all four polarizations of the photon and also agrees with particle physics it says you get the energy out of the vacuum the vacuum exists in time is not observable the virtual state does exist it&#x27;s just not observable so if you call three space observable or observable three space then the virtual State actually is a structure internal structure in time it&#x27;s okay if it&#x27;s energy up there it&#x27;s got a structure it&#x27;s got rates of flow it&#x27;s got density all that stuff it&#x27;s got differences in intensity which means a potential it&#x27;s got a direction it&#x27;s a Time Direction either into the charge or out of the charge now this however dramatically opens up things like physics and chemistry because in chemistry in the standard model they assume equilibrium the the standard U1 model assumes equilibrium you do not have these dise equilibriums they have not taken into account this fundamental thing we just talked about that every charge and every dipole already does now if I look at a set of experiments with this type of eye for example suppose you tell me that in one of these that I mix an acid and I mix a hydroxide and I get the neutralization the chemistry agrees with this the test show that but I don&#x27;t get the heat no exothermic reaction no exothermic reaction okay the problem then is the standard model in equilibrium says you will always get heat there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that standard model as long as that SpaceTime remains flat and as long as you didn&#x27;t have an interaction with a with the vacuum that is the time domain with the virtual State what you have just proved is that that assumption in the standard model no longer applies you have experimentally proved that you now have violated gone outside that model to a higher form of phenomenology and you have involved an interaction with a curve space time and with local uh activity of the vacuum you have involved the super system not the system the standard model kills the super system it only has one/ third of the of the components that are actually interacting now for most cases when equilibrium is recovered by a Decay very quickly that&#x27;s good enough when it does not Decay quick quickly but is stabilized that is not good enough and will not even describe the phenomenology so what you have further told me is that in the acid and the hydroxide I have some peculiar properties built in here wired in in the particular acid and hydroxide I&#x27;ve made that causes them to remain stable in a condition where they normally could not be stable in an equilibrium condition you have stabilized a disequilibrium condition very precisely and that means you have an a locked in action with curve SpaceTime and with a local vacuum you have a super system uh situation not a system situation you see the approach we&#x27;re coming from what looks to me like the approach we&#x27;re coming from is that the these conventional models in a sense are a subset of of a larger set that&#x27;s correct so what you&#x27;re doing you&#x27;re talking about graduating to a situation where you&#x27;re you&#x27;re enlarging you&#x27;re either having to create to discover the other subsets or you&#x27;re having to larger you&#x27;re having to enlarge the members of your existing subset that&#x27;s right and fortunately the models that will allow you to do this that will fit what you&#x27;re doing they do exist I&#x27;ll give you what the models are they are Sachs unified field theory that means he takes the vacum he his theory applies from everything from the the quarks and nucleon quarks inside the nucleon the gluons to the whole universe and everything in between quantum mechanics and everything he got it all and it&#x27;s engineerable baby it&#x27;s engineerable electromagnet magnetically but with a different kind of electromagnetics a higher symmetry electromagnetics there are several other kinds of electromagnetics that already cover a good part of that a good one is 03 electrodynamics which uh the alpha institutes uh the alpha foundation&#x27;s Institute for advanced study has been uh developing under the leadership of Dr myON Evans now we have over a 100 papers right now carried on a doe website it&#x27;s restricted to scientists because we didn&#x27;t want to argue with idiots that said you can&#x27;t ever have a new model you can&#x27;t have a high Symmetry electromagnetics and all that sort of thing but uh uh you know we can probably arrange with Dave Hamilton to get you guys access to that since you&#x27;re not interested in starting a big kurur dog fight you&#x27;re interested in what the content is another place you can look is su2 group symmetry electromagnetics now a leading exponent of that is Dr Barrett Barrett was one of the founders and movers and shakers behind the ultra wide Bend radar and Barrett handels higher symmetry electromagnetics quite well very well so there are models they were developed over in particle physics for situations where the Maxwell heavyside Theory the U1 stuff falls apart won&#x27;t work they were developed specifically to include higher symmetry phenomena not contained in U1 model that&#x27;s why they were developed but there&#x27;s been this tremendous resistance to correcting what&#x27;s taught in our schools in our universities instead we still teach all elect Engineers U1 we still teach all the chemists U1 and uh you know we meanwhile know we have better electromagnetic systems and more phenomenology available but the scientific Community is dominated by the large output of people uh trained only in U1 electrets so we got to argue with the whole scientific Community almost there&#x27;s only a small number of people are working around these pereral areas some particle physicist few guys over here some people pushing the electromagnetics out into higher symmetry uh situations you but they do exist I you to ask the question is the um resistance to examining these new model is the intellectual entropy um strictly intellectual is it because uh if you discover some of these systems and you actually create an applied science for it you can actually create enormous upheaval in existing industry with its enormous invest and equipment and Machinery I mean we see that with energy if there was someone who could actually on a large scale produce systems of free energy my God you you talk about the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in in the electrical infrastructure so I think it&#x27;s a really interesting kind of side sidebar to all of this is the fact that um the um they feed each other I think I think the actual entropy to to really get in and examining these other systems and enlarging our understanding enlarging the knowledge base comes from uh uh business considerations as much or more as intellectual ones oh of course and the scientific Community right now is very dominant dominated by you know who controls Sciences who controls their funding somebody got to pay the freight I&#x27;m speaking is one that doesn&#x27;t have a salary because I&#x27;m too big of a rebel the uh but somebody&#x27;s got to pay the freight okay how do you get the freight PID if you&#x27;re a professor at a university you have very little Freedom anymore contrary to popular opinion for one the state the uh University demands that you go out and get outside money because you know under the U uh overhead and Burden rate this the university is going to get at least half of it to help them cover their expenses so they&#x27;re very interested in you getting out outside money if you want to get your graduate students funded so you can have graduate students working on their doctorate and all and doing a good job you&#x27;ve got to get outside funding for that and for their projects</p>
