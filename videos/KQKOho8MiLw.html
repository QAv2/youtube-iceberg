            <p>at the top of this also adhere and I have it going around the top and this wire is what&#x27;s positively charged on the other side and then I have a negatively charged wire that&#x27;s going around to this end it just takes to the tinfoil skirt there so I this is positive and negatively charged difference in the basics of this is if I have all of this electricity going in just one spot you would see that what you saw there like a lightning bolt the arcing you literally can physically see the electrons jumping from the wire to the skirt that&#x27;s great you&#x27;re just not going to get me lift or do anything able to do much with that but if you could pull apart that that arc that lightning bolts all of those electrons stop them from flowing through in just one spot and very evenly distribute them across that total surface area you&#x27;re not going to see anything anymore from an electrical standpoint but you actually get a lift so you&#x27;re having all those electrons jumping for the one wire down to the tip ball skirt and you&#x27;re getting that lift just like in the diagram that was shown that the people ground effect and then thrust in that direction so what happens when you put a hundred thousand volts to it and you turned on she gets lift with no fans or motors or anything like that all I have here below it is just a straight string holding it down so this would continue to fly off the table so again one thing to read about it for years see some grainy pictures of what may look like if the UFO totally different things person and again that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what my main objective has been is to prove that yes all of this crap that you guys been reading about in the internet all these years is real it&#x27;s it really is possible no you&#x27;re not going to get educated in a university or even high school of course but you may see it at my daughter&#x27;s science fair [Applause]</p>
