            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is a channel for educational purposes and uh we look at theories of everything that have inspired me from the past and um we uh go deep into them and see how they can be used to help you out with your Paradigm shifting your Awakening to 5D Consciousness and your formation of a holistic worldview today is our 517th video on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and uh in 1959 Mr Larson um articulated his two fundamental postulates about how he believed the universe operated um the first postulate is the primary one where he says that the universe is composed entirely of motion not matter not energy but motion and that um the universe is composed entirely of motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so universe is made out of motion motion is a relationship between space and time and in particular he&#x27;s talking about a kind of motion that he calls scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but has no specific Direction you can Envision a scalar motion using a balloon that you put dots on if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction every dot will be moving away from every other dot um and that is the fundamental motion that is the uh source of all manifestation Larson calls that the progression and then that is really anti-gravity motion then the reverse of that motion is what he calls Gravity the inward motion of that balloon um surface of that balloon would be the gravity and um so then he goes from there takes a second postulate which is that the Universe um conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian and he plugs the postulates into those uh rules and arrives at a theoretical Universe How the Universe operates um what the universe looks like if it operates the way that he says it does and then he Compares his theoretical Universe with the measured empirical universe of the modern scientists um and he does that in books like the one we have in front of us today basic properties of matter uh which is primarily on chemistry and Larson arrives at equations for many of the basic properties of matter and then Compares uh what he&#x27;s got with uh the scientific tables and uh we are in chapter 25 of the this book uh getting close to the end uh chapter 25 is on radioactivity and I think we&#x27;re just going to get right into it uh we may or may not get to all the way to the end of this chapter here today okay um radioactivity uh taken from uh the middle of the chapter start uh if you want to get a deeper uh sense of the reciprocal system you want to watch one of my first 474 videos on this subject where I go into the postulates a little bit deeper and explain the ramifications and so on the discrete unit postulate and the three dimensions and the space and time reciprocity but for today I&#x27;m just going to uh assume that you have working knowledge okay in those those regions where the magnetic ionization level is zero or near zero all of the 117 possible elements are stable and there is no Alpha radioactivity the heavy element content of young matter is low because atom building is a cumulative process and this young matter has not had time to produce more than a relatively small number of the more complex atoms but probability consider ations make it inevitable that some atoms of the higher groups will be formed in the younger Aggregates particularly where older matter is dispersed into space by explosive processes um older matter dispersed into space by explosive processes has been accreted by these younger structures thus although Aggregates composed primarily of young matter have a much lower heavy element content than those uh composed of older matter they do contain an appreciable number of the very heavy elements including the trans Uranian elements that are absent from terrestrial matter the significance of this point will be explained in volume 3 if matter from a region of zero magnetic ionization is transferred to a region such as the surface of the Earth where the ionization level is Unity or above the stability limit in terms of the atomic number uh drops and radioactivity is in is initiated whether the material constituents of the earth acquired the unit magnetic ionization level at the time that the Earth assumed its present status as a planet or reached this level at some earlier or later date is not definitely indicated by the information now available there is some evidence suggest esting that this change took place in a considerably earlier era but in any event the situation with respect to the activity of the elements now undergoing Alpha radioactivity is essentially the same they originated in a region of zero or near zero magnetic ionization and either remained in that region while the magnetic ionization level increased or in some manner the nature of which is immaterial in the present connection ction were transferred to their present locations where they have become radioactive for the reason stated reason stated as noted above another source of natural radioactivity is atomic rearrangement resulting from interaction of material atoms with high energy particles principally the cosmic rays and their derivatives in such reactions stable isotopes of one kind or another are converted into unstable Isotopes and the latter um then become sources of radioactivity mostly of the beta type the level of beta radioactivity produced in this manner is quite low the very intense activity of the same general nature that is indicated by the radio and x-ray emission from certain kinds of astronomical objects originates by means of a different process examination of which will be deferred until the and behavior of the objects from which the uh emissions are observed are developed in volume 3 the processes that constitute natural radioactivity can be duplicated experimentally together with a great variety of similar Atomic Transformations which presumably also occur naturally under appropriate circumstances but have been observed only under experimental conditions we may therefore combine our consideration of natur natural beta radioactivity the so-called artificial radioactivity and the other experimentally induced Transformations into an examination of atomic transformations in general essentially these Transformations regardless of the number and type of atoms or particles involved are no different from the simple addition and Decay reactions previously discussed the most convenient way of describing these more Complex events is to treat them as successive processes in which the reacting particles first join in an addition reaction and subsequently eject one or more particles from the combination According to some of the theories currently in Vogue this is the way in which Transformations actually take place but for present purposes it is immaterial whether or not the symbolic representation conforms to physical reality and we will leave this question in a bance the formation of the isotope uh P30 phosphorus 30 from aluminum the first artificial radioactive reaction discovered may be represented as al27 plus H4 yields uh phosphorus 30 + N1 in this case the two phases of the reaction are independent in the sense that any combination which adds up to 30-1 can produce P30 + N1 while there are many ways in which the 31-1 resultant of the combination al27 plus H4 can be broken down the final product May for instance be uh SI 30 plus H1 plus H1 the usual method of conducting transformation experiments is to accelerate a small atomic or subatomic unit to a very high velocity and cause it to impinge on a Target in general the degree of fragmentation of the target atoms depends on the relative stability of those atoms and the kinetic energy of the incident particles for example if we use hydrogen atoms against an aluminum Target at a relatively low energy level we get results similar to those produced in the uh aluminum 27 plus helium 4 reaction previously discussed typical equations are al27 + H1 yields magnesium 24 plus H4 or aluminum 27 + H1 yields silicon 27 + N1 greater energies cause further fragmentation and result in such rearrangements as al27 + H1 yields sodium 24 + 3 H1 plus [Music] N1 um plus N1 the general principle that the degree of fragmentation is a function of the energy of the incident particles has an important bearing on the relative probability ities of various reactions at very high temperatures and we&#x27;ll have further Recon uh consideration later in the extreme situation where the target atom is heavy and inherently unstable the fragments may be relatively large in this case the process is known as fision the difference between the fision process and the transformation reactions previously described is merely a matter of degree and the same relation ships apply although it is possible in some instances to transform one stable isotope into another by an appropriate process the more general rule is that if orig the original reactants are stable the major product is unstable and therefore radioactive the reason is of course that the stable isotopes have vibrational to rotational Mass ratios within the stability Zone and any change in the ratio tends to move it out of that zone as an example the P30 isotope formed in the reaction between aluminum and helium atoms is below the stability Zone that is it is deficient in vibrational Mass it therefore decays um by the uh beta plus process um to form a stable silicon isotope P30 yields si3 it&#x27;s 30-0 yields 28-2 in the radioactive reactions of the heavy elements the products often have substantial extreme or sub substantial excesses of vibrational mass and in these cases successive beta emissions take place resulting in Decay chains in which the unstable Isotopes move step by step towards stability one of the relatively long change of chains of this type has been identified um as the following Xenon 140 uh then going to cesium 140 barium 140 lanum 140 and then U oh cesium 140 uh before that we had casium 140 so I think that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called um uh that&#x27;s like 10832 to 110 D30 to2 D28 to 114 d26 to 116 or 28 sorry um yeah okay um eventually getting to 11624 uh which is still below the stability Zone the figures in parentheses refer to the number of units of vibrational Mass corresponding to the center of the zone of stability um and that was 22 for the last one 116-24 as calculated for each element from equation 24-1 the original product Xenon 140 has 13 excess vibrational units and is thus far outside the stability Zone successive beta emissions convert two unit quantities of vibrational Mass to rotational Mass while the stable amount of vibrational Mass gradually increases as the atomic number Rises on reaching uh C 140 the excess has been reduced to two units this is within the stability margin and the radioactivity therefore ceases the foregoing description of the atomic transformation processes has been confined to the essential element of the transformation the redistribution of the primary mass and the collateral effects have either been ignored or left for later treatment in the latter category are the mass energy relations uh which will be discussed in chapter 27 the electric charges carried by some of the reacting substances or the reaction products have no significance in the present connection as they only affect the energy relations on first consideration it might appear that the addition processes discussed in the preceding Pages would provide the answer to the problem of accounting for the existence of the heavier members of the the series of chemical elements in current practice this is taken for granted and the question to be answered is accepted as being merely the issue as to what specific or uh what spec what specific one or more of these processes is operative the currently accepted hypothesis is that the raw material from which the elements are formed is hydrogen and that Mass is added to hydrogen by means of the addition processes it is recognized that with certain exceptions that will be considered later the addition mechanisms are high energy processes atoms approaching each other at low or moderate speeds normally rebound and take up positions at equilibrium distances the additions take place only where speeds are high enough to overcome the resistance and these speeds generally involve disruption of the structure of the target atoms followed by some recombination the only place now known in our galaxy where the energy concentration is at the level required for the operation for operation of these processes on a major scale is in the Interiors of the Stars the accepted hypothesis therefore is that the atom building takes place in the Solar Stellar interiors and that the products are subsequently scattered into the environment by Supernova explosions it has been demonstrated by laboratory experiments and more dramatically in the explosion of the hydrogen bomb that the mass 2 and mass 3 isotopes of hydrogen can be stimulated to combine into the mass 4 isotope of helium with the release of large quantities of energy this hydrogen conversion process is currently the most powerful source of energy known to science aside from some highly speculative ideas that involve carrying gravitational attraction to hypothetical extremes the attitude of the professional physicist has always been that the most energetic processes known to them must necessarily be the process by which energy is generated in the Stars even though they have had to revise their concept of the nature of this process twice already the last time under very embarrassing circumstances the current belief of both the physicist and the astronomers therefore is that the hydrogen conversion process is unquestionably the primary Stellar energy source it is further assumed that there are other additional addition processes operating in in the stars by which atom building beyond the helium level is accomplished it will be shown in volume three that there is a mass of astronomical EV evidence demonstrating conclusively that this hydrogen conversion process cannot be the means by which the Stellar energy is generated but even without this evidence that demolishes the currently accepted assumption any Critical examination of the fundamentals of atom building will make it clear that high energy processes inherently destructive are not the answer to the problem it is true that the formation of helium from isotopes of hydrogen proceeds in the right direction but the fact is that the increase in atomic mass that results from the hydrogen conversion reaction is an incidental Al effect of a process that operates toward a different end the primary objective of that process the objective that supplies the probability difference that powers the process is the conversion of unstable Isotopes into stable isotopes the fuel for the known hydrogen conversion process that of the hydrogen bomb and the experiments aimed at developing uh fusion power is a mixture of these unstable hydrogen Isotopes the operating principle is merely a matter of speeding up the conversion causing the reactants to do rapidly what they will do slowly of their own accord if not subjected to stimulation is freely asserted that this is the same process as that by which energy is generated in the stars and that the fusion experiments are designed to duplicate the Stellar conditions but the hydrogen in the stars is mainly in the form of stable Mass one isotope and there is no justification for assuming that this stable atomic structure can be induced to undergo the kind of a reaction to which the unstable Isotopes are subject by reason of their instability the mere fact that the conversion process process would be exothermic if it occurred does not necessarily mean that it will take place spontaneously the controlling factor is the relative probability not the energy balance and so far as we know the mass one isotope of hydrogen is just as probable a structure as the helium atom under any physical conditions other than those to be discussed in chapter 26 the next chapter that lead to atom building at high temperatures the chances of atomic breakup are improved but this does not necessarily increase the proportion of helium in the final product on the contrary as noted earlier a greater kinetic energy results in more fragmentation and it therefore favors the smaller unit rather than the larger a certain amount of recombination of the fragments produced under these high temperature conditions can be ex expected particularly where the extreme conditions are only temporary as in the explosion of the hydrogen bomb but the relative amounts of the various possible products of recombination are determined by probability considerations in as much as stable isotopes are formed are are in as much as stable isotopes are more probable than unstable isotop otop uh formation of the stable helium isotope from the atomic and subatomic fragments takes precedence over recombination of the UN unstable isotopes of hydrogen but the mass one hydrogen isotope that is the principal uh constituent of the stars is just as stable as helium and it has the advantage in a high energy environment of being the smaller unit which makes it less susceptible to fragmentation and more capable of recombination if disrupted thus it cannot be expected that recombination of fragments into helium under high energy conditions will occur on a large enough scale to constitute a major source of Stellar energy in this connection it should be noted that the general tendency of high energy reactions in the material sector of the universe is to break down existing structures rather than build larger ones the reason for this should be evident the material sector is the low speed sector and the lower the speed of matter the more pronounced its material character becomes that is the more it deviates from the speeds of the cosmic sector it follows that in general the lower the speed the greater the tendency to form combinations of the material type conversely higher speeds lessen the material character of the matter and not only inhibit further combination but tend to disrupt the combinations already existing furthermore this increase in the amount of negative displacement is not uh that&#x27;s thermal or trans ational motion is not conducive to building up positive displacement in the form of mass thus the net result of the reactions in the high-speed environment of the Stellar Interiors can be expected to decrease rather than increase the average atomic weight of the matter participating in these reactions an analogous process in a more familiar energy range is the pyrolysis of petroleum cracking of a paraffinic oil for instance yields products that among other things include substantial quantities of complex aromatic compounds for example one of those that makes its appearance is anthene a 24 atom molecule there are few if any of the Ring compounds even the smaller ones in the original material thus it is evident that the high temperatur of this process have not only broken down the original Hydro hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules or atoms but have also allowed some recombination into larger molecular units nevertheless the general result of the cracking process is a drastic reduction in the average size of the molecules the greater part of the mass being reduced to hydrogen methane and carbon the point that needs to be recognized is that this is what high energy processes do to combinations such as atoms regardless of whether those atoms are combinations of particles as contended by con conventional physics or combinations of different forms of motion as deduced from the postulates of the theory of the universe of motion such processes disrupt some or all of the original combinations the in chaot in the chaotic conditions generated by the application of powerful forces there is a certain amount of recombination going on alongside uh the disintegration this may result in the appearance of some new combination some new Isotopes which may suggest that atom building is occurring but in fact these constructive events are are merely incidental results of a destructive process in the universe of motion the raw material for atom building consists of massless particles the Decay products of cosmic rays conversion of these particles into simple atoms of matter and production of increasingly more massive atoms from the original units is a slow and gradual constructive process not a high energy destructive process this assertion as to the general character of the atom building process is confirmed by the astronomical evidence which as will be brought out in volume 3 shows that atom building is taking place throughout the Universe not merely at special locations and under special conditions as envisioned in present day theories the details of the atom build buing processes in the universe of motion will be the subject of the next chapter and so that is the end of this chapter 25 on radioactivity and uh chapter 26 is called Adam building and uh then we just have chapter 27 which is on mass and energy and that will be the end of this volume volume two uh when he refers to volume three there he&#x27;s talking about his volume on astronomy called the universe of motion and uh we will um not be getting into that right away maybe in the future it&#x27;s a little bit more advanced of a study um at least uh once you get into the after the first couple chapters um and there&#x27;s like 31 chapters and it&#x27;s um it&#x27;s more advanced in this uh here and this one&#x27;s already pretty Advanced so uh after we get done with this book we&#x27;re going to go into Larson&#x27;s theory of economics and read um maybe not read but at least summarize his work called uh the road to permanent prosperity and um then maybe get into some of Bruce Pet&#x27;s work on his rs2 Forum that he did before he passed away and uh then we&#x27;ll be moving on in two uh different subjects Quantum arithmetic synergetic geometry uh music studies music theory music history um and uh some ancient history going back to the first century um and uh the Romans and the Jews and so on okay um thank you for tuning in today stay tuned for tomorrow on chapter 26 Adam building and have a great day</p>
