            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Hello everybody and welcome to your foes around the world. It&#x27;s Christmas Eve. I hope you&#x27;re all ready for the big day tomorrow. So this video is about weaponized yesterday&#x27;s interview with Jack Valet. Now if you don&#x27;t know Jack Valet, he&#x27;s wrote many books over the years starting from 1969 which was the passport to Magonia.</p>
<p>Then the messages of deception which was 1979, dimensions which was 1988, the invisible college 1975 and the one that I&#x27;ve read which is the 2021 one which is trinity the best kept secret. That is a brilliant book. You all need to read that book and he&#x27;s wrote many more. He is up there him and Jnap on the same screen. That&#x27;s what you want.</p>
<p>That is what you want to be watching. And I really enjoyed this one. I didn&#x27;t enjoy the Joe Rogan interview with him for some reason. I don&#x27;t think Joe Rogan enjoyed interviewing him. I think he found him tough to interview.</p>
<p>But in this he says something that&#x27;s really interesting. We&#x27;re going to get straight into it now. So let&#x27;s crack on. Okay, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s human reality. He fortunately survived.</p>
<p>He escaped uh and uh he went on to be you know a prominent advisor to the go and prominent publisher in Paris. that&#x27;s, you know, that&#x27;s a real experience. Um, he was in a, he said that was a control system. Uh, but it could be open or closed depending on the conditions. He said, I think UFOs may be the same thing.</p>
<p>They may be open to some people under certain conditions that they control. They certainly have uh spoken to people who were confronted with entities that were open to discussion. Um there there are cases that I know uh where there were this happened in government facilities but nobody&#x27;s talking about that. So I suspect that that&#x27;s true based on the people I&#x27;ve met but uh they were not the people who are running the program so I cannot be completely sure but what they described to me is a very sophisticated process by which we may be able to interact with the entities. Those are not the entities that are described um at Trinity in in uh in you know in uh in in my book um uh with PA.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a brilliant book by the way. You need to read that book. So he&#x27;s going on here that we can reach out to these entities. is there&#x27;s a process where we can reach out to these entities and he goes on that these are our handlers and we&#x27;ve probably been given technology in exchange for something maybe to maybe certain people know what&#x27;s going on and there&#x27;s deals going on Harris uh they are not the entities that were uh caught in Brazil um that that are you know in that documentary um they are they may be the controllers they may be the higher level entity they if if what I&#x27;m told is true the communication with them is very sophisticated and it&#x27;s complex so there may be a group that I would respect that has access to that and this was from years ago by the I mean that report of of that that particular interaction was more than 20 years in a in in a lab somewhere in control conditions. If that&#x27;s true then uh there is a process ongoing where we may be able to acquire information at a very sophisticated level and that would be that could be a reason for stalling quote disclosure until there can be a a rational way that we&#x27;re not confronted with something so uh overpowering that it would destroy our culture.</p>
<p>And so would it destroy you to find out that we&#x27;re being controlled by some entities for some reason? They they they are basically they put us here. There&#x27;s some experiment going on. It might not be a bad experiment. They might just be letting us. We might eventually ascend to a level where we&#x27;re supposed to um communicate with these beings, stuff like that, but we might have to have it&#x27;s been forced for them to communicate to a certain bunch of people because we&#x27;re a bunch of morons and we like to blow things up and we like to hurt people and we like to hurt the planet and that&#x27;s probably them.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re probably not bothered about us hurting each other, but they&#x27;re probably more concerned about the fact that um we&#x27;re damaging the planet, but they don&#x27;t want to stop the experiment. So they might have thought right we need to reach out to some of these morons put them in charge of the rest of the morons and tell them that um we&#x27;ll give them technology to try and advance them a little bit which we&#x27;ll link I this ontological sh I don&#x27;t know what could shock me I&#x27;ve been down so many rabbit holes I don&#x27;t know what could shock me the only thing that could shock me is I think the only thing that would shock me is what the what the deep state and all that I&#x27;ve been doing with some of the humans on this planet I think and the children and stuff I think that would be ontological shock to some of the people. Um, but as as for us not being the apex predator and there&#x27;s us being there&#x27;s something bigger and better than us and would it would it be an ontological shock? not to the non-religious people don&#x27;t I think this is the it&#x27;s going to be religious people that have the onlogical shot &gt;&gt; society I mean we have enough to deal with with AI these days which is you know a foreign entity potentially um &gt;&gt; but so so you&#x27;re saying you&#x27;ve been made aware that there is a government project maybe it was 20 years ago that was able to establish direct communication with a nonhuman intelligent and that you believe this information to be true and that and that and and that this is a reality. This is what you understand to be true. Is that &gt;&gt; just George? Nap looks like Steven Arc in there, don&#x27;t he? &gt;&gt; Correct.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um I cannot tell. Yes. Yes. Uh it it&#x27;s factual. What I cannot tell is whether &gt;&gt; So he just said yes that&#x27;s factual.</p>
<p>So what he just said then 20 years ago there was communication with these and he just went yes that&#x27;s factual. He&#x27;s saying that&#x27;s 100% that&#x27;s real &gt;&gt; that the entity that was presented was a simulation of a real entity or whether it was the real entity. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Ah okay. Uh it &gt;&gt; so for people that might not have caught that, he&#x27;s saying we don&#x27;t know if what they communicated with was something like like a robot that we might send out there or it was the actual entity itself.</p>
<p>So me going up to him saying, &quot;Look, I&#x27;m a higher being than you or me sending a minion that I&#x27;ve created to go and do that for me, some synthetic robotic being or something like that.&quot; That&#x27;s interesting &gt;&gt; that the the the people I spoke to couldn&#x27;t probe it. uh to see if it was made of flesh or in metal or or or or something else. Okay. that the it was presented to them in a secure facility that I&#x27;ve never heard of anywhere else where there was structured interaction with it on a continuing basis by specialists from different areas. the the person I spoke to was an extreme, you know, specialist in in a particular discipline.</p>
<p>Uh and uh not not the casual observer. And so that could be that could be kind of one of the reasons we have to be careful or there&#x27;s a slow roll out of disclosure because you&#x27;re saying we might already have communication with some non forms of communication or ways to engineer communication at a sophisticated level. I don&#x27;t think the the entities from Trinity you know were obvious. So when he says at a sophisticated level is that like some high have we been given some technology that has allowed us to open up some communication to the higher entities is some of this technology for that reason so we are we being given technology from some of these beings so we can then get the truth from these entities maybe God right let&#x27;s just say it could be God the the creator these other beings have said we&#x27;ll give you this technology this will help you you know communicate and you&#x27;ll find out more about of who you are and where what you&#x27;re doing is in purpose. It he knows a lot.</p>
<p>He knows he knows a lot. Jack Valle and I think I think they are doing on that panel actually. I think they&#x27;ve all got something and I think they they&#x27;re well aware that it&#x27;s a slow disclosure plan that&#x27;s going on and I think they are sticking to that plan. I think it is going to be a 2034 2035 date and I think before then the world has to change massively. Maybe some sinister, I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Or AI is going to do something that&#x27;s um &gt;&gt; revolutionary that change things in a big way for people. &gt;&gt; Something has to change. &gt;&gt; They were not the controllers of the craft. the the witness was still alive, you know, uh we&#x27;ve become close friends with him, went inside as a kid, you know, I mean was a very curious, very smart kid who knew his as he says still today, I know my territory, you know, this is the the land from his family. He knows that ranch.</p>
<p>He knows the cattle. He knows where the water is. He knows everything about it. And uh you know when he was inside the rude thing that we actually have which and we disagree about what it is but I I think it&#x27;s something that the soldiers that the military brought and they forgot to take it back. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a sophisticated.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve tested it in the lab. That&#x27;s what we spent over $10,000 testing it in Valley Labs and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just perfectly normal gadget. It&#x27;s not mysterious at all. So, uh, it may have been there just for the convenience of the soldiers doing work at night or whatever, but I I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s part of the original of the original manufacturing equipment, you know, of whatever it was. Uh, the craft itself, we had very good description of it.</p>
<p>By the way, the the the shape and the the You know the look and feel as as people say in Silicon Valley is identical to the one in Soro and it&#x27;s identical to the one in Valencol. So we have three cases there. And what&#x27;s funny is when people uh were describing it in a newspaper and they they always hire an illustrator. &gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m going to share with that now. So that&#x27;s on Jeremy Carbell&#x27;s Weaponized with George Knap.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s called Jack Valet, the bizarre nature of UFOs. It will be in the description. But I want to know, drop a comment. What would cause ontological shock for you? It gets put around so much. Oh, it&#x27;s ontological shock.</p>
<p>People couldn&#x27;t handle it. People could what I I I struggle to think of what would cause onlogical shock for me. For me, it&#x27;d be something afterlife. something that when we maybe it&#x27;s this and we we go somewhere or we somehat horrible happens after life or it&#x27;s just a reincarnation maybe that&#x27; be a bit of a shock to my system but uh the stuff that&#x27;s going on now with the trafficking and stuff like that things that slowly being leaked out that&#x27;s going to cause ontological shock to people not necessarily to me because been researching that stuff it&#x27;s going to it&#x27;s going to cause a lot of onlogical shock to people when they find out the harm that&#x27;s been going on to a lot of human beings that will eventually come out and And we have Jack Valet now saying um it&#x27;s pro we have a a process where we can communicate with these beings and you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a process and that&#x27;s why we it&#x27;s a slow process going on it&#x27;s 70 years potentially this has been going on but he said what did he say 20 years so 20 years ago they managed to do a process from from some way to communicate with an entity there which they consider maybe our handlers. Depends.</p>
<p>Having handlers isn&#x27;t always a bad thing. It could be a good good handlers. Could be really bad handlers. The reason I&#x27;m concerned of the handlers is there&#x27;s a lot of weird horrible people that are doing hideous on this planet. And these handlers, let&#x27;s call it God, is allowing it.</p>
<p>Why are you allowing it? Are you sick? Are you are sick? Are you sick handlers as well? Maybe maybe the maybe the truth maybe we don&#x27;t want the truth. Maybe maybe maybe we&#x27;re we&#x27;re digging into something here we don&#x27;t really want to know the truth to. And Tukson said this. Tuk said he didn&#x27;t want to he didn&#x27;t want to know anymore. He&#x27;s not he knows enough.</p>
<p>He he went down a spiritual route saying that it&#x27;s he&#x27;s spiritual and he went angels demons and all that kind of stuff. And for me I want to know. I want to know. I think we should vote. And then we go into a room and they say, &quot;Right, this and people don&#x27;t want to know.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t have to know.&quot; Do that. Anyway, I hope you all have a good Christmas tomorrow. Merry Christmas. I hope you have a merry Christmas. Not happy holidays.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas. Um, I hope you all get all the presents, eat as much turkey, and have a nice drink and just spend time with your family. That&#x27;s the most important thing. This will be my last video now till after Christmas. So, I will see you when I&#x27;m much fatter and I will probably be hung over.</p>
<p>But I&#x27;ll be happy because I&#x27;ll be around the family and stuff like that. As always, keep your eyes to the skies because the next story could be yours. It could also be Santa Claus. Remember that Santa Claus is in the sky tonight. So, good night.</p>
<p>God bless. And I&#x27;ll see you on the next one.</p>
