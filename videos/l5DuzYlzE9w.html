            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel my name is Thomas and I do educational stuff here uh we are wrapping up our um reading of the final book of Dewey B Larson called beyond space and time and uh this book goes into metaphysics um religion psychology philosophy which was a departure from his earlier books which were all on um the hard sciences and Larson is the author of the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory of everything meaning that you can take the theory and you can apply it to any subject uh once you kind of understand how it works and and you have to use a good amount of induction and deductive reasoning um to kind of uh figure out how it all fits together um it&#x27;s not easy uh but uh the theory itself is something he came up with in the 20th century uh wrote down his uh first initial postulates uh to initial postulates uh in the 1950s and the basic idea is that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion uh and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are um really non-existent except as how they come together in motion their relationship is motion and so you need both of them uh to to get motion and they are related in like a fraction and they are reciprocally related meaning that you invert one to get the other and um so you know you have time over space or you could have space over time or you could have time as we&#x27;ll see time to the first power over space to the second power time to the second power over space to the first Power uh that is what you call uh impulse and uh so on now time and space both being multi-dimensional because we can recognize space as being um three or more dimensions and by the reciprocal postulate whatever qualities um adhere to one of the space and time also adhere to the other so time is also multi-dimensional in that same way and Larson calls that coordinate space and coordinate time but also uh time we recognize to be flowing or progressing um it&#x27;s always getting later and later and therefore two space also has that quality the flow of space it was recognized by the Hubble telescope as the recession of the distant galaxies space is always getting farther and farther away Larson calls this clock clock time and clock space and this is really like a scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but no particular direction there&#x27;s no uh you can Envision it as a bunch of dots that you put on a balloon with a magic marker you blow up that balloon and all the dots are moving away from each other that is an outward scalar motion the only Direction it has is out or in depending on your whether you&#x27;re blowing up the balloon or sucking in the balloon uh space and time are also only in discrete units meaning that they uh come in little chunks uh one unit at a time and um one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light now in Einstein&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe but for Larson the speed of light is the midpoint or the null point or even the origin of the universe meaning that half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls this the cosmic sector or sector two and half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light that&#x27;s the half that we&#x27;re familiar with that Larson calls sector one or the material sector the material sector Aggregates uh bonds with each other atoms bond with each other until they get to their most complicated level which is the DNA molecule containing a couple of billion of atoms and at that level the DNA molecule becomes eligible to be taken over or controlled by an entity from sector two a cosmic entity that when you put them both together Larson calls that the life unit life is a combination of a material and Cosmic unit in the right configuration in the right proportions and this life unit starts out as a single-celled organism and it grows and evolves and develops over time up to its most complex complex level which is for Larson the intelligent human being or humanoid and at that level the intelligent human being becomes eligible to be controlled overall by an entity from sector three and this sector 3 which other people would call God or the gods or the goddesses or the spirit world or the religious is [Music] um pointing at this actual speed of light the one over one relationship the one um but Larson calls it sector three and says that sector three is always good and it communicates with human beings in various ways uh through various channels such as ESP and intuition and Revelation and insight and those Communications are always correct uh but our ability as uh basically spiritual single-celled organisms is limited uh in being able to decode these messages decoding messages from sector three depending on the complexity requires a great deal of preparation and concentration and dedication and uh at this point in time in our spiritual Evolution we&#x27;re not quite there yet but we are getting there and that is what Larson says is really the purpose of this universe is to elevate us to uh this spiritual fluency where we are able to you know lock in on those messages that we get from sector three and utilize them properly now uh his final book beyond space and time it came out uh posthumously in 1995. um as you might guess is on this metaphysical subject on sector three that is the metaphysical beyond space and time independent of space and time this is referring to sector three and so we&#x27;re looking at the the last chapter here that&#x27;s called human Destiny and um we will uh back up a little bit uh but um okay we&#x27;ll start right here here comes uh quoting Larson uh he asserted categorically that it is not the natural body that is resurrected this is uh uh referring to uh Paul he asserted categorically that it is not the natural body that is resurrected but the spiritual body a body that as he said does not bear the image of the Earthly this is essentially the same conclusion that has emerged from our investigation so Larson is agreeing with the Apostle Paul uh the physical body is a piece of equipment that the human individual must possess in order to take part in life in the physical Universe just as he must possess a boat if he is to take part in Marine activities the point brought out in the last chapter is that the death of the human individual is like the sinking of the boat it terminates the particular kind of activities for which a special unit of equipment is required but it does not prevent the individual from being active in some other environment what we are now considering is the possibility that the deceased human individual may do something equivalent to buying a new boat so that he may resume the kind of activities that were interrupted by Death thus in the light of our new findings the usual objections that have been raised to the general concept of reincarnation are not are without Merit on the other hand there are adequate grounds for rejecting some of the specific beliefs of those who regard The Reincarnation process as a reality the idea that a person will return to a higher or lower station in life depending on the nature of his conduct during the previous existence cannot be entertained as there is nothing to indicate that any one human situation is superior to another from the sector 3 standpoint the further extension of this idea to include life as an animal is totally unacceptable as animals do not participate in sector 3 existence at all another belief widely held in the East that must be rejected is that whatever evil and suffering a person Encounters in his Earthly life are punishments for his misdeeds in his earlier incarnations as emphasized the evils of human life are phenomena of the physical sectors of existence as a whole and they do not survive death in any form there is no posthumous punishment the absence of any valid agreement argument valid argument against the reality of reincarnation does not prove that such a process exists our next undertaking therefore will be to examine the positive evidence in favor of its existence the strongest argument on the positive side is that reincarnation is the only plausible means thus far envisioned for completing the tasks the tasks that remained remains unfinished at the death of the human individual the human lifespan is far too short to enable accomplishing more than a small fraction of what is necessary in order to reach the ultimate goal and if existence as a whole actually has a logical and rational character that we have concluded we are justifying and attributing to it there must be some provision for continuing the process of which human life is an unfinished part biological evolution is faced with a similar problem here too no more than a small fraction of the total task can be accomplished within the lifetime of an individual organism but the biological sector is not concerned with individuals as such the task of biological evolution is to develop a highly complex type of organism from a simple life form without regard for the number of individuals taking part in the process or what happens to those individuals Evolution has therefore been able to compensate for the short individual lifespan by utilizing a long succession of lives of different individuals this expedient is not available where the objective is development of the individual some of the Eastern religions picture the ultimate fate of the human Spirit as a reabsorption back into the Divine Essence from which they contended it originated this appears to be a reflection of a general attitude toward life that is quite different from the usual Western viewpoint the Western religions take the stand that individual existence on the whole is a desirable thing and should be perpetuated these Eastern thinkers on the other hand regard individual existence in this world as a heavy burden from which release is desired whatever the respective merits of the conflicting appraisals of human life may be our findings indicate that the extinction of individuality according with a court in accordance with these Eastern doctrines would conflict with the underlying purpose of human existence the unfinished task must be carried to completion in some other way if we rule out completion by decree as being inconsistent with the orderly and law-abiding character of existence as we see it in Those portions of the hall that are accessible to Observation it follows that there must be a succession of existences of each non-physical individual either in the observed physical universe or in some other Universe of motion of change there are also some considerations of equity that have an important bearing on this situation some individuals are born into environments in which they have little chance of developing their ethical personalities to more than a minimum degree others are similarly limited by a short lifespan by disease or by physical infirmities it does not seem Equitable to hold these individuals to the same standards that apply to those who have not been subject to such handicaps but neither would it be Equitable to credit them with an accomplishment when in fact nothing has been accomplished Equitable treatment for all is undoubtedly part of the sector 3 code our intuitive knowledge of Elementary ethical principles assures us of this the far from ideal allocation of human happiness appears to conflict with this principle but we have found that happiness has no significance from the standpoint of existence in general whether one receives more or less of it is therefore immaterial from the long-range Viewpoint and consequently there is no real need for any Equalization in an afterlife Equitable treatment with respect to opportunity for ethical advancement on the other hand is vital and it would seem to be an essential part of the overall program a series of successive existences is the only adequate solution to this Equity problem that has yet been suggested if there are a considerable number of such existences the operation of probability will give each individual approximately the same average environment okay now keep in mind that Larson wrote this 30 or more years ago and uh you know there was kind of no distinction at that time between equity and equality the uh you know equality of opportunity or the equality of result and um that it&#x27;s in the reverse Equity as being the equality of re of result whereas equality being the equality uh quality of opportunity Larson is I believe in this paragraph really just talking about um equality but he uses the term equity um which you know is just a political sleight of hand that the uh crazy people that run this world uh have employed over the last a handful of years in order to get all kinds of uh very unfair things uh you know passed under their mantle okay now um back to Larson while the idea of reincarnation is anathema to much of the Western World the new light on this subject has been contributed by this present work should help to make it more palatable and again just remember uh Howard Larson talked about earlier in this chapter how in 553 A.D the uh writings on reincarnation were expunged from the Bible okay so it used to be part of the Christian Bible but it is not anymore for the last Almost 1500 years one of the that I think is the second Council on Constantinople one of the principal conceptual obstacles has been this strong commitment to the idea of the uniqueness of the individual that is characteristic of Western thinking hypothesis that two human ings who have been identified as different individuals may actually have been the same individual living at different times seems to undermine this uniqueness and to be more in harmony with Eastern concepts of collective existence this objection should however be minimized by our findings which now showed that reincarnation does not necessarily or even probably involve successive Earthly existences according to these findings the new life of the individual May emerge on another of the millions of earth-like planets in our physical universe that were discussed earlier or it may emerge in some entirely different Universe perhaps even of a totally different kind of universe this concept of successive lives in different and entirely separate places should not be so difficult to accept as a logical possibility except for a difference in the Viewpoint as to the objective to be accomplished the new a new stage of existence of this nature is not unlike the Purgatory to which a large segment of Western religious thought is already committed in fact some of the views of existence as a whole that have previously been formulated are remarkably similar to the conclusions of this work for instance GRS Mead tells us that some people regard quote the present Life as a stage leading to ever Superior states of existence either on other planets or in other conditions of Life higher than are possible on this Earth end quote back to Larson just where the Improvement of ethical conduct in Earthly Society together with corresponding advances in collateral areas fits into the general picture is not definitely indicated but it wouldn&#x27;t be logical to conclude that The Reincarnation process if it exists involves some kind of a mechanism whereby individuals are assigned to successively more advanced environments as their individual personalities Advanced toward the ultimate goal this is what is implied in the statement just quoted on the assumption that the ethical Improvement that is taking place on Earth is a reflection of a general Trend that is applicable to all life supporting planets it is possible that the succession of existences takes place on EX unsuccessively older and more advanced planets in the known physical Universe there will always be a range of planets of Ages from very young to very old as no planet is permanent and new ones are continually being formed even if the central star of a planetary system maintains the precarious balance between inflow and outflow of energy that is essential to continuation of biological life on its attended Planet the existence of the Galaxy of which that Central Star is apart is limited to a finite period of time thus the appropriate conditions for a succession of existences within the observed physical Universe are always present okay now uh a lot of that Larson gets into in his books on astronomy um which I have to say are based on of various assumptions that the prevailing views of astronomy are generally correct um okay that&#x27;s about it for today we&#x27;ll resume tomorrow and finish this book up</p>
