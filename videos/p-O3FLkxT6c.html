            <p>what we&#x27;re here to talk about today is the fact that the brain is and will be the 21st century battlescape in many ways end of story you will encounter some form of neurocognitive science that has been weaponized not only in your military career but in your personal and professional lives it is valid valuable and already an operational play the brain is the current and future battle space what&#x27;s new about this is the enclose nature of this increasingly we&#x27;re not seeing these things as Weapons of Mass Destruction against gross aspects of the population more specifically perhaps might be targeting individuals on a level that allows either direct attribution or coverted engagement with non-attribution if we talk about what brain science is let me just give you a little bit of brief background on this field it is now called Neuroscience as a titular field as a named field Neuroscience has only been in existence for 40 years I know that because I&#x27;ve been a neuroscientist for about 38 of those 40 years increasingly it is becoming an international Multinational Global and independently exercised event and Endeavor which increases the capability of the brain Sciences to develop not only new theories but ever more sophisticated tools so how then can we use these elements As Weapons means of contending against others formal definition of a weapon probably the one that you&#x27;ve heard about most recently most contempor in in the literature is the possibility to use some form of directed energy energy to affect physiology peripherally and also to affect the physiology and health of the brain case in point here US Embassy Personnel in Havana and possibly in China clearly one of the things we can also do is transcranial neuromodulation the idea of going through the skull to modulate the node network activity of the brain to implant certain brain machine interfaces these are many of the darer programs that you may hear of now probably the one that is most notorious is something called the N3 program which is the non-invasive Neurosurgical neuromodulation program being run by their program manager Dr Alami the idea here is to put minimal sized electrodes in a network within a brain through only minimal intervention to be able to read and right into the brain function in real time remotely and then of course you also have the things are a little bit more traditional if we talk about things that can be operable in the biochemical space we ordinarily talk about drugs bugs toxins and ever more we considering devices I can disrupt an individual from the level of their cell to their system and disrupt individuals on a variety of levels from individuals all the way up to the social fabric Target a specific individual change or eliminate that individual with very little attribution and Trace and be able to leave prior to any attribution drugs can be exceedingly specific and as I&#x27;ll show you in a moment can be very very much used to individualize weaponology in terms of what we call Precision pathology or Precision effect and by affecting the way that brain is built and the way it functions influence in ways that are kinetic and non-kinetic the the attitudes beliefs thoughts emotions activities look at the power that understanding tools techniques the brain Sciences afford we also see the use of biodata as a viable weapon manipulating biodata so that I can then put into your particular medical records subtle information that may change the disposition of whether you&#x27;re sick or not change how you&#x27;re treated influence the postures that go to you in terms of insurance care viability from military service by altering that information by changing those data by purloining those data I essentially change the U of you and I can do that in very subtle and Insidious ways furthermore I can do that on a variety of different levels that can affect key individuals so that in fact your medical record changes to thereby render you incapable or at least invalid to be able to serve in a way youve serving or I can do that on a much larger scale groups populations and if I change those data I change the way you&#x27;re being regarded and treated and I can do that in one of two ways I can do it in such a way that you&#x27;re going to be regarded in a negative sense or I can do that in such a way that I&#x27;m going to treat you incorrectly if I say for example you have a particular allergy or you have a particular disorder you will be treated for that and that could then harm your health and your stability in both a short Wars approach as well as a long Wars approach one of the newest developments is that nanoparticulate matter can be stabilized for distribution if you&#x27;re not aware what nanoparticulate matter is it&#x27;s that matter which exists on a scale scale of 1 * 10us 9th very very small smaller than a cell and we can manufacture materials that have discrete properties that can be controlled by virtue of bioengineering and their physical chemistry I can create small robotic units controllable robotic units at the Nano scale and that these two can be aerosolized to create a Nanos swarm of biop penetrable materials that you cannot see that can penetrate all but the most robust biochemical fil that are able to integrate themselves through a variety of membranes mucous membranes in wherever mouth nose ears eyes can be then uptaken into the vascular system to create clumping can affect the vascular system of the brain or can directly diffuse into the brain space and these can be weaponized and they can be done in such a level that their presence is almost impossible to detect and as such the attribution becomes exceedingly difficult to demonstrate we&#x27;ve come to the precarious position of opening the proverbial can of worms of if how in what ways to what extent and when these techniques and technologies will be used in weaponized intelligence and National Security agenda are civilian ethics even viable any longer and if we engage military ethics what military ethical principles will we engage</p>
