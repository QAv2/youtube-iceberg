            <p>Do oil companies really suppress free energy devices? Every few years, somebody claims that they&#x27;ve invented a free energy device that oil companies are suppressing. Here&#x27;s why physics disagree. The first law of thermodynamics says energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted. Free energy devices claim to output more energy than they consume. But that&#x27;s literally impossible.</p>
<p>If these devices worked, inventors would be billionaire. Military would use them. Every country would want energy independence. In over 200 years of trying, nobody has demonstrated a working free energy device. The US issues patents for impossible machines because they can&#x27;t test everything.</p>
<p>Want real solutions? You got to work with physics, not against it. Solar converts sunlight. Wind converts moving air. Nuclear converts mass. Oil converts chemical bonds.</p>
<p>All transform existing energy and creating energy from nothing. The conspiracy isn&#x27;t suppression. It&#x27;s the</p>
