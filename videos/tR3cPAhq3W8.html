            <p>  THE RISE PERSONNEL. BACK TO  YOU.  &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JANE. DEVELOPING  THIS MORNING, JACKSONVILLE  SHERIFF&#x27;S OFFICE TAKING STEPS  TO ADDRESS COMPUTER ISSUES  THAT ARE IMPACTING SOME OF ITS  SYSTEMS. WE ARE TOLD THOSE  ISSUES WILL NOT IMPACT YOU IF  YOU NEED TO CALL 9-1-1.</p>
<p>TO  REPORT A CRIME. VERY IMPORTANT  TO NOTE THERE. NEWS 4 JAX  REPORTER BRIANNA ANDREWS IS  LIVE THIS MORNING. BRIANNA,  THERE ARE SOME LESS NOTICEABLE  CHANGES, THOUGH, BECAUSE OF  WHAT&#x27;S HAPPENING.  &gt;&gt;MELANIE LAWSON: YEAH, WE&#x27;RE  HERE AT THE JAIL AND SOURCES  TELL NEWS FOR JAX TO DO SO IS  HAVING SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH  DISPATCH AND BOOKINGS.</p>
<p>NOW THE  SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY WAS FIRST  DETECTED ON FRIDAY AND THE  CITY SAYS IT QUICKLY DISABLED  THE ACCOUNT AT THE CENTER OF  THE ISSUE.  &gt;&gt; NEITHER THE CITY NOR THE  SHERIFF&#x27;S OFFICE IS CALLING  THIS A RANSOMWARE ATTACK.  WE&#x27;RE TOLD ACCESS IS LIMITED  WHILE CYBERSECURITY TEAMS  FINISH A DEEP DIVE THROUGH THE  SYSTEM. NOW BECAUSE OF THAT  PROCESS IS LIKE FILING ARREST,  REPORTS WILL TAKE A BIT  LONGER. BUT AGAIN, THIS IS NOT  IMPACTING CALLS TO 9-1-1,  ISSUES COME AS DUVAL COUNTY  VOTERS PREPARE TO PICK THE  NEXT SHERIFF.</p>

<p> &gt;&gt; WHAT HE SHOULD BURTON SAID,  I COULD NOT OFFER INSIGHT  WITHOUT HAVING THE SPECIFIC  DETAILS OF THIS CURRENT  SITUATION AT IS. SO  UNFORTUNATELY IN TODAY&#x27;S  WORLD, THESE ARE THE THREATS.  ORGANIZATIONS MUST BE READY TO  FACE. TONY COMING SAID THE  POWER OUTAGE AT THE  JACKSONVILLE SHERIFF&#x27;S OFFICE  EXPERIENCE TODAY IS REMINDER  OF THE NEED TO UPDATE IN  HARDIN. THE AGENCY&#x27;S COMPUTER  SYSTEMS.</p>
<p>WHEN CLARK SAID HE  SURPRISED SO HAS MORE FIRE  WALLS THAN ANY OTHER CITY  SYSTEM HAS SURPASSED FDLE  INSPECTIONS. BUT HE WAS  UNAWARE OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUE  TO GET. WATERS DID NOT COMMENT  ON THE MATTER NOW. WE ALSO  REACHED OUT TO THE FBI, THE  JACKSONVILLE CYBER SECURITY  TASK FORCE IS HELPING THE CITY  AS A FIGURE OUT THIS </p>
