            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this channel is about educational uh matters that are probably unknown uh things I think are important subjects but they have not been given any really public acknowledgment um usually you know things that are very far out on the fringes but um should be far more Central to our attention and uh today is the 158th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory system of theory uh Theory of Everything uh that was uh proposed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 started his work many many years before that way back in 1930 or so and uh wrote up his fundamental postulates in the 1950s and then started writing books um his uh postulates basically state that um we do not live in a universe of matter and we do not live in a universe of energy but we live in a universe of motion and motion is the most fundamental thing and um motion is the relationship between space and time space space and time are basically components of the two components of motion and everything is made out of them so space is normally thought of as really and time to normally thought of as the container of the universe but in Larson&#x27;s Vision uh space and time are the contents of the universe even though space and time do not exist independently they only exist together in motion motion is basically a fraction uh with time or space as the numerator and with space or time as the denominator and therefore space and time have a reciprocal relationship they are identical to one another except that they are um you know counterparts in that fraction that makes up motion now they both have multiple Dimensions um three or more Dimensions Accord their coordinate aspects we know space to have three or more Dimensions coordinate space x y z coordinates time also has that as um a natural outcome of the reciprocal system we know time to be progressing uh getting later and later always uh Larson calls that clock time and therefore there is also something that is called clock space clock space is uh whereas clock time is everything is always getting later and later with clock space everything is always getting farther and farther apart and this was observed by the Hubble telescope even before Larson&#x27;s um you know first findings uh back in the 1920s that all of the galaxies all the distant galaxies are moving away from each other this clock time and clock space is what Larson calls a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no particular direction or you could say all all directions uh and you can visualize this scalar motion by taking out a balloon and a magic marker and putting a bunch of dots on the balloon when you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other that is a scalar motion the mo the dots are moving away from each other but in no particular direction and um then also space and time also come in only discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time uh below that uh those entities uh do not exist um inside time we have space inside Space we have time one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is really the origin uh it&#x27;s really the no point or the reference point Larson calls that the progression of the natural reference system the universe is moving outward at the speed of light in all directions at all times um that&#x27;s that initial progression so this is a uh you know a reference point so when you make measurements normally we think of making measurements from a zero point you know how far out is this or how far is this from the zero reference point in Larson&#x27;s system we make our measurements from unit speed the speed of light is this faster than the speed of light or is this slower than the speed of light the part of the universe that is slower than the speed of light is called the material sector and this is what we&#x27;re familiar with and this is the universe that Einstein talks about when he says that the maximum speed of the universe is the speed of light that is true from the material sector standpoint but uh Einstein omitted the cosmic sector which is the half of the universe that&#x27;s actually moving faster than the speed of light and in this Cosmic universe which uh Larson did write a book on metaphysics and uh that Cosmic universe is featured a lot in the metaphysical book it references a lot of mental phenomena life phenomena and in this Cosmic Universe the speed of light is the slowest speed in the universe and even though the cosmic Universe seems to be quite mysterious it isn&#x27;t because it Bears a re perfect natural um generalized reciprocal relation with uh the material universe so whatever we know about the material Universe can be extrapolated to the cosmic universe and uh all we have to do is invert the roles of space and time or time and space so that&#x27;s kind of how it works uh we are in chapter seven of uh his book that&#x27;s called Nothing But motion it came out in 1979 it&#x27;s primarily about physics and uh we are in chapter seven which is called high speed motion now high speed motion uh generally refers to motions that are faster than the speed of light and uh he was just giving us a few uh he does a lot of his uh heavy lifting with um visualizations uh examples that he provides to help us um kind of go through the kind of thinking that we need to go through so that we can kind of understand how the reciprocal system works the reciprocal system is a system of theory meaning that you can uh apply it to any subject that you want if you understand the system it also means that um he basically states that the reciprocal system of theory is quite simple um it&#x27;s seems complicated because you have to unlearn some stuff but once you&#x27;ve unlearned the stuff the new stuff that you learn is actually quite a bit simpler than the stuff that you unlearned so you know the relativity Theory and the quantum mechanics that we generally um has generally uh you know excluded 98 of us um because it&#x27;s too complicated for y&#x27;all um you know Rubes out there and uh yeah just leave it to the guys in the white lab coats we understand what&#x27;s going on um that kind of stuff uh is way more complicated than the reciprocal system of theory uh but and the reciprocal system of theory is a replacement for that so but you&#x27;d have to unlearn the the stuff before you learn new stuff okay we&#x27;re gonna take over right here let Larson&#x27;s words take over uh here in the middle of chapter seven he was originally talking about uh discrepancies uh between the uh mathematical nature and the conceptual nature he&#x27;s saying that these uh exotic theories of Einstein and the quantum mechanists uh they provide answers that are mathematically correct but they are not conceptually correct and so we&#x27;ve used them as a Band-Aid okay they get the right answers but they don&#x27;t you know give us the fundamental pictures uh of what&#x27;s actually happening because they don&#x27;t uh provide us with any conceptual understanding of what&#x27;s going on and in fact people like Heisenberg have actually even said that there is no you know there is no conceptual thing going on you know just take it you know just sit down and take it you know this is how it this is these are the answers we&#x27;re coming up with don&#x27;t bother with what those uh equations mean just plug the equations in okay um so that this is where Larson is right now the significance of this kind of a discrepancy lies in the fact that when a theory makes certain assertions of a general nature if any one case can be found where these assertions are not valid this invalidates the generality of the assertions and thus invalidates the theory as a whole the inconsistency of this nature that we will consider here is what is known as the clock paradox it is frequently confused with the twin paradox in which one of a set of twins stays home while the other goes on a long journey at a very high speed according to the theory relativity time progresses more slowly for the traveling twin and he returns home still a young man while his brother has reached old age the clock Paradox which replaces the twins with two identical clocks is somewhat simpler as it evades the question as to the relation between clock registration and physical processes in the usual statement of the Paradox it is assumed that clock B is accelerated relative to another identical clock a and that subsequently after a period of time and a constant relative velocity the acceleration is reversed and the clocks return to their original locations according to the principles of special relativity clock B the moving clock has been running more slowly than clock a the stationary clock and hence the time interval registered by B is less than that registered by a but the special Theory also tells us that we cannot distinguish between the motion of clock B relative to clock a and the motion of clock a relative to clock B thus it is equally correct to say that a is the moving clock and B is the stationary clock um in which K in which case the interval registered by clock a is less than that registered by clock B each clock therefore registers both more and less than the other uh now that makes sense but he plugs in uh when I know this uh the analogy that I&#x27;m familiar with uh here is the uh train Paradox if you&#x27;re on a movie on a train um and you there&#x27;s another set of tracks right next to you in another train right next to you uh and one of them starts moving you can&#x27;t tell the difference you can&#x27;t tell if your train is moving or if the other train is moving and so I think that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s plugging in here with this clock Paradox is that with relativity um you can&#x27;t tell the difference between the moving clock and the stationary clock but at the same time it&#x27;s saying that one clock is moving faster than the other so that is a an absurdity a paradox and so that that doesn&#x27;t work okay back to Larson here we have a situation in which a straightforward application of the special relativity Theory leads to a conclusion that is manifestly absurd this Paradox which stands squarely in the way of any claim that relativity theory is conceptually valid has never been resolved except by means which contradict the basic assumptions of the relativity Theory itself Richard Schlegel brings this fact out very clearly in a discussion of the Paradox in his book time and the physical world quote acceptance of a preferred coordinate system is necessary um in order to resolve the contradiction he points out but quote such an assumption brings a profound modification to special relativity Theory for the Assumption contradicts the principle that between any two relatively Moving Systems the effects of the motion of motion are the same from either system to the other end quote g j wittrow summarizes the situation in this way quote The crucial argument of those who support Einstein in the clock Paradox controversy automatically undermines Einstein&#x27;s own position end quote the theory based primarily on the postulate that all motion is relative contains an internal contradiction which cannot be removed except by some argument relying on the assumption that some motion is not relative all the efforts that have been made by the professional relativists to explain away this Paradox depend directly or indirectly on abandoning the general applicability of the relativity principle and identifying the acceleration of clock b as something more than an acceleration relative to clock a molar for example tells us that the acceleration of clock B is quote relative to the fixed Stars end quote authors such as Tallman who speaks of the quote lack of symmetry between the treatment given to clock a which was at no time subjected to any force and that given to clock B which was subjected to forces when the relative motion of the clocks was changed are simply end quote are simply saying the same thing in a more roundabout way but if motion is purely relative as a special Theory contends then a force applied to clock B cannot produce anything more than a relative motion it cannot produce a kind of motion that does not exist and the effect on clock a must therefore be the same as that on clock B introduction of a preferred coordinate system such as that defined by the average position of the fixed Stars gets around this difficulty but only at the cost of destroying the foundations of the theory as the special theory is built on the postulate that no such preferred coordinate system exists the impossibility of resolving the contradiction inherent in the clock paradox by appeal to acceleration can be demonstrated in yet another way as the acceleration can be eliminated without altering the contradiction that constitutes the Paradox no exhaustive search has been made to ascertain whether this streamlined version which we may call this simplified clock Paradox has been given any consideration previously but at any rate it does not appear in the most accessible discussions of the subject this is quite surprising as it is rather a rather obvious way of tightening the Paradox to the point where there is little if any room for an attempt at evasion in this simplified clock Paradox we will merely assume that the two clocks are in uniform motion relative to one to each other the question as to how this motion originated does not enter into the situation perhaps they have always been in relative motion or if they were accelerated they may have been accelerated equally at any rate for purposes of the inquiry we are dealing only with the clocks in uniform relative motion but here again we encounter the same Paradox according to the relativity Theory each clock can be regarded either as stationary in which case it is the faster or as moving in which case it is the slower again each clock registers both more and less than the other there are those who claim that the Paradox has been resolved experimentally in the published report of one recent experiment bearing on the subject the flat assertion is made that quote these results provide an unambiguous empirical resolution of the famous clock Paradox end quote this claim is in itself a good illustration of the lack of precision and current thinking in this area as the clock Paradox is a logical contradiction it refers to a specific situation in which a strict application of the special theory of relativity results in absurdity obviously a logical inconsistency cannot be resolved by empirical means what the investigators have accomplished in this instance is simply to provide a further verification of some of the mathematical aspects of the theory which play no part in the clock paradox okay we&#x27;re going to leave it there for now take over tomorrow go back into the clock Paradox a little bit thanks for tuning in and have a great day</p>
