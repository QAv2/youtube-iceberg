            <p>There&#x27;s one thing in physical processes that change almost everything else. What we found is that you need thermal gradients because there&#x27;s one thing in physical processes that change almost everything else that&#x27;s temperature. You change temperature and all the kind of parameters change. Okay. So if you have a temperature spread, you are automatically doing thousands and thousands of experiments at the same time.</p>
<p>Okay? And what you could see is thermal vibration of the metal latis. You have a particular set of parameters that hits the sweet spot. The process takes place and instantaneously it stops working. But the next piece next to it is a little bit cooler and it gets heated to the right temperature and what it does it slides up until other parameters are out of capability and it slides back down. So it was a 6 mm segment of a 7 cm or 6 cm rod that was the active area and the temperature was right.</p>
