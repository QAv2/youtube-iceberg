            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel where we try to uh focus in on various theories of everything and go into uh deep Dives on them so you get the full picture and uh you can use these things in your own life uh make the Paradigm yours and apply them to new and N novel and and different uh questions that you have in your life uh that could also benefit others so um today is our 350th video on the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory that was first arrived at by dwey B Larson uh way back almost 100 years ago and uh uh he passed away in 1990 after 60 years or so working on his problems and um then uh a few people have picked up the mantle and have attempted to push forward the theory and move it into new areas Revis some of the uh Kinks and U one of them was Dr Bruce pet who also passed away back in 2020 but uh before that he did some great work in putting out what he called rs2 along with Dr kvk Neu and the rs2 is a re-evaluation of the reciprocal system so taking uh you know the high points and uh preserving them while uh some of the sticking points uh revising those all the while remaining in the spirit of Larson&#x27;s uh reciprocal system which is um the basic gist of the reciprocal system is that the universe is made not out of matter not out of energy not out of the fundamental forces the universe is made out of motion and is made out of a specific kind of motion called scalar motion which is a more generalized kind of motion than the normal vectorial motion of velocity that we know of where the has a direction a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction you can Envision this using a balloon with dots on it when you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other and uh but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific direction that is a scalar motion and you might say well that seems uh rather abstruse but uh this is actually a motion that was observed by the Hubble telescope as all of the distant galaxies are participating in this kind of motion they&#x27;re all moving away from each other um and as long as we don&#x27;t want to uh put ourselves in the position of being at the center of the universe uh that basically means that our galaxy is also participating in this galactic recession all of the galaxies are moving away from each other in no particular direction and the farther away we are the faster we are moving away from each other um and if you put that in the reverse also if you suck in the balloon rather than blow out the balloon all of the uh all the spots on the balloon are moving toward each other uh and that is analogous to gravitation um so gravitation is a motion a scalar motion like that as well so it is somewhat of a mystery why uh Legacy science hasn&#x27;t focused on this kind of a scaler motion as being more fundamental than it is but for whatever reason Larson has picked that up and uh so his uh first postulate says that the universe is composed entirely of um motion uh particularly scalar motion then it comes in three dimensions um and uh indiscrete units and with three with two reciprocal aspects space and time so basically motion is the relationship between space and time and uh that creates a generalized reciprocal relationship between space space and time space and time are not uh separate they only work together in motion and space and time being reciprocals of each other have the same qualities one of them is that they are three-dimensional uh we can easily see this with space uh generally XYZ cordinates um three dimensions of space but uh we don&#x27;t generally recognize three dimensions of time but that&#x27;s what Larson calls coordinate time and then um then there&#x27;s also the clock aspects that&#x27;s the scalar motion the clock is always getting later and later and later and later and uh that is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction the time is not getting later in any particular direction and then uh the counterpart to that would be clock space which is a concept we&#x27;re not as familiar with but this is basically that space is getting farther and farther and farther apart like the dots on an expanding balloon and like the distant galaxies so uh that is clock space all the the space is getting farther and farther and farther apart you can think of this as you know an expansion of space itself um and you know the Motions do not have a direction until you assign a reference point when you determine that one of those arbitrarily determine that one of the dots on the balloon is actually stationary when you make that um abstraction where you make that um arbitrary call that this one is stationary then all of a sudden the directions start to appear and you can uh determine the directions uh from one um from from that particular dot to all the other dots and that&#x27;s where you end up getting Concepts not only like um direction and motion but also force fields gravitational field also mag magnetic and electric Fields uh and then also space and time come in only discrete units u meaning that there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time and you have to have a full unit in order to have those things you can&#x27;t just get by with uh a fractional unit of space you have to have a full unit um and it turns out that the full unit is uh 4.56 * 10- 8 um M and um I think that&#x27;s like a 2 millionth of an inch or something like that um uh that that could be very wrong it&#x27;s 20 milth of a meter so um something like half a millionth of an inch and then um you also have uh the discrete unit of time uh which is much smaller which is 1.52 * 10- 16 seconds meaning that you can fit 6.5 76 quadrillion of them into 1 second so that&#x27;s a a quadrillion is a thousand trillion uh so it&#x27;s a million billion and it&#x27;s a billion million it&#x27;s a trillion thousand so it&#x27;s a big number uh anyway if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light and so the speed of light is what Larsa calls unit speed 1/ 1 equal 1 and this is the place this is the center point of this universe uh and it&#x27;s the what you call the zero point the natural uh the progression of the natural reference system or the natural reference point uh the null point the state of rest the origin The Ether and this is the place where time actually equal space as one um everywhere else there the ratio of time to space is is different could be 2: one could be two to 3: one or it could be 1:2 or it could be 1: 3 or 1: 4 but it&#x27;s always integers and uh that is the discrete unit postulate and um so basically motion is a fraction uh with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator um speed the most basic kind of motion that is space over time the car is going 10 miles per hour 10 miles of Space 1 hour of time energy uh that would be time over space took me one hour to push that thing half a mile 1 hour of space one hour of time sorry 1 hour of time in 1 half mile of space time over space energy acceleration I dropped the rock out out the window and it fell to the ground at 32 ft perss squared time space over time to the second power 32 fet of space in 1 second per second of time space over time squared acceleration and so on and so forth uh there many other things that we could get into but uh that is just a short discussion of the um how the the reciprocal system works uh and now we&#x27;re going to uh get into part two of reading this paper here from Dr Bruce pet called Quantum pi and this is the fifth uh paper in his series of uh tutorials on rs2 the reciprocal system 2 uh his re-evaluation of the reciprocal system and here he&#x27;s basically showing uh this discrete unit postulate in action and that um you know many of the things that are involved in this uh discrete units um they really when you break them down they are pixelated and they are RI rigid and continu and discontinuous but because the units are so small it looks smooth curvy and um therefore Pi looks like Pi 3.14159265 but uh really Pi actually equals 4 uh which is the ratio of um the perimeter of a square to the diameter of that square uh as opposed to Pi which is the um ratio of the circumference of a circle with the diameter of the circle so when you change from a uh a IR rational Pi uh for a circle to pial 4 you&#x27;re changing from a circle to a square and paret is saying that when you get right down to it at the smallest level uh you&#x27;re talking about squares and not circles and so we&#x27;re going to take over here at this point where he&#x27;s talking about pixels pixels are treated as a unit in the sense that a blue pixel will be all blue you cannot start with red on one side and end up with blue on the other side in the same pixel the entire pixel will always be the same color and intensity across its surface area this is analogous to larsson&#x27;s discrete unit postulate you can only change color after you exit one pixel and start another angled lines and curves drawn with pict pixels therefore appear Jagged if you look at them closely enough you know with a magnifying glass or microscope or whatever stair steps uh is this section the rectangles are what the computer actually displays in pixels to make the black line that is seen on the monitor it is Optical trickery and again I was also using the same anal the analogy of the cartoon just like that uh I guess that would be in time rather than in space where you are showing still photos or still pictures but you&#x27;re showing them in Rapid succession and so it appears as if there&#x27;s a continuous motion going on but if you slow down the motion you will see that it&#x27;s just one picture after another that are slightly different um and so that is the same kind of uh illusion um of the uh of the universe that the universe is moving so fast that it appears to be continuous but it is actually discreet consider the same situation in nature the observable measurable universe is also pixelated because of the reciprocal system uh because of the reciprocal systems discrete unit postulate and the absolute scaled orthogonal ukian projection it is a grid of Cubes we just call it quantized rather than pixelated now consider what happens if you try to draw a circle on a computer monitor that has a radius of one pixel you get a 2X 2 squar with a circumference of 8 units a diameter of 2 units and Pi the ratio of circumference to diameter is actually 8/ 2 = 4 not 3.15 9265 due to pixelation programmers that dealt with the early computer Graphics worked at pixel level and knew that the perimeter of a pixelated circle is 4times its diameter this had to be accounted for when a user tried to pick a location on a circle because it was approximated with a light pen you could select the pixel approximating the circle near where the mathematical Circle should be but seldom exactly on it uh now he he kind of goes through uh some a chart here which unfortunately didn&#x27;t really transpose to my computer the same way that it was appearing on the screen but uh you know it&#x27;s just uh showing that you know if you&#x27;re okay here we go take that unit Square representing a pixelated Circle and increase the radius to two or three you get a series of squares since the curvature of the real Circle uh real in quotes the curvature of the real circle is still too steep to clip any of the the corners as the diameter increases clipping occurs as indicated by the gray squares in uh radius equals 4 resulting in a decreasing ratio of circular to square area that appears um completely lost my place uh as the ratio increases as the diameter increases clipping occurs as indicated by the gray squares in radius equals 4 resulting in a descending ratio of circular to square area that approaches the accepted value for pi as the radius approaches Infinity so as your radius gets larger and larger and larger the values get closer and closer and closer to Pi never reaching it okay so the radius starts at four one at at a at a a diameter of of two um you know one Quantum square but as the uh radius increases the value of pi decreases from four down to an idealized level of Pi which is never realized uh you would only get to Pi if your radius was infinite infinite the clipped pixels are those that are entirely outside the circular area so as you get larger and larger you know the the the the circle um will there will be certain pixels you know if you have have a square uh and you know say you have a 10x 10 square you know you have 10 by 10 each uh the circle [Music] will eventually get to a point where there&#x27;s certain squares that are are completely outside of the circle and you can clip those off and that&#x27;s how the value of pi will start to decrease and he has a chart um explaining that let&#x27;s see here um the clip the clipped pixels are those that are entirely outside the circular area but note that the radial to square area changes with radius the perimeter does not not even if when following the jagged path around the clipped boxes the perimeter is always um 6 r or 2 pi r where pi equal 4 uh pixel square area so uh this is just his chart you know showing how uh eventually these things start to approach approach Pi if you&#x27;ve got it looks like if you have a 10x1 grid then Pi is still 3.64 and if you got 12 by 12 you&#x27;re down to well I don&#x27;t know it looks like it&#x27;s going up actually uh if you got a 14 by 14 grade you&#x27;re 3.51 uh 16 16 by 16 is 3.50 and uh so on and so forth So eventually once you get uh up to 300 you are down to 3.15 154 so you&#x27;re getting pretty close and by the time you&#x27;re up to a radius of 500 you&#x27;re down to 3149 so you&#x27;re getting closer and closer but you would have to get all the way up to INF infinite before you got down to uh 3.14159265 uh with a radius of uh a um a th000 with a diameter of a th000 you&#x27;re at 3. 45544 okay it is this knowledge of pixelated or discret circles that provides a reciprocal system understanding of Miles Ma&#x27;s pial 4 concept by assuming that the smallest quantity is a single discrete unit rather than the smallest Quant approaching nothing uh limit of zero you are quantizing the system into a square pixelated components where there is no such thing as a curve only an approximation of a curve made with uh stair stepped lines of a fixed unit sized width but if that width is uh very very small it can very closely approximate a curve that stair stepping or you know jagged lines um like a stair you know um that stair stepping adds the extra distance to the perimeter to bring it up to 4.0 bring Pi up to 4.0 so there are actually three different concepts for this ratio as we we refer to as Pi the analog which is circumference over diameter 3.14159 in all cases this is called uh by paret the yin aspect this is the mathematical value that only exists in mathematics not in nature then we have the quantize perimeter uh over diameter equals 4. in all cases this is the Yang aspect due to the discrete unit smallest quantity of one this is the value found in the three-dimensional spatial coordinate system of nature so in coordinate space and then the transitional area over radius squar um is from 4 down to limiting to 31459 as radius uh goes to infin Infinity this is a range of values dependent upon radius but note that in nature all quantities are finite there are no Infinities hence the mathematical value for pi can never be reached since the radius or area will always be limited okay I think we&#x27;re going to stop it right there and uh get ready to start up uh and I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re going to get through this paper tomorrow but yes I believe we will and uh so we&#x27;re going to uh stop it right here and uh we&#x27;ll be back with the third installment of this paper tomorrow uh so just hang in there if uh if you don&#x27;t get it uh that&#x27;s how you study the reciprocal system basically is you suspend disbelief and you just let it wash over you and then you uh scrutinize the ideas uh over time um but if you come to it with a nay&#x27;s attitude that oh I&#x27;m going to just pick holes in this uh you know then it&#x27;s probably not for you in the first place uh because you need to have a more open mind to uh you know Embrace new ideas that are unfamiliar and uh that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to do here so um you know I&#x27;m reading these I read some of these articles multiple times and I&#x27;m still confused by some of them so um but I feel like I&#x27;m making great progress with the reciprocal system I understand it a hell of a lot better than I did uh 12 months ago and I&#x27;ve been studying it for 20 years so I&#x27;m still making great progress now I was I came from a very low place you know I&#x27;m a I&#x27;m a liberal arts guy so I mean I&#x27;m good at math but I&#x27;m um not trained in any of these subjects other than like high school I mean I took uh I took astronomy in college I guess I did take three semesters of calculus but I never learned anything when I took those and um I uh I took I think I did take a college Physics course but you know basically I&#x27;m a liberal arts person I&#x27;m a history guy so uh actually that probably worked my benefit because uh science people seem to be about the last people that will um let go of their Paradigm of and and try to embrace new ideas they&#x27;re so committed to their old ideas that they don&#x27;t have an open mind about uh finding anything new but if you look at the history of science you&#x27;ll recognize that every last one of the major Innovations in science has come from Outsiders to the field the only major revolutions come from Outsiders you know the inside iders can provide you with um you know little Innovations but the Revolutionary changes come from Outsiders and so uh that is a um my advice from a science from a historian to a scientist is that if you want to make a revolutionary change uh you better start looking outside your field okay uh thanks for tuning in today and uh I hope to see you tomorrow have a great</p>
