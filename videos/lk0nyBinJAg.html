            <p>the energy flow in electric circuits and in general in physics is very interesting much of physics including all of electromagnetics was already established before we had even the idea that energy flowed through space this was simultaneously done by pointing and also by heavy side in the late 1880s and the notion was extremely novel at the time that energy actually could flow through the vacuum or through space today of course we use that as a matter of fact what is not so commonly known is that the application of tracking the energy flow in an electric circuit has never been very well done at all in physics you will find that most of electromagnetic textbooks when they get to that point How does the energy flow in the circuit they actually</p>
