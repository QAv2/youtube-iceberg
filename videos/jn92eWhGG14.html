            <p>big thank you to nebula for sponsoring this [Music] video Utah 1869 Promontory Summit located in the Great Plains almost 70 M from Salt Lake City it is the site of a moment in history the last Spike in the first transcontinental Railway is being hammered at there is Media abound Railway Baron Leland Stanford has the honor of hammering in that final Spike the moment he swings that hammer a message is sent out across the telegraph Network done except he misses his swing doesn&#x27;t matter though the spike is for show a hole had already been dug and the spike was placed into it beforehand it&#x27;s also not even full gold it was iron painted with gold and besides right after the the famous photograph was taken they would remove it and put a regular one in after people would just steal it otherwise the golden spike is a symbol of the completion of a Monumental task the meeting of two industrial Titans whose work cost millions and produced an engineering Marvel that connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans with one final leg a celebration of rival companies and the backbreaking labor of thousands of immigrants it&#x27;s the moment that made it into the the history books because it made for one hell of a photo 120 years later and just 64 m to the southeast a new golden spike ceremony is playing out once again but instead of the Great Plains we&#x27;re at the Salt Lake City airport in a FedEx office there is a camera crew here they&#x27;re filming a grad student Marvin Hawkins and he&#x27;s clutching an envelope inside it is the most important paper of his career he&#x27;s waiting for someone who will never show up they had an agreement that they would submit their papers at the same time back to back a show of good faith Marvin doesn&#x27;t realize it yet but he&#x27;s just an unfortunate Pawn about to be trampled in a much larger dispute in about a month he&#x27;d be fired just months away from getting his PhD the people he&#x27;s waiting for right now had no interest in playing pretend nice for the media this was war now this was more than a potential Nobel Prize their Discovery was the solution to the world&#x27;s energy crisis the key to eliminate the world&#x27;s dependence on oil the resource that was slowly killing the planet just days ago Exxon Valdes had caused the largest oil spill in history off the coast of Alaska the timing was almost prophetic today is Good Friday salvation was here and it had been discovered in Utah it was time to spread the good word [Music] Utah is not exactly the first place you think of when you hear about a scientific breakthrough let&#x27;s be honest here your mind almost certainly went to the Church of Latter-day Saints the state was founded by the controversial religious group where they searched for a promised land to make their own and they fought with the federal government for decades before they were eventually accepted into the Union notably only after the church publicly disavowed their former tradition of polygamy and throughout the 20th century you Utah as a state craved legitimacy in the eyes of the rest of the nation the state spent years building up their image as something more than just the home of the Mormons their national parks and ski resorts attract millions of tourists each year now iconic films have made their Premiere there at Sundance they lobbied for almost 20 years to host the eventual 2002 Winter Olympics but for every success there would be a Utah story making national news for all the wrong reasons in the 1980s there were the deadly salt Lake City bombings of Mark Hoffman another was a shootout with police involving an illegal family of polygamists the issue was summed up by a local political pundit if you ask a lot of people in Utah what they fear it&#x27;s that everyone is going to laugh at us we want money and we want respect we would very much like to be respected not as Nevada is for gambling or Wyoming for coal but for brains and for talent despite its perception as a bit of an intellectual Backwater in the 9s Utah had the second highest rate of high school graduates that went on to higher education it&#x27;s home to plenty of great schools with the top two locked in in Eternal rivalry with each other Brigham Young University located in Provo is owned and operated by the Mormon church and it enforces a Draconian and regressive Honor Code but it has a good reputation in the field of engineering and nursing and then there was BYU&#x27;s longtime football adversary the top school in the state the University of Utah or the you for short an all-around good Research Institute its genetics program was respected all across the country and it was also the birthplace of the now iconic Utah teapot The Benchmark of 3D modeling and its chemistry Department was no slouch either ranked within the top 20 in the country one Utah resident wanted to improve those rankings and he was going to do everything he could to earn his State the respect he felt it deserved even if it cost him his job Chase Peterson like most most people from the state was a Mormon although he was not a fanatical one he had spent most of his early career out east and got a medical degree from Harvard and eventually became the dean of admissions but his home state beckoned to him and he eventually returned becoming the president of the University of Utah in 1983 his time out east had taught him how to rub elbows with the wealthy and attract donors skills he would desperately need as U of you was facing a period of steep decline State education budgets were being slashed each year as Utah&#x27;s whole economy slowed and that meant that Peterson had to cut his school&#x27;s budget eight times in just as many years if he wanted money he either had to convince the government he deserved it or he had to make friends in the private sector and the way you go about that is by making headlines back in 1972 a u ofu chemist announced that he had invented the first ever x-ray laser after much excitement no other labs could reproduce it and it became jokingly known as the Utah effect what Peterson needed was another one of those but real this time his first real time in the National Spotlight was When U of you doctors implanted the first ever artificial heart into a man named Barney Clark Clark had long suffered from severe heart problems and was going to die without medical intervention it was a groundbreaking surgery and 70 reporters came from all over the globe to cover it it was an intense 6-hour procedure and Clark had severe complications including seizures and breathing problems unfortunately he died in hospital 112 Days Later although clearly a step forward it was not a success Clark was intended to live much longer the Utah effect had struck again but despite the failure Chase Peterson&#x27;s handling of the announcement was positively received he was a calm voice of reason who had a clear handle on sharing complex topics with the world and he had high Ambitions his name was floated in political circles potentially as a Democratic candidate for Senate one more solid announcement and you could maybe think about planning his next moves it was just a matter of time until someone at the U came up with a real breakthrough and that moment came in late 1988 Peterson learned of this project through bits and pieces it was apparently highly confidential even a whisper of it getting to the wrong person could jeopardize it it was something supposedly world changing two professors in the chemistry Department have been working on something for years in secret the administration first got wind of it when they submitted a funding proposal to the dean of science Hugo Rossi Rossi had read it but the implications didn&#x27;t click until he woke up in the middle of the night the first thing he did the next morning was call the scientist and ask quite bluntly are you building a bomb and the answer he got was quote well I suppose you could put it that way it was not in fact a bomb but Washington would soon be paying close attention anyway the lab in which this discovery had taken taking place had been working 24/7 for almost the past month desperate to get as much data as possible before the announcement now Peterson was having secret trustee meetings where everything was locked down leaks would be devastating no one was allowed to use the actual words to describe the Breakthrough it was referred to Simply as the F-word although secrecy was of the utmost importance Peterson was rumored to have spoken to the governor of Utah in late 1998 and told him that his school May soon win a Nobel Prize on March 13th 1989 the school filed its first patent the first of several by March 16th Peterson called an emergency meeting with all their lawyers and The two scientists Peterson and the lawyers were in agreement the time was now if they waited any longer it would jeopardize the patent applications The two scientists however are reluctant but after a long argument they are slowly swayed they realize the gravity of the situation years later Peterson will argue that if they had stood their ground he wouldn&#x27;t have forced them to hold the press conference and yet the recollection of another attendee was that one of the two scientists was on the verge of tears whatever the case the decision had been made the press conference was scheduled for 1:00 p.m. Mountain Time March 23rd 1989 the media was given just a single day advance warning campus security is deployed around the chemistry Department locking down access to the basement lab where all of this had started the room is packed TV Crews capture the whole thing which will last for a little over half an hour this is a moment in history first let&#x27;s get the news of that scientific breakthrough at the University of Utah Brian it&#x27;s a late story thanks very much caroly Keith good afternoon everyone in about an hour researchers at the University of Utah are scheduled to make an announcement that they revolutionize the way we energize our world Chase Peterson and his VP James broy welcomed the journalists to the talk Peterson knowing full well his words we broadcast across the country make sure that everyone knows this discovery happened at his school this University Prides itself whether it be in creative writing or dance or chemistry or genetics or artificial organs in a long tradition of intellectual Freedom intellectual excitement and a willingness to try new ways to solve old problems those minds and that knowledge are then dedicated to the benefit of the people of the world generally and to the cultural and economic well-being of the state of Utah specifically next the mic is handed over to our first protagonist Stanley ponds well first of all let me thank uh Dr Peterson Dr broy for the the kind of introduction and further for their strong encouragement and support throughout this entire project the experiment we have accomplished has been described in the news release which you have and I&#x27;ll just uh give you a brief synopsis and that it is basically we&#x27;ve established a sustained nuclear fusion reaction by means by means which are considerably simpler uh than conventional techniques uh duum which is a component of heavy water is driven into a metal rod similar exactly like uh the one that have in my hand here under uh to such an extent that Fusion between the these components uh these deuterons uh in heavy water are fused to form a single uh a new atom and with this process there is a considerable release of energy and we&#x27;ve demonstrated that this could be sustained on its own uh in other words much more energy is coming out than we&#x27;re putting in that was a lot of words but the most important ones were these quote sustained nuclear fusion reaction and considerably simpler than conventional techniques and then finally much more energy is coming out than we&#x27;re putting in pawns then turns to his partner Martin fleshman and asks him if he wants to add anything and uh he has really described the experiment it is very simple you drive the deuterons into the lattice you compress the dutron in the Lattis and under those circumstances we have found conditions where Fus takes place and can be sustained indefinitely now indefinitely is an emotive word we have run experiments for hundreds of hours and an hour time scale that is a pretty long time again there&#x27;s that phrase quote very simple following this Pon explains why they think this can only be Fusion well first of all the heat that we then measure can only be accounted for by uh nuclear reactions the the heat is so intense that it cannot be explained by any chemical process that that is known they have some additional evidence too uh the other evidence is of course that we have direct measurements of neutrons by measuring the uh gamma radiation which builds up in a tank where one of these cells is under operation we can measure have a gamma R Spectrum uh in addition there is a buildup of trium uh in the uh in the cell which we measure with a cellation counter radiation again a clear sign that this is a nuclear effect I would think that it would be reasonable within a short number of years to build a a fully operational uh device that could drive produce electric power or to drive a steam generator fleshman quite clearly explains that for every one watt they put in they get four Watts out we have run uh uh cells now in excess of generating in excess of 20 watts per cubic cm in terms of percentages that&#x27;s 300% excess Heat this is astounding if I might just add it is clear it has been clear for three or four decades that the promise of virtually unlimited radiation free uh energy is something that is worth spending perhaps billions of dollars on um we would also like it to come to the to the benefit of the economy of Utah that&#x27;s not always easy to guarantee because ideas aren&#x27;t contained by borders but perhaps ownership are the conference has one very brief mention that a peer-reviewed paper has been submitted it has not yet been published if you were only paying attention to the tone of their voices you might think that this was something as mundane as the renaming of a campus Building not the unveiling of a world changing technology rumors leading up to the conference said that any number of prominent politicians would personally attend including the president the vice president or UK prime minister although none of these were true but the existence of such rumors conveyed just how Monumental this announcement was one politician did make a small appearance the Utah Governor had sent in a written statement to be read as a devout Mormon he linked the discovery with the famous words of Brigham Young this is the place miracles happen in Utah it is here where mythology is born this was a rags to Rich&#x27;s story this was the UN University of Utah it wasn&#x27;t some Elite East Coast University this wasn&#x27;t MIT this wasn&#x27;t Harvard this was two relatively unknown guys from Utah that had just upended physics two Pioneers who boldly went against the scientific Paradigm gambling on a risky idea that never should have worked Stan and I thought this experiment was so stupid that we financed it ourselves and I think it would be fair to say that we have burnt up about $100,000 in the process so it&#x27;s not that cheap and this is just a kitchen experiment so if you scale it up we could burn up a few million dollars fairly quickly too Stanley ponds and Martin fleschman are not remembered in the most positive light today for reasons you&#x27;ll soon come to understand but one trap their critics sometimes fall into is underplaying their achievements prior to March 23rd 1989 I think it&#x27;s important to make clear that among their peers pawns and flashmen were well respected and productive scientists that&#x27;s what makes their Fall From Grace all the more tragic one thing that comes across even in just these short clips is that Stan pwns is not very comfortable speaking in front of crowds he stumbles over some of his words and trails off at the end of sentences fleshman is much more confident and his jokes get laughs from the audience multiple times uh the rubber made Basin is for uh uh lecture presentations because we want to uh have the punchline that we paid for it ourselves and we couldn&#x27;t actually pay for very much basically this has been described as a kitchen type experiment how do you feel knowing that you can do in a kitchen what other researchers can do a half a million dollars large SCI it&#x27;s a pretty big kitchen that confidence comes from experience there&#x27;s a bit of an age gap between the two men fleshman is 61 here and pwns is just 46 and while pwns has a solid resume fleshman&#x27;s is extensive born in Czechoslovakia he grew up in the UK and made a name for himself there as a prominent electrochemist electrochemistry is a particular Niche that&#x27;s fairly simple to explain they study electricity that induces chemical reactions or chemical reactions that generate electricity he was known for his invention of a type of calorimeter a device used to measure heat with great precision and he also did some pioneering work with the defraction of x raay in 1986 he was inducted into the UK&#x27;s Royal Society which is essentially a Lifetime Achievement Award in science placing him among the great such as Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday he was quote more Innovative than any other electrochemist in the world and Marvin Hawkins the PHD student once said of him you meet fleshman and you&#x27;re going wow if I can spend just a month with this guy I&#x27;ll be a god myself fleshman&#x27;s Renown as an elder Statesman was no doubt a major contrib rbor to why so many people took the announcement seriously he would not simply rush out to make a bold claim without plenty of evidence to back it up Stanley pwns was much more of an unknown he had taken a more Meandering route in his career born in North Carolina he quit Academia for 10 years to work for the family business before eventually returning to get his PhD in 1975 and he earned it at Southampton which is where fleschman became his mentor and eventually his friend after hopping around a bit he landed him self a professorship at the University of Utah he wasn&#x27;t a Mormon but U ofu wasn&#x27;t as strict as they are over at BYU over the course of the 1980s he began publishing more and more papers every year in 1988 he published a staggering 36 papers he even ran his own company selling homemade lab equipment out of his house a true worker be his peers called him U ofu must have been impressed because they made him chair of the chemistry Department in 1988 his grad students knew him to be an introvert uncomfortable with giving presentations especially in front of large audiences but they also spoke highly of him he was humble generous and a good friend once you got to know him it&#x27;s hard to get a feel for what kind of person you are when you see someone on TV a few minutes he&#x27;s a very um intensive person family and science takes up 97% of his time oh God Stan Pond is also very private in his world family and science mix and little else centers the picture despite their age Gap the two were genuinely close friends who loveed to ski cook hike and throw parties together I&#x27;ve heard some people describe both of you as The Odd Couple of fusion uh he seems to be more outgoing you&#x27;re so private yeah do that fit I think so I think so by the mid 1980s fleshman was effectively retired but he had set up an arrangement where he&#x27;d split his time between his labs in the UK and visiting ponds at ufu as a visiting researcher the Duo&#x27;s Dynamic was very obvious fleshman was the ideas man and pawns was the one who tested the ideas out before this historic day they had published close to 30 papers together fleshman who&#x27;s based in England has spent four months each year at the University on the project in between both men rack up $400 a month phone bills Chase Peterson told a CBS reporter later that day that this research may win pawns and flan a Nobel Prize although they never actually say these words in the announcement the world will come to know it as cold fusion even if you have no idea what it means you very likely heard those two iconic words before Marvin Hawkins the group&#x27;s PhD student recalls fleshman telling him that everything was going to change after that day for the better or for the worse he didn&#x27;t specify but Hawkins realized soon that it was going to be for the worse this press conference should never have happened pwns and fleshman had wanted an extra 18 months before going public look pressure outside their control had forced their hand there had been a leak and so against their better judgment they gave a press conference that doomed their careers and forever tarnished their reputations it would be [Music] they when it comes to Nuclear Physics there are actually two fword fishing you&#x27;ve definitely heard of splitting the atom massive nucleus breaks apart into two releasing a massive amount of energy so much energy it could start a chain reaction leading to an explosion so immense it could flatten a city in an instant nuclear fishing changed the course of the 20th century but its sibling Fusion is even more powerful the joining of atoms when we divide by the amount of mass used for fuel Fusion beats out fishing by a factor of four all of the atoms around you are made up of protons and neutrons bundles of particles protons with a positive charge and neutrons with none the smallest possible nucleus is that of hydrogen with just one solitary proton if you were to take another atom of hydrogen and slowly push them closer and closer together you would find yourself at war with an immense Force the electromagnetic force repels positive charges away from each other the closer they get together the harder it pushes back but there is a barrier you can surpass if you were to supply enough Force enough heat enough pressure you can get the protons close enough together and a new Force dominates the strong nuclear force at small enough scales it overpowers the electromagnetic force and the two protons fuse together two atoms of hydrogen have become one atom of helium and this releases a ton of energy much of it in the form of heat self-sustaining Fusion has been one of the Holy Grails of physics since the concept was first theorized in the 1920s the idea that an initial Fusion would release enough energy to Kickstart a chain reaction unleashing more energy than it took to start the first one Fusion is all about probabilities if you have two nuclei close enough together for a long enough period of time there is always a chance no matter how infinitesimal that they will overcome their repulsion and fuse one way you can increase the odds of fusion is to add neutrons this is dyum one proton one Neutron although it sounds like another element entirely it is really just a variant of hydrogen heavy hydrogen because neutrons have no charge they provide a bit of a buffer it&#x27;s much easier to fuse two dyum atoms than two hydrogen atoms in the modern day we we try to induce Fusion in gigantic reactors called tacx donut-shaped rooms that trap protons with immense magnetic fields however despite our best efforts the energy we get out is always less than the energy we put in self-sustaining Fusion has only been observed in two places here&#x27;s the [Music] first and here&#x27;s the second an immensely huge ball of gas that warms our planet and grows our crops and the hbomb a device so destructive that if it was used for its original purpose it would Doom us to Extinction sustained hot Fusion in a lab would fundamentally alter our society but hot Fusion was not a widely used term in the 1980s when physicists spoke of fusion it was implied that it had to be hot of course that all changed on March 23rd 1989 like any good mythology the early history of their cold fusion project has varied over the years fleshman has said that they were inspired during a hike in mil Creek Canyon later that day they pulled an allnighter frantically writing down calculations and sketching out an experiment should we tell the truth y it was in one of our Jack Daniels phases according to fleshman their convo went a little like this quote it&#x27;s a billion to one chance shall we do it to which Pon said let&#x27;s have a go fleshman&#x27;s decades long career meant he was familiar with dozens of material systems and he had done extensive work with Palladium Palladium is a decently rare metal which can absorb surprisingly large amounts of hydrogen it was almost like a metal sponge and he wrote about it in a paper as early as 1948 a padium lattice can absorb about 900 times as much hydrogen inside the same volume and as it fills up it also expands slightly and the internal pressure increase dramatically the effect is the same if you swap out hydrogen for dyum fleshman&#x27;s thinking was that you could load up a Palladium lattice with so much dyum that it would compress the atoms so tightly that some of them could undergo fusion and all that could be done at room temperature a colleague at Southampton said that fleshman mentioned this idea to him as early as 1974 but it wasn&#x27;t until he went to Utah to work with pawns that he had someone willing to try it out with him in order to load the Palladium with dyum they devise the following setup they take a battery and hook it up to two electrodes one is platinum and one is palladium next they submerge this into a giant water bath except this isn&#x27;t regular water H2O this is heavy water d2o the hydrogen is replaced with dyum heavy water is not exactly common it makes up only about 0.056% of the Earth&#x27;s total water but for chemists it&#x27;s easy to get their hands on next they dissolve some lithium into the heavy water lithium is a conductor and they plan to run electricity through the water when the electricity is turned on the heavy water molecules d2o are split apart through electrolysis they separate into oxygen and dyum the oxygen is negatively charged and floats over to the anode and the duum is positively charged and floats over to the padium cathode the padium acts as a sponge and absorbs the dyum atoms and theoretically when the Palladium is loaded up with as much dyum as physically possible Fusion might occur how would they be able to tell though by measuring the temperature of the water if the heat energy released was more than the amount of electricity pumped in that would be excess heat a potential new energy source although it takes some work to get oceans have enough heavy water to last us centuries certainly much more renewable than oil or natural gas and with none of the pollutants this experiment was not an entirely new idea however in the 1920s a German group was trying to find a reliable way to produce helium following World War I Germany had been banned from importing it so a reliable way to make it in a lab would be a GameChanger they had tried loading Palladium up with hydrogen and saw some evidence of helium however this this work was fairly obscure and it had been forgotten about for decades largely because the authors eventually retracted their work they realized they had made a mistake the helium they were seeing had been absorbed from the air and not produced via Fusion of course the neutron wasn&#x27;t even discovered until a few years later and so they wouldn&#x27;t have known to use dyum rather than hydrogen fleshman had heard of this work before as he briefly overlapped at the same school as one of the authors in the 1950s and so all these years later fleshman had taken that general idea but swapped out hydrogen for dyum pwns and fleshman said several things in this press conference they will later come to regret the first was calling the phenomena a sustained fusion reaction the second was claiming that the experiment was quote very simple and implying it would be easy to reproduce fleshman will later say he regrets doing the press conference at all he knew that by going public like this they were opening themselves up to to more scrutiny than they&#x27;d ever seen before he thinks that pawns may not have realized that at the time fleshman is close to retirement here and he could have left the field any day if he ever chose to when they write his obituary cold fusion will be just a paragraph among several in a long and successful career pwns though is younger and with children still in school he was not prepared for how this would upend his life by the end of it he will be left so defeated that he&#x27;ll give up his US citizenship we did it for the first time anywhere a big step forward in a little test Tu what could be the discovery of the century the dawn of a new nuclear age they have successfully maintained a nuclear fusion fusion fusion fusion fusion fusion fusion fusion reaction and generated more energy out than they put in it was like an avalanche there was no news channel you could flip to that wasn&#x27;t running a cold fusion story most of the initial headlines portrayed the announcement as an earth shattering discovery that may change physics as we knew it this was a potential solution to the energy crisis clean nuclear power period period at a at an affordable price one cubic foot of sea water contains enough detarium to produce 250,000 BTU of energy it would take 10,000 tons of coal to equal that kind of energy no more acid rain from burnt coal and other power plants and the exhaust of the automobiles internal combustion engine would be a thing of the past nuclear fishing had become a political nightmare following the Chernobyl disaster and the Exxon vald&#x27;s oil spill had occurred literally the same day as the announcement the the fact is there are a lot of people including the Chase Manhattan Bank who are going to find themselves broke if oil doesn&#x27;t stay at $20 a barrel the Middle East crisis gets settled just like that because there&#x27;s nothing to fight over the headlines wrote themselves two local papers the Salt Lake City Tribune and the Deseret News would religiously follow the story with a sense of Hometown Pride in the latter case I mean that literally Deseret News is owned by the Mormon church not all reactions were also positive though many outlets took a more mixed stance some were outright skeptical for some papers it wasn&#x27;t even worth a front page story The New York Times squirrel it away on page 12 optimistic incredulous there was an entire spectrum of emotions but everyone was paying attention there was a distinct third type of reaction that went on largely behind closed doors however did this have the potential to be turned into a weapon or if not a weapon a source of fuel for one countries without nuclear weapons programs may have just been handed a Golden Ticket governments around the world scrambled to ask their top scientists their opinions at the University of Utah things quickly devolved into a mad house following the press conference Marvin Hawkins led the media through a tour of the lab explaining the setup the kitchen comments were bang on it looked like something a hobbyist could do in their basement car batteries a Rubbermaid Wash Tub all right next to a Janitor&#x27;s Closet this was certainly not like the hot Fusion tacx that were the size of entire buildings and cost half a billion dollars to run news TV Crews were wandering the halls of the University looking for anyone willing to be interviewed many had no idea about the experiment but hey it was a chance to be on TV what are they doing the experiments and things I do you know what it is well I have an idea I don&#x27;t idea well it&#x27;s just it has to do with with energy this openness will soon be replaced by the opposite U of you will lock down external access to the lab even covering up some windows the school&#x27;s phones were ringing off the hook hundreds of calls a day from every Walk of Life politicians like Al Gore called in offering congratulations pwns got personal calls from Edward Teller the controversial father of the hydrogen bomb and Carlo ruia director of CERN but they were also flooded with random people looking to invest or cranks who wanted to talk about their pet conspiracies fleshman and his wife were quickly assigned a pair of bodyguards to follow them wherever they traveled soon Pon had to change his home phone number otherwise it would be ringing all night the attempt to capitalize on the phenomenon was immediate the U started selling cold fusion t-shirts a soda shop down the street had a novelty cold fusion drink many researchers when they first heard of it were dumbfounded cold fusion was a nonsense concept right it would be the great the most significant technological Discovery since man discovered fire this had come out of nowhere if anything you&#x27;d expected out of a place like MIT or one of the big Federal Labs like Los Alamos or Oak Ridge some didn&#x27;t even dare touch the subject quote it&#x27;s got to be wrong I&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;ll look like idiots if we&#x27;re seen trying this thing but on the other hand pawns and fleshman were not complete nobody&#x27;s they had some level of credibility and they wouldn&#x27;t make an announcement like this without solid proof and hey fleshman had said the experiment was very easy to replicate and the materials were cheap and easy to get why not take a week to try and get their own versions going this was basically just a modified electrolysis setup quite literally something that high school students do in their chemistry classes you just needed some Palladium and some heavy water those who were quick on the draw were lucky as soon Palladium stock prices were about to spike but in the past 2 months Palladium has been the most profitable mineral uh I think we ran from about $142 up to $180 at one point in time some groups even managed to track down pawns and fleshman&#x27;s supplier Johnson mathy although their Palladium was standard stuff they sold off the shelf they did start marketing it as quote Fusion grade and so began the cold fusion Mania that swept the United States but this was not just an American phenomenon cold fusion had captured the attention of the entire Planet but as scientists around the world attempt to recreate the experiment in their own Labs Fusion has turned to confusion I&#x27;ve logged 63 or 64 Laboratories trying to do the thermal experiment and I can say honestly that not one of those Laboratories is doing it the same way that we did it didn&#x27;t take long for them to realize that the announcement lacked a bunch of critical details here&#x27;s just a short list what size were the Palladium rods how are the rods made are they machined or cast is the surface of the rod baked etched or left alone how much duum needs to be loaded into the rods how long did it take to load the duum hours days weeks what current should you supply should the current change over time which electrolite do you add to the water was there any stirring done to the liquid all legitimate questions that could have a major impact on the results everyone knew that a paper was in the works but only a select few had managed to see a copy most of what people had to go on was a story that evolved into a key part of cold Fusion&#x27;s mythology the Meltdown the Meltdown is supposedly the first time pwns and fleshman saw something that might suggest Fusion exact dates for this meltdown are inconsistent and hazy they stretch back as early as late 1984 or early 1985 why then specifically well notably it would be the earliest possible time where they could have come up with their experiment but also late enough that both pwns and fmen had fully left their prior jobs at Southampton and the University of Alberta any potential patent rights would fall only to them and the University of Utah according to the mythology they had been loading a Palladium electrode for seven entire months and then one night pwn had instructed his son Joey who was working in the lab to adjust the current running through the cell his son did as he was asked left and then returned hours later to check on the EXP experiment what he saw was astounding a 1 cm cube of padium which is a melting point of, 1500° had fully melted exact details are again inconsistent in some versions of the story the rest of the setup melted too in others it was a mini explosion in some versions Joey had lowered the current in others he had raised it there was one detail that remains consistent though there was a hole in the concrete floor 4 in big at least one independent Source ponza grad student Kevin Ashley confirmed that he saw the hole the next day something had generated a shocking amount of heat so much heat that it could not have been explained by any chemical reaction the only logical conclusion according to pwns INF Flashman was that something nuclear had just occurred and it was stories of this meltdown that supposedly convinced the university that this discovery was genuine leading to the eventual press conference and yet there exist no official University records of this meltdown from the time it supposedly occurred fleshman years later claimed that they had covered it up out of fear of having their experiment shut down as a clear fire hazard but regardless the Meltdown story would be a particular point of fixation among scientists because even though the story lacked hard numbers it still implied them a 1 cm padium Cube has a melting point you can estimate and you can calculate how much energy would be NE necessary so does a 4-in hole in concrete researchers would soon be working backwards from what little info they had the first week was a Mad Dash to uncover as much information as possible researchers phon their friends to brainstorm faxes of rough drawings and calculations sent out across the country people even analyzed footage of Pawns holding one of his cells and used the size of his wrist to try and guess at the dimensions of the cell there are even alleged reports that some people managed to crack their way into Pond&#x27;s personal email ma hoping to Snoop for answers but found nothing of Interest back then the internet was still in its infancy and barely anyone called it that yet but universities and research Labs were some of the first in the world with access to it making cold fusion one of the first ever viral news stories early bulletin boards hosted Daily News updates and information was spreading faster than ever could before very few people were able to speak with fleshman and pawns directly save for a few of their close friends Chuck Martin at Texas A&amp;M had known pwns for years and had heard a few days beforehand that he&#x27;d want to keep an eye on the news Chuck Martin was extremely eager to get his own cold fusion experiment running and he phoned pawns asking for any tips but pawns only gave him cryptic warnings about the potential danger it seems this was Sage advice as some Labs were about to prove the Lawrence Livermore Labs got a reaction they did not expect their experiment blew up but the hydrogen gas apparently caused a small explosion which sent shards of glass all over the lab North Carolina State University scien scientists earlier suspended their Fusion experiment following a small explosion INF flan had given some friends at Harwell Labs An Early Head Start he&#x27;d been shipping them some of their cold fusion cells throughout March for them to measure he wanted at least one UK lab to get a head start so the US didn&#x27;t get all the glory it&#x27;s around this time when the criticism starts to pour in so far the best sources for hard numbers were newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and the financial times in all of this what has been the most frustrating thing for you the most frustrating part is not having enough details uh to replicate the experiment or trying to get the details out of newspapers this is not usually the way we do science this whole situation was bizarre why had the press conference come before a peer-reviewed paper for many people that was a major faux paw you know not aware that we did anything at all wrong we were very cautious not to say that papers have been accepted anywhere pwns infl had in fact submitted their paper a couple weeks earlier to the Journal of electroanalytical chemistry and although it hadn&#x27;t been published yet it had been accepted where this gets iffy is why it was accepted you see a couple weeks before the announcement pwn had received an unrelated call from a friend who was an editor at the journal pwns and fleshman had published often with them before and fleshman was a longtime friend of the managing editor Roger Parsons Parsons upon hearing that his friends may have the the discovery of the century and that they had a tight deadline tells pawns that it&#x27;ll push it to be published as soon as possible Parsons was the only person to review the paper pwns and Flashman had also sent a paper to the much more prestigious nature but they had refused to publish it without a much more careful review there&#x27;s more to that side of the story later the paper was eventually published on April 8th but the pre-print leaked a little earlier pwns had given five copies to friends in Utah these were quickly faxed and copied across the entire world so many times that most of the text quickly became unreadable except of course for the massive stamp that read confidential but even this paper was only eight pages and had little new that people didn&#x27;t already know the Assumption many were working on was that pwns and fleshman were intentionally withholding details because of patent concerns some people even speculated that the cells they showed off on TV were dummies and that deep in their basement lab they had their real heavy duty cells hidden the press release given to the media by uu&#x27;s comm&#x27;s Department was also devoid of many details Pam brogal the school&#x27;s comm&#x27;s director later said that she was actually forced to remove sentences at the request from the University&#x27;s legal teams which she fiercely disagreed with and yes that was team&#x27;s plural she noted that there were three separate groups of high-powered lawyers ones from the East Coast West Coast and Texas she had wanted to speak to Pon and fleshman well in in advance but had only been allowed to just days before the announcement leaving her no time to research although the press conference was heavily promoted by the school the exact topic was not fully revealed beforehand despite this at least three reporters had managed to get an inside scoop one of them was Jerry Bishop at the Wall Street Journal brogal who wanted to guarantee coverage from the journal tells him it&#x27;s room temperature Fusion despite his initial skepticism he too ends up making some calls to physicists and pieces together that this story is a major deal and his headline taming H bombs was certainly not the kind of thing you expect to see in a financial paper Jerry Bishop&#x27;s coverage of cold fusion is some of the most in-depth in the traditional media sphere he will later win a science writing award from the AIP however it should be noted that his award ceremony will also be boycotted by many physicists they found his reporting misleading and often one-sided some actually credit Jerry Bishop with popularizing the name cold fusion because as you&#x27;ll see in their written press release and fleshman called their Discovery and fusion Jerry Bishop did not come up with a term called Fusion on his own however and you&#x27;ll find out who did a little later on nothing was conventional about cold fusion and it was only going to get weirder from here by mid April the first reports from other labs began to roll in ponds and flayman had set the precedent that if you had a result you were fine to hold a press conference before you even had a paper published and that&#x27;s what many of these Labs did called in the media put on their best suits and got their 50 15 minutes of fame it&#x27;s rare for scientists to get on TV and this might be their only shot hundreds of Laboratories have tried to confirm the Utah experiment it looks as though Texas A&amp;M won the race with Georgia Tech a close second we found that there is more energy coming out of this cell than we are putting in we couldn&#x27;t believe it we couldn&#x27;t believe it but then another announcement from another school Georgia Tech researchers there duplicated the Utah experiment and this weekend two Hungarian researchers say the University of Washington Italian news reports Stanford researchers today two Mexican scientists say government project in India researchers at the University of Florida Swedish physicists said today the University of Minnesota the Los Alamos National Laboratory New Mexico incidentally this brings to more than 60 the number of Laboratories that have confirmed at least part of the Utah experiment over the next few weeks pwns and fleshman will be traveling non-stop fleshman had gone to Europe the day after the announcement and he had given talks at some of the top physics Labs on the continent Harwell in the UK Aries in Italy and now CERN in Switzerland he was filling auditoriums Beyond capacity each time pwns was just as in demand and he had given talks at U ofu Indiana and soon he would give the biggest talk of his life cold fusion was such a big deal that nearly every major scientific organization decided to hold emergency sessions entirely dedicated to the subject and for a chemist like Pawns there was no bigger stage than the American Chemical Society they had scheduled a meeting in Dallas on April 12th they had booked out a basketball stadium and early registration suggested the chemists all across the country would swarm the event Dr Pond has been escorted around Dallas much the way you would escort around a presidential candidate or even a president himself incredible for a chemistry convention it felt like a jazz Lakers seventh game in the playoffs I&#x27;ll tell you one thing it was quite a day the first day of the conference the arena has 7,000 people in it looking back many call this event the Woodstock of chemistry as a comparison the American physical Society had their own Woodstock event just 2 years earlier when a group had found evidence of high temperature superconductors that work had won its discoverers the Nobel Prize every chemist in the country wanted to see their new hero Stanley ponds the president of the society opened his talk with a bit of a jab at their rival field of physics while much has been learned about plasma physics the goal has remained elusive now it appears the chemist may have come to the rescue although intended as a light-hearted comment it cut to a real feeling among chemists the physics Community was still extremely pessimistic many of them had ties to traditional hot Fusion research cold fusion would certainly disrupt their funding and so they&#x27;d have an incentive to criticize it the energy in the room was electric right as pawns is being introduced the MC takes a moment to announce some breaking news before I have Stanley come on up I&#x27;d like to comment when were just informed before we came on a Dallas radio station has reported that the University of Moscow has just announced that it has successfully repeated the ponds Flashman experiment history is being made during the event itself as for pawns he&#x27;s clearly much more comfortable now than he was in Utah he opens with a joke it&#x27;s incredible to me what an electrochemist has to do today to get an invitation to the American Chemical [Music] Society most of his talk is just him going over the experiment but he finds time for another joke the next slide is a photograph of the U1 Utah Tac it&#x27;s a clear Flex hot Fusion tacx are the size of entire rooms and weigh tons his can sit in a tougher Weare container the Applause he gets at the end is what you&#x27;d expect a rock star to get at the end of a concert thank you very much during the Q&amp;A one of the audience members asks Pawn&#x27;s a question Prometheus Pandora or piltdown man three options for for how this could turn out was this like stealing fire from the gods was it like unleashing a curse upon mankind that could not be undone or was it simply a hoax Pond&#x27;s response was short no comment meanwhile Pon and fman were not the only two who&#x27;d had a busy couple weeks Chase Peterson not wanting to waste the momentum of the publicity flew out his team and personally visited the Utah Governor at his vacation house the governor could tell they weren&#x27;t there just for pleasantries and ask them Point Blank how much money they wanted when they say around 2 or 3 million he hits back with five we will hold a special session of the legislature with one item on the agenda that item will be to deal with the $5 million appropriation a state senator Elden money even suggested a proposal where Utah residents could donate to the research and receive tax cuts in return some believe it will do for Utah what gambling does for Nevada with so much money coming in who needs taxes the results show that 60% of those who called thought taxpayers should pay for the research 40% said no taxpayers should not on April 7th the Utah legislature will vote 97-3 to approve the $5 million but it&#x27;s kind of like politics they&#x27;re certainly generating a lot of heat during the session the governor paraphrased the Bible when expressing his support he that doeth nothing is damned and I don&#x27;t want to be damned this was was an energy source so plentiful it would be quote too cheap to meter most of this $5 million would presumably go to some sort of research institute although almost immediately half a million is allocated entirely to the army of patent lawyers who would run this institute surely the competition would be fierce the earliest rumor was James Fletcher who had just retired as head of NASA a perfect fit given he was a Mormon from Utah this appointment would not pan out though but it did show just how much interest was being generated the eventual name would be the national cold fusion Institute of course looking at that name it implies at least some sort of collaboration with the rest of the country Washington was absolutely paying attention to Cold Fusion and things were already in [Music] motion on April 13th Glenn seaborg got a phone call in a California Diner it&#x27;s from Washington he needs to take a flight there because it&#x27;s urgent this is not the first time he&#x27;s done this he&#x27;s a well-respected veteran in nuclear science in a few years he&#x27;ll get a chemical element named after him he&#x27;s been a personal scientific adviser to half a dozen US presidents and George Bush wants his opinion on Cold Fusion when he gets there he tells Bush his chief of staff and Secretary of Energy James Watkins his honest opinion this wasn&#x27;t going to be anything there wasn&#x27;t enough evidence there to convince me and and I&#x27;m not uh convinced uh yet everybody knows about it uh uh nearly everybody is talking about it but uh uh most of the people I&#x27;ve talked to are not buying it but at the same time you couldn&#x27;t just declare it wrong the world was paying attention cold fusion looked like a solution to the energy crisis if you&#x27;re going to evaluate this you need to do it slowly make a panel have them visit the labs and write a big report don&#x27;t rush it out secretary Watkins orders a dozen of the country&#x27;s National Labs to start working on cold fusion and none of the secrecy business if there&#x27;s a confirmation he wants to know immediately this was not the only major development in Washington that month this is not a science project this is an American project quite frankly and a Utah project so I couldn&#x27;t agree with you more and I think we ought to jump right on it and not let anybody else steal this thing and the last 20 years are full of American inventions and Japanese promotion we&#x27;d like to have both opportunities in the house the science space and Technology committee held a hearing on April 26th with 42 members it is one of the largest committees in the house and that day there was full attendance the opening remarks are full of Pomp and Circumstance morning ladies and gentlemen in recent weeks an atmosphere of high excitement anticipation has permeated the scientific Community as startling possibilities for sustained nuclear fusion reactions at room temperature haveed emerge the potential implications of a scientific breakthrough that can produce coal Fusion are at the least in our judgment spectacular we all want this to work energy is the lifeblood of our nation and Fusion Energy would be an enormous step toward the goal of energy Independence in a period when our news seems to be filled with items telling us about drugs budget deficits decline in America&#x27;s economic position and environmental problems the news of the possible discovery of cold fusion in Utah with its accompanying even with its accompanying controversy was a wonderful news Wayne Owens congressman from Utah was eager to introduce the distinguished guests from his home state the possible achievement of solid state Fusion or the so-called cold fusion is nothing less than a miracle later he would make plans for a trip with his fellow committee members to go visit U ofu and see cold fusion with their own eyes the first guest to speak is Stanley ponds clearly quite humbled and honored to be speaking in Congress the one thing about those microphones is they&#x27;re not that good so you have to pull them closer okay thank you very much chairman first we would like to thank you and the committee for the opportunity to testify here today he starts us off with a fairly in-depth explanation of the nitty-gritty technical details he has a slideshow that lasts for nearly 15 minutes flayman is up next and does what he does best giving a digestible big picture view and speculates about how this could be applied notably he says something interesting here now the experiment which Professor Pon has described to you is superficially simple but is actually quite difficult to carry out because you have to go through a process of optimizing the experiment such that you will make a significant observation this is in contrast to the initial press conference where he said it was and I quote very simple although most of the politicians in attendance were enraptured some of the ask the occasional tough question I must say Mr chairman the process so far uh by which we&#x27;ve learned about this has been more confusion than cold fusion and there seems to be a feeling about that the process has been more driven by uh a wish to protect future potential profits than it has uh been adherence to normal peer review processes the uh public release of the information prior to the publication in a journal and the fact uh that the lack of data seems to have inhibited the replication of your results in most cases where it&#x27;s been tried in chemistry it is generally uh the situation that when you have submitted a paper and the paper is accepted which was the case in in our case then it is okay to make an announcement I think that problem we&#x27;ve had is that physicists don&#x27;t do don&#x27;t do things exactly the same way Pon is correct in saying that their paper was accepted but he&#x27;s not being entirely honest here about the peer review and as for the lack of experimental details fleshman hits back with this we admit that there were not the experimental details there but in a preliminary note there never are these experimental details and we do now have fax machines and telephones which would allow people to request that information from us and those that have we have given them that advice I reject that particular criticism indeed many scientists had been calling the two men non-stop asking for details however you either had to be extremely lucky or one of their close friends to actually get a response fleshman plays the Diplomat very well here he makes it clear that he does not want money taken away from hot Fusion researchers he does not want to make any unnecessary enemies when he&#x27;s asked how much he thinks scaling up this technology might cost he is careful to avoid giving an exact number rather he passes that particular Hot Potato to chase Peterson who has brought with him a high-profile lobbyist Ira magaziner together they made their Hail marry pitch to all 42 members of the committee who listened intently the figure that comes to mind is $25 million in the federal government uh maybe that needs to be 125 million someday but that&#x27;s of not any importance right now $25 million would allow us to start the onion growing with State and private sources 25 million at the low end 125 at the high end that is a big ask Peterson also in vague terms alluded to potential National Defense concerns about the research although cold fusion was not a bomb Fusion was known to produce tridium a radioactive isotope that is used in making bombs or liable way to generate tridium would certainly be of use to the US Army Ira magaziner tapped into the Poli iCal fears of the period and described a scenario where Japan their fearsome economic rival would swoop in and steal cold fusion from them just like they had with electronics and Automobiles you know we we have consulted in Japan we&#x27;ve consulted with Japanese companies and in the past and we understand the kind of effort that the Japanese are now devoting to this uh Discovery even before they&#x27;ve replicated this was an existential threat that meant they had to act now to fend it off the total hearing is 5 hours long and much of it is dry as the University of Utah group departed so did many of the representatives most of them simply don&#x27;t want to stay to listen to the much more skeptical Witnesses of the other speakers that day by far the most interesting was the group from Brigham Young University the Rival school to the University of Utah just 40 m down the road and representing them was a very softspoken physicist named Steven Jones and he was singing a very different tune than pawns and flashmen he didn&#x27;t think that cold fusion was worth dumping Millions into at least not yet he had even brought along a prop to help him explain now this is a tender shoot as you can tell it is difficult to say what it will become some think and suggest strongly that this is a tree and it will grow up very quickly and provide us enough wood for all our energy needs for Generations I do not think it is I think adding too much fer izer at this stage will be detrimental I think we need to give it time at least a couple of months please to see whether this is something that&#x27;s a rose or a tree if it should turn out to be a rose we can then admire it for its beauty even if we are a bit disappointed it was not a tree and by that he meant this is a new unexplored bit of physics and that is worth studying but a miracle energy source this was not to hammer home the point he made a comparison that the politicians could easily understand on the other hand I heard Mr Jones say that uh uh the difference between that experiment in commercial productivity was the difference between the dollar and and the national debt for a room of politicians who had just been asked for $25 million it made a compelling case but why had he of all people been invited who even is Steven Jones well Steven Jones is is the reason any of this was happening at all what he isn&#x27;t telling the committee here is that he feels pawns and fleshman have [ __ ] him over because what he&#x27;s claiming is that he is the inventor of cold [Music] fusion hey are you dying to see part two like right now well you can watch it early on nebula nebula is the creator owned streaming service I&#x27;m a part of alongside some of the best educational creators on the internet there you can watch my videos and many more completely ad free not only do I post my videos 2 weeks early there but you can find dozens of nebula originals not found anywhere else speaking of which I&#x27;m very excited to announce that I&#x27;m directing a featurelength documentary called 17 Pages by far my biggest project yet it covers one of the most famous controversies in American Science we&#x27;ve been flying out on location to film reviews I&#x27;ve commissioned some amazing art and I&#x27;m even going to be working with a composer for the music it will be releasing exclusively on nebula in early 2025 and I can&#x27;t wait for you all to see it making documentaries is my full-time job now and the best way for you to support me is by signing up to nebula using my link with it you&#x27;ll get a 40% discount on an annual subscription which works out to just $3 a month a significant chunk of that money goes directly to me for as long as you&#x27;re subscribed which will help me make bigger and better brentar support me me and many others by signing up for nebula today as always thanks for watching [Music]</p>
