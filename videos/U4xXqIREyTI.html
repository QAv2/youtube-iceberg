            <p>the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 and government corruption. On February 1st, 1952, President Truman signed into law the Invention Secrecy Act or the ISA, prohibiting certain inventions from becoming public. Patent applications are reviewed and many are manually screened each year. The ISA is strictly controlled by any federal agency with classifying powers that can order a restriction under the act. These agencies include, but are not limited to, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the CIA, the EPA, the FDA, and the National Security Agency.</p>
<p>These classifying powers include many governmental officials elected, appointed, or hired who may have connections or are backed by special interests, including corporations that would lose financial gains from innovating inventions or pharmaceutical corporations that withhold or restrict life-saving procedures, medications, and cures due to profit gains and losses. There is a lack of transparency and oversight for the classifying powers and the inventions that fall under the ISA. So the next time you ask why our vehicles don&#x27;t get better gas mileage or why electricity is so expensive, this is one reason. Or why our appliances and devices use so much power or do not last long. This is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Forcing the consumer to use more fuel or purchase products that do not last very long equates to more profits for corporations and more taxes for government spending. The ISA also restricts, prohibits, and bans portions of medical research that are deemed detrimental to national security by classifying powers, including medical technologies. This means that any medical research with potential government interest or implications could be and often are restricted or prohibited. When you question why there is no cure for cancer, this is one of the reasons. Cure a disease and the market loses a customer.</p>
<p>Provide medication and ongoing medical treatment to relieve symptoms of a disease and you keep the consumer hooked for life. More money and power over the masses in the long term. Cures take time for research and cost millions of dollars to fund, but in the end, the revenue is lost once the patient is cured. Even though approximately 47% of medical research funding in the United States comes from government sources, primarily through the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies. This funding supports a significant portion of biomedical research conducted in the country.</p>
<p>Now ask yourself if the research has already been done but has been restricted or prohibited. Is that research actually unavailable or is it available to the highest bidder? Where there is extreme monetary gain or influence exemptions are made. There are breakthroughs in medical research in other countries that the US government and classifying powers have banned from use in the United States. Even though the extensive research shows the effectiveness and viability of the procedures, medication, and cures can and do make a difference, there are medical breakthroughs used for the military that could help save lives in trauma situations, yet are prohibited to the public due to national security. How is national security jeopardized when the public receives medical procedures that save lives? When did it become detrimental to national security to save lives, extend lives, or cure diseases? It is only detrimental to corporate profits, personal greed, institutional control, and government corruption.</p>
<p>One example is the military&#x27;s use of blood substitutes and synthetic blood that is classified for military use only and could save lives in trauma situations and in remote areas where medical attention is too far for conventional methods to sustain the life of the patient. There is money and power in consumerism. No matter if the government is based on capitalism, socialism or anarchy, government and corporate corruption, financial gain, and power over the masses are several reasons. Think of all the inventions that have been suppressed that would have made our lives and the lives of all the world better. Now ask yourself, how many inventors ceased inventing because of this law? Then on the conspiracy side, how many mysteriously disappeared or died? This is not to say the government or a government entity had anything to do with it.</p>
<p>But where there is big money, there is always corruption and those who will do anything to keep the currency flowing in their direction. Here are the main nuances that I see in this corrupt governmental law. Each spelled out in the invention secrecy act of 1951. Inventors cannot share or discuss their inventions under penalty of fines and or imprisonment. Inventions may be restricted from being sold or exported, yet are unavailable to US markets.</p>
<p>Applications may be classified, requiring secure storage and handling. Secrecy orders can indefinitely block the issuance of patents, even if the invention is patentable and viable for production without immediate physical harm. Inventors may petition for compensation, but courts often deny these claims. Here are the facts. The ISA was enacted on February 1, 1952 and codified under title 35 of the United States Code.</p>
<p>However, the drive to restrict or prohibit certain inventions can be seen as far back as 1910, escalated in the 1940s, and settled into the ISA of 1951. Title 35 regards the governing of all aspects of patent law in the United States. There are currently 37 chapters which include 376 sections with only 149 being used in title 35. Intellectual property codes are scattered throughout the United States code. Copyrights, trademarks, unfair competition, trade secrets, and any form of intellectual property are also covered by the United States Code.</p>
<p>An invention must meet several requirements to be eligible for a patent. The invention must concern patentable subject matter. The invention must be novel. And the application for a patent on the invention must be timely. The invention must be non-obvious.</p>
<p>Finally, the invention must be sufficiently documented. This explanation comes from wikipedia.org. Furthermore, the ISA is a United States federal law that authorizes the government to suppress and prohibit the disclosure of certain inventions for reasons of national security. The law allows selected federal agencies to decide whether a patent application poses a risk and to classify the invention under the secrecy orders without disclosure to the public. The secrecy orders have been imposed upon a wide range of inventions from military and defense to inventions that are alleged threats to the economic stability of the US.</p>
<p>Many question the validity of these restrictions and prohibitions and the classification of these inventions has unproven consequences to national security or the economic stability of the nation. The law applies to all inventions in the United States for which a patent is filed or granted. Secrecy orders can bar public disclosure entirely, prohibit sales to anyone outside the defense sector, block exports, and seal restricted applications as classified. It is believed that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has considered applying secrecy orders to inventions deemed disruptive to established industries. This in reality means if a car can be made to be more fuel efficient and produce less pollution, it would disrupt some corporate financial gain and possibly allocate tax money.</p>
<p>With reduced emissions, there would be less need to allocate tax money to monitor the emissions. With better fuel efficiency, gas companies would lose revenue from sale and the government would receive less tax money. With all the talk of green energy, it&#x27;s no wonder that the government keeps many inventions secret to advance their green initiative. If it could be proven and made public that the government has suppressed the ability to reduce carbon emissions, reduce air pollution while stealing and classifying the intellectual property of inventors, with the public even care. Inventors whose work is restricted may petition for compensation, but courts have often denied claims on the ground that inventors cannot show actual damages while their inventions remain suppressed.</p>
<p>Meaning that the corrupt government and court system are backed by corporate greed and the need to control the populace. Yet, here is the kicker. There is no known transparency or stated oversight when it comes to classifying powers and how or why certain inventions are restricted, prohibited, or banned, especially when it comes to conflicts for corporate financial gains. In 2025, there were more than 6,500 secrecy orders in effect, which are known. The process for declassifying these orders involves a review by the US patent and trademark office and relevant defense agencies which seldom if ever happens.</p>
<p>How is the government allowed to restrict or prohibit inventions by classifying these inventions as detrimental to homeland security or national defense without disclosure to the public explaining the reasoning? When did we the people hand over all our power to a handful of greedy, powering, egotistical, self-serving elitists? Where is the nation by the people for the people gone? Even without the invention secrecy act, corporations and those in power have the ability to keep inventions from the public. For example, in 1926, Albert Einstein and Leo Shalad invented the Einstein refrigerator, which operates without moving parts and uses a heat source for cooling. Despite its innovative design aimed at improving safety, it was not commercially successful due to various challenges, including the Great Depression and competition from other refrigeration technologies. The Einstein refrigerator could revolutionize refrigeration systems in remote areas and reduce the atmospheric contaminants that are used in refrigeration units used today. The fact that there are no moving parts and the system could run almost indefinitely would cause a detriment to corporate financial gains.</p>
<p>Thus, why would corporations endorse or produce any product that would not guarantee an ongoing revenue for the corporation? Cellular service providers are allowed to push out updates that are detrimental to the life of cell devices. Consumer products like TVs, computers, appliances, and many more are made with substandard components so as to break down in a short period of time. Laptop batteries are designed with a chip that breaks after a certain amount of time or charges. We live in a consumerrist world where everything is made to break as soon as the warranty is up. Craftsmanship has given way to corporate greed and theft of service.</p>
<p>When a cell company is allowed to slow the performance of a device to force you to purchase a new device, it is theft of service and destruction of private property. In Europe, cell companies have been forced to allow aftermarket repairs. Corporations have been forced to standardize power outlets to avoid forcing consumers to buy new accessories. In the US, the government or agencies have not taken the steps that the Europeans and Canadians have taken to curtail corporate greed. How much money is enough? There is never enough for the greedy.</p>
<p>In 1901, Nicola Tesla built Warden Cliff Tower with the sole purpose of transmitting electricity without the use of wires. Using the earth and atmosphere as conductors, he aimed to create a global system for wireless communication and power distribution. But the project was never completed due to financial difficulties. Once again, big money and power shut down an innovation that would have revolutionized life. At the time, his concept was mocked and his investors pulled funding, recognizing the effects of wireless power and the loss of control over the distribution of electricity.</p>
<p>With the threat of solar flares and the possibility of causing the electrical grid to fail, wireless electricity distribution would be ideal if it were not detrimental to national security. Upon Tesla&#x27;s death on January 7, 1943, all his research was ceased by government entities and has not seen the light of day since. In recent decades, research into Tesla&#x27;s claims and known inventions have gained ground. His wireless electricity distribution is in use on a small scale but not widely available. Where would we be if his invention had been made public and backed by the government to advance our civilization? In 1977, the life of the reluctant inventor Tom Ogle took a turn for what should have been a bright future.</p>
<p>Instead, his life ended in tragedy at the young age of 26. Since around 1971, he had been tinkering and experimenting with different equipment until in 1977, he moved on to the four-stroke engine. He came up with the idea of a vapor carburetor that makes an internal combustion engine highly fuel efficient. He applied his revolutionary innovation to a 1970 Ford Galaxy featuring a V8 engine with 427 horsepower and a 3gon tank. He used a multiple vapor system in that car and drove it for 100 miles.</p>
<p>The fuel efficiency that he achieved with a two-ton vehicle boggles the mind. Yet his innovation came under ridicule, skepticism, and denial by auto manufacturers, the US government, the petroleum industry, and the science community. It was reported that auto manufacturers tried to buy his invention. He died on August 18, 1981 at the young age of 26. Was his untimely death mysterious? Definitely.</p>
<p>Was there more to his death? We may never know, but the truth is that Tom Ogle was not the only inventor who had an untimely mysterious death. On May 27, 1977, the Times reported that multiple people had stepped forward claiming to own a share of Tom Ogle&#x27;s gas-saving invention and that General Motors may have a patent issued in 1972 that would make shares in Ogle&#x27;s invention worthless. the patent for the Tom Ogle engine, specifically US417779A. Without asking the question, how easy would it be for a powerful corporation to have a patent backdated? The question should be, why if General Motors had a similar patent, didn&#x27;t the corporation put the highly efficient innovation into production? Were in our auto manufacturers in non-compete agreements with the petroleum industry and government agencies? If you look at the old style carburetors and the newer fuel injection systems, there is still as much emissions and the lack of efficiency. We have yet to break the 40 m per gallon fuel only efficiency.</p>
<p>Hybrid vehicles like the BMW 330e suggest an efficiency of up to 217.3 m per gallon. Why are vehicles not allowed to get better fuel efficiency? To make things more interesting, the federal and many state governments are trying to ban older model vehicles with carburetors. Even if you buy into the green initiative and the need for electric vehicles, they still do not get the mileage efficiency of the Ogal type carburetor. So here at the end I would ask the question where does the US government get the authority and power to decide without the direct consent of the people to classify inventions as detrimental to national security and the US economy? When does the profit of the few outweigh the necessities of the public? Where is the government oversight and passing of laws to restrict corporations from pillaging the consumer in a time of supposed global warming? Why is the US government spending more money on projects that have had no effect on the environment and not opening the vaults of the classified and restricted inventions that would go a long way in combating the so-called global warming? If there were truly an issue with global warming, would it not be more productive and sensible to repeal the Invention Secrecy Act and allow inventors to innovate a better future? Then again, corporations and big money dictate the future. There is no ethics in big government or businesses.</p>
<p>There is only manipulation, control, corruption, and greed. Just food for thought.</p>
