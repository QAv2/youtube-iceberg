            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Well, good day and welcome back to Reality Check. I&#x27;m your host, Ross Kulart, and I can tell you today we have a story that I think is absolutely mindblowing, if true. It&#x27;s quite extraordinary. And I don&#x27;t get the credit for digging this one up. The the person who deserves the credit most of all are the two gentlemen that are joining us now.</p>
<p>TWW Mock, a billionaire businessman, a huge success story in American military logistics, and former special forces veteran Chad Roishau. Guys, thank you so much for joining Reality Check, both of you. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having us on, Ross. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sir. &gt;&gt; Um, I&#x27;ll give you first a bit of a background on who TWW is.</p>
<p>TWW Mock is a prominent American entrepreneur and chief executive known for building a massive empire in global logistics, private intelligence, disaster recovery and supply chain operations. It&#x27;s a great ragsto riches story. Uh mock you TWW you launched your career in general construction and you moved across into military logistics arriving in Iraq with just $25,000. No government contracts, zero backing. You lived out of a shipping container near Camp Victory, which I&#x27;ve suffered many times myself and I didn&#x27;t envy you when I read about that.</p>
<p>And you you basically became driven by a mantra that you cite in your interview with Chad from General Robert Barrow that defined the philosophy, if you control the supply lines, you control the outcome. And because of this, you&#x27;ve become known as the god of war because you&#x27;ve won conflicts and crises or helped win those conflicts and crises without ever pulling a trigger. The other thing I really want to give a hand to here is your great work in supporting veterans via the Resilient Project, which is very much a project led by Chad and partnering with groups like Mighty Oaks Foundation. I I can&#x27;t think and I can&#x27;t emphasize more strongly of the importance of supporting our veterans. They come out of war, we take it for granted, and the real battle begins when they come home.</p>
<p>Now, TWW, your company, your main company is Tactical Advanced Deployment, TAD. Uh, it&#x27;s your flagship firm. Specializes in large loss disaster recovery, maritime logistics, oil and gas, and shadow economy. And, uh, it operates in 10 plus countries across five continents. And you&#x27;ve also founded Orion Global Intel and Technology providing on the ground intelligence in contested areas.</p>
<p>At times, your managed assets, this is an incredible number, have peaked at 118 billion with figures cited more recently at around about 50 billion. I should suspect that&#x27;s probably because the wars have wound down, thank heavens. Now, Chad, you&#x27;re a decorated US Marine Corps veteran, and one of the things I I love is you&#x27;re a force recon guy, and I know the work you guys do. our incredible work behind the scenes. You were born in Louisiana.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got a military family background. You enlisted in the Marines at 17 and you joined the Elite Third Force Reconnaissance Company, becoming a sergeant by 2001. 18 plus years in uniform. And I think at the peak of your career, you were in the JOC task force, an advanced force operator, AFO, undercover special operations, deployed eight times to Afghanistan as part of JOC, the US military&#x27;s premier counterterrorism unit, home to Delta Force, Devgrrew, Seal Team 6, Task Force Orange, where you conducted 100 plus high-risk missions in contest contested areas And in 2012, you founded the Mighty Oaks Foundation, which has served 500,000 plus veterans, troops, and first responders. And I can&#x27;t think of a more ludable charity to support.</p>
<p>If everybody watching this was to help the Mighty Oaks Foundation, they&#x27;d be doing a great thing indeed. And in your spare time, as if you actually have any, you&#x27;re a promma champion and a black black belt. Uh you&#x27;ve uh authored best sellers and my favorite I&#x27;ve heard about this and read part of it is Saving Aziz the story of your 2021 Afghanistan evacuations where you rescued thousands including your interpreter Aziz. So gentlemen thank you so much for joining us. Um the story we are talking about today I think frankly is mindblowing.</p>
<p>The implications of it are extraordinary. TWW, sir, you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve given service and I think I should thank both of you for your service. Even though you&#x27;re not a combat veteran, you&#x27;ve done a hell of a lot to win wars and help support wars in the last few years. What&#x27;s the history of your involvement in these kind of retrieval operations? Um, is it something that you&#x27;ve done a lot of? Um with regards to this particular mission set, no this was uh very specialized but ultimately the the call came uh due to our logistical ability in our mobilization ability. &gt;&gt; And so as I understand it, we&#x27;re not revealing at this stage the location in Mexico.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s correct, Chad. You&#x27;re you&#x27;re going to be going to the location in Mexico at some stage. But what we are talking about here is it&#x27;s mind-blowing. I I can&#x27;t quite believe it. This is a retrieval of alien reptilian bodies, gigantic, probably 7, 8 foot tall beings judging from the skeletons.</p>
<p>TWW, you&#x27;ve actually been right next to these skeletons. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; That is correct. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can you tell me this the story of how you came to be involved? &gt;&gt; Um, yeah, absolutely. I was uh working with a with another defense company out of Virginia Beach um that subsequently started early early 22 Aprilish um regarding retrieving some assets under another program.</p>
<p>Um subsequently that fast forwarding into August um the number continued to uh increase and then of course there was a there was a shift in in the situation with regards to China possibly having requiring one of these assets that kind of expedited things. Um subsequently took the we we took on the mission set. We went down to uh down to Mexico and we did uh phase one which was proof of life. Um in in gauging what we were seeing if it was if it was true, if it was honest, if it was what we believed it was or what the mission said believed it was and subsequently went and did that. &gt;&gt; So TWW, I always love that first moment because I&#x27;ve spoken to a lot of people privately who&#x27;ve been involved in retrievals.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a lot of great men and women actually who&#x27;ve been involved in retrieval operations. Um there&#x27;s always that awe moment, that ontological shock. What was it like for you, sir? &gt;&gt; Um it was um not much surprises me in this world anymore, but this uh this put me on my heels. It had me question me question everything. um I trust but verify and and and in that situation of course I&#x27;ve always been a skeptic very very realistic uh I would say that it&#x27;s realistic that this does apply um or does exist however I&#x27;d never seen it personally so I wouldn&#x27;t comment on that but uh until I saw it um and subsequently what I saw in what we went through on the ground there was something an experience I&#x27;d never experienced um absolutely um something was very hard to comprehend &gt;&gt; that Now Chad, you&#x27;re the host of the Resilient Show, which is a very successful podcast that has done a huge amount of work supporting veterans and particularly the Mighty Oaks Foundation charity that you lead.</p>
<p>What did you think when TWW told you this story? &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, I met TWW um this past uh election cycle. We went we went for the inauguration together for pres when President Trump took office and we were in uh Washington DC and and some of the folks that we had mutual friends with were from uh central intelligence agencies, some other government intelligence agencies. So our meeting and introduction was through a mutual network of friends that we trust. And so meeting each other where you know we we kind of just the nature of how we met was there was some validation of being you know trustability and and a conversation came up about about uh our mutual interest in in this topic. I I have a very large interest in in history and uh pre-duveno, you know, pre flood uh ancient technologies.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve really got into studying Genesis 6 in the Bible and the book of Enoch and the Watchers and and uh and all this ancient technologies and want to know, you know, like many people, how did the pyramids get built? had the megalith the great megalith structures like Machu Picchu who I stood you know I stood at Machu Picchu and looked at the structure and know that there&#x27;s no way that you know the Inca built this. So I just had all these questions and we got into this topic of discussion and and TWW entrusted me with the knowledge that he had in this experience and he said uh he wanted to share it. he wanted to, you know, get this information out. Uh, and then not only did he want to get this information out, but he wants to go back to the location and was looking for the right people to do it. And, uh, and we just over the last, you know, months, year, uh, we talked about it and and, uh, we decided to share it on this show.</p>
<p>Uh, but beyond sharing it, we we intend to go back. That&#x27;s why we hadn&#x27;t revealed the exact uh, but we know the exact location. we had permission to be able to go there and uh we want to put together the right team with safety protocols and and go back and unearth what was left behind and uh so I was I was blown away just like just like you Ross when I first saw these pictures uh skepticism sets in right away and uh and you know start asking the questions is this real is this a hoax and uh so I started passing I started you know trying to make it pass this the smell test if it&#x27;s real and and and everything I&#x27;ve checked out so far all indications is this is uh the real deal. And uh and then getting to know TWW, I have a you know, getting to know who he is personally, I have 100% confidence is the real deal and that we&#x27;re going to go back down and uh and and see it again for myself. &gt;&gt; So Chad, like I have privately, I&#x27;ve spoken to several special forces operators who&#x27;ve been involved in retrievalss.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re good patriots. They don&#x27;t want to do anything to offend the national security constraints and we don&#x27;t want to do that either here today. But one of the questions I really want to ask both of you, you&#x27;re both men of faith and one of the often used excuses that I get from people particularly in the US Air Force is that the public, especially Christians, aren&#x27;t ready for this. that they can&#x27;t handle the idea of an ontological shock of being confronted with the reality that there is a nonhuman intelligence that&#x27;s highly advanced. What does what do both of you say? I&#x27;ll start with you, Chad.</p>
<p>What do you say, sir? As a Christian, what do you say to the idea that Christians might be so ontologically shocked by the realization that there is an extraterrestrial or non-human intelligence that we shouldn&#x27;t tell them about it? That this should be kept secret. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I mean, one of the things that uh has actually been disturbing to me as a Christian is that uh the dog dogmatism of the Christian world and Christian faith has been so close to the idea of uh of uh extraterrestrial life. Meaning when I say extraterrestrial outside of earth and uh you know the Bible doesn&#x27;t only uh the Bible actually speaks the opposite.</p>
<p>I mean in the Bible it talks about when when the earth was formed that that they that they rejoiced. Who was they? It was it was it was a elder race to us. So we we were born not just we were not just created from a singular God. God God is a singular you know lord of lord and king of kings but there was elder race to us and uh and and so we&#x27;re part of a a bigger family. We&#x27;re part of a family and uh you know the what happened in the garden and the sin that we separated us from the family and the whole story of redemption in the gospel is to be re to be reunited with that family and uh and so if anything in this in the billions of stars or trillions of stars the infinite galaxy an infinite universe and infinite time uh exists out there then I have no doubt as a believer to believe that that it was created by God under control of under control of a sovereign God.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s kind of where where I I lie theologically in that. I believe there&#x27;s so much more that uh that that uh we would never understand in this life, but you know, the Bible gives us some hints in uh Genesis 6. And uh you know, a lot of people don&#x27;t don&#x27;t want to subscribe to the book of Enoch because it&#x27;s not part of the cannon. Uh I I you know, think lots of things. I mean, we read great authors who Christian authors and we read their books, but for some reason, a lot of people want to discount the book of Enoch.</p>
<p>Uh I think the book of Enoch is is uh as I personally process it, it&#x27;s never it doesn&#x27;t contrast the gospel of Jesus Christ. And because it doesn&#x27;t contrast the gospel of Jesus Christ and I don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s a conflict in it and uh and it it doesn&#x27;t derail me from my belief. In fact, all of all reading that has really done was make me more aware of the spiritual world and spiritual warfare, which makes me I believe a more more aware Christian. And uh man, I I tell you, one of the things that really scares me, Ross, uh with uh with where we are today is uh is a and this, you know, go down my rabbit trail here, but a project blue beam scenario and uh and if the you know, global elitist, the powers to be ever want to gain control of of humanity and mankind, a project blue beam scenario, the one group of people that it&#x27;ll completely destroy the narrative is is Christians who who believe that uh that it is implausible to think that anything outside of this planet exists and uh it will shake people&#x27;s faith because they have put themselves in such a theological box that they&#x27;re not prepared for that kind of information. And so I I believe the you know the Christian world needs to be uh not open to understanding these things because it prepares them spiritually and and and in no way if if people take the time to study the Bible in no way does it contra does it conflict with the teachings of the Bible uh God&#x27;s word or or or especially and most importantly the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>So for me, uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of where I sit with it. And it&#x27;s outside of that, the gospel is always the most important thing. But outside of uh all those theological beliefs, it&#x27;s fascinating. It&#x27;s fun. I love studying it.</p>
<p>And uh man, every I think every, you know, adventurous spirit person, you know, wants to know what&#x27;s out there. And uh and especially if we&#x27;re unearthing technology and and skeletal remains like TWW found down in Mexico. Uh this is just fascinating. So, TWW, I I understand you also are a man of faith. Um, what&#x27;s your feeling? I like asking this question because I&#x27;ve had people from the Air Force say to me angrily, &quot;This is demonic.</p>
<p>You shouldn&#x27;t be getting into this issue. It&#x27;s dangerous.&quot; What do you say to that? Do you think we&#x27;ve got a right to know? &gt;&gt; I would think the Epstein files are dangerous. Um, and so, you know, look, I think the I think the the population, global population has been misled from misinformation for so long that that I think everybody is extremely tired of of just being manipulated and and quite frankly, the truth gives you the path to to open the doors to make a better decision, more informed decision. But, you know, subsequently, um, this wouldn&#x27;t, in my opinion, this wouldn&#x27;t rock face a faith of anybody. I think if it&#x27;s if this were to rock your faith in any way, then you really weren&#x27;t a true believer in the first place.</p>
<p>Um, you know, so I I kind of take it with a grain of salt. Um, but look, there&#x27;s so many other things out there in the world right now that are going on that are geopolitically that have a global instability perception to it that it gets the masses. I mean, but how would you control the masses at some degree? Um, fear is typically how that&#x27;s done. So, you know, and divide and conquer. Um, look, I I&#x27;m not it&#x27;s way above my pay grade.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know where that&#x27;s going with anything other than the fact that uh what I do know is, you know, what I&#x27;ve been involved in, what I&#x27;ve seen, and how I feel about it. And subsequently, I think if every rational human being approaches it the same way, I think they&#x27;ll have the same outcome in my opinion. Do I think they&#x27;re going to get a little bit spun up and a little bit out over this? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And we don&#x27;t know where the things come from, right? TWW we just cuz you found it, you seen it, you touched it, but we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t know the origin of where it came from. We don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from if it is extraterrestrial or it&#x27;s pre-deluveno like we just don&#x27;t know this.</p>
<p>I mean look at the ocean. We we have a we I mean I don&#x27;t know the numbers on it but uh we probably only discovered you know a small small fraction percentage of what exists on this planet. So we just don&#x27;t know a lot of things. But uh &gt;&gt; so let&#x27;s go through this TWW. Um the the first thing I&#x27;ve got to do is project I think a degree of skepticism because obviously we&#x27;ve been I&#x27;ve just come back from Peru and I&#x27;ve been looking at the so-called tridactyls and there are counter and proarguments about the tridactyls and I&#x27;m going to be presenting a story about that shortly um as to whether or not they are authentic objects, authentic beings.</p>
<p>The implications of that investigation though are that there&#x27;s going to be a high degree of public skepticism that these are constructed objects that that somehow maybe the cartels trying to make money, maybe trying to lure some naive investor to extract millions of dollars, maybe maybe they&#x27;ve created fake skeletons, fake beings. What do you say to that? Is there a possibility that this is an elaborate hoax? Uh look, I&#x27;ve been a skeptic most of my life. Uh when it comes to this, uh I would say that um I was a skeptic up until August of 22. I am not no longer a skeptic. I know what what what I was engaged with.</p>
<p>I know what I saw. I know that that wasn&#x27;t uh that wasn&#x27;t humanlike. None of the situations were, none of the objects. And and really the it&#x27;s trust but verified. The information kind of led you down a different road.</p>
<p>Now, do I think that u that a lot of a lot of folks, we&#x27;ll call them folks, I won&#x27;t name the cartel out directly, but I would say that do do I think that there&#x27;s been a lot of manipulation of information? Yes. Do I think that there&#x27;s a lot of misinformation? Absolutely. Um do I think that uh do I think the world continuously gravitates around the possibilities? Uh, of course. I think it&#x27;s um I think it&#x27;s rationable rationable to think that in today&#x27;s stage and in today&#x27;s environment that with all of the encounters that we&#x27;ve had across around the world go from Central South America to include the UK to include Europe to include the Middle East um there&#x27;s too many coincidences right now and I&#x27;m not a firm believer in coincidence. Um, &gt;&gt; so TWW, talk me through I mean you you actually were on the ground personally, weren&#x27;t you? Which I find incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>And I envy you, Chad, that you&#x27;re going to be getting there on the ground to actually see this for yourself in some future occasion. I I I&#x27;m want to know what it was like. I mean, what was that moment like when you first describe it to me? Take me through the first moment you saw what you believe are alien remains. &gt;&gt; Oh man, I It&#x27;s It&#x27;s interesting. I&#x27;ll back this up a little bit because this is I returned home I want to say three to four days before my 20-year vow renewal with my wife.</p>
<p>Um which which was interesting because I remember the mental my mental capacity at that time was was absolutely strained on the ground in in uh in Mexico. But subsequently when when the engagement happened, I questioned I I remember I remember this vividly in my head and just simply saying what what am I looking at because I couldn&#x27;t even comprehend it. It was it was one of these things where I&#x27;m a realist at the end of the day and I was trying to make sense of what I was seeing and I didn&#x27;t believe that, you know, this asset could be in this particular location and why h why haven&#x27;t they until now? How why haven&#x27;t they what am I doing there? All the things, right? It&#x27;s way above my pay grade. I knew that I had I had outpunted the coverage as they say on this one. &gt;&gt; Okay, so we&#x27;ve got an image that we&#x27;ve put up here of what appear to be two scal remains.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re clearly not human. If we believe what you&#x27;ve been told about these remains, they date right back to the 1600s. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Talk me talk me through what we&#x27;re looking at here. They appear to be non-human.</p>
<p>Talk me through what you&#x27;re looking at. &gt;&gt; I I moved I I&#x27;ll move back to the original carving stone. That was one of the first objects that was was identified. And that particular stone had a reference of two skeletal looking beings and one was stabbing the other on this stone. And then that stone was actually dates stamped back in the 163234 range.</p>
<p>Um then that leads me to the skeletal remains that were found secondarily. And then you put that and I go back to this because it it was carved in stone. Um it resembles the the uh the artifacts that I found as skeletal remains and then subsequently um yeah anyway I was trying to process all of the information as it came together. Um and subsequently that led me to a place of saying well this this isn&#x27;t us. This isn&#x27;t human.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t uh this didn&#x27;t even date back. The Mayans were basically carving something at that time or or the indigenous on the ground at that time, you know, basically put something in in stone. Um and there were a bunch of other artifacts like that as well, but this one particularly as it referenced the skeletal remains uh versus the the object in the in the stone. Um yeah, it it just it was uh it was actually kind of in um want to put this. It was mildly concerning.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s probably a good way to put it. &gt;&gt; Mildly concerning. &gt;&gt; I can imagine it was &gt;&gt; I thought was super super compelling as you know as as TWW breaks down the history of this is this wasn&#x27;t just bones like found in a in a pile of rubble. This was you know they the locals when these crashes these you know the story goes in the 1600s they had these crashes all these anomalies began to happen. the locals built churches on top of the crash sites thinking that their religious buildings would would protect them.</p>
<p>And uh and so these buildings have been there for hundreds of years. And so when when they begin the excavation, they didn&#x27;t just start digging in in some dirt that someone could have threw some manufactured skeletons in. They had to bust through concrete and get into a cave system that had been there for qu for a long time. So if this uh was some kind of hoax, it would have been a hoax that was in, you know, hundreds of years in the making. &gt;&gt; It would have been for sure.</p>
<p>Yes. &gt;&gt; When you found the skeletons, TWW, were they buried in soil or were they just lying in a in a a sarcophagus? How were they presented? &gt;&gt; Uh they were they were actually in a cave system underneath that church that that Chad referenced. Um and you can look at the the the original photo of the unearthing of the entrance into the cave system. Um, you can see where they actually concreted over that original entrance to to kind of encapsulate that moment. But inside of the cave system was a natural cavern system.</p>
<p>Um, and that&#x27;s where that&#x27;s where the artifacts were found was in the in the cave system itself. Now, the thing that fascinates me about all of this is I&#x27;ve been briefed privately by people aware of the legacy program who say one of the things that worries them most about us keeping this secret is that the Chinese particularly are stealing the march on us. They&#x27;re actually getting ahead of us on this, which is a huge worry. Frankly, if anyone&#x27;s going to have access to this technology and this knowledge, I want it to be the US. I couldn&#x27;t think of a more important thing for the United States to be in control of technology and knowledge rather than authoritarian repressive regimes like Russia or China.</p>
<p>T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T TWW, as I understand it, the the background to this is that in the briefing that you were given before you traveled to Mexico, you were told by I think it&#x27;s a a JPL joint uh propulsion laboratories uh cover organization uh known as Zero Gravity. You were told in the briefing that the Chinese had got there first and taken remains previously. Can you talk me through that please sir? &gt;&gt; That was the that was the actuating notification when that came in that China had had actually obtained one of the assets um and the technology in Mexico and then subsequently had taken that taken that back to China and that&#x27;s what expedited this particular mission set that it became a um a priority. Still to this day, I don&#x27;t uh I I still question why the United States and wasn&#x27;t directly engaged with this from a uh from a governmental perspective versus going into a contractor environment and then stepping down. I mean that to me that was very odd and even Niss even asked me the same question.</p>
<p>Uh you know where&#x27;s where&#x27;s the United States and and the governmental agents in Mexico were asking where&#x27;s the United States and I said you have better access to them than I do at this point when it comes to this. uh feel free to give them a call and ask them. So, uh you know, I was just balling back and forth, but was put in the hot seat directly and put in the hot seat as soon as I hit the ground in Mexico to navigate those conversations. So, but to be really clear about this, it&#x27;s quite clear the Chinese knew about this and and I understand from the u from the excellent interview that Chad&#x27;s done for the Resilient Show, as I understand it, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s been a relationship between the Chinese and incredible as it may sound, these reptilian beings, historically, this has been going on for some time. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to say something here that I understand the contact with the current Chinese government was first made during the period of Maong under the communist regime.</p>
<p>So they&#x27;ve been allegedly and I don&#x27;t know this for sure allegedly dealing with these reptilian beings since the period of Miong of communism. What do you know about that sir? What were you told in your briefing? Um, I was told that, excuse me, I was told that, um, subsequently was Russia and China that subsequently were were of the reptilian end of the house and if you will, and and subsequently they were opposing the Anunnaki, which was supporting the United States and the program and subsequently looking for peace. And that was the briefing in a synopsis. That was the briefing that was given to me. And then subsequently the uh the matter of national security and this is where things get interesting because if it is a matter of national security I shouldn&#x27;t have been there is the way that I looked at it at that point.</p>
<p>Um but subsequently they needed to get a get contain they needed to contain that that situation and subsequently they needed verification that it existed. Um I think they questioned whether or not that it was real in in at in some fashion. I mean, I&#x27;ll be honest with you, TWW, it sounds like a stuff up, a mistake that they didn&#x27;t deploy. I mean, there are recovery teams linked through the Department of Energy, um, as you probably know, and, uh, they&#x27;ve been involved in many retrievalss historically. Why I mean, I know you&#x27;ve touched on this earlier, but I can I put this to you specifically.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s your understanding as to why they didn&#x27;t use their own recovery teams, and why did they deploy you? No disrespect to you because you obviously know what you&#x27;re doing. &gt;&gt; Well, I wouldn&#x27;t uh I wouldn&#x27;t for your for your latter statement, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly say I know what I&#x27;m doing in this space. Uh logistically, we can handle that. But understanding what we&#x27;re dealing with on the ground, I think we were left we were left relatively blind. I found out subsequently following the mission set that 13 operators had died from exposure leading into this.</p>
<p>Um that told me a lot what I needed to know, which is historic in our position in in engaging and dealing with uh certain governmental aspects, meaning we&#x27;re disposable. Um you know, if if something were to happen to us on the ground, I mean, that&#x27;s just unfortunate, but that&#x27;s the way it goes. Um but, uh for them, &gt;&gt; go ahead. I I apologize for interrupting, but when you say that uh 13 operators or you were told that 13 operators have died during these operations, are you talking about this particular operation or was it a historical thing? &gt;&gt; Uh I&#x27;m talking about this particular I was informed that 13 operators died under this mission under this retrieval mission. Now, I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not they didn&#x27;t identify the operators of being US or being Mexican or being another sovereignty&#x27;s governmental operations, but um I I know and I would kind of push this back to Chad.</p>
<p>I mean, we everybody in the ecosystem knows that if 13 operators went down in one mission set, that would uh that would be, you know, news at nine type situation, meaning that would not miss the news in any way. Um, for the most part, &gt;&gt; yeah, cut my experience, Ross, like I mean, uh, you talked earlier about my my time in Afghanistan, you know, I was when I went to Afghanistan, I had my time in as a force recon marine, then I went over to a JCO task force as a contractor and, uh, you know, the military, particularly in uh, you know, when you get into SPE SAP, special access programs, uh, you know, these types of things, it&#x27;s very common for the United States government to use contractors. uh one because they&#x27;re, you know, the military rotates, you know, in and out of people&#x27;s careers, but when you get people that stay in contracting, they get really niche and good at a job. So, they&#x27;re they have a, you know, sometimes have even uh they work so hand with the military, they have, you know, a lot uh more refined capabilities and and uh and then there&#x27;s also that I don&#x27;t want to use the word plausible deniability, but there a non-attributable factor that uh that sometimes comes into play. So it&#x27;s very common for the United States government to use contractors and layer layer uh uh these contractors for distancing uh from programs especially in these special access programs.</p>
<p>I mean look all of our you know the military-industrial complex when you have these reverse engineered UAPs projects like uh Loheed Martin and Skunkworks and Rathon and and Arthur Gumman that I mean all those are contractors and you know eventually they make their way to the military but who&#x27;s the the best at it in the world is at creating these things or or our contractors. So, not uncommon at all. Uh, and uh, and not surprising that they would they would do that. One of the things that TWW probably modestly is uh is is leaving out here that he was when he was down in the in the cave system and made contact, he actually put hands on the skeletal remains and he was told that he touched something down there and uh and his vitals went haywire and and he was giving a he was given uh two weeks to live uh because of the sickness that that he was told that he had from from contact making contact down there. And uh thankfully, you know, he&#x27;s still here with us.</p>
<p>But but uh you know, this is where it goes into this follow-up site visit that we&#x27;re going to do where I have friends that are still on crash site retrieval teams and we&#x27;re going to make sure we make all the proper protocols to make sure myself and our team is safe when we go back and and excavate reacavate site. &gt;&gt; And actually, just on that point, can I be really clear about this, Chad? Obviously, there are retrievalss of mundane human technology, hopefully our adversaries, Russia, China, North Korea. What you&#x27;re talking about when you&#x27;re talking about retrievalss, you&#x27;re talking about UAP retrievalss, non-human retrievalss. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I mean when when so when we talk about like uh you mentioned Department of Energy, the Central Intelligence A agency, when you have these crash site retrieval teams, I think the immediate thing people think about is UFOs, UAPs, but the one of the main things these teams would work on would be if a United States uh asset that high technological capabilities crashed, we we&#x27;d want to be able to recapture that technology as fast as possible before the enemy we want Russia or China to get it.</p>
<p>So, our crash site retrie retrieval team will go in to recover that asset to make sure we protected that technology. Uh, on the opposite end, if if a Russian aircraft or a Chinese aircraft or some other foreign adversaries aircraft crash and they had technology on it, we want to get to it as fast as possible to to get a hold of their technology. And so, that&#x27;s primarily what these crash site retrieval teams do. However, they also exist. If we have a UFO, unident unidentified flying object that may be extraterrestrial crashes, we want to be able to get that uh to that technology.</p>
<p>Uh UAPs, uh you know, UAPs would be unidentified aerrow phenomena. Uh sometimes those would be reverse engineered. And so when I say reverse engineered uh whether it&#x27;s a crash or I&#x27;ve been told and I don&#x27;t know the validity of this I&#x27;ve interviewed Dr. Steven Greer and other people that have says have said we actually have intentionally taken down uh extraterrestrial craft before with the explicit intent to reverse engineer them. Uh and so uh we have a reverse engineering program to be able to you know uh build that technology based off of retrievalss.</p>
<p>So TWW coming back to you for a moment of the different types of retrieval mission that take place probably 90% of them or 95% of them are the normal mundane retrievalss of either our own technology or Russian or Chinese some potential foreign adversary. What percentage of the retrievalss that you&#x27;ve been involved in are non-human? &gt;&gt; Um it would be probably 1% I would say that this is the only one that&#x27;s non-human. Um really &gt;&gt; this is the only one that I&#x27;ve been involved with like that. We&#x27;ve never been asked to engage at a different level. Um historically they&#x27;re calling us for logistical support.</p>
<p>Um we have we have a ground element to this as well. We&#x27;re not subject matter experts in the case &gt;&gt; which was uh which was mildly concerning in this particular situation. However, we do have the expertise to to to move the asset in the event of. So, um I I think that was uh more or less the uh the fluidity of the conversation that led us there. &gt;&gt; So, let me talk you through when you went into this site.</p>
<p>I mean, I&#x27;m presuming I know the DOE guys wear biohazard suits, they use breathing gear. What were you wearing and what what warnings had you been given before you went into the site? Were you told that this was potentially dangerous? &gt;&gt; No, sir. No, sir. We we uh &gt;&gt; were you wearing I mean in the images I&#x27;ve seen you don&#x27;t appear to be wearing bow warfare suits. &gt;&gt; I was not I was in civilian street clothes.</p>
<p>So um just blending in with the indigenous. We we had no we had no special we did have we did have some thermal technology with us and some other things but we had nothing nothing on the uh nothing on the spectrum of radioactivity anything like that um to to go into that scenario. So, as Chad described there and as you discuss in the interview that you&#x27;ve done with the Resilient Show, um there&#x27;s a mention there that they noticed that your vitals had changed when you touched these objects. Does that mean that they were monitoring your body vitals? How were they doing that? &gt;&gt; Um well, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s interesting because no, they weren&#x27;t monitoring them directly. They were monitoring them indirectly.</p>
<p>And I mean by uh one just for me, but it was tied back to my phone actually at the time. Um, which was interesting because my heart rate changed which I would imagine at that point everybody&#x27;s heart rate would start moving. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Things didn&#x27;t uh things didn&#x27;t move uh with regards to the skeletal remains. They moved they referenced the fact that I had touched a portal.</p>
<p>Um and and at that point, you know, my uh well, what you said on the beginning of the of the show, uh on the introduction side, I my threshold for pain when it comes to BS is very small. Uh so I I my my my rebuttal to that was is is u I wish you guys the best of luck. I&#x27;m going to uh clean my mess up right here and I&#x27;m going to head on back to Texas and you know, we&#x27;ll circle back on this. It&#x27;s funny you should mention portals TWW because as a journalist who&#x27;s been trained to be very very skeptical. When I first started out investigating this UAP subject, I thought portals or the notion of a portal was complete nonsense.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m fast coming to the realization that the United States knows a lot more about portals and non-human technology than they&#x27;re letting on. What did they tell you a portal was, sir? um transporting uh time time and energy through mass um along that but I look they gave me a a second grade introduction to a portal. I had to go subsequently to third parties in in in my ecosystem to actually get an education on this. It was very mundane. My briefing was very mundane on on I guess the explanation side of of reading into the situation.</p>
<p>I think that had to do with the timeline of the mission set of when it needed to happen. Um but subsequently I got I really had no debrief when it came down to to all the different things. So, I didn&#x27;t have um I still to this day don&#x27;t have a clear, of course, I can search this out, but I don&#x27;t have a clear definition of what the actual porters have been used for. Um and and who actually uses them, but to your point on the US government having the technology and and having the access to the technology, I think that&#x27;s pretty evident for for everybody out there in the ecosystem that understands the dynamics of technology and the growth of it. So, um, yeah, that&#x27;s &gt;&gt; I think the thing that really strikes me here, TWW, is there&#x27;s almost a lesson for the the the the foundation, the Mighty Oaks Foundation here about the way that veterans get taken for granted and treated appallingly badly, if if it is the case that 13 operators have died in the course of this retrieval and you yourself are exposed to something that I presume it was the CIA or the DOE, I I won&#x27;t pry and I respect the reasons why we can&#x27;t pry.</p>
<p>But if they were briefing you that you&#x27;d been exposed to something that was potentially fatal, that reflects, I think, a callous disregard for our men and women of service, doesn&#x27;t it? &gt;&gt; Well, I think this to directly answer your question, yes. But I would also say this, um, and it&#x27;s something that Chad and I touched on in our interview. This goes back to the industrial complex and the purpose of war. Um, and and Chad, I want to correct myself. I said 12 12 years we&#x27;ve not been at conflict as a sovereignty it&#x27;s 17 to be exact.</p>
<p>My team fact checked me in the middle of that. So uh look that&#x27;s just the you know they&#x27;re constantly navigating and making sure that that um you know that the facts are straight. But to your point uh I think I know in fact I know a lot of service men and women that have uh unfortunately you know supported an agenda that you know they volunteered for but didn&#x27;t sign up for. How does that sound? um probably wrong narrative but a lot of them have been the collateral damage has has been massive has been a been a massive adverse effect. &gt;&gt; Can I ask you sir how were you briefed for these operations? How does it work? Are you taken to a skiff somewhere and given a special briefing in Virginia or um as it just done on the a secure phone? How were you briefed? &gt;&gt; Uh we were done it was all secure comms secure comms back and forth between Texas.</p>
<p>I never set foot in the room in Virginia. Uh, in fact, I never met the the group and the team personally. Um, I talked to them. They were spun in from Egypt. I know there were teammates that were spun from that was stationed in Egypt uh back into and they were tied in through Virginia and then subsequently down to me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And and just so I understand this correctly because it did surprise me it wasn&#x27;t done through the opaces of the DOE because I&#x27;m I&#x27;m aware of the DOE retrieval teams. That&#x27;s a common knowledge. Why was it done through JPL the joint propulsion laboratories? What what&#x27;s that all about? &gt;&gt; Well, actually it was done through a Virginia defense contractor uh to be clear and then JPL got involved through Zero uh as things got got increasingly close to the mission set the mission date. Um JPL was not involved to my knowledge. They weren&#x27;t involved leading up to this.</p>
<p>They got involved in it literally uh three days prior to &gt;&gt; and and what&#x27;s this term zero gravity? What&#x27;s that about? I mean, I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve actually searched the JPL website for zero gravity and of course about a billion entries come up because it&#x27;s the most benile name. It&#x27;s your understanding that&#x27;s a um that&#x27;s a code name. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; I was I I was I was giving the the definition of zero. Yes, that was the program name, but it was it fell under another program that uh it&#x27;s its primary program was Stargate and then subsequently that led into and Zero was a byproduct of Stargate. Um, now Google Stargate and that&#x27;ll take you down a few rabbit holes.</p>
<p>I think that that that particular program was canceled in the 60s, I believe. I could be wrong, but it was canceled uh back before my time. But Star Zero Gravity is is what they called the program and the team that was on that program that I was dealing with. So just for the benefit of our audience to give you a bit of background, Operation Stargate was a program funded by the CIA uh overseen by the CIA investigating the use of psychic phenomena. Uh uh there were a number of subjects including Yuri Geller, the Israeli psychic who&#x27;s appeared on Reality Check previously and you can find that episode in the show archive.</p>
<p>Um they were tested by Dr. Hull Putoff, Russell Tag, both of whom are friends of the show. And uh it depends who you talk to. The CIA officially says there was never any evidence of psychic phenomena detected and that&#x27;s why the program was abandoned. I&#x27;m told by Russell Tag, who appeared on the show recently, that they did actually verify phenomena, psychic phenomena.</p>
<p>And more importantly, other sources have told me that Operation Stargate has continued often other under other names, other code word names, secret SAP projects. And I&#x27;ve actually spoken to people who&#x27;ve continued in the operation known as Stargate. So it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that Stargates kept on going. Was it your understanding TWW that because of the Stargate derivation for this operation there was something to to involving psychic phenomena psionic phenomena as it&#x27;s more popularly known these days that involved the operation that you were involved in sir. &gt;&gt; Um the Stargate was only referenced as the as the parent uh primary program to which Zero was formed out of.</p>
<p>I I had no no touch points, no connective tissue back to the Stargate program or nor was there an explanation as to it. Um they just referenced Stargate as as the primary. &gt;&gt; Sure. And I I want to respect and I don&#x27;t want to put you in a difficult position TWW and tell me and smack me if I&#x27;m going too far, sir. um the briefings that you were given obviously you don&#x27;t want to name the agency involved but are is it fair to say that you are more than satisfied that this was a US government intelligence agency or military agency that was very well aware of the program? &gt;&gt; Absolutely.</p>
<p>I I would I would I would know in preference with this. Um at the time I was extremely entrenched in the Ukrainian conflict. Um and there were there were other subsequent conversations moving around that ecosystem at the same time. Um and and that subsequently um to directly answer your question, I would find it hard to believe that the United States was was uh was not engaged at this point at some level. &gt;&gt; So this couldn&#x27;t be a hoax.</p>
<p>Basically, you haven&#x27;t been had by some crazy billionaire who&#x27;s used you pretending that this is a US government project. You&#x27;re more than satisfied that this was an official US government project done through different covers. &gt;&gt; I would uh I would answer directly under this premise of saying I couldn&#x27;t confirm or deny that because I don&#x27;t physically have that that documentation. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m very cautious about uh saying certain things in my opinion. Um what I would tell you is is that um I would look at the proximity of the prime contractor.</p>
<p>I would look in the proximity of who that prime contractor is attached to. Um and then subsequently I would let you make your own determination from there on uh on where that where that moves to. &gt;&gt; And TWW, I&#x27;ve obviously got to ask you this because I&#x27;m a nosy journalist and tell me to go away. Who was the prime contractor, sir? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t understand the question. &gt;&gt; I completely understand.</p>
<p>No worries at all. You mentioned a stone, a tablet. Where was this? Was this on the ground on the surface or was it buried underground? &gt;&gt; No, actually the uh the original the the and I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll use this for a little bit of support from Chad, but the original stone that was found um that shows the two skeletals actually fighting with each other, one stabbing the other. I didn&#x27;t find that particular stone. That stone was was part of the program coming into it.</p>
<p>Um, there were other stones that subsequently supported that stone that were in there, but that was the caveat coming in and that was really some of the intel that that I was given on the front side as to some of the artifacts that had been had been retrieved earlier. &gt;&gt; So, physically you you arrive at a church location. As I understand it, this whole operation was facilitated by an approach from a how do we say this? A very wealthy Mexican businessman. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; No, the the actually the approach came from again came out of Virginia. this became relationship driven on the ground for connected tissue because ultimately, you know, we we got the notification.</p>
<p>I think we were seven days out from from when we when we took on the mission to when we actually landed on the ground. Um we didn&#x27;t do we didn&#x27;t do anything that we historically do on the front side of of a mission set. This was more of just a P in in into the house and subsequently that was the introduction with that team in Mexico that uh that assisted with some political relationships. Were you given any military cover, sir? Was was there any security that was provided by the US to protect you during this retrieval operation? &gt;&gt; No, sir. Not not from the United States.</p>
<p>No. &gt;&gt; I I just find that incredible. I mean, I I the thing I don&#x27;t understand, Chad, is you and I both know operators who&#x27;ve been involved with DOE, they go in in full bow warfare suits. They&#x27;re toled up, armed to the teeth. There&#x27;s overhead security, perimeter security.</p>
<p>there&#x27;s there&#x27;s backup to make sure that the security site can&#x27;t be breached. This sounds to me like there&#x27;s been a terrible screw up. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it when you as TWW broke this down for me uh I I felt the same way and it made me you know I mean really concerning become you know become friends with TWW and the fact that he was put in that kind of position is upsetting. Uh I have I have friends right now who are on crash site ret retrieval teams and they are cautioning me as we go back into this you know to go back to the site like that these protocols are in place because uh even if it&#x27;s you know them advising me or supporting me outside of their official capacity because they care about me personally and uh one of my friends that&#x27;s a team lead there right now he has two guys that had a that had a uh made contact with a asset a year ago and they&#x27;re still they&#x27;re still uh they&#x27;re still hospitalized right now a year later. Uh, and so, &gt;&gt; so, so these are people who, when you say an asset, you&#x27;re talking here about a non-human technology of some kind or perhaps a biolog technology uh, that they made physical contact with uh, even with the protocols in place and they&#x27;ve been they&#x27;ve been hospitalized for a year now and so there&#x27;s a lot of concern uh, and you know, my friends of mine who care about me and so want to make sure that that we&#x27;re safe moving forward in this.</p>
<p>So, uh, we&#x27;re, you know, like I said, we&#x27;re not doing this recklessly. We&#x27;re going to take extreme precautions and make sure we&#x27;re doing things correctly. But but uh yeah, it&#x27;s I think back of you know how TWW got brought into this and um you know uh sometimes I believe I believe what what took place this is my opinion of of learning everything talking TWW I believe what took place was this was hasty because of uh the Chinese got got a hold of an asset from Mexico was able to extract that asset before the United States. So, it became a race for time and uh because it became a race for time, the easiest and and most efficient way to do it was to get contractors in, get them in quickly and uh and try to remove those assets and and and a lot of safety protocols were uh were bypassed in order for the sake of time. And uh sometimes that happens in um in logistics, sometimes it happens in battlefield where you uh you could either do it, you know, cheap, good or fast.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s kind of, you know, the kind of three things of business. You can do cheap, good, or fast. You can only do two of those things. You can do it, you know, cheap and faster, but you can&#x27;t do it good. Or you can do it good and fast, but you can&#x27;t do it cheap.</p>
<p>That kind of that kind of criteria goes. And I think what happened was, you know, China already got asset out and the US wanted to beat them to getting the rest of assets out. And uh and TWW and his team and other people got sucked into that. And uh and then there was some obviously some safety concerns that sounds like it cost some human life. Uh it cost TWW uh you know, his own health for a season.</p>
<p>and uh but but you know thankfully he&#x27;s okay but we want to make sure that we don&#x27;t make those same mistakes moving forward. &gt;&gt; Chad, you&#x27;re a former elite special forces operator. You&#x27;ve worked with Seal Team 6. I mean I think you know quite a few of the guys I&#x27;ve probably met over the years. Um the thing that I know they all are they&#x27;re good men and good women.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re patriots. They love their country. But that the lesson of the Mighty Oaks Foundation and thanks to you very much TWW for supporting that great charity is that we often take our armed service men and women for granted. Veterans get hurt. They they come back from war damaged.</p>
<p>Are you aware of I mean the the implications of what we&#x27;re talking about here are that there&#x27;s a covert battle going on and David Grush when he did his interview with me in June of 2026 he talked about the fact that there&#x27;s a covert cold war going on and it worries me that it suits certain men and women in the military and the intelligence community that this is all being done in private quietly covertly. Meanwhile, good people are getting killed. Are you aware, Chad, of an incident I&#x27;m aware of where there was a blue on blueue where JOC operators engaged each other and kinetically and a man was killed? &gt;&gt; Uh, I&#x27;m not sure which incident you would have been referring to, but I mean it&#x27;s happened in the past. Look, I mean, um, &gt;&gt; that was during a retrieval operation. &gt;&gt; I h I have not heard of that one.</p>
<p>Um, &gt;&gt; no. But I what what what really worries me TWW is I&#x27;m I&#x27;m aware of previous JC authorized oper operations where good men good men &gt;&gt; patriots bloody good operators were sent into an engagement and as I understand it operators who were funded by a private aerospace company they engaged kinetically and a man was killed. Have you heard of those kind of horrible mistakes happening TWW? I mean I I guess the reason I&#x27;m drawing the you on this sir is because it strikes me it suits these people to keep this private because they were happy to throw you to the scrape. You were expendable and other men have been expendable along the way. And this fundamentally angers me because it goes to the heart of what Mighty Oaks the Resilient Show is all about.</p>
<p>Helping our veterans, helping our warriors. Do you agree, TWW? &gt;&gt; Um, I would agree. I I don&#x27;t know specifically to the incident you&#x27;re talking about, but what I would say is is that there&#x27;s been uh like I think in um anytime you have kinetics, you you have the potential um for things to go right to left. But with this being said, I would, you know, to your point on on the the damage, the collateral damage to the veteran community out there. Um, it is absolutely disgraceful to what&#x27;s going on in the United States right now.</p>
<p>And I know even in in the UK, I&#x27;ve got a lot of relationships there as well and in Eastern Europe. Um, to see how the veteran communities are treated right now, especially within the VA system, especially within like I&#x27;ve lost commanders in my life that were very very close to me. um uh all because of a we&#x27;ll just say a cancer treatment that they couldn&#x27;t that the medical situation would not fund. Um you know we we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve jumped in and offered to do that but that would hurt their pension. It&#x27;s just to me it&#x27;s an absolute travesty.</p>
<p>I think the collateral damage is is that when you&#x27;re looking at uh when you&#x27;re looking at the defense space from a from a from a broad perspective and you understand the ecosystem that it is um I think it&#x27;s the largest business in the world to be clear. Uh I want to don&#x27;t don&#x27;t quote me on that but I believe I&#x27;m pretty close to that. Um subsequently is and I would ask you sir is is war about peace or is war about money. Um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to go with an ecosystem as capitalism. It drives certain certain networks.</p>
<p>It drives certain agendas and and subsequently the collateral damage is the volunteer is the soldier that actually walks into the battlefield to to support that narrative. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s wrong. I&#x27;m just saying that I&#x27;m not saying the battle&#x27;s wrong. I&#x27;m saying that the the support is wrong um ultimately because you&#x27;re you&#x27;re forgotten about for the most part and they say that you&#x27;re not, but historically you are. I know more operators that are dysfunctional now, especially special operators and um that are broken and subsequently can&#x27;t reintegrate back into society very well because they know one speed and subsequently they have a very difficult foundational placement as they move into civilian the civilian world.</p>
<p>This is this is this is very personal for me, sir, because I&#x27;ve become good friends with Jake Barber, who went public with his experience uh of having been exposed to something involving the phenomenon when he was asked to escort a box from a Middle Eastern location back to the United States. And he and his men were unwittingly involved in an exposure to what appears to have been anomalous radiation. And I I know Jake struggles with health issues as a result of that exposure and he&#x27;s a he&#x27;s a patriot. He unquestioningly does his duty and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve come to expect of our men and women in uniform. But the lesson the the lesson here, Chad, is isn&#x27;t it that that because this has largely been unaccountable.</p>
<p>This is a covert operation that&#x27;s been held and continues to be held under the cloak of special access programs, probably waved, unacknowledged special access programs. We&#x27;re putting men and women in danger as they&#x27;re not getting the help they need, are they? &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re right. And uh you know, I want to speak to to what you said because what you said is so important, Ross. Our men and women who serve in in you know, around the world, but we specifically talking right now, I can speak to the US military and every man and woman who&#x27;s dawned that uniform since 1775 and fought, bled, and died for our country. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re just a special it&#x27;s a special type of person that does that.</p>
<p>only half a percent of the United States serves. Uh and and and of the half a percent that serves, we talk about special operations world like you know you know 0.1% that serve in that capacity. These are very special human beings that uh you know were willing to do something willing to do the impossible for something they believe passionately passionately and in the powers to be have have the ability to take such an advantage of them because one of the first things you learn when you join the military and as you go into special operations you need to be critical thinkers and all those things but it&#x27;s immediate response to order. So when if you&#x27;re getting there&#x27;s no time in the battlefield when you get asked to do something uh you know the higher you get up in special operations of course again that&#x27;s critical thinking but you have to be able to respond to those orders. You got to be able to trust your leadership and so that that trust has been taken advantage of many times on the battlefields of combat and special these special access programs where we trust because we&#x27;re doing the right thing.</p>
<p>So we think those above us are doing the right thing. And uh the older I get, Ross, it it saddens me to say because I&#x27;m a patriot. I love this country and and I love the cause of freedom and will always give my life to defend uh defend freedom uh you know, to the day I die. But but TWW brought up a great point. In two 250 years of American sovereignty, we&#x27;ve only not been in war for 17 years.</p>
<p>Uh that&#x27;s there&#x27;s a you know you can look at why we&#x27;re not been at a war anything but 17 years but there&#x27;s a lot of money to be made on war and we&#x27;ve seen it I&#x27;ve seen it most clearly in the Ukraine conflict when you know when uh you know it&#x27;s just people make when wars are going people make money and uh in the the neocons in Washington DC and the war mobers of Washington DC uh have taken advantage of the men and women who dawn their uniform and willing to put their lives in the line lines every day and and uh and and not only are they put in places that they shouldn&#x27;t be put in very often times for the wrong reasons, but when they do, right or wrong, go to go to serve, they often come home and they&#x27;re not taken care of the way they deserve to. And and Mighty Oaks, I love Mighty Oaks. It&#x27;s my God put that burden on my heart to do for others what was done for me and I&#x27;ll pay it forward and continue to pay it forward. But Mighty Oaks should not exist. Our government should do everything above and beyond to where a nonprofit like Mighty Oak should never have to exist.</p>
<p>Yet there&#x27;s 50 50 plus thousand veteran service organizations in America that have to stand up in a deficit of our government not doing the right thing. Our Veterans Administration is the second largest budget in the entire United States government next to the DoD and and it&#x27;s it is broken and incompetent. I love Secretary Collins, Doug Collins, an amazing man. he&#x27;s been given a job that&#x27;s unfortunately unwinable and uh and our VA is broken and uh and so organizations like Mighty Oaks is standing in the gap uh backed by the uh by a grateful nation of patriots who love our who love our warriors. Well, I think the thing that I find most tragic, and I don&#x27;t want to get diverted by this, but the fact that so many veterans have have taken their own lives and that we don&#x27;t care enough for them with the PTSD that they suffer from the conflicts that we&#x27;ve asked them to get involved in and also the covert operations like these ones that they&#x27;ve been unquestioningly loyal about.</p>
<p>And if we demand unquestioning loyalty, we should also provide them with support. TWW, what what is the background to all of this? H how come you can speak about this? You obviously have a security clearance, I presume. And uh were you under any kind of NDAs or contractual undertakings of not to reveal this operation? &gt;&gt; Uh well, two things on that. One to to to correct. I do not have a clearance at the moment.</p>
<p>Uh I think that expired 18 years ago now. I mean, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s been a minute. Uh retired from the space in 16 and then subsequently went back into it in 22. So uh from 07 to 16 I was active and then subsequently moved moved away from that came home to retire in theory um and then subsequently pulled back into it in 22. But um no and then in and to to answer your your your second uh statement there um I guess I would I would have you reframe that.</p>
<p>So I I&#x27;ll answer in a very direct a very different a different way. &gt;&gt; Yep. Um, I tell you what, could I um can I ask you this way then? Is there anything legally that&#x27;s stopping you from talking about this operation in Mexico? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you think the public should know about the sacrifices that good people have made on the operation that you were involved in? &gt;&gt; I think the public should know about a lot of different things. This just being one of them.</p>
<p>Um unfortunately I think that uh you know we&#x27;re we&#x27;re we&#x27;re treated as sheep. Even even the the previous warriors the prior service warriors are treated as sheep unfortunately and and uh it&#x27;s not on a need to know basis but unfortunately it affects all of us as as as human beings and then and operators at that point. &gt;&gt; So you&#x27;re an influential businessman. You&#x27;ve got obviously clear mega relationships. You know people in the Trump camp I&#x27;m sure.</p>
<p>Have you engaged with anybody in the administration about the operation you&#x27;ve been involved in? &gt;&gt; Uh, no sir, not directly. I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve talked to well I mean how Chad and I met and subsequently I mean that that particular group I would say is is um probably has the ear of quite a few uh when it comes to that. So they&#x27;re all very aware of the situation in and and were for quite a while. So, um, but directly to your to answer your question, no, I have not spoken with the administration. Do I think that they&#x27;re aware of it? I think they&#x27;re more aware of of of what&#x27;s going on.</p>
<p>Maybe not this specific situation, but subsequently the u the program as a whole. &gt;&gt; You you&#x27;re obviously somewhat you&#x27;re obviously someone who has a relationship with the administration to the extent that you were invited to the inauguration. Um, if you were given the opportunity to speak to President Trump, what would you want to tell him about what you&#x27;ve witnessed? &gt;&gt; Um, well, I guess to be clear, I want to be clear about this. The reason that I was invited to the inauguration, Chad, I&#x27;ll probably step out over my skis on this one, but um, there was a request for me to run for governor of Texas. That&#x27;s what uh, that&#x27;s what I was doing at the at the inauguration.</p>
<p>That was the first time I&#x27;d ever been to one. Um, but subsequently, that was the purpose of of being there. um as I understood it. Chad had to hold me accountable for that one. I I don&#x27;t want to step outside the box there, but but um or I wouldn&#x27;t have been there to be clear.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not my not my cup of tea, not my forte. Um I do support I do support the administration. Um 10th generation Texan. We&#x27;re born into being a Republican here. I&#x27;m just going to lay that out there.</p>
<p>You know how it goes in Texas. You&#x27;re either in cattle or oil, but uh or land. And and uh the historical part of my family has been in all the above. you know, from from that aspect, I support the narrative. I support pus, whatever pus that is.</p>
<p>Uh to include the last few. Um but uh no, I would love to sit down and talk with him. Actually, &gt;&gt; I was going to say I I I think President Trump needs to know about this because the thing that worries me about the covert operation that we&#x27;re describing here, it&#x27;s not entirely clear to me that presidents have been briefed. I&#x27; I&#x27;ve spoken to people in the administration and I know there&#x27;s speculation. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily accurate that President Trump is poised to make a disclosure later this year.</p>
<p>I actually suspect the president&#x27;s not being briefed, that he&#x27;s not being told about the risks that our men and women are being exposed to. Chad, what do you say to that, sir? &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re right. I I just interviewed uh coming up, I think next week on uh the Brazilian show, I interviewed Congressman Berling Burlesman. uh Eli, Congressman Eli Crane, uh I&#x27;m I got a interview coming up with Congressman Bett. Um Congressman Luna, all all are, you know, these individuals are are part of uh the disclosure of government secrets.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re on a committee to disclose government secrets. And one of the biggest government secrets they&#x27;re looking to disclose is the UFO UAP uh information. And uh and one of the things that talking to Berles that they discovered is that so many things have functioned outside of not only the oversight of the executive branch outside the president&#x27;s uh perview but also outside of Congress which is super scary. There&#x27;s no a lot of these special programs that exist uh which is we thought this was rumor before we thought it was speculation from you know people like Dr. Steven Greer and stuff like that.</p>
<p>But it is confirmed now that these programs exist with no oversight. No oversight of of Congress, no oversight of the White House. And so the president of the United States doesn&#x27;t even have access to know what&#x27;s going on in some of these programs. And that&#x27;s and that&#x27;s a I mean essentially could say these programs are going rogue. And um and that&#x27;s a dangerous thing for anyone.</p>
<p>Everyone needs accountability. uh especially when you&#x27;re dealing with, you know, public taxpayer dollars uh running these programs that there&#x27;s no accountability. And uh &gt;&gt; TWW, one of the things I admire most about America is its constitution. It it has this wonderful constitution that enshrines the rights of all Americans. And it it particularly enshrines the right for Congress to have oversight of expenditure.</p>
<p>It it&#x27;s quite clear that in your career you&#x27;ve obviously handled billions of dollars of government money and you&#x27;ve been accountable for it. I&#x27;m sure the the auditors are accounting for every dollar that you spend. Um it strikes me that with this covert program that you appear to have found yourself on the periphery of getting sucked into this retrieval operation, there&#x27;s a hell of a lot happening that&#x27;s covert and undisclosed to the American taxpayer and to Congress, isn&#x27;t there? Um, absolutely. A lot more than this. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean, h how strongly do you feel, sir, about the need for disclosure? Do do you see the failure to tell the public the truth as part of a wider malaise in government? &gt;&gt; Uh, yes. I directly answer your question. Yes. I think ultimately that the uh the US population probably has a a fraction of the understanding of what&#x27;s truly going on right now in the world. Um right down to the inability for the Pentagon to balance a budget.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not going there, but I&#x27;m just going to throw under the bus. But I&#x27;m just I&#x27;m saying in in the in the commercial business sector, when you can&#x27;t balance a budget and you can&#x27;t balance your finances, the odds are you&#x27;re not in business. It&#x27;s very simple &gt;&gt; by by trillions. It&#x27;s uh I mean my taxes are off couple hundred bucks and I&#x27;m getting a I&#x27;m getting a call from IRS but we somehow our government could be off you know trillions of dollars. &gt;&gt; Can I ask both of you gentlemen? I mean Chad, you as a a former special forces combat operator and TWW, you as a a man who&#x27;s worked at the very apex of logistics support for the US military and intelligence community.</p>
<p>Do you think there&#x27;s any good reason for why the public shouldn&#x27;t know at the very least that the US is engaged in a covert investigation into non-human intelligence? Shouldn&#x27;t we as a public have the right to know about that? &gt;&gt; I I&#x27;ll answer I mean our government is a government of we the people. This it doesn&#x27;t our our country and our it does not belong to a group of elitists uh in Washington DC. Somehow the tables got flipped from what our founding fathers intended. Our founding fathers intended for representation of the people to be constituent to go from the industry to go represent for a period of time and then come back to that community, not to be career politicians. We were never intended to function that way.</p>
<p>And so the career politicians uh that exist with no term limits is one of the biggest problems that has uh that has uh taken America off the off of its tracks. And uh you know I think one of the things that solves all this would be term limits in within our government because uh you know again it&#x27;s not a represent representation of the the constituency now it&#x27;s a career uh career political elitist that separate themselves from the government. We so to answer your question, we the people have the right to know. Uh the government should not uh function outside of the will of the people and uh but that&#x27;s where we are. &gt;&gt; TWW, what&#x27;s your take on that? I mean, do you think the public&#x27;s got the right to know? Can you think of any good reason why the public should be withheld knowledge of the fact of a non-human intelligence engaging with the planet? &gt;&gt; Um in today&#x27;s society, I do.</p>
<p>if if I&#x27;m sitting back there from a strategic intelligence position because ultimately the the uh the mental stability of the American population right now in my opinion is relatively weak. Um and they&#x27;re easily influenced. So you know ultimately there there could be a a massive a massive shock wave that goes through a fear factor that leads to civil unrest and chaos just because everybody&#x27;s gotten a little bit dramatic about things these days. Uh but subsequently we should know and I think it&#x27;s I think it&#x27;s the I think it&#x27;s the I think it is the um the duty of of of inside the beltway or the politicians or the the leaders to be right now are in place that they should disseminate that information as to to a verifiable fact. &gt;&gt; Now TWW I&#x27;m going to ask you I I just want to quickly get one question into you sir.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to ask you a very specific question about the skull that you saw. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; The teeth. This is a question that&#x27;s pertinent to people who I am aware of who have a knowledge of alleged reptilian beings from within the legacy program. Tell me about the teeth.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s interesting. This is the second time I&#x27;ve been asking about the teeth. I was asking about it on Saturday night and I was at a uh at an event with my wife. But um and and the reason I bring that up is the the timeline of which I responded to that chat. It was it kind of in the moment and just kind of kicked it back.</p>
<p>But but look, we had we had we had two uh we had two particular skulls at that time that had two rows of teeth and and different canines too. I want to bring this up too, Chad. We didn&#x27;t really talk about this, but there were some K9 events in there that were that were extremely abnormal. Um, but then secondarily, you had you had uh other skeletons that didn&#x27;t have that had one set of teeth that looked very uh very similar to to what you would imagine. They didn&#x27;t look that have the shark look to it where you had multiple rows, but two specifically, one individually.</p>
<p>So, um, you know, I I didn&#x27;t know the variance or the impact of that of what that actually meant. uh after to this day. &gt;&gt; So just just so I&#x27;m clear TWW because this is really important. You&#x27;re saying there were two rows of teeth in was it the upper or the lower mandible? &gt;&gt; Lower. &gt;&gt; Really &gt;&gt; lower.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That is very significant and I&#x27;m sure there are people in the legacy program right now who are quite surprised that I&#x27;m asking that question. Chad, did you want to say something, sir? I didn&#x27;t want to cut you off. Well, I mean, it&#x27;s it was back to your kind of the motive of of public public disclosure. And by the way, I think it&#x27;s rumor. Who knows if it&#x27;s true or not? Uh I asked Congressman Burlesen, but uh the president supposedly has a speech prepared for July uh which is going to be a public disclosure of of uh you know this this subject.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s going to be, but supposedly that speech is supposed to happen in July. We&#x27;ll see. So, so do so is Eric Berles now saying that he thinks there is going to be a disclosure in July. &gt;&gt; He thinks there&#x27;s going to be a speech. He&#x27;s he&#x27;s not confirming it, but but he gave a pretty strong speculation that he believes uh believes that there&#x27;s going to be a speech.</p>
<p>Now, I mean, look, everything&#x27;s been derailed with with Epstein. So, I think they need to get ahead of themselves on that first and uh and and uh I think they need to get back to the will of the American people on that. Uh, I mean, I love this administration, but they can&#x27;t get by. They American the American people are not going to move on and we should not move on uh from from the victims of the Epstein files. And so, I think they have to get that uh under control.</p>
<p>But next would be, you know, hopefully this this disclosure. But what I was going to say what what was um it just my particular this is just my speculative opinion of why I think the UFO uh the secrecy behind UFOs, UAPs, and and extraterrestrial life. I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with hiding aliens, uh hiding things in Area 51. I personally think this has to do with the energy. Uh I mean when you talk about reverse engineered craft and technology uh the idea is out there that that we have the technology of of zero point energy and know if you if zero point energy is real which I believe it is real that&#x27;s a threat to the uh petrol industry and all the powers to be who make money in the petrol industry we&#x27;re talking you know I don&#x27;t even know the number thousands of trillions of dollars would be would world would become energy independent uh on a on a personal scale immediately, right? Everyone would have heat, everyone would have power, everyone would have uh unlimited supply of energy if we if zero point energy was was real and accessible to mankind.</p>
<p>So I think the secrecy is really behind energy and not so much the secrets of extraterrestrial. &gt;&gt; I completely agree with you, Chad. Uh TWW, what&#x27;s your take on that, sir? I mean, the Epstein files episode is is a sad example of government lack of accountability at the moment. How important is accountability both on Epstein and on the subject of non-human life? &gt;&gt; I I think accountability is something that&#x27;s lost in today&#x27;s society, period. And and I&#x27;ll just say this on my own behalf and speaking for myself.</p>
<p>I mean, look, that&#x27;s a painful that&#x27;s a painful experience sometimes to to own it. um because historically it&#x27;s around massive failures, not around massive wins. Um I&#x27;ve also been there too. Uh but what I would say to that is is two things. One, I would go back to look at our democracy and its current state today and look how it&#x27;s it&#x27;s been um it&#x27;s been it&#x27;s been manipulated over the the periods of time um to to its current status.</p>
<p>And what I believe if you look that up in the in the dictionary or you look it up Wikipedia I think they call that a dictatorship to a degree. Um our constitutional our constitutional rights and the way our forefathers actually put this together from the we have we have absolutely moved away from that concept. So uh in my opinion uh and there it is controlled by elitist it is controlled by money it is controlled by by certain powers to be but I would say this gentlemen I would say that China already has it and I would it appears that they do I&#x27;ll use that terminology and that vernacular but they&#x27;re ahead of us in that in that space and they have it. Do you think it&#x27;s possible, TWW, that the Chinese because they got there first, if there was technology on that site, it was the Chinese that got it first, wasn&#x27;t it? &gt;&gt; Um, well, not on this particular site. There were four crash sites uh totally from my understanding.</p>
<p>I went to I went to three of them. The fourth one I did not engage. That was the Chinese situation. Um, but the other crash sites have not been unearthed. They&#x27;ve not been excavated.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve not been touched. Um, so at this point, it would be plausible, it&#x27;d be realistic to think that that of course if China paid for something and and and if there was a a denominational change at some level to to to some sovereignty to sovereignty, I would think that of course that China would want that technology. And if they have they have one, then they would want them all in my opinion. Um, I&#x27;ve been told that they have not been have not been the other the other sites have not been engaged yet. So you didn&#x27;t see any technology when you were in the locations that you were excavating? &gt;&gt; No sir, no technology.</p>
<p>Um other other than other than u and and I can only relate this to something to something in the ecosystem that that some folks may be may be aware of and that&#x27;s called the syndrome. Um and how that works. I&#x27;ve never been mentally foggy. I&#x27;ve never been mentally compressed. I&#x27;ve never understood.</p>
<p>I mean, it got as bad to where the confusion was. I didn&#x27;t know whether I need to go up the escalator or down the escalator. I didn&#x27;t know if I No, it sounds so mundane and just so ridiculous because I look back at that. Um and and and I I can I complain. I didn&#x27;t see it at the time.</p>
<p>Understood it that something was wrong, but I didn&#x27;t understand what it was. Um got it coming back into Dallas. That was a completely different different situation. And then subsequently there there&#x27;s another video I was going to send you Chad that u my vow renewal with my wife that subsequently happened 4 days following. Um I actually spoke about this to the to the to the group of people there at at our at our event.</p>
<p>Um half of them were operational and the other half were not. Um, but I I probably went down a a little further deeper road, you know, than I should have that conversation because of the emotional drain that it took on my family to to go back and forth to that. &gt;&gt; So, TWW, you were living with the prospect. You were actually told you were going to die because you&#x27;d come into contact with this portal. Were you feeling ill? &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>Um, I had been feeling ill for a minute. Uh but in and again I mean to me it&#x27;s it goes back to the false narrative of of shock and awe and and and look I am extremely versed on on agency trade craft and and I&#x27;m not a fan of it but unfortunately you know they and that&#x27;s the way I interpreted the conversation when it when it happened. It was more more about putting fear into my into my mind and they needed to access me and they needed access to they needed me to come in to actually do some additional testing on of which I just basically said have a good day if if in the event of then I guess I&#x27;ll see you in two weeks uh if you guys show up for the funeral. &gt;&gt; And how long did it take for you get a to get a clearance? I mean were you preparing your affairs? Did you honestly think that this was real that you were going to die? Um, leading into this, well, I I guess let me let me back to something lead into the premise of this. Um, I&#x27;ve written my my wife and my family a letter, you know, if you&#x27;re reading this letter.</p>
<p>I think most guys in the space understand what I just said. Um, and I sent it to myself and then subsequently, that was Sunday night. I was leaving Monday morning. I I called my son, which was also my partner at the time and still is, but I said, uh, subsequently I said, uh, if something happens to me, I need mom to check my email. That&#x27;s all I need.</p>
<p>And from there, there&#x27;s a chain of events that are going to occur. Um, and he said, &quot;No, you&#x27;re going to be fine.&quot; And I said, &quot;Yeah, I I don&#x27;t know anything about this adversary.&quot; So, you know, I&#x27;m going into something extremely blind. And and yes, to your point, I was extremely concerned that um you&#x27;ve got all the factions in Mexico as well. I could have easily died from a car accident. I could have easily died from from stepping into the wrong in narcos controlled territory.</p>
<p>I mean, there&#x27;s a number of things that could have gone wrong, but um &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; When the new extraction team came in to retrieve the bodies, did they by any chance happen to wear protective clothing and masks and all of the gear that you weren&#x27;t given? &gt;&gt; No, sir.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They they weren&#x27;t they they weren&#x27;t. Do you know who they were? Were they government agencies or were they private contractors? &gt;&gt; Private contractors. They were flown in after the fact. The the uh the actual artifacts stayed in Mexico until they wouldn&#x27;t retrieve them and then they took them back to back to Virginia. &gt;&gt; In the time that you became aware that you were suffering or allegedly suffering exposure to something that the United States government was telling you was going to kill you, not may kill you, but will kill you.</p>
<p>In the time that you were living with that realization, were you offered any kind of medical treatment by the US government? &gt;&gt; No, sir. No. Don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s I just think that&#x27;s bloody ridiculous. I mean, if they&#x27;re going to ask you to do something, they should they should support you. &gt;&gt; Uh they&#x27;ve never supported me.</p>
<p>I want to be clear about that. Um I can&#x27;t pop smoke and somebody&#x27;s going to save me. That&#x27;s not that&#x27;s not Thank for 20 years. So, um at no time have I ever had the US government ever come to my aid for anything. Um it doesn&#x27;t get picko.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve never been there. we&#x27;ve supported them, but unfortunately they&#x27;re not going to support us. Um, and it&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re not, it&#x27;s just that that&#x27;s the way that the operations have always worked. &gt;&gt; Now, TWW, there&#x27;s a good chance, I suspect, that the US government might be watching this and thinking, well, this gives us plausible deniability. This justifies the reason why we used a contractor because he can&#x27;t prove that it was us that commissioned him.</p>
<p>What do what would you say to that? Would you be in a position if say for example a I mean if if there was a a meeting of the Senate Intelligence Committee and you were called to Congress by good people in Congress who want testimony about this kind of thing. Would you be able to provide evidence of your involvement in retrievals? AB &gt;&gt; absolutely fact-based information is is that&#x27;s not my concern. It&#x27;s the concern of it being whether or not that would have been embraced from a from a leadership perspective and how much they actually knew about it. Uh to your earlier statement about whether or not pus is clearly understanding the a few things going on. I know for a fact that that&#x27;s not it can&#x27;t be the case.</p>
<p>It just simply can&#x27;t be under certain programs. Um I I know he&#x27;s not read on on everything and all things going on governmentally right now. Can I ask both of you gentlemen, coming back to the fact that you&#x27;re both men of faith, if you were asked to swear on the Bible that what you have told me here today is the truth and nothing but the truth, what would you say, TWW? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Um, you know, &gt;&gt; right hand and we&#x27;ll swear that in.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I think I think you know I think both of us just uh you know I I can say from TWW TWW is a person who has nothing to gain by you know publicly I mean you publicly trying to you know embellish a story or anything like that and you know I run a podcast so I I there&#x27;s incentive there for me but uh but for TWW he&#x27;s not in the space he&#x27;s not in the media space he&#x27;s there he&#x27;s he&#x27;s wanting to just share his experience and uh and bringing public awareness and for me the reason I&#x27;m in the media space and is because I I believe every story I share helps I share it for one reason one reason only to help better people&#x27;s lives make them more resilient that&#x27;s so it&#x27;s called the resilient show sharing stories of resilient people and uh and the only way to really do that effectively is through sharing truth and u you know I&#x27;m on a journey as well just like you Ross and and everything you do I&#x27;m on a journey for truth and I want to share that journey with other people and uh so it has to be authentic so yes &gt;&gt; so TWW if push comes to shove if President Trump rings you or if say the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee or the Armed Services Committee ring you and say, &quot;Sir, will you come to Congress and testify in a skiff and tell the truth and nothing but the truth about what you&#x27;ve told us today? Will you tell them what you&#x27;ve told us?&quot; &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; A little deeper than that. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s time, isn&#x27;t it, both of you? It&#x27;s time the public was told the truth. I personally know many good people are sick of being gaslit.</p>
<p>The American public is sick of being gaslit by a government, an intelligence community, and a military that&#x27;s consistently lied to the public about this for 80 plus years. It&#x27;s time, TWW, isn&#x27;t it, for the public to know the truth. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s overdue. That that bill is overdue. That bill should have been paid a long time ago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, I think our our kids, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m looking at generations in front of me that I don&#x27;t even know yet. Unfortunately, they are not going to grow up in the same world we did. Um, and and that&#x27;s mildly concerning. And that that&#x27;s probably one of the biggest anxiety points that I have in in in my world right now is knowing that we have the operational ability and I&#x27;m saying from a community from an from a from a global human humanitarian standpoint to to actually enforce change. Politically, we do not.</p>
<p>particularly particularly if it&#x27;s from a national security standpoint. We have the right to know the state of our security as as as citizens. I believe that standpoint. But if technology is being kept from us, if if zero point energy is is is available to everybody around the world and everybody around the world we talking about defeating hunger and and and and being warm and and you know if we could have that technology available and that&#x27;s being withheld from us because there are people in Washington DC the people in power are keeping that from us out of greed. Uh that&#x27;s an atrocity.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s uh and uh and that you know that needs to be that that truth needs to be exposed. &gt;&gt; But TWW, you&#x27;re a leader in business. You know how much the pro dollar, the US dollar being pegged to the oil market keeps the US economy going. I mean, one of the things I find incredible from my country, Australia, is the extent of the multi-tens of trillions of dollars in unsustainable debt that&#x27;s that&#x27;s basically keeping the US economy going. and and it just seems impossible that you&#x27;re ever going to be able to repay that debt.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t the reality, sir, that if the US admits it is in possession of 0 point energy technology, of alien technology, this could actually put the whole US economy in jeopardy. I mean, think I want to put your your governor hat on as the governor of Texas, a state that that potentially makes, you know, tens of billions of dollars a year for the US economy out of oil. We stick it in the ground and you pull it out. What What do you say to that? I mean, what we&#x27;re talking about here, it&#x27;s not just an awareness of a non-human intelligence. What we&#x27;re talking about here is an absolutely massive change to the US economy, to the world economy, aren&#x27;t we? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re talking about we&#x27;re talking about um humanity changing at that level.</p>
<p>But I I would lead you with this. Uh global global economies collapse at sub40 oil. Uh they also collapse at post120 oil. Um where I would go with that is and that oil&#x27;s controlled from a from a very interesting mechanism in the in the trading and speculative market. So to your point, we are the petro dollar.</p>
<p>Are we backed by gold? Are we backed by backed by oil? Um, look, we can we can throw the we can throw the analogies out there that we&#x27;re a gold back sovereignty and we&#x27;re gold back currency. That could in my opinion, I&#x27;m not an economist, but my opinion that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth. Um, I have seen uh been around the oil business specifically for many generations of my life. I know me personally was 2010 on, but um subsequently let me let me put it to you like this. Yellow Cab didn&#x27;t think Uber was a threat until they were.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. So, Exxon doesn&#x27;t think this is a threat until it is. So, you&#x27;ve got more &gt;&gt; TWW&#x27;s doing that. &gt;&gt; I I understand you&#x27;ve got a daughter who&#x27;s interested in the UAP subject. Does she talk to you about her interest in the subject? &gt;&gt; Very much so.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, my 24year-old uh wild child, as I call her, love her to death. But, uh, yeah, she comes up with some stuff. And, and here&#x27;s the thing, though. I I I I I kind of dismiss it because I don&#x27;t want to engage it if that makes any sense. Um just mentally don&#x27;t want to want to spend the time on understanding it any better, but she&#x27;s into it.</p>
<p>Uh she certainly travels and I mean she certainly tracks a lot of it. &gt;&gt; Can I get a clear statement from you? Is it fair to say what&#x27;s your take on this? I mean, from what you&#x27;re telling me, it sounds to me like you&#x27;re saying unequivocally you are now absolutely convinced that the tech that that what you saw was a nonhuman intelligence, an alien body, that the United States is concealing evidence of non-human intelligence. What do you say to that? &gt;&gt; I I would uh I would bet my entire life and career credibility on it that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s true in fact. And I know it&#x27;s more so just than this. I mean there there&#x27;s other instances out there right now.</p>
<p>I mean you couldn&#x27;t convince me otherwise. How does that sound? &gt;&gt; Well, thank you sir for sharing and and I think showing genuine courage in speaking out. Uh and I think also coming back to you Chad. I I know TWW is a big supporter of Mighty Oaks. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And it really it really matters this it matters to me that veterans have died. And in fact, I know veterans have been murdered to protect this secret. That&#x27;s the terrible thing. &gt;&gt; TWW, ultimately you guys are expendable, and that&#x27;s wrong. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; Chad, what&#x27;s your take on this &gt;&gt; on on the fact that uh the expendability of of people with the protective secrets? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, um yeah, I I I think uh you know, I think it goes back to what I was what I was, you know, speaking of earlier. We we are we were you know our founders set us set America up to be a very special this is the great American experiment that&#x27;s has never happened before in the history of the world and and it&#x27;s succeeded until you know now we&#x27;re on the brink of it not succeeding because people have taken it from what it&#x27;s meant to be. It&#x27;s meant to be a a government set up for the people. We&#x27;re a constitutional republic set up for the people and by the people and and people have people in power have taken their duties as as uh as as representatives and and and taking a le and they taken that power away from the people and it has to come back to the people and all these problems that you&#x27;re talking about uh the manipulation, the control, the abuse of power, it all comes back from just from people who have taken our government away from what it was intended to be. And uh and so we are at a time in our country that if we are gonna if we&#x27;re going to be the the beacon of freedom in the world, which by the way I believe unfortunately I know this is not going to be insulting to you uh Ross, but uh Australia I don&#x27;t believe is a free country anymore.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t believe uh Canada is a free country. I don&#x27;t believe Europe Europe&#x27;s a free country. I believe America barely is a free country anymore. And the last stand of hope of freedom in in the world is in America. And if we can&#x27;t preserve that and fight for that by giving the power back to the people, then it it&#x27;s lost for humanity.</p>
<p>And uh if any other country in the world has hope to get their freedoms back, that that stand has to come with American giving their regaining their their power back to the people. &gt;&gt; TWW, I had a sense you wanted to add to that, sir. &gt;&gt; I was going to say something. It was nonable. There was a there was a comment that that Chad had made.</p>
<p>I was going to back on to that with a with another statement. Um, look, the global economy and the geopolitical situation in the United States is is has left uh our country an extremely vulnerable state right now. Um, and where I would go with that is I think we&#x27;re in a pendulum over the next 24 months where we&#x27;re going to know how this is going to go right to left. Um, it&#x27;s either going to go really good or it&#x27;s going to go really bad. Um, but unfortunately, I think it&#x27;s safer in Baghdad than it is in the United States right now in some places.</p>
<p>I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m just gonna throw that out there. I look at the body counts in Dallas and Houston every night. We watch the just the friction. I&#x27;m just talking about Texas specifically, but you know, Texas is a Texas a place in my opinion. Um and it&#x27;s losing its uh it&#x27;s losing its roots.</p>
<p>Um things are changing dramatically. &gt;&gt; Well, TWW, I&#x27;ll speak for a lot of people here. If you don&#x27;t run for governor, you&#x27;re a bloody idiot, sir. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s got my vote, too, Ross. She&#x27;ll be all over it.</p>
<p>But uh no, it&#x27;s Look, I I appreciate it, gentlemen. I really do. It&#x27;s certainly a fight that I that uh I underestimated. I&#x27;ll say that. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you for your courage. Thank you for both of you in speaking to us today on Reality Check. Thank you to the Resilient Show and the Mighty Oaks Foundation. And um Chad Roachar, thank you so much for uh talking to us.</p>
<p>TWW Mock, thank you, sir. And I sincerely hope that the right people in power start listening to what good men like you are talking about. Thank you again. &gt;&gt; We appreciate the opportunity. We promise to keep you a breast of uh of of the future endeavors that we, you know, when we get back down there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; When do you plan heading down there, Chad? Can we come? &gt;&gt; We we plan on doing it uh pretty pretty quickly. We don&#x27;t want to sit on it. So, uh, we&#x27;re going to do it as as fast as we can do it safe and proper. But, uh, we, you know, within within the weeks and months ahead, we plan on ex that Ross, that that answer is yes, you&#x27;re more than welcome to to join. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;d be very honored to.</p>
<p>Thank you so much. Thank you to both of you again. And and thank frankly, I think I should say this. It&#x27;s very touching this. Thank you to both of you for your service.</p>
<p>And thank you to those men. Thank you to those covert men and women who&#x27;ve never been acknowledged, who&#x27;ve given their lives, and we&#x27;ve never heard their names. And I hope one day I hope one day their names are recorded. &gt;&gt; Leave it with you. All the best, guys.</p>
<p>And uh everybody on reality check who&#x27;s watching this, I can promise you we are going to follow this story like a dog on a bone. We&#x27;re not letting go. We are going to chase this one very very hard. I know from my own sources that the credentials of both TWW Mock and Chad are absolutely impeccable and I defy the defense and intelligence community to try and write this one off as a crazy hoax.</p>
