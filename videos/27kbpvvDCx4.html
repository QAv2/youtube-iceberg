            <p>I&#x27;m Tim Ventura for American anti-gravity comm and this is a follow-up interview with dr. Eugene Parkman off world-famous Russian physicist and chemist known for his work into gravitational waves and gravity beam generation during our previous interview dr. Paul clean off told us that he&#x27;d been able to generate hundreds of pounds of force in beams of pure gravitational energy and we&#x27;re conducting a follow-up interview to learn a little bit more about the details of his experiment dr. Park laughs can you hear me okay one of the responses that we had online was with nearly a decade of experience why have we been able to see video or photos of your experiments up until now which do not allow to make any photos it&#x27;s the policy which is accepted at this scientific Center oh absolutely well in light of the publicity they&#x27;ve had recently have you given thought to doing any photos or video in the near future I think I will try to make something I discussed this possibility with administration they think it might be possible but at present we had no videos and no photos at all oh okay well I look forward to hopefully receiving some in the future you know if it turns out that it is possible well to move along have you been able to obtain funding from government or private interests has there been a fair amount of interest that&#x27;s come forward and tried to provide some funding for your experiments interest from several circuits but it&#x27;s private sector mainly because governmental policy but all the research in the field of gravity and experimental gravity is it&#x27;s not a popular trend so we don&#x27;t get much money from the government of course we use the ready installations at the technological center but there is some interest in general all over the world and in the United States and Great Britain but we didn&#x27;t get any funding from the government we get rather small funding from private sector as I mentioned but our plans are really amazing and we need considerable funding so this topic gravity is first of all it is a bit unusual and we need some exotic material we need special installations we need cryogenic systems also we need the help of people who are top qualified in their own areas and this all yeah definitely well you know with with the actual testing one of the questions that had occurred to me when I was you know when I sat down and took a little bit of time was it you know as these are presumed to be gravity beams have you noticed any time effects because it&#x27;s not practically a gravity beam it&#x27;s a gravity impulse so it&#x27;s very short in time and because of these limitations as it is shortened tire we didn&#x27;t notice any time effects and didn&#x27;t even try to measure maybe they&#x27;re present they are working with the rotating disc salutely that that makes perfect sense well you know I I was wondering on a personal note you&#x27;d mentioned that this was over hundreds of pounds of force for a very short period of time and I&#x27;d wondered has this has this been able to punch holes through lightweight substances or is it more of just kind of emotion on them it depends on the voltage that we apply and also on the structure of the superconducting ammeter so at the maximum possibility of our materials at present we can obtain brothers and big impulses so they are able to deform metal plates with the thickness of a couple of injures and they&#x27;re able to make holes in concrete walls so we&#x27;re not speaking about some lightweight substances but concrete whoa is something very solid and they deform metal in the way that a hydraulic press might do it but the impulse is very short in time so of course we can build a system and use several Marx generators so we can give a series of impulses that will definitely improve the situation we can treat different materials with our gravity impulse generator and also what is important that we can absolutely well you know in in terms of putting holes through concrete it makes sense that the holes would remain but with metals after the metal is deformed do they snap back after the beam is gone or do they remain to form an explosion oh okay okay you know I&#x27;m planning on buying a small superconductor and testing some myself hopefully I don&#x27;t have a five million volt system I think five thousand with a very high amperage so hopefully I doubt that it would do metals but I thought maybe paper might be something to experiment with and see if like well I&#x27;ll definitely have to move forward with that well one of the things I was wondering about was whether you&#x27;ve been able to do efficiency calculations for the force beam Giovanni Martinez calculated some preliminary made sample in their measurements and gave the forces in girls but we practically did not try to calculate we wanted to simply to see the results and how their different objects react to the action of this impulse so we didn&#x27;t make any precise calculations oh okay you&#x27;d mentioned in the past that this tends to defy conventional relativity theory I was wondering if you might have any specific examples of things that caught your eye as maybe being not right or outside of what the theory predicts well first of all I didn&#x27;t say that our experiments defy conventional relativity theory now and they don&#x27;t but if we speak about the experiment with the rotating disks I simply mentioned that we&#x27;re rotating metal of superconducting objects at very high speed and as these rotations around its own axis is not an absolute rotation so it&#x27;s absolute movement it&#x27;s not relative that&#x27;s why the relativity theory is not applicable to our dating discs because it&#x27;s entirely different thing oh ok so it just doesn&#x27;t apply but it doesn&#x27;t invalidate at all that and I I should apologize for getting that one incorrect Oh does the does the inertia change in proportion to changes in mass the the reason that I kind of wrote that down was really in relation to Fran D akeno&#x27;s research and he believes that these aren&#x27;t equal that they just tend to appear equal to to us in our friend of reference but I was experience we did not make any difference between gravitational and inertial mass so we think that they&#x27;re equal also in case with the impulses the impulses are too short in time to make to notice any difference and we didn&#x27;t make any special experiments just to distinguish okay Oh in terms of the actual emitter the superconductor you know I&#x27;d read the experimental write-up I believe it was 47 millimeters if I remember correctly but I was wondering if changing the size or shape effects the beam output maybe makes it stronger or refocuses at perhaps the superconductor shouldn&#x27;t be smaller than 4 inches because of the Schwarz Schwarzschild radius and different shapes and the impulse will repeat the projection of a certain shape so it is important oh okay well that may rule out my experiment I the largest I&#x27;ve seen online I think it&#x27;s a one-inch superconductor in the United States at least so not sure if they sell 4 inch ones although if they did it would be worth the money any good results with smaller superconductors and also it&#x27;s much more difficult to get discharge well have you noticed any changes in the molecular structure or maybe compression for the targets that you&#x27;ve sent a beam through like you&#x27;ve mentioned metals deforming and holes through concrete oh okay so it&#x27;s just a large-scale deformation from force but not anything internal them oh I shouldn&#x27;t ask if the beam loses energy as it penetrates materials does it does it naturally decrease with distance but well that&#x27;s an interesting question and to our great surprise and we made a lot of discharges so the installation was working for about four years now they beam practically does not lose energy when it meets the materials it can pass through the brick wall or concrete or metal plates very thick ones and plastic materials also it seems that it doesn&#x27;t lose energy at all which seems a bit strange but we don&#x27;t want to break any laws and simply the system where we are working it&#x27;s not a closed one therefore the second law of thermodynamics is again not applicable here and if we speak about the actions with a distance the dependence of the energy on the distance we don&#x27;t have much experimental data but what we have now is the first measurement at the distance of 1.2 kilometers and there is no loss of energy and the latest experiments the distance was 5 kilometers and they beam penetrated through several houses which made which were made of concrete so we did not measure any loss of energy but according to some calculations and the evaluations that we made with a distance of more than 100 kilometers we should get some decrease of the energy so it&#x27;s this work awaits us in the future oh ok hey you know as well you&#x27;d mentioned 5 kilometers did you notice any change in the focus of the beam did it did it widen or perhaps get smaller as it as it travels the main solenoid which is around around the chamber is made in a good way then we have a very good discharged and practically it contains the same form as it was with the distance of five kilometers we notice that there is the beam is not so focused it&#x27;s it goes a bit bit wider than it was so there are some deviations in the in the shape of the impulse it becomes a bit wider oh okay you know one of the I collected a few questions online and one person had written me is it possible to generate more work along the path of the beam than energy put into the beam I think they were asking about potential overunity applications [Applause] well it&#x27;s surprising that the energy that we put inside the discharge it&#x27;s much less than the energy which the impulse produces and the work that it can make is bigger than the energy that we put inside the beam but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an over unity device simply we create the conditions when the interactions of magnetic field and electric field and special behavior of the bose-einstein condensate so with all these parameters we provide the interaction of the fields and of the material with the subatomic particles we may call it zero-point energy or whatever it is or ever but anyway when normal matter interacts with subatomic particles [Applause] special energy is obtained and we can use this energy so our installation is like a key which opens the energy of the subatomic particles our explanation sure sure well and it sounds like it is kind of opening up and perhaps in some ways more energy even is immediately available yeah that&#x27;s right also we are not speaking about any closed system this system is an open one and we don&#x27;t break any laws from our point of view oh okay well you would mentioned that you&#x27;re actually working on some publications and I guess in some ways that kind of ruins my next question that I&#x27;ve collected online they&#x27;d asked if you&#x27;re going to publish more in the near future well of course the interest to this problem is growing in all the countries we got a very interesting offer from China from they have a special project at the University of Beijing and there is a certain interest from the private sector in the United States so as soon as we get the funding we will try to organize all these experiments in a more detailed way but at present what is extremely interesting that we measured or we tried to measure the interaction of this beam with a light and some preliminary results were published last year in the Journal of low-temperature physics it was in August it&#x27;s my article with Giovanni Martinez and we continue this work now and also we tried to measure the speed the propagation speed of the impulse and we are very cautious about it because we don&#x27;t want to frighten the scientific community and also we want to be absolutely sure that the results were checked and rechecked several tens of times but it seems that based on what we have now and we&#x27;re already working for a year and a half on this the speed of the impulse is much higher than the speed of light and with the parameters that we use now with the present the meters and the voltage of three and five million volts this speed is about 63 64 C which means that the propagation speed of the impulse is close it is typically 64 times faster than the speed of light we would like of course to measure all these parameters using different measurement systems different approaches doesn&#x27;t we used two atomic clock and we think that our experiments were precise enough we would welcome of course the advice of the international community and the advice on how to measure the speed of the impulse in a very precise way as soon as we get good confirmation of the results we will try to publish all this information oh okay so there&#x27;s definitely more coming along you know one thing that I found helps with the lifter experiments and others that I&#x27;ve conducted and again if you you know once you reach the point of taking film I found that fill analysis helps a lot at least for my experiments and one of my favorites has been working with smoke and cloud chambers and you know by by stopping the tape and rewinding I found that I can find a lot of little things going on I never noticed that you know at the time I filmed it so you know perhaps that may be something that&#x27;ll be valuable if you&#x27;re able to bring a camera and get some photos yes that&#x27;s a very good approach we&#x27;ll take it into consideration of course well you know I was wondering you&#x27;d mentioned that there&#x27;s interest from the private sector in the United States and from China but do you know if there are any duplication efforts or replications underway by other groups for your your research interest in growing but I don&#x27;t know their secrets and I know that the Department of Defense in the United States is also interested in this program and that&#x27;s why they invited dr. Ming Lee to lead the scientific laboratory official replication of microwave experiments and the official attitude of the political science to this problem is negative so it creates a lot of difficulties but I don&#x27;t write anything and if people contact me directly or by email I usually try to give all the advice that I haven&#x27;t to share all the experience because the problem is too complicated for one country or for one lab to succeed and the gravity should be studied all over the world using the best forces and the brains of different scientists absolutely well and I&#x27;ve always had great success in terms of contacting you and evils been incredibly helpful with my questions and and so I&#x27;m sure others will have a similar experience but you know one of the obstacles to independent replications it sounds like is the 4 inch superconductor do you know if those are manufactured and sold anywhere or is it a process that everyone has to go through to build their own well frankly speaking it&#x27;s a part of my know-how but if we speak about extremely effective emitters but normally meters which allow simply to measure small effects it&#x27;s not a problem and I think that American Superconductor can help easily to make the emitters of this kind also there is a nice firm called super conductive components in Ohio Columbus in the United States and they are more or less familiar with my technology and they can I think make their contribution oh okay so essentially by using a smaller superconductor you have a smaller effect but that can be tested using more sensitive equipment well still the diameter that this should be not less than four inches now I speak about the structure the structure for very efficient emitters is a bit difficult and it takes a lot of experience to achieve this structure so even if I give the detail the description I&#x27;ve been difficult to make it without my help but with normal emitters which allow you to push a thick book away from the table it&#x27;s possible to make it it&#x27;s not so complicated oh okay okay well you know I had one other question about this person was also asking that video but they were also asking about a moving flat glow discharge and this was something I thought might be in your notes perhaps that I had missed when I read through them in order to make the video for the flag low discharge we should use a high-speed video camera which we don&#x27;t have at present so we just want to rely on our game sucks but it&#x27;s a bit difficult to make it but even with I where we have normal discharge I mean a spark as in Van de Graaff generator or a thread glow discharge which repeats the configuration of emitter it&#x27;s possible to see it with your own eyes we don&#x27;t need any cameras oh okay well just to wrap things up because we&#x27;re almost out of time again it sounds like getting amazing results you&#x27;re able to actually you know put holes through concrete and Bend metals with this say five million volts you know these are remarkable results is there anything you&#x27;d like to say in close I don&#x27;t think that these results are remarkable in general this subject called experimental gravity research it has a very big potential and if we compare the complicated process this problem is to the problem of let&#x27;s say nuclear explosion I think that gravity research is much more complicated but even if we speak about nuclear power there was a period in the United States when everybody was interested and military people wanted to make some researchers and the government was interested and then people came and said could you please make a small explosion and then we will make we will give you money for a big one and it&#x27;s impossible to make a small nuclear explosion somewhere under ventilation same thing refers to gravity it&#x27;s an enormous problem and we can&#x27;t get much if we don&#x27;t have an organized approach as it was in the nuclear program for example in the United States so only combining the knowledge of current fields of different physicists and chemists and material scientists theoretical physicists only making them work together we can make a breakthrough in this field because it&#x27;s a very very serious research absolutely well thanks again for your time and we definitely look forward to following up with you more in the future thank you you&#x27;re welcome working with the rotating discs definitely and we had some some experience with this but with great impulse generator we simply didn&#x27;t organize any measurements absolutely that that makes perfect sense well you know I I was wondering on a personal note you&#x27;d mentioned that this was over hundreds of pounds of force for a very short period of time and I&#x27;d wondered has this has this been able to punch holes through lightweight substances or is it more of just kind of emotion on them voltage that we apply and also on the structure of the superconducting ammeter so at the maximum possibility of our materials at present we can obtain a big impulses so they are able to deform metal plates with the thickness of a couple of inches and they&#x27;re able to make holes in concrete I&#x27;m Tim Ventura from american anti-gravity comm and this is a follow-up interview with dr.</p>
