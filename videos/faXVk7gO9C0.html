            <p>♪ &gt;&gt;KENT JUSTICE: 9 OF THE 10  O&#x27;CLOCK NEWS. A NOW FORMER  JACKSONVILLE POLICE OFFICER  FINDS HIMSELF ON THE WRONG  SIDE OF THLAW.EARLR  DAY, SHERIFF PK WATERS  ANNOUNCED THE ARREST OF  CHRISTOPHER BAR. HE&#x27;S ACCUSED  OF ACCESSING INFORMATION  UNRESTRICTED LAW ENFORCEMENT  DATABASES AND SENDING THAT  INFORMATION TO SUSPECTS IN A  JSO CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. AS  NEWS 4 JAX REPORTER ERIK  EXPLAINS. THERE&#x27;S A STRONG  POSSIBILITY THE CRIMINALS ARE  CONNECTED TO GANGS.</p>
<p> &gt;&gt; JSO INVESTIGATORS TELL NEWS  4 JAX THAT ON 2 OCCASIONS  WHILE CHRISTOPHER BAR WAS  STILL A COP, HE ACCESS TO  DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT  DATABASES AND SENT INFORMATION  ABOUT WITNESSES AND A JSO  CRIMINAL CASE TO MULTIPLE  PEOPLE WHO ARE SUSPECTS. IN  THAT CASE. YOU&#x27;RE ON THE  INSI WITH PRIVY TO THAT  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND  NEWS 4 JAX CRIME AND SAFETY  ANALYST TOM HACKNEY IS A  RETIRED JSO DIRECTOR OF  INVESTIGATIONS AND DIRECTOR OF  PERSONNEL AND PROFESSIONAL  STANDARDS WITHIN JSO. HE SAYS  THERE&#x27;S A REASON WHY LAW  ENFORCEMENT DATABASES ARE  RESTRICTED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT  OFFICERS. ONLY WE&#x27;RE KIND OF  INFORMATION.</p>
<p>CAN A POLICE  OFFICER OCTANE WHEN THEY GO  INTO THESE DATABASES? IT&#x27;S  IT&#x27;S SO MUCH INFORMATION  THAT&#x27;S IN THERE. AND ANYBODY  WHO&#x27;S EVER BEEN A VICTIM OF A  CRIME. ARE WITNESSING A CRIME.  &gt;&gt; ALL THE TRAFFIC STOP  INFORMATION. ANYBODY WHO  STOPPED RECEIVED A TICKET.</p>
<p>A  FIELD INVESTIGATION REPORT IS  WRITTEN ON THEM. THERE&#x27;S  THERE&#x27;S QUITE A BIT OF  INFORMATION. THEY&#x27;RE  ACCEPTABLE INFORMATION THAT  SHOULD NEVER GET INTO THE  WRONG HANDS. ACCORDING TO  INVESTIGATORS, BAR MAY HAVE  SUPPLIED GANG MEMBERS WITH  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. DOES  THIS BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE FOR  PEOPLE WHO MAY BE INVOLVED IN  THIS CASE AS WITNESSES OR EVEN  THE OFFICERS? YEAH,  &gt;&gt; IT THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS  WHEN WHEN THESE CASES LIKE  THIS OCCUR THAT NOT ONLY  EXPOSES POTENTIAL UNDERCOVER  OFFICERS, BUT CERTAINLY  VICTIMS AND WITNESSES IN  CASES.</p>
<p> &gt;&gt; WHOSE INFORMATION IS  PROTECTED BY LAWN AND THEY  WANT THAT PROTECTED TH&#x27;RE  POD TH TH COULD LEAD  TO BAD CONSEQUENCES. HACKNEY  SAYS FROM AN INVESTIGATORS  STANDPOINT.  &gt;&gt; WHEN A POLICE OFFICER IS  SUSPECTED OF SUPPLYING  CRIMINALS WITH INFORMATION.  THE FIRST THING THE  INVESTIGATOR THINKS ABOUT IS  WHETHER THAT OFFICER IS ON THE  CRIMINALS PAYROLL SO FAR JSO  HAS NOT CONFIRMED BAR WAS PAID  TO COMMIT HIS ALLEGED CRIMES.  &gt;&gt;JOHN GAUGHAN: WHEN WE  CHECKED OUR OWN DATABASE ON  JSO OFFICERS WHO WERE  PREVIOUSLY ARRESTED FOR THE  SAME CRIME, WE FOUND THAT  THERE WERE 6 THAT DATE ALL THE  WAY BACK TO 2011.</p>
<p>THE 2 MOST  RECENT SES WERE IN 2021.  REPORTING LIVE</p>
