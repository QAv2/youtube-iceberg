            <p>hello YouTube I&#x27;m dr. Ronald abuse at founder and chair of the International Society of unified science and president trans power corporation a commercial and custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company and an engineering and management consultancy today we&#x27;re going to look at some more confirmations of the reciprocal system of theory first up is this very large quasar blast which was reported in science daily back in 2012 so let&#x27;s look at this science daily says quote biggest black hole blast discovered most powerful laser alpha ever found well dear nothing supposedly comes out from a black hole but my opponents and conventional physics keep telling us well quasars are powered by black holes of let&#x27;s garbage they&#x27;re powered by ongoing supernova explosions so I&#x27;m gonna go down here just to look at the summary it says here astronomers using esos very large telescope VLT of discover your quasar with less energetic outflow ever seen at least five times more powerful than any that have been observed today quasars are extremely light galaxy centres powered by supermassive black holes which parenthetically that&#x27;s nonsense many of last huge amounts of material out into their host galaxies and these outflows play a key role in the evolution of galaxies that&#x27;s also nonsense but until now observe quasar outflows weren&#x27;t as powerful as predicted by theorists actually what&#x27;s going on is the quasars were result of supernovae explosions from galactic huge galactic explosions then the quakers themselves start exploding supernovae type 2 and that material eventually leaves our material sector for the other half of the universe the cosmic sector so that&#x27;s the real truth what&#x27;s going on with this particular quasar is that as discombobulating materials leaving our sector for the cosmic sector okay let&#x27;s look at number two do supernovae type 1a or really just no big now this is kind of interesting so let&#x27;s just go look at this this is from UC Santa Barbara currents Science and Technology says the findings show some type 1a supernovae linked to know they well white dwarfs don&#x27;t explode as supernovae they explode as no thing and by the way like white dwarfs are not a dead end they don&#x27;t turn into black Dwarfs white dwarfs actually expand back to the main sequence so what what this says the authors conclude there are multiple ways to make a type 1a supernova finding that could have implications for understand the differences seen in the standard candles sanic candle should be supernovae type 1 not necessarily 1a and by the way the differences between the different supernovae types would then try to on how to do with which element is doing the fission ok anyway now what&#x27;s interesting here is that they say a red giant loses some of its outer layers through celery and some of the forms of discipline around a companion register this is utter nonsense the white dwarf is expanding back to the main sequence so gas pressure builds up in the center and explodes out forming the nove that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really going on there&#x27;s no transfer from the red giant to a white dwarf ok let&#x27;s go on to the next one where particle decay upset supersymmetry theories so let&#x27;s look at this one supersymmetry means this units it&#x27;s even more bizarre than the standard theory it says here popular physics theory running out of hiding places researchers at the Large Hadron Collider LHC I&#x27;ve detected one of the rarest particle decay seen in nature so for so much any predicts heavy versions all the particles are now about the supercritical as well it&#x27;s another crackpot invented theory of modern physics it&#x27;s not inductive in the least so it says also super so much you may not be dead but these latest results have certainly put it into the hospital well it&#x27;s a nonsensical let&#x27;s go back and I&#x27;ll show you what my responses the BS meson decays to muons our new Nissans what is the big deal here in the reciprocal system we can identify that the s meson as probably a ch2 that&#x27;s cosmic deuterium with four material gravitational charges it can indicate to two muons which are really see argon with two material gravitational charges the mass energy remaining has come into AC beryllium with one gravitational charge reciprocal mass is equal to now here&#x27;s the equation 1862 point 95 divided by n plus 0.5 times g plus i times nine thirty one point four seven eight MeV per C squared where n is the cosmic atomic number G is the cosmic a number of gravitational charges and I is equal to the material the number of material gravitational charges present a theory say that Gary heavy particle should be found in the decay products for this reason certain experiments shows that that is unlikely from the standpoint of the reciprocal system it&#x27;s rather difficult to imagine a causing particle heavier than what&#x27;s been calculated for B s here and that&#x27;s fifty three sixty six point three MeV per C squared of course energy maybe conversion to any material atoms such as cesium which would obviously wouldn&#x27;t be much heavier but it&#x27;s not a cosmic or anti particle so sometimes when we get these heavy particles out what they&#x27;re actually creating on material the radioactive material particles not really cosmic alrighty and we got one more to go here experimental proof of compound motion and radiation so kudos to the experimenters for verifying reciprocal system internal radiation a photon is a linear vibration in one dimension with a linear translational motion and second perpendicular dimension there&#x27;s always a compound motion known as radiation this explains the wave particle duality well let&#x27;s just take a quick look at this article here Partizan wave-like behavior of light measured simultaneously again this is from Science Daily what is like made of waves or particles this basic questions fascinated physicists since the early days of science crime mechanics predicts and photons particles like are both particles and waves simultaneously this is now given a new demonstration this wave particle duality photons dubbed the one real mystery quantum mechanics by nobel prize laureate richard fineman well it says here what is like native ways where particles this basic question ok did all this so it says yes your sizes mark my intense debate between the particle and wave theories of play that goes in Isaac Newton&#x27;s theory James clerk Maxwell&#x27;s theory etc the fact of the matter is radiation is a compound motion a combination of a linear vibration which is the photon itself plus the perpendicular space-time progression that solves the wave particle duality problem so we don&#x27;t have that problem then reciprocal system so that concludes our presentation for today again all these stories verify or at least are consistent with the reciprocal Systems Theory study the reciprocal system and prove it for yourself simplest treatment of the reciprocal system is my book the universe unless comprehensive treatment where thousands of equations is my work existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything and for those who want to apply the system and practice to both the micro cosmos and macro cosmos there&#x27;s my reciprocal system database two modules one for the micro cosmos and one for the macro cosmos so it makes it easy to apply the theory that does it for today thanks for your attention</p>
