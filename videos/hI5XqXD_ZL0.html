            <p>okay you guys welcome to the M eg replication project I&#x27;m gonna replicate the emotionless electromagnetic generator patented by Thomas Bearden this is a over-unity device and I&#x27;ve always seen one person try and replicate this Jael Norton from France and basically I&#x27;m gonna go off of some of his schematics to build this replication I&#x27;m also gonna do some different things by trying some different input and output coils to see what I get so this is a 2018-2019 project basically this year I&#x27;ve spent just acquiring the parts that I need designing the bobbins I&#x27;m gonna 3d print all these bobbins to put on the C core here so I&#x27;ve got different sizes I&#x27;m gonna test out yeah so basically you know here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m following we have a really good set of diagrams here basically I ordered the AMC C 320 and more for a Secor very special type of transformer core and we&#x27;re gonna have some thin wire which is right here wrapped around these small bobbins for the input coils and we&#x27;re gonna have a little bit thicker wire here or sorry I have that reversed we&#x27;re gonna do the thicker wire on the smaller input bobbin and we&#x27;re gonna do this thinner wire a lot more turns of it around the output bobbin right there so this is the diagram right here I get the reflection off yeah there we go so here&#x27;s the circuit you have to use this special amp a TL 494 and I have those so basically what I&#x27;ve done is I&#x27;ve built this circuit on this breadboard I&#x27;m going to take it into the University test it out but before I do that you know I&#x27;m gonna get my coils 3d printed and wound I&#x27;m gonna whine these bobbins but let me show you the C chord this is and this probably the coolest thing here so what happens in this experiment because we have this and more for a C core and you can see here up close here I&#x27;m gonna that it is laminated and it&#x27;s microns thick laminations so there&#x27;s really no eddy currents and the losses are really reduced so the experiment with this what happens here is there is a magnet in between the two sides of the C core here so basically I found some magnets that would fit inside here and when I was putting these in here you know you can feel the power of the magnets and then these small ones as I was sliding them in I would put one close and it would go just suck it in suck it in and now I mean this is super magnetized I can you can not pull this straight apart to separate it the only way you can get it apart is to twist it get it apart now I wanted to test this seek or without the magnets in there but I have had the hardest time I cannot get these out of here these will not come out so I&#x27;m probably gonna leave them in there but basically here&#x27;s what happens with our bobbins so we&#x27;re gonna have this one wound it&#x27;s gonna be on the top that&#x27;s our input coil we&#x27;re gonna have another one down here this is gonna be our output coil and these magnets will be in the middle and they&#x27;ll go straight in the center there</p>
