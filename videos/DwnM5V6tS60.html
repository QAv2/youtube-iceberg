            <p>All in all, Vessa thought he had a winner. &gt;&gt; Within 5 years, assuming the government attitude towards the technology was proper, it would be available to the consumers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Fast forward to today. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s open. There&#x27;s a fuel of the future. 25 years of rust on it. &gt;&gt; Vzna&#x27;s vehicle sits idle. It still starts.</p>
<p>And Vzna still believes it&#x27;s the cure for the world&#x27;s energy. woes. But he says shortly after his appearance on Parliament Hill back in &#x27; 81, interest in his idea all but disappeared. Vzna speculates it&#x27;s because the government owned ProCanada, so there wasn&#x27;t much political will to develop alternative fuels. &gt;&gt; What do I say? I mean, you know, you can be right, but you got to wait for history.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s basically what happened to us. We were right, but history wasn&#x27;t ready. The world wasn&#x27;t ready. [Music]</p>
