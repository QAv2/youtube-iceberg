            <p>good morning and welcome to day two of the inaugural let X we have some fantastic presentations for you today I think you&#x27;re really going to enjoy them in particular this first one is going to be outstanding today we have Steve justice who just retired in September as the director for integrated systems at Lockheed Martin&#x27;s skunk works in this role he was responsible for coordinating emerging program strategies across the advanced systems organization he&#x27;s a native of Nashville Tennessee and in 1978 he graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in aerospace engineering from there he moved on to General Dynamics Fort Worth division where he worked on the f-111 the f-16 and the f-16xl teams as well as other programs his responsibilities included aircraft conceptual design and systems engineering and integration he joined skunk works in 1984 where he held roles of increasing responsibility on programs including the f-117 Nighthawk the stealth fighter the Y f-22 stealth air superiority fighter and his aeronautical experience worked all the way between operations analysis based requirements through system flight tests with leadership roles leading to program manager campaign director and advanced programs portfolio director Mr Justice has to awarded patents and five classified patent disclosures he represented Lockheed Martin on the AIA a committee for aircraft design in 1990 he&#x27;s the recipient of the Kelly Johnson inventor of the Year award in 1993 and 1999 and the engineers Council Award for engineering merit and project achievement in 1996 and 1999 in 2005 he received the LM aeronautics company Aero star award and corporate nova award for leadership and in 2007 he was a member of the National Academy of Sciences panel for the study of methods to reduce aircraft fuel consumption he was one of the organization&#x27;s historians and the custodian of reports and artifacts the document skunk work achievements he was also an instructor for the Lockheed Martin Technical Institute for aircraft configuration development structural design systems design and low observables technology integration he was the past director of the Lightspeed youth motivate no program sponsored by skunk works in short if you want to know anything about advanced aircraft design this is the person to tell you about it please give a warm welcome to mr. Steve justice thank you thank you very much for the invitation to be here it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s an absolute honor um we&#x27;ll start with the test you can grade yourself it&#x27;s early the morning for a test but tough ok name different kinds of ships and if you thought of aircraft carrier ocean liner rowboat destroyer you&#x27;re an incredibly well educated adult congratulations give yourself an F if you thought of submarine give yourself a D I did not ask you to name things that float on water ask you to name different kinds of ships if you thought of airship give yourself a seat has nothing to do with water you thought a spaceship give yourself a B it&#x27;s not even buoyant and if you thought of friendship ownership relationship give yourself an A one of the greatest traps we have in the technical world as well as the leadership world is adding rules that are not there and we do it subconsciously vaquita breakthroughs is looking where the assumptions are in this particular case you assume that a ship was something that floated on water and you eliminated a huge chunk of design space okay and you did it subconsciously without Mouse without it 1/10 trying to do your best job possible to get an a so that means other people around you are doing the exact same thing how&#x27;s that feel I know that I failed that test everybody does but once you&#x27;re aware of it now you can do something about it I also you know as I as I stand here and look at this group there&#x27;s a story that pops into my head about calibration in environments I&#x27;m a number of years ago we hired a two-star Air Force general and his first day in plant he was speaking with his boss one of my peers walks in delivers this general is now boss five dollars worth of grief over a decision that had been made and leaves and the general says are you gonna let him talk to you like that well the answer was yes because open communication was key and there was no ambiguity about what was going on about two or three weeks later the same general was in on one of those days off you know when you have a day off but you&#x27;re still at work at you know seven o&#x27;clock in the morning building PowerPoint slides working with a junior level engineer for presentation was going to happen on Monday and I passed by the cubicle and you know said hey how&#x27;s it going and he looked at me said I used to be a general I thought that was a really interesting statement because there was a calibration difference in what he saw going on what his assumption base was for how things would operate and he was coming to completely recalibrate himself as to what a norm was okay so now imagine that you have a firm set of rules and the baseline changes how do you adapt and that&#x27;s key skeeter leadership it&#x27;s key to technology breakthroughs and I believe that it is the key to what allowed the skunkworks to be what it is I will tell you that ever since I was a little kid I wanted to design airplanes my dad was on an aircraft carrier in World War two well his job was to shoot down pesky airplanes his gun director mount was on the flight deck level and so he watched flight operations and he he imprinted a passion for airplanes on me when I was in college the first photos of the Blackbird came out and I got a poster put on my wall said I&#x27;m gonna work there one day and I got to do that and that is just an absolute dream come true the greatest privilege I had was to have the papers and documents dating all the way back to the early 1900s on the Lockheed corporation including a lot of the classified documents from skunk works programs and I got to read in particularly Kelly Johnson&#x27;s notes on his philosophies inside of program so I had his program logs for the u2 the a12 oxcart the yf-12 headlock is the code word for that the sr-71 senior crown or Blackbird as everybody knows it along with a variety of other programs when you see in here in unfiltered context for him learning lessons him finding the assumptions of the flaws and the assumptions that he had made lamenting having having taken on too much risk I when we look at this aircraft at the very end of its cycle after the airplane was up and flying he said if we had known how hard it was gonna be to do this we probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried think about that for a minute we probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried and yet that means that success was out there due to the diligence that took place and it and one of Kelly&#x27;s rules was one miracle per program and this was essentially all miracles every single thing if you go back and read about the technical course and if somebody has questions about the Blackbird I&#x27;d be happy to answer them in one of the breaks around I&#x27;m pretty easy to spot being about six and a half feet tall so you&#x27;ll find me pretty easy up there but you you combine the idea of assumption based rules with new environments you&#x27;ve never been down this trail for you&#x27;re actually trail braking with a really really difficult and abstract set of problems that pound you every step of the way along the path you&#x27;re having to cut through thorns and thicket and all that kind of stuff that just impede you at every step of the way and that&#x27;s what I saw in the logs it was hard to do and I a lesson I took away from it is sometimes success is just due to pure dogged determination I&#x27;ve seen everybody when they&#x27;ve been given a challenge I&#x27;ve never seen anybody failed when given enough time or resources to do it of course that&#x27;s exactly what we don&#x27;t have in a lot of cases but you can solve just about any problem that&#x27;s out there I&#x27;ve always seen my my engineers solve problems especially when I get out of the way and give them the opportunity to do that one other trick that I want you to have in the back of your mind as we go through the the constraints that led to the skunkworks inform the DNA that that organization has today is a concept of standing in the future and looking back as opposed to standing in the present looking to the future you may say what&#x27;s the difference when I was in college in air force magazine there was an article this is about 1976 ya know that&#x27;s one of the reasons all that stuff on my bio there&#x27;s so much stuff there&#x27;s just I&#x27;ve been around a long time you&#x27;ll see exactly the same thing happened through your careers there was this I had an article about what it was like to fly the u2 how difficult the airplane was to fly and I held on to that magazine a few years ago as I was going through and kind of culling out stuff that I could just get rid of I found this here this magazine from 1976 you know 40 years ago well what else was going on 40 years ago and they talked about this system called GPS and someday if the United States really invests in electronic miniaturization a soldier will be able to wear a backpack that weighs 15 pounds and cost 12,000 dollars that will tell him where he is on the face of the earth we laugh at that don&#x27;t we because we&#x27;re standing in that person&#x27;s future and looking back now imagine if in 1976 he said someday if the United States focuses on electronic miniaturization a soldier will be able to carry something that will fit in his pocket that will tell him where he is on the face of the earth but not only that how to get there with voice commands turn-by-turn and it will be a camera and a personal assistant and a phone and a calendar you would say the guy was out of his mind an editor never would have allowed to even be printed and yes that&#x27;s exactly what happened so standing in the future and looking back is a very different set of perspectives than standing in the present and looking to the future it&#x27;s very difficult to do because what is the product of standing in the future and looking back to the people in the present laughter ridicule doubt and what does that do to your own personal self-confidence as a leader can I do it it starts a being away at the thought process I look back on the skunkworks projects that I was involved in and in retrospect they were extremely difficult to do I was having so much fun at the time working for the skunkworks designing airplanes I didn&#x27;t notice I was working with a team that was brutal to each other with their honesty I was working with customers like you that needed capability fielded as quickly as possible so everybody was in it together and I think that is truly magical and results in a lot of what we now have fielded today there was we&#x27;re in 1988 I was working on something called the J program inside the skunk works you know it today as the f-22 Raptor we were working the design for the yf-22 during the demonstration validation phase and I went over to the the gentlemen working the the pilot vehicle interface PVI I said tell me how you do your job he said well I got to think of it this way the people that are gonna fly this aren&#x27;t born yet they&#x27;re gonna grow up with computers of a power I cannot imagine they&#x27;re gonna interface with computers in a very different way than we do now and I have to make it to where this does not seem archaic to them but it is natural to them I have to stand in that future and create that and what was very interesting was everybody that I talked to had that perspective whether it was the maintainer z-- or the structural people whoever it was saying in the time period where this is operational this is the set of perspectives that we&#x27;re going to have how do I accommodate that in my design now so think about trying to stand 20 or 30 years in the future and creating that future and making it happen okay Kelly Johnson came with a vision very early on of an organization that could respond to we&#x27;ll call it pop-up problems it was called an experimental shop in his head and his idea was to jam everybody together now at this point in time when he came to the skunk work or to Lockheed down in Burbank there was probably around 900 people working there 900 and there was a communication problem there were too too much detachment between departments ok how many people do we even have in this room that was the size of a company and there were communication problems there was breakdowns inefficiency and so he wanted to create this environment where everybody was pressed together and get that direct relationship that allowed the peak efficiency rapid decision-making and he finally got his chance with the p80 the the best example I can give you of the urgency with which the United States wanted to feel the jet fighters this I my dad was in a assisted living facility and he had a lot of friends down there and you know the the World War two guys would all get together and tell stories and he met this pilot b-17 pilot Bob Barney shot down on his 18th mission which was headed to Berlin and so mr. Barney wrote a a small book for his family my dad got a copy of it for me and I read it and it blew me away with what his life was like from the Great Depression up through the war and his war experiences and when I sat down and talked with him about book he describes something to me that was very difficult for me to imagine so they&#x27;re headed into Berlin you know one of these multi hundred aircraft raids and there&#x27;s ten guys per airplane okay if you haven&#x27;t read masters of the air do so brilliant book on the strategy the physiology the psychology and the results of the 8th Air Force campaign in Europe he described very clearly to me the effects of the cannon fire from the me-109 s that were raking his airplane made the airplane the stick feel in his hand and when one of the engines got hit what it felt like to fall out of formation and know that he was going down he and the top turret gunner had a deal that they would be the last to out of the airplanes and when when mr. Barney heard the top set of 50 cals stopped firing that meant that his that everybody was out including his top turret gunner and he could jump out of the aircraft so mr. Bonnie describes the yellow nose 109s coming in raking the airplane trying to hold the bailout bail while he tries to hold the airplane level enough for his crew to get out and finally the top the the top turn 50 Cal stopped firing and mr.</p>
<p>Barney let&#x27;s go the stick and starts headed towards the bailout hatch the aircraft immediately goes wildly out of control the g-forces are throwing him around all inside the cockpit he manages to work his way to the door drops out of the airplane falls for as far as he can because he wants to make sure he&#x27;s away from that gyrating airplane goes under canopy and acts dead so that he won&#x27;t be raked by the Luftwaffe of still circulating around and then he described a scene to me that I&#x27;ve never read in any book he said he looked up and all he saw were columns of smoke from the ground of all the aircraft that had been shot down both bombers and fighters marking the path back to England and each one&#x27;s airplanes had ten people in it it&#x27;s hard for us to imagine today the amount of sacrifice and the losses was just intolerable to us today but that&#x27;s what they were dealing with and now suddenly Germany introduces an airplane it&#x27;s 150 miles per hour faster than our fastest fighter what do you do about that it was actually so fast coming through the formations that the electric powered turrets couldn&#x27;t pull lead on it increases the Jets survivability so Kelly came back to his bosses at the skunk works saying hey I got a contract for 180 days to build a jet fighter they said congratulations Kelly but rules you cannot disrupt wartime production we&#x27;re building B seven teams we&#x27;re building p-38s and other things so no people no equipment no facilities good luck Kelly went down to the south end of the plant down here you can actually see a runway across the top here we got a laser we run away across the top here where they flew the p38 mph I have later on PA TS out of all of this is manufacturing space through here down here is the wins hull where&#x27;d you go yard and so he went through and took the engine crates from the right cyclone engines than the b-17s and built walls and a lean-to up against the window rented a circus tent and draped over it to create a roof that was his environment now the good news for him was at that point in time there was over 90,000 people working in Burbank good lucky 90,000 as much as in the corporation today at one point they were hiring as many as 4,000 people a month so he could hide a small group he could hide and nobody would notice so his team was very small two or three dozen and people to go do this jet fighter so he had high construed tremendous constraints on himself he had to be not interrupt production not interrupt the flow of equipment or anything to the wartime production needs and yet he still had a job to get done this is the only known photograph that we have of the tent itself in the background of this p80 nose it&#x27;s pretty crude and you can go read about how the skunk works got its name it&#x27;s an interesting little reference to an Al cap cartoon but this was a brutal work environment people were packed in very very closely but what you saw was camaraderie build you see that in the teams that you work with - when you&#x27;re all jammed into one room there&#x27;s a natural alignment that takes place and that&#x27;s what he got out of his people they&#x27;re ready to fly in 143 days instead of 180 okay now you were designing an airplane that was gonna go faster and level flight than the p38 did in a dive and the p38 was hitting compressibility effects so much so that they couldn&#x27;t pull out of dyes and had to have special air brakes on them and stuff to deal with that you&#x27;re gonna be dealing with aerodynamic forces on the airplane unlike anything you&#x27;d seen because of the dynamic pressures you were dealing with jet fuel instead of gasoline so how did seals and everything hoses work you were dealing with a jet induction system as opposed to a propeller in a hundred and forty three days think about that it day 85 they were still inventing in parallel to that they were developing the production aircraft so the prototype was the first one out the production aircraft was a little different was a little bit larger had guns in it had the operational equipment it lagged the prototype airplane by two months so that they could take advantage of the learning on the prototype one third of the span Kelly&#x27;s rule was people didn&#x27;t work on Sundays Kelly was the last one out of the building at the end of the day and locked the door behind him it was absolute secrecy nobody could be in a carpool couldn&#x27;t tell anybody what they were doing interesting environment and you see that the the DNA of that even today Kelly came up with some axioms for success and you see it&#x27;s Center on decision makings immediate decisions a good decision today is better than a great decision next week because it allows progress he&#x27;s guys how are we here today he was not a believer in huge amounts of overtime although he noted in his log one time when he would come in on Monday some work got done between the last time when he left and when he came in on Monday Kelly was also a big believer in listening if I remember this correctly there&#x27;s a little valve in your ear I mean in the cochlea that when you talk flips and knocks down the game so that you don&#x27;t definite yourself when you talk it takes about 30 DB out of sensitivity so truly you cannot hear as well when you talk and then the last one was the mantra that still continues to today is be quick be quiet and be on time one of the challenges of boss gave me when I heard in in 1984 he set this incredibly tight schedule and I said you know there&#x27;s no way I can beat that and he says if I were to give you instead of this 24 month schedule a 36 month schedule you&#x27;d miss that one - I&#x27;d rather you miss a 24 month schedule because you&#x27;ll miss it by a month or two but you&#x27;ll also miss the 36 month schedule and we&#x27;ll be out at 37 or 38 months which is better so we had these incredibly aggressive schedules in these environments that forced you to make decisions very quickly and concentrate on what was important some other rules started to pop out as well and resulted in what we called Kelly&#x27;s DNA for the skunkworks you can see a summary of those listed on the left hand side and the first one is a one strong knowledgeable leader I&#x27;ll show you some examples of that with Kelly here in just a second but you can look down through that list and you can see the the the roots of stuff that he learned on the p80 there was actually a p80 set of experimental shop rules that evolved into this set that he had and we try to abide by these today not always successful but we try to abide by these today we got to remember I&#x27;m retired now and don&#x27;t don&#x27;t speak for them the problem with all this is is we try to do this the principle is simple it&#x27;s all duh there&#x27;s nothing new here but I want you to think about the number of times you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve not done duh you&#x27;ve not done what&#x27;s obvious you made life harder for yourself because you haven&#x27;t followed simple principles and so in reality it&#x27;s very difficult to implement and it takes commitment over a long period of time in World War two a lot of airplane companies could build airplanes in six months but one of the things that was different between the skunkworks and those other airplane companies was Kelly stayed in charge of the skunk works for about 30 years so the expectations were constant been Rich&#x27;s hand-picked successor carried it into about 1990 so there was about but from 1943 to about 1990 about 50 years of continuous expectations of constant expectations whereas most jobs leaders change out about every two years because they&#x27;re promoted so this holding these expectations over time was absolutely critical in a very big differentiator for the skunk works looking at Kelly&#x27;s rule number one these are pages out of his Archangel log and on the we&#x27;ll start off with the technical log and you can see his notes on the front here and on about seven pages he sizes a Mach three airplane works up all the skin friction drag repulsion parameters the weights of the aircraft and dirt determines a final performance on eight pages he plans the program and so you&#x27;ll see in here as he works up through labor cost material costs headcount overtime for both the shop as well as engineering production rates of aircraft you&#x27;ll also see in here estimated or there&#x27;s aircraft deliveries estimated unit cost of aircraft and then the all-important pilot bonus in there make sure you don&#x27;t miss that okay look at how rounded this one individual was it allowed him to ask questions in any domain specialisation is great it&#x27;s fantastic but look at what having a broad aperture brings to you the ability to quiet ask questions in any domain and that&#x27;s what was expected of me and a leadership role but the skunkworks the ability to ask questions anywhere wasn&#x27;t my job to do this stuff anymore sadly because I really enjoyed my time in the trenches the hands-on designing of airplanes but when I lifted up out of that my job was to ask questions very hard questions questions that other people may not be asking themselves because they have to find a ship to be something that floats on water they become very task focused you saw one example in in Todd&#x27;s briefing yesterday about the the card game or the the magic trick you know another another example of this is an example in an exercise where they ask people look around a room and find everything that&#x27;s blue you got 10 seconds make a list have people close their eyes in and ask names things and name things that were in the room that were brown I can&#x27;t name anything because it becomes so task-focused that they miss all the other stuff going on and a leaders job is to step back and ask those questions not only within a domain but cross-domain how does a technical decision impact the program plan and how can you do that if you don&#x27;t have an understanding of how all those different pieces work his unwritten rules this is what I got from talking with people that worked for him including customers I gave you the example of extremely compressed schedules I will tell you there was one time the customer you the Air Force asked for a first flight in 24 months my chief engineer came up to me with a schedule that was 32 months tight well did you you the evaluators wouldn&#x27;t even look at that because it wasn&#x27;t compliant to the RFP because what this is what it takes Steve and I go to what rules well we have to do this we have to do this and wait we have to do what there was one case it had a kind of a strange nozzle on the backside kind of like an f-117 nozzle you know not which is hard to call a nozzle sometimes when you look at its efficiencies but they had to do this tremendous amount of Windtunnel work and computational fluid dynamics on it and I asked why they did some of these analyses in here because the labor hours were just killing us and it was killing the schedule as well and so because we well we always do this excuse me well this is this is CFD runs these tasks are things we always do I said let me ask you a question if the backend of this airplane was round and came to a round nozzle in the back there was a vertical tail above it horizontal tail man and I the fuselage how much CFD would you have to do on this thing and the guy started calculating in his head we&#x27;d have to do this then he stopped and he said none I go right answer because there&#x27;s a p80 on a pole right out front that they didn&#x27;t do any CFD on okay just because you can doesn&#x27;t mean that you should and that&#x27;s one of the hardest things because you become so entrenched in how things are done down to the process itself you become locked in and you become trapped by that a ship is even in how things are done fixed-price programs this is a really interesting one the CIA had a fixed-price program for the development of the oxcart the Air Force rolls in with the senior crown or the Blackbird program for the sr-71 and wanted to transition from a fixed-price contract to a cost-plus program and Kelley notes in there this is just an excuse to overrun he wanted no flexible boundaries out there at all now we all know the flaws of that today but isn&#x27;t that an interesting philosophy don&#x27;t allow me the flexibility to overrun force me to make hard decisions about what it is I do and don&#x27;t do it forces me to determine what is truly important to do as opposed to doing the stuff I normally do only invent what is required this is the one that broke Kellis fundamental rule of one mill corporal program that&#x27;s our 71 that did just trash that one one of the things you see on the p80 for instance they used the British engine so that was off the shelf you see parts from other airplanes stuffed in it all over the place what was unique to it was a sheet metal of the outside and a few of the components on the inside but they use pieces off of a p38 off of a p-51 they used whatever they could because you want to save invention for the things that really count the things that are associated with the breakthrough itself on the Blackbird when you have something that&#x27;s I thought was talking to some people last night when the cooling temperatures and the nacelle or 800 degrees Fahrenheit there&#x27;s not a lot of parts on the on the shelf you can go pull to do that when you&#x27;re designing a stealth airplane for the first time not a lot of stuff you can pull off the shelf and I think that&#x27;s the kind of thing that resulted in Kelly saying if we&#x27;d known how hard it was gonna be we probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried thank goodness they did because what an incredible masterpiece that airplane was absolutely just a work of art I got to experience the takeoff of a blackbird one stand by the nozzle when it was running in full afterburner or standing by the wingtip when it&#x27;s running in full afterburner and you couldn&#x27;t clench your jaw tight enough to keep your teeth from rattling I mean that is just power you see that 40-foot long flame coming out the back I&#x27;m standing standing on the out near the runway when it took off was just a visual imagery that I will never ever forget so thank God they&#x27;ve been too involved through that and also the decision-making power that he gave what seven presidents to make really hard decisions using that information thoroughly documented work the reports they wrote on these compressed schedules are stunning they&#x27;re not PowerPoint they are written prose with tables inserted all done by hand typed no microsoft word there&#x27;s one report that documents a surprise they found in flight test on the Blackbird that&#x27;s this thick and they did that while on a program where they invented everything from go ahead to first flight in 32 months there were writing reports look how lazy we are today and I will tell you some people go well you know I document everything in PowerPoint I dare you to go brief with the same fidelity a PowerPoint presentation you created a year ago after so many years it&#x27;ll mean absolutely nothing you&#x27;ll just have what exists in imagery on the slide and if you have the same admonition that most people have which is a slide is intended to be brief that is not a self-contained piece of information you can see the even further detachment there what was beautiful about having all these documents that they wrote when we went to work the Rattlers Mach 3 cruise missile there was a whole series of Windtunnel tests we didn&#x27;t have to do because the guys had data right there explaining what it was and how stuff work save the saved everybody money in the development phase here&#x27;s a page out of the xp-80 log this will be the production of ex bada production bird you can see the days are numbered on the left with a date beside it and on day 86 if you can kind of read this I&#x27;ll read it to you well excuse me day 89 we roll down through here clj let me see if I can tag this for him reading from write about a little little laser has died clj is okayed CD stewart to work over here had a long talk with him and let him know exactly what is expected of him he is enthusiastic fuel-system to meet Cooper&#x27;s requirements is not yet invented Bradley and others trying to get a good idea we need a valve which will pass fuel but stop air Kelly was working the prototype of the airplane that was 2 months ahead but would come in once a week and check the log to see how things were going now imagine writing down for your boss to come in and see that you didn&#x27;t know how to do something on day 89 well look what it results in hey I know how seal J resulted in the problem being solved what we would see is a vulnerability resulted in moving the ball down the field so think about now today how willing you are to expose the flaws that you have in your decision making your shortfalls when it could be the key to how you move forward and get out of that that rut that you&#x27;re in I think it also shows tremendous leadership because Kelly came in and talked to somebody and said here&#x27;s what I expect of you so Kelly had his rules for the shop and he would also sit down with people defining the expectations that he had for everyone on the program how often do you see that today if you&#x27;re a member of my lab this afternoon you&#x27;ll see my rules you&#x27;ll see my expectations of leaders and you&#x27;ll see how my brain works you&#x27;re welcome to have a copy of if you&#x27;re not in the lab you can contact the people that run this thing they have a PDF of it or a scan of it but I sit down with every new team that I have and I had and explained exactly how my brain works as well as what my expectations of my leaders are so there is no ambiguity whatsoever and that&#x27;s what Kelly did and I thought that was a really good idea Kelly Johnson the man you can read those up there I will go down about half way called them as he saw them he accepted his perspectives being challenged but seldom lost and yet people would still go in and challenge him imagine somebody that&#x27;s got a you know a batting average of 900 and you&#x27;re gonna challenge him hard thing to do but that&#x27;s the level of trust that Kelly had on his team you&#x27;ll also notice that he had the right people in the right job you heard that mantra yesterday if they weren&#x27;t the right people in the right job changes were made ineffective people were removed quickly because I was just burning budget otherwise and you see rigid staffing control people didn&#x27;t get to hang around once their job was done all the keys to schedule and budget management while getting the technical job done when you would talk to members of his team I think the last one that I know of just recently passed away last year you saw violent loyalty to the man even though he was hard on them absolute violent loyalty nobody dared say a bad thing about Kelly and I believe that&#x27;s what we should expect from today&#x27;s leaders violent loyalty so the role of leadership is to create the environment and find those people that can fit into that environment so in creating the environment as a leader to find the end state not the path to achieve it one of the things I tell my wife is you can tell me what to do or how to do but not both give me some flexibility in the job here okay I I&#x27;m always amazed I go define this in state to my young teams people they&#x27;re just out of college they never do it the way I would they do it better and I find that fascinating I learned be the accountability boundary in the vein of eyes how we&#x27;re writing the letters for the d-day invasion he had a letter if it succeeded and a letter if it failed that succeeded it was because of the sacrifices of those men that went ashore and parachuted in if it failed it was his fault excuse me all leaders should be that way the team should know that none of the bad stuff is gonna flow down to them and they get all the reward enable decision-making at all levels who makes what decision lock that down define it so people know who to go to to get a particular kind of decision may tailor the processes to meet needs so just rubber-stamp processes into a program at the skunkworks we had the ability to tailor what was called arrow codes to a specific program need arrow codes were designed to handle huge production programs like the f-22 or f-35 that&#x27;s not what the skunk versus skunk works doesn&#x27;t solve all problems it solves a very narrow niche of problems so we tailored those coats aero coats down to meet the specific needs of a program and we didn&#x27;t even use the same rubber stamp between small programs and then define your style and expectations and share it as I said earlier that&#x27;s what I did with Myer set of rules I&#x27;ll give you one example for those of you that aren&#x27;t in that lab this afternoon there are five reasons I asked a question number one I asked the question you didn&#x27;t answer it a lot of what we see from politicians today number two I didn&#x27;t understand what you said so I&#x27;m asking more questions number three I&#x27;m educating myself this is new to me and I want to learn more number four I&#x27;m educating other people in the room because they won&#x27;t ask questions and I know they don&#x27;t know the answers and number five I&#x27;m testing your convictions because if you don&#x27;t believe it why should I and none of those are an attack and yet how often are question seen as an attack I want to make sure you have the fortitude behind your responses but I don&#x27;t question the validity of them then seeking those with the proper mindset assume it can be done as soon as you try to determine whether or not something can be done you start finding all the ways that it can&#x27;t be done all the reasons it can&#x27;t be done apply wisdom this is one thing that is really interesting to me when I stepped into Bill&#x27;s office yesterday I saw four words up on the board that I found fascinating wisdom fortitude justice and temperance you guys know where that came from it&#x27;s a movie Gladiator Marcus Aurelius though that was a really interesting set of attributes think about what your attributes are and apply those to your style you see courage up there in decision-making as a leader gonna have to make very bold decisions ones that are risky ones a little roll will will risk your career but that&#x27;s your job your job is to be out on the tip of the spear have control in stressful situations never let a situation get to you you got to maintain your cool because if you lose your cool everybody else will as well despise fear but but don&#x27;t are despite failure but don&#x27;t fear failing as soon as you fear failing you&#x27;re gonna make different decisions I despise it I want you to hate it with every fiber of your being but don&#x27;t fear it I also one of the things I have is I don&#x27;t want people on my stressful teams that have not failed before it is a is a tough thing to watch somebody fail for the first time because it&#x27;s hard for them to recover understand the boundaries of Tolerance how far do you let something go before you have to step in I would let my young teams go to the edge of a cliff leaned over that cliff their toes start to slip off before I would grab them by the collar and pull them back in because I need it for them too that they were failing if I save them too early they don&#x27;t know under store don&#x27;t understand the consequences of their decisions and then find those that seek opportunity and risk and uncertainty and ambiguity and sudden change that&#x27;s what I look for in a skunkworks team that&#x27;s what Kelly looked for in his even though he didn&#x27;t write it down this way think about what your team is trying to achieve and define that set of expectations lastly Kelly had this his promise to his own quirks team I thought this was very interesting challenging worthwhile job stable employment fair pay a chance to advance and contribute to our nation&#x27;s first line of defense we keep you guys may not recognize this but we as the contractors when we&#x27;re gonna put somebody in the nose of a jet for the first time that&#x27;s our friend going in the nose and when we design an airplane that&#x27;s gonna be going into combat we want that person to come home to their family every single time and we want the bad guys to have a bad day we don&#x27;t want a fair fight it&#x27;s not a sport we want a crushing win we want to hand you whatever instruments we can they give you that dominating advantage and it is an honor to be able to do that for a nation I never served in the military but I saw how patriotic my dad was and they passed that on to me and I tried to fulfill that through the job that I did it was an honor to do so and it was an honor to speak to you today thank you so much [Applause]</p>
