            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>The marching orders have been given for disclosure. Start pushing get it to happen inside the government, says Representative Burlson. Now, I covered this yesterday um on the mega kind of episode that I did yesterday when we were kind of going over the press conference that happened. For those of you who aren&#x27;t aware, James Fox um was true to his word, had the press conference about the 1996 Varia case that happened in Brazil, had some of the doctors there, had some had ex-military pilot there to talk about it. There were uh various witnesses, Jacqu Valle came out, said some things as well.</p>
<p>And it was a lot of uh confirmations, stories and accounts, alleged accounts of things that happened. So, one of those things that I covered while we were going over it was I I had said someone&#x27;s got to be there from the government to hear this stuff because if they&#x27;re doing these hearings all the time and they&#x27;re getting these witnesses that say, &quot;Well, I heard that I can&#x27;t tell you anything. You got to do it in a skiff.&quot; Or, &quot;I heard from someone, but I didn&#x27;t see it firsthand.&quot; And that like that&#x27;s usually what the hearings have been. and they&#x27;ve been having problems talking to getting whistleblowers to speak. Um, so but they got to have somebody at this press conference to hear what these guys who supposedly was in a room with an alien.</p>
<p>So that happened. Um, one of the major players in the game right now for the government has been Eric Burlson and he has stepped up. It is. It&#x27;s interesting how when you go back to like 2023 and the it&#x27;s things shift as far as who&#x27;s really taken front and center with with the microphone when it comes to um when it comes to the government. And it was Luna at a time.</p>
<p>It was I mean it was Chuck Schumer at a time. It was um Moscowitz. Um it was um Burchchett. And now for the last at least I think 6 months to a year, Burlesen has really stepped up and said, &quot;Okay, I I&#x27;m going to speak on the behalf of the government that&#x27;s really looking into this. We are passionate about this and I&#x27;ve also said many times that his outlook has seemed to have changed a bit from when if you you go back to 2023 and you go back to those hearings, he seemed a little bit more skeptical.</p>
<p>Knew never like this is BS. He knew something was going on and he knew that there were things that they needed to look into, but he was very clear about saying, &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that says anything&#x27;s alien.&quot; I was in a room just now and it actually kind of to me cemented more of the fact that I don&#x27;t think it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s alien or extraterrestrial. But that was in like 2023. Since then, as I&#x27;ve mentioned, he has sat next to Eric Davis, who has said many times over about the different various species that are around. He&#x27;s listened to the conversations that James Fox and others and Jeremy Corbell and people like that have had about this.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s listen he&#x27;s David Grush has worked for him. David Grush talking about the fact that there have been um remains and things picked up and then yesterday he&#x27;s at this hearing about the Varia case. So one would assume that his stance has changed but what his stance has not changed is trying to figure out and get answers and he said as much yesterday. AOL covers this one and this is again from the hearing yesterday to which Republican Missouri rap Eric Burlson joined witnesses and enthusiasts at a conference commemorating the 30th anniversary of a famous alleged extraterrestrial encounter during which he spoke in favor of disclosure and whistleblower protection. The UAP press conference hosted by James Fox marked the 30th anniversary of alleged 1996 encounter in Virginia, Brazil, during which some claim the Brazilian government captured two nonhuman entities.</p>
<p>Berles advocated during the conference for two pieces of legislation that says he will improve transparency on the issue and encourage further witnesses to come forward. This is once a more compelling first person narratives, Burlesson told the Daily Caller News Foundation during the conference. I&#x27;m looking forward to actually getting my hands on any kind of real physical evidence, whether that&#x27;s material evidence or biological samples, maybe from the corpse. At the end of the day, I remain skeptical. Okay, gives a bit of an answer what I said before until I get my hands on physical evidence, but until then, I&#x27;m going to take it seriously investigating myself.</p>
<p>A sticker declares the existence of flying saucers from the window of a car parked on property near Jamal, California, October 15, 2000. Purchased by the Unarius Academy of Science to serve as a future landing site for space brothers from other planets. Berles urged passage of the UAPDA as well as whistleblower protections in legislation. We&#x27;ve been giving marching orders. We have legislation that we need to pass.</p>
<p>The congressman said, &quot;We&#x27;ve heard from a lot of witnesses. It&#x27;s time for action and it&#x27;s time to get the receipt. So, it&#x27;s time to pass the UAP disclosure act. It&#x27;s time to pass whistleblower protection within that or a separate act. Fox told the DCNF that the conference was an important forum for people to connect on a human level while grappling with the issue of transparency in alleged UAP sightings.</p>
<p>I think that it&#x27;s safe to say that there&#x27;s enough extremely compelling firsthand eyewitness testimony. Something truly extraordinary took place and we just want an investigation. The filmmaker told DCNF. It&#x27;s one thing to watch witnesses testify in a documentary or make claims in a documentary. It&#x27;s very different to look someone in the eyes, shake their hand, to meet their wife, to meet their colleagues.</p>
<p>Look, I got a bump shoulder, man. Stupid things happen to my body as I&#x27;m getting older. And another thing that happened to my body this year was or last year rather was the holidays. I was traveling a lot. I had a lot of good food and then just get a lot of chaos and it knocked me off my health and fitness goes.</p>
<p>And for me, I&#x27;m getting older. I&#x27;ve noticed that the holidays, it takes a bigger and bigger toll on my body. But January is here. It means it&#x27;s time to get back into the swing of my healthy routine. And I have been.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been hitting the gym, going back to it, and I&#x27;m not just getting back into my normal, healthy routine. I&#x27;m actually helping my body turn back the clock. How you doing that? Well, you might not know this, but the things that happen to our body as we get older, you get stiff joints in the morning, longer recovery from the gym, there&#x27;s hair thinning, nails breaking, every skin losing their smooth glow, and that can be fixed. They happen because your body&#x27;s collagen levels start to naturally decline beginning as early as your mid20s. Collagen is often referred to as the glue that holds our bodies together.</p>
<p>So, you can imagine that a decline in collagen production has some big impacts on your body. But that&#x27;s where Bubs Naturals collagen peptides come in. Bubs helps restore collagen levels closer to what your body naturally had in its youth, so your joints feel stronger. Your hair and nails grow healthier and your skin looks smoother. And it&#x27;s super easy to use.</p>
<p>You mix it into your coffee, which is what I do. Some people put it in their smoothies, or you can put it in juice. It&#x27;s tasteless. It&#x27;s odorless. And it dissolves instantly.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no clumps, no weird aftertaste. What makes it different is the brand is a tribute to former Navy Seal Glenn Bub Doherty, a national hero who gave his life saving Americans in Libya. Glenn&#x27;s call sign was Bub, and he was the kind of guy who always pushed for self-improvement and helped everyone around him. That DNA is woven into the brand. And to honor him, Bubs donates 10% of all profits to charity, starring with the Glen Dhy Memorial Foundation.</p>
<p>On top of that, Bubs is built to the highest standard. No junk, zero sugars, sweeteners, or fillers.

Okay, so Burlesson kind of gave a an an answer to my question a little bit there.</p>
<p>He says he&#x27;s still skeptical, which I think is fair. I think anybody should be skeptical. We don&#x27;t have any Most people yesterday, including myself as I was watching said in order to really make an impact here, they got to have some kind of sample. They got to have a picture. They got to have um video.</p>
<p>They got to have something because even if the stories are compelling, most people are going to say in the comments section, whoever is listening, they&#x27;re going to say the same thing, which is more words, more stories, nothing to see here. Now, I do think that there was something pretty big when it came to the fact that this ex-military pilot was talking about this. When it came to the fact that Jacqu Vallet was saying what he was saying, when it came to the fact that Eric Berles took that time, this is someone who works inside the government. could be working on other things at the moment, but he&#x27;s there at this hearing or this uh conference and he made it clear to say, &quot;We&#x27;re going to be pushing more so for the UAPDA to be passed. We&#x27;re going to be looking and pushing towards getting whistleblowers protected because something needs to be done to find out what is actually happening.&quot; But he didn&#x27;t say, and I don&#x27;t think he can say, &quot;Yes, you know what? I believe it&#x27;s aliens.&quot; I don&#x27;t think he can say that um for his for his career.</p>
<p>Now I I don&#x27;t necessarily know if that&#x27;s true because I do think that if you pushed um Bett or Luna who talks about interdimensional stuff and other things that they they seem to be still holding their positions and saying things. So, I wonder what the hesitancy is, unless it&#x27;s just authentic in the fact that he he&#x27;s he feels like the rest of those people I just mentioned in the comments. Look, I&#x27;m pushing towards it, but where&#x27;s that picture? Where&#x27;s that video? But he&#x27;s got to understand better than anybody at this point. You ain&#x27;t getting those pictures and videos unless you&#x27;re able to do what you&#x27;re promising here, which is to get these people protection. And I know it&#x27;s frustrating for them when they try to get these people at the hearings and they can&#x27;t do it because whether it&#x27;s again a a Laty who apparently he doesn&#x27;t want or doesn&#x27;t think that they need rather um a you&#x27;ve got um Jay Stratton, you&#x27;ve got all these other people.</p>
<p>To me, Latsky is one who&#x27;s talked about touching the hull of a ship and doing that under testimony is yes. Yes, the press conference is great, but what happened at the What did we say though yesterday on this video? We we you you knew it was coming. Nobody outside the regular cast of characters, nobody covered that press conference. Yes, everybody inside of this community covered it. Sure, News Nation covered it.</p>
<p>I covered it. Vetted covered it. um you know, you get uh Pavll covered it and uh and um uh Weaponized probably doing more extensive stuff on it. Everybody inside of the community if and I&#x27;m just mentioning a handful of people that that I know. There&#x27;s there&#x27;s tons of people inside of the community that were covering this and posting about it.</p>
<p>All the all the people on Twitter posting it was UAP Reporting Center, UAP James, um you know, uh UFO Joe, everybody&#x27;s everybody that that&#x27;s what everybody was doing inside of the community. who knew that they were going to. It was the big story for this community. But the way this pushes forward and keeps on moving is the way that it pushed forward and got more people during 2023 because everybody was covering it when the thing happened recently on the last hearing to be honest about the potential UFO that that hit something and moved forward or whatever or or age of disclosure that got major coverage from from everybody. made age of disclosure got the kind of coverage because of who was involved.</p>
<p>Dan Farah who has done movies and produced movies with Spielberg and other things is a big player in the game and can and his publicists are good enough to get him on every big show. Bill Maher was talking about it. These other things are talking about it. But this story which is a fascinating thing like James Fox needs Dan Farah&#x27;s publicist. Even he even needs Lou Alzando&#x27;s publicist because Lou was on every damn show when Lou had his book.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s what you need though. You need mass coverage on this stuff. And I know you guys, a lot of you don&#x27;t um agree with me on that and think like ah the mainstream media is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s biased and it&#x27;s and and it&#x27;s corrupt and it&#x27;s you&#x27;re you&#x27;re right. Doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have an impact. Doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have reach.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s the way people consume news is they see this stuff. Not me. I get it from the internet. Yeah. But a lot of these things keep as I mentioned in viral viral moments.</p>
<p>Um and I I I use the Hakua girl as the example all the damn time. More people in the world know about the Hakua girl than they knew about this. How stupid is that? And and I&#x27;m not telling you that everybody had to believe in it. I&#x27;m just saying that fact that there was an ex-military pilot talking about this and saying that there could be 30 to 40 other witnesses and the fact that there was a a uh a an actual representative in from the government talking about UAP disclosure and nobody&#x27;s nobody was covering that outside of this community. Um so things need to change and things need to push forward and what it needs like any other thing it needs money.</p>
<p>It needs money behind it. That&#x27;s the main thing. I don&#x27;t know where the hell Bigalow went, but Bigalow, I think it probably has his own interest that he&#x27;s working on right now that he he&#x27;s not really helping the movement, nor do I think he wants to help the movement because he probably has a lot of things that he&#x27;s working on, other people are working on that they don&#x27;t want bothered or disturbed. So, they need somebody that&#x27;s going to back it. They need somebody who&#x27;s going to really put some money behind it so they can protect the whistleblowers to really get that forward.</p>
<p>and they&#x27;re going to need some heavy hitters to really push um and get this bill passed because if I was going to bet on it, there&#x27;s been like two or three times they&#x27;ve tried to do this already and it&#x27;s failed every single time or the I guess one time it was passed but it was it was gutted tremendously. And Grush had said that when he was on Rogan that it was going to happen because of the two mics. It was Mike Turner and I Mike I for the other the other guy&#x27;s name but between the two of them and it&#x27;s exactly what happened. So what is going to happen? What&#x27;ll be different this time around? Um full disclosure I&#x27;m trying to uh get Representative Burlesen on this show for an interview. I&#x27;m working on it.</p>
<p>Things seem to be moving a little bit forward. So if that happens, I obviously will be posting it sooner than later. Um, but I&#x27;m working on it and I&#x27;ll ask all these questions. You guys know I will. It&#x27;s the same and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be uh open to to answer them.</p>
<p>Uh, in the same way that I&#x27;ve asked anybody that&#x27;s been on this show. Want to make sure that we I I have so much to ask. I have so much to ask, especially for someone who&#x27;s really got their feet dug into the ground here on this one. What&#x27;s What&#x27;s moving forward? So, we&#x27;ll see. Uh, thanks for being here.</p>
<p>I really appreciate you. We&#x27;ll be back again tomorrow and that&#x27;s about it. So, as I mentioned beforehand, if you want to help the show out, please go check out our good friends over at Bubs. And that&#x27;s all I got for you. We&#x27;ll talk to you soon.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
