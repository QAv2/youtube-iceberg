            <p>all right hello welcome to my channel I am Thomas and I do educational videos on many different subjects uh today is the 65th video that we&#x27;re doing on the reciprocal system of theory which is a system of theory developed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century and uh he wrote books all the way from about 1959 up until his death in 1990. uh this book is his final book beyond space and time that came out posthumously in 1995. and it is his foray into the metaphysical the philosophical the religious uh and uh he was uh kind of um disappointed many of his adherence because uh really his wife for publishing this uh because they thought that these were just his private notes and he would never want it to be published because he was a scientist and he wrote books on astronomy and physics and chemistry and um you know these were just his private notes on the philosophical and the religious um and the psychological so um anyway but this what we have it looks like it&#x27;s pretty much uh intact so um the basic gist of Larson&#x27;s theory is that the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion and motion is the relationship or the ratio between time and space time and space are reciprocals of each other meaning that they both have the same general qualities space is three-dimensional um parenthetically I would say four dimensional also three or four if you look at the cube the star tetrahedron in the cube that&#x27;s uh what I&#x27;m talking about uh but so if say space is three-dimensional that would also mean that time is three-dimensional and time flows or progresses it&#x27;s always getting later and later in the same way space flows it is always getting further and further apart um now there are also the space and time are quantized meaning that there is a minimum unit of space and there is a minimum unit of time and one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so in Larson&#x27;s system the speed of light is the neutral point of the universe whereas Einstein would say that the speed of light is the maximum speed that&#x27;s because Einstein is only referent referencing the material sector in Larson&#x27;s world the material the uh speed of light is the midpoint and there is half of the universe that&#x27;s moving fast ER than the speed of light called The Cosmic sector or sector two the einsteinian world of the physical universe is what he calls sector one and that is the whole universe that is going slower than the speed of light this world Grows by aggregation meaning you know things just attach to one another until the atoms uh grow to their most complex form which Larson says is the DNA molecule which has billions of atoms per molecule and at that level of complexity the a material unit the DNA molecule becomes uh eligible to be taken over by a cosmic unit uh what Larson would call a control unit uh that this Cosmic unit even though it&#x27;s much smaller uh than the um or it&#x27;s just a minor portion of this material uh combination combination of material and Cosmic it controls the material body uh and that is what Larson calls the life unit and the life unit then uh evolves or we just say develops uh up into its most complex level which Larson calls the intelligent human being or humanoid and uh at that point it becomes eligible to be controlled by a sector 3 unit and sector three is the unit that is uh beyond space and time the range of the uh uh universe that is beyond space and time which I would posit is having something to do with this light uh that is in the at the boundary uh because uh you know when you&#x27;re moving at the speed of light all those relativistic things just go away uh time goes away space goes away and you just have one one over one is one and um at this point then the human being can be con controlled by this sector three which probably a lot of the ancient religions and mythologies would just call God or the spirit world and uh its objectives are good behavior so it uh or ethical Behavior whereas the sector two the sector two control unit is uh geared towards survival so at some points survival is uh uh is in harmony with good behavior but in some other areas it is not it and they work oppositely and at that point the human being has to be able to make a decision uh between the sector 2 control and the sector 3 control anyway we&#x27;ll get to that probably next chapter but right now we&#x27;re dealing with chapter 16 which is on um dream interpretation now remember dreams are the result of sector two um even though they have sector three implications but they&#x27;re really the result of sector two which is our thinking apparatus which concern which consists of both memory and thinking reasoning and uh these uh parts of sector two which are governed by three-dimensional time uh or four uh XYZ coordinates or w x y z coordinates and uh while the sector one is governed by the flow of time or scalar motion of time the flow of time always getting later and later so they work differently and as a result the thinking and the memory uh very often or periodically or every day get out of the sink with the um with the flow of time and they have to be disconnected and rewound to rewind them back into sync uh there&#x27;s a zone of tolerance but uh once it gets kind of outside the zone of tolerance which I would suggest would be a one unit uh then uh they have to be disconnected and rewound but the memory rewinds quicker or doesn&#x27;t need as much rewinding as as the um thinking and so when both are rewinding the individual is asleep when the memory is done rewinding but the thinking still needs more time to rewind than the individual is dreaming or REM sleep so they&#x27;re two different kinds of sleep non-rem and REM and uh one of them is the result of both rewinding non-rem and one is the result of just the thinking rewinding which is the REM sleep and uh and so the thinking is is rewinding the thinking is what generally sensors our thoughts um to what is rational uh whereas memory is operating on the association process and so many bizarre and irrational things can enter by the Association process because you can associate things that are widely different and even contradictory because they have the you know the same qualities in some way or another um so anyway let&#x27;s take over here uh he just got done talking about how uh disagreeing with Freud and others how uh symbolism plays no part in dream and dream interpretation and that the dreams that he has at least can be interpreted using literal uh interpretation as opposed to symbolic interpretation okay so here we&#x27;ll start in the days when dreams were thought to be messages in code originating from some metaphysical Source the idea that the code could be deciphered only by specially trained individuals was not unreasonable but now that this idea has been abandoned and it is conceded that dreaming is a purely physiological process sector two it should not take much reflection to dispose of this far-fetched concealment hypothesis it is simply absurd to suggest that Evolution um or would say development would have gone to all the trouble of producing a special mechanism for the purpose of concealing information from the individual himself surely there is no selection pressure favoring survival of the ignorant even without the new information contributed by this present work it should be clear that the symbolic interpretation of Dreams is too far divorced from reality to be entitled to consider serious consideration uh then he talks about uh the uh nonsense of the popular dream books and horoscopes that are out there uh and he um uses the word nonsense um and says that well you know nonsense is slightly entertaining and you know uh that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s true it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s a horrible thing but it you know it it is nonsense uh and then um uh he then he criticizes Freud&#x27;s uh wish fulfillment hypothesis that the dream is a fulfillment of wishes uh which it you know and Freud says if I succeed in uh uh appeasing my thirst by means of the dream that I am drinking I need not wake up in order to satisfy that thirst uh but that is clearly wrong uh and ridiculous I would say uh because uh you know if you&#x27;re dreaming you&#x27;re not fulfilling any of your wishes they&#x27;re not happening uh you&#x27;re still gonna be thirsty um and Larson then says instead of wish fulfillment what we have here is a memory of a satisfying experience called forth by a stimulus associated with such an experience the difference is not particularly striking but is nevertheless significant the dream itself does not satisfy Freud keeps admitting this even though at the same time he insists that each dream is wish fulfillment uh you know here he says a series of Dreams which are based on the Longing To Go to Rome for Freud asserts it is obvious that I&#x27;m trying in vain to see my dreams in my dreams a city which I have never seen in my Waking Life uh trying in vain as Freud says can hardly be equated with fulfillment uh this again is simply a memory theme elaborated into a synthetic experience during the day something reminded Freud of his desire to see Rome the theme a visit to Rome then carried over into a circulating memory and initiated a dream there is no hidden meaning and no need for an interpretation uh and then he talks about anticipation of uh in dreaming and um dreams that originate from those items in the circulating memory um uh meaning that uh here he says um originating from memories that I deliberately impressed on the circulating memory system in the form of I must remember to do so and so the first thing in the morning uh I cannot determine from the available information whether every such command addressed to the memory system before retiring resulted in a dream but I do know that uh in this month that I was testing my dreams there were only three occasions during the month on in which it was necessary for me to rise before my usual hour to take care of such self-imposed responsibilities and in every one of these alarm clock instances the matter with which I was to deal in the morning became the theme of A Dream this experience is a strong indication that any instructions given to the memory to be retained overnight are reflected in the dream themes as would be expected from the theory developed um and then he goes and criticizes another uh aspect of the wish fulfillment hypothesis um the hid the Forbidden wishes and um the UNH inhibited expression but then he says the dream is merely a replay of experience the process that might deserve to be called uninhibited expression is daydreaming in which the individual exercises conscious direction to shape events to his liking in Freud&#x27;s thirst initiated dream the entire situation was simple and his report brief as it is contains enough information to indicate its true character as a simple memory recall most dreams however cannot be understood without a reasonably detailed knowledge of the events in the life of the dreamer that took place during the preceding day a good illustration of how essential it is to have this information is provided by one of the dreams recorded by my study the dream consisted of three distinct Parts I had a clear memory of the first and last while my recollection of the second was rather vagan confused the original record of the episode reads as follows I had experienced some kind of good fortune the nature of which was not identified it was evidently a matter of common knowledge as just about everyone I passed stopped to talk to me even those I did not know however they did not seem to be congratulating me nor did I feel any special satisfaction uh so that was his dream report uh those who regard dreams as prophetic would have no difficulty in interpreting this dream as a favorable Omen those of the wish fulfillment school could just as easily see it as a result of my desire of some kind of good fortune although my apparent indifference to the outcome could would have to be explained away in some fashion when I examined the dream report several hours after recording it in the course of my regular procedure I could find nothing in the previous day&#x27;s events to which it seemed to have any relation I therefore gave it a tentative classification as unexplained um okay uh okay then uh he goes to the third part of the dream an unidentified friend met me and wanted me to play some kind of a game with him I agreed to do so it was not any of the standard games which I am acquainted and had some complicated rules which he had to explain to me while we were busy with the explanation someone came in and tampered with the lights causing them to become dim so we could not continue no doubt those who work with symbols and hidden meanings could have had a field day with playing some kind of a game but I could easily see that it was a direct memory the unidentified friend was one of the local supermarkets the game they wanted me to play was a promotional feature that they were starting called the cash king game I agreed to play in the sense that I accepted one of the cards uh which were being handed out to purchasers the complicated rules of the game were explained to me by that card the dimming of the lights was the way in which the dream expressed the fact that some parts of the material on the card were in such fine print that I had to stop reading and get a magnifying glass before I could finish here we have pure memory modified only by the generalizing that takes place in passing through the circulate circulating memory system the easily found origin of this third theme of the dream then made the origin of the First theme clear it was also drawn from the same Source The Good Fortune of the dream was the prize money to be distributed to winners of the game and the reason for my indifference was my realization that the odds against winning anything were astronomical the reason for the separation between the two themes was that they were separated in time several hours between a lapse between my first contact with the game and my perusal of the rules the futility of any attempt to interpret these two dream episodes without having a reasonably good knowledge of my activities during the preceding day is evident the same can be said about almost all of the dreams included in my study but when that knowledge is available the dreams can be understood in purely matter of fact way in a purely matter-of-fact way without any esoteric or psychic implications there is no need for symbols or wish fulfillment hypotheses in the interpretation nor is there any deliberate Distortion or concealment involved why is an interpretation necessary at all why does not the dream say directly what it means asks Freud the conclusion he reaches is that the dreams are distorted as a means of Disguise But Here Again The Very dream that he cites as the first example to support his conclusions is readily ex readily understandable on the basis that it does say directly what it means uh now he goes into a uh an example using Freud uh and we&#x27;ll probably get to that tomorrow now I just want to say that uh one of Larson&#x27;s strongest adherents Bruce perrett has a strong a disagreement with this Bruce Pratt was actually excuse me was actually a person who was a lucid dreamer and almost every night he would claim to have lucid dreams and you know travel throughout the lucid dream is basically where you kind of wake up in your dream recognize that you&#x27;re dreaming and start taking control of the dream um and uh he had a whole protocol for dreaming so he takes Larson a task on this eventually um and we&#x27;ll see the results of that uh as well uh but anyway have a good day and we&#x27;ll catch you tomorrow uh looking at this dream interpretation</p>
