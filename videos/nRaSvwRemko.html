            <p>&gt;&gt; IF YOU FOLLOW THE UEFA WISH  OR YOU HAVE PROBABLY NOTICED  THAT MANY OF THE MOST  COMPELLING ENCOUNTERS IN  RECENT YEARS HAVE HAPPENED  BETWEEN UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT AND  U.S. NAVY ASSETS. THE FAMED  USS NIMITZ, TIC TAC IS JUST  ONE EXAMPLE. WHATEVER THEY  ARE, THESE THINGS SEEM TO  SPEND A LOT OF TIME AROUND  WATER NOW THAT HAS FUELED  SPECULATION THAT ALIENS MIGHT  LIVING ON THE OCEAN FLOOR  INSTEAD OF ABOVE OUR HEADS IN  SPACE. THAT FASCINATING THEORY  IS THE BASIS FOR THE LATEST  NEWS NATIONS.</p>
<p>SPECIAL REALITY  CHECK WITH ROSS CALLED HEART  UNDERWATER. UF OWES IT AIRS  THIS SATURDAY AT 08:00PM  EASTERN ROSS AND HIS TEAM  INVESTIGATE REPORTS OF A  MYSTERIOUS UNDERWATER HIGHWAY.  YEAH, YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT.  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF  UNIDENTIFIED SUBMERSIBLE  OBJECTS OR U.S. OWES HAVE THEY  BEEN AS ARE CALLED HAVE BEEN  SIGHTED OFF UNITED STATES  SHORELINES MOST FREQUENTLY OFF  THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA.</p>
<p> THAT&#x27;S WHERE THE TEAM MET OF  BOAT CAPTAIN, WHO IS SPEAKING  OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT  HIS HARROWING ENCOUNTER WITH  SEVERAL COLOR CHANGING OR  &gt;&gt; THAT&#x27;S WHAT REALLY  INTERESTS JUST WITH YOUR CASE  BECAUSE HOW LONG WOULD YOU SAY  THAT WHOLE DURATION FROM WHEN  YOU SAW THESE THINGS? YOU HAVE  A COUPLE MINUTES ON THAT  VIDEO. BUT IF YOU WERE TO SAY  FROM START TO STOP ON ONE SET  OF THOSE ORANGE, A SLIGHT, HOW  LONG WERE THEY UP IN THE  PROBABLY AS  &gt;&gt; FLYING CLOSE MY BOAT FOR  ABOUT 10 MINUTES. THERE&#x27;S SOME  SMALLER ONES OFF IN THE  DISTANCE. YOU DON&#x27;T SEE THE  VIDEO, BUT  &gt;&gt; IT START OUT LIKE AS 3  SAID, WERE CLOSE TOGETHER LIKE  IN A TRIANGULAR PATTERN AND  THEY&#x27;D ALL KIND BEING THEY  WERE CHANGING COLORS FROM RED,  BLACK, ORANGE. AND SOMEWHERE  SIT ON BALL STUFF AND THEY  WOULD MERGE TOGETHER AS ONE  AND THEN THEY&#x27;D SPLIT OFF  THEIR BE 2 OF THEM.</p>
<p>THEN  THERE&#x27;D BE ONE. THEN THERE BE  3 OF THEM AND CERTAIN POINTS  THEY JUST DISAPPEARED  ALTOGETHER. AND WE&#x27;RE JUST  REAPPEAR. THEY DROP DOWN CLOSE  TO THE WATER LIKE RIGHT ABOVE  THE WATER AND STARTED COMING  TOWARDS ME.  &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p>HERE TO PREVIEW  HIS SPECIAL IS ROSS CALLED  TARP ROSS. GREAT TO HAVE YOU  BACK ON THE SHOW.  &gt;&gt; SO WHAT IS WHAT IS IT ABOUT  THE COAST OFF CALIFORNIA?  WHY&#x27;D YOU THINK WE HAVE SO  MANY REPORTED ENCOUNTERS  THERE.  &gt;&gt; HELLO, ELIZABETH. I DON&#x27;T  THINK IT&#x27;S A COINCIDENCE THAT  CALIFORNIA INTO SOME OF THE  BIGGEST AEROSPACE COMPANIES IN  AMERICA.</p>
<p>AND IT&#x27;S ALSO  PROBABLY THE CLOSEST POINT  WHERE, IF YOU WILL, NORM HUMAN  CIVILIZATION, YOU COULD HIDE  YOURSELF VERY SUCCESSFULLY AND  THOUSANDS OF METERS OF WATER  WITH A REASONABLE DEGREE OF  CERTAINTY THAT YOU WOULDN&#x27;T BE  DETECTED THE AS WE KNOW,  THERE&#x27;S HUGE GULF, SOME WATER  JUST OFF THE COAST OF  CALIFORNIA. THE BAJA,  CALIFORNIA AREA, OR IS WE THE  U.S. NIMITZ INCIDENT HAPPENED  IN 2004 AND WE KNOW WILL SIDE  OF THAT IS BEING REPEATED  SIGHTINGS OF THE NORMAL U.S.  PHENOMENON OF TRUST THAT BOAT  CAPTAINS STORE. BUT MANY, MANY  DOZENS, IN FACT, HUNDREDS OF  SIGHTINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE  AROUND CATALINA ISLAND JUST  OFF THE COAST OF A LIE.</p>
<p>AND I  GUESS MANY SPECULATING HERE.  BUT IF YOU WILL, THE AND  CIVILIZED NATION, YOU 71% OF  DEPENDENTS. IF THIS IS WATER  AND IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR A  NEW TRIAL ENVIRONMENT THAT  SAID TEMPERATURE CONSISTENT,  WE&#x27;D LOVE TO LIGHT. WE YOU  WANT TO HIDE IF THERE IS ALIEN  SPECIES TARGETING THIS KIND A  LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THERE IS,  INCLUDING SITTING CONGRESSMAN,  THAT WOULD BE THE PLACE TO  HIDE. YEAH.</p>
<p>AND IT&#x27;S I&#x27;VE  NOTED ON THE SHOW BEFORE.  &gt;&gt; 27% OF THE OCEAN IS MAPPED  OUT BY HUMANS. WE ONLY KNOW  WE&#x27;VE MAPPED OUT 27% OF OUR  OCEANS. WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THE  SERVICE OF MARS AND THE  SURFACE OF THE MOON WE DO  ABOUT OUR OWN OCEANS.  &gt;&gt; THAT&#x27;S SO TRUE.</p>
<p>AND  ELIZABETH, I&#x27;LL TELL YOU, I&#x27;VE  SPOKEN TO SUB MARINERS WHO  WORKING OUT OF THE SUBMARINE  FLEET WITH NUCLEAR SUBMARINES  UP NEAR SEATTLE. IT AND  THEY&#x27;VE TOLD ME THAT RECORDED  AN ANOMALOUS PHENOMENA MOVING  FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF SOUND  AND THE WATER LIKE THAT&#x27;S  THAT&#x27;S THAT&#x27;S IT. FASTER THAN  1000 NOTES UNDER WATER. WE  DON&#x27;T HAVE AY CROFT IN THE  HUMAN  &gt;&gt; TECHNOLOGY THAT PRESSURE  THAT THE WATER PRESSURE THAT  TO TO IT. HARD TO SWIM IN THE  OCEAN AND KNOW, YOU CAN&#x27;T  ACROSS THE SWIMMIMING POL ALL  VERY FAST.</p>
<p>YOU THE WAY YOU CAN  RUN ON GROUND. IT IS HARD TO  MOVE FAST AT ALL AND EROSION.  &gt;&gt; YES, SO WE HAVE THIS VERY  SILLY SITUATION WHERE EVEN  UNDER THE CURRENT  ADMINISTRATION, THERE&#x27;S A KIND  OF A DENIAL ABOUT THE  POSSIBILITY OF NORMAL HUMAN  INTELLIGENCE OR CHAI. BUT THE  PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING FORWARD  TO ME INTO BEING HENSON IN  THIS STORY, I BASICALLY PEOPLE  WHO&#x27;VE WORKED ON THE WATER  AROUND CATALINA RUN WE&#x27;VE  SPOKEN TO PEOPLE IN THE  MILITARY AND THERE IS OF FAST  NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE  WILLING TO GO ON THE RECORD TO  SITE. THEY HAVE WITNESSED A  NORMAL US PHENOMENA.</p>
<p>I&#x27;M WALL  TO DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS  AT JUST A YES OR NO ANSWER  BECAUSE IT WILL BE A TEASER.  BUT  &gt;&gt; DO THEIR STORIES IS IT? ARE  THEY DESCRIBING THE SAME THING  OR A BUNCH OF DIFFERENTHINGS  THAT THEY&#x27;RE SAYING VERY MUCH  THE SAME THING. OKAY. VERY  MUCH. THE VERY, VERY  INTERESTING.</p>
<p>AND BY THE WAY,  TO YOUR POINT THAT CALIFORNIA  IS THE HOME TO SO MANY  MILITARY BASES. WE KNOW THAT  MANY OF THE UFO SIGHTINGS ON  FACILITIES OR SENSITIVE AR  INSTALLATIONS. SO  &gt;&gt; ROSS CALLED HEART. THANKS  SO MUCH. THE SPECIAL UIS FO&#x27;S UNDERWATER </p>
