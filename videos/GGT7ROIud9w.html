            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>our next speaker began this quest for better fuel efficiency with his brother Don modifying fuel systems in 1984 or Ford Tempo taking it from eighteen point six miles per gallon to an amazing 108 feet with huge gains in performance in March of 2009 he discovered the modification for air systems the gadget man room it has proven to increase mileage substantially boost power at the same time using a multi gas analyzer the gadget man groove which is currently patent-pending has shown a reduction of hydrocarbon emissions 70% more welcome run no stretch of mock come up on stage a lot first of all thank you everyone three years ago I was nothing more than a fraud local tinkerer working on my ex-girlfriends Land Rover okay always had a passion for fuel efficiency and when I was so maybe this big welcomed by our regular station wagon my dad was working he always worked god bless he thought he was became yeah anyway so I won&#x27;t buy it and this ditch was coming out of the tailpipe yeah we all know what that is that&#x27;s right we do know now is go into your ancient air and feel the smell coming up to tell my it&#x27;s not right so anyway but I smell there&#x27;s that smell he said oh yeah the carburetors running a little rich that&#x27;s fuel to use now at that point I realized there was something not quite right because we&#x27;re putting stuff in the end of the tank it goes through the engine comes out the top without really giving us any benefit right so I worked on things you know and I&#x27;ve seen some pretty amazing stuff how many of you guys are actually developed actually working on something you have an idea if it&#x27;s only on paper count something there developer how we give you longer and that&#x27;s about about 90% of the group all right I guess the rest of you guys are just curious right okay well hopefully you&#x27;re going to get a runny curiosity satisfied this week you know my Kurata I&#x27;m going to talk to you alright this man I know you heard what he&#x27;s doing he&#x27;s doing exactly what we all need to be doing just taking whatever resources we have and then sharing that with people in the best way that we know how to help you accomplish your goals okay well since that time when I mark my nose and my dad&#x27;s exalted right now there&#x27;s a few people here that were with me yesterday when I did some modifications what you guys raise your hands okay quite see all right how many of you guys actually smelled the exhaust coming out vehicles one two three all right but you guys just stand up for something easier all right let&#x27;s let&#x27;s start with you tell me what you smell coming on the tub out the tub what just now thank you well just tell me thank you thank you hardly hardly any fumes out of the truck thank you a lot of Hollywood what you would find on stage like yet see what what has happened in the automotive industry yes through what I believe to be surreptitious means with alternative ends they have designed many things into the engine to force it to consume more fuel okay now this is a very common idea but how have they done it well I&#x27;m gonna give you guys a couple of things to gauge we take only use on your car right now number one there&#x27;s there&#x27;s two things to consider when you consider the vaporization linearization has to occur before combustion can take place okay it make sense to not burn a liquid because it has to mix with the oxygen before it can burn make sense okay so but there&#x27;s two factors there&#x27;s temperature or BTU content and pressure by the standard wolof temperature pressure plus what&#x27;s the point point of water somebody&#x27;s begun right 212 degrees right at sea level that&#x27;s the whole equation but most people forget the second half they say 200 month grades most people don&#x27;t even know what the point point of water is I have hundreds and hundreds of them most of them say exactly what would you repeat that place stand up stand up anybody here and it stays in liquid state on their pressure like here what&#x27;s an altitude about thousand feet maybe 2,300 okay so far doesn&#x27;t both to our properties here it boils at somewhere around 209 maybe 208 Denver it boils at 203 why is it to bless me boiling because there&#x27;s less atmosphere pressure pushing now this is a standard thing that is taught in the 6th 7th 8th grades now all right and these automotive engineers that go to school for 8 to 12 years are pretending like they don&#x27;t know it because how many vacuum lines do you see on your intake manifolds nowadays ok it&#x27;s a nightmare right ok but everything you attach to Indianapolis where the vacuum is created in the engine creates a load on that fact so the piston starts pointing down the hoses collapse infinitesimally but it&#x27;s enough to soften the vacuum that could be presented to your feeling now what the games main group does is it amplifies of natural occurring process inside the engine the way the engine works right now it helps it do what it&#x27;s already doing which is what we should be doing is working in harmony with our engines right PCV valve this is a pollution control of the box right no it&#x27;s a pollution creation device because it drains off the substantial portion to get back to your engine so the first thing what you guys do is going to check this out for yourself pull off the vacuum line on the intake manifold to your PCV valve put it back in the cabinet&#x27;s place and drive your car right you&#x27;ll notice that your power will up you&#x27;ll notice that your emissions will go down and you&#x27;ll also notice that you&#x27;ll get probably one maybe as much as three or four extra miles per gallon out of your car just by capping off the PCB on how come you guys it right in as dim okay right now PCB the positive crankcase ventilation that means they&#x27;re using the force to create a vent well it doesn&#x27;t need a force it just needs a vent the crankcase ventilation system there&#x27;s a system is the supply air comes from before the throttle body between the throttle body and the air filter runs in one side of the engine goes down to the crankcase picks up the fumes and thing goes back up into the PCV Bell when you disconnect the PCV no it&#x27;s still gonna vent it&#x27;s just we&#x27;ve been to different location it&#x27;s not going to steal your engine vacuum okay well on the same page with that alright there&#x27;s another area where they steal from us and we just accept it okay your spark plugs now this is not true on every engine but about 90% of them I worked on this works okay your coil has a maximum rate of say what we&#x27;ll call it a hundred thousand volts just to make it easy to figure your spark but there&#x27;s a decay in all electronic systems over time right so if they manufacture a car the coils rated of hundred thousand volts and they know that they wanted to last say five years well over a five year period that quote make the Canaan to say eighty thousand volts or even more right so what they did they set the spark plug at say forty thousand volts but the coils charged on a ramp and what happens is as soon as it hits enough charge inside that system it discharges based on the gap of the spark plug okay okay oh why do get requires more voltage and narrow gap wires west try this if you&#x27;ve got a single coil system it doesn&#x27;t matter if a single coil system then it&#x27;s easier to do pull one put one start the engine pull one plug wire listen to the change in the engine shut the engine off pull the spark plug increase the gap by 20 a factory okay reinstall the spark plug listen Dean pull the prop 1 notice how much you change its what you want to do is you want to hear a lot of change in total all of a sudden it doesn&#x27;t change anymore then you hit the maximum value sylheti continue to increase the gap one is parked by 20% until that spark plug begins to misfire okay then you know that you think the maximum value go back to the previous setting and apply that value to all of your spark plugs by doing this for one with nothing else to an engine I&#x27;ve given as much as five miles to the gallon on car five miles to the gallon just might be getting your spark plugs the engineers don&#x27;t know this you know you know I didn&#x27;t graduate high school these guys been calls for eight years they don&#x27;t know their basic science somebody&#x27;s not sure we&#x27;ll real simple increase the gap by 20% over stop what you&#x27;re trying to do is find out what the max value of your coil hits you don&#x27;t know it doesn&#x27;t really matter if what the backs down don&#x27;t get to add even else because okay all right just get to the maximum that that coil will put out so you just keep increasing the gap on that spark plug until it spark plug no longer fires you listen to the engine use your ears okay you can tell it by the way the engines running when it starts missing okay if when you pull the plug wire the engine doesn&#x27;t change then that plug is missing you say okay so you pull that back down to the next step and then you apply that down into all your spark plugs you guys got that yeah because they think why I don&#x27;t know why does it what why does the increasing efficiency because with the wider cap it allows the coil to charge it to a higher level which is more voltage more voltages more energy more energy delivered to the spark delivered to the field inside chamber equals better combustion Sesame count them yeah look just look at some some have coils right on top the spark plugs now those have to do individually okay it&#x27;s a bit of a process but once you have that maximum value from your system if you ever go back to changes parklets what you usually don&#x27;t meet right then you&#x27;ve got the back just live it down and whatever you sell the party might take you down box F keep it forever didn&#x27;t tell the next owner this is Nova this this will save you some money do this on the rescue cars you&#x27;ll be happy alright there&#x27;s a few out there I don&#x27;t remember what the specifics are that don&#x27;t respond to that de Morny maxed amount and the interest of better efficiency but the vast majority of vehicles out there on the road are poorly poorly adjusted and we&#x27;re using factory settings I&#x27;ve done so many tune ups where after going full tune-up new plug wires plugs yep rotary all that the mileage goes down one because of a little thing called gap creep I use do you say yes is heaven to you right there&#x27;s probably a bunch of us out there oh my god it&#x27;s timing good to not I want my my let&#x27;s go up and it goes down instead right why is that because if you ever bother content your spark plug when you pull it out there&#x27;s a thing called gap creep every time that spark plug fires it burns a little bit of the metal off so your gap is supposed to be like this keeps getting wider and wider and wider as it gets wider the coil must deliver more voltage to jump that gap it also returns the timing a little bit so it&#x27;s firing later in the cycle closer to top dead center most of the concept on the road today are putting it 30 degrees before top dead center piston has need to come up to the top and then already fired why because the fuel is crap right somebody told me I can&#x27;t repeat the guy&#x27;s name okay I get interesting phone calls I have some really interesting okay yeah you guys will too you got it if you don&#x27;t want write it and probably did have uh call me up said Ron listen I got some news for you said you know my company ABC company will call it just received a shipment of chemicals alright hazardous waste said they put it into the refinery into the refinery think about that for just a minute the garbage that the manufacturing companies can&#x27;t get rid of you&#x27;re now paying the oil companies gas tank okay now this is just rumor has it but doesn&#x27;t it make sense you know it makes if you&#x27;re a business corporate and you say well I can&#x27;t pay to get rid of this stuff ooh you know what I&#x27;ll sell it to the oil companies will make a profit and the people will never know what hit them not until it&#x27;s way too late cancer asthma the list goes on right if we the people suffer because okay now while I know that the gauge man group is only a small piece of the puzzle of a true freedom truth power people it&#x27;s okay so I&#x27;ve kept the prospectus most possibly can yeah guys it&#x27;s spread around the world it&#x27;s now in more than 20 countries 20 countries okay I&#x27;ve got an organization Russia this growing here&#x27;s a little tidbit for you Russia the vehicles that receive the gas main roof respond in a certain way not a single Russian vehicle that&#x27;s received engaged member who&#x27;s got less than 50 percent increasing mileage not less than 50% now a young been dealing with this for three years for 50% it&#x27;s not impressive to me okay it is to you guys but you just never hear about this right okay if you get less than 20% increase of mileage after the driven plug your vehicle I apologize okay every modification hasn&#x27;t been a 100% money-back guarantee why would I do that once I have your money should not be happy well but if you&#x27;re not I&#x27;m not okay do you do sergeant you&#x27;ll find that there are people out there that try the group that somebody else put on then I didn&#x27;t teach how to do it all right there&#x27;s one that Prescott McCurry lives up in there look mom right call me that one day said he was screaming at me I said well hold on Coleman I don&#x27;t remember your name did you know my forgetting you say he said no no no you didn&#x27;t do that brother so-and-so did isolate what your pikas name now I help everybody in my first name last name where they live usually their spouses names of children to write something about me I remember people for years they&#x27;re surprised and I said well I don&#x27;t know him I did not teach him how to do that so whatever he did your throttle body was not the gadget manager that&#x27;s the bad news here&#x27;s the good news I&#x27;ll fix it he said what I said y&#x27;all fix it for you I didn&#x27;t get paid from it I usually don&#x27;t but you or by the gauge man Ruth you didn&#x27;t get the cage man group you sent me your throttle money I&#x27;ll fix it also at no charge okay well I&#x27;m sure why not right so he says be a solid money I take one look at it and it was just a disaster I reach out my shot so just reach over like this and I turn right over to the computer and start doing a search for a throttle body call them up same time get this followed by $42 no problem they present us that doesn&#x27;t batteries I throw them it&#x27;s all finally get be fixed this is just too far gone you know I said that good news is I&#x27;m not what are you doing I just wanted to call you and let you know it&#x27;s gonna take a couple of weeks before I can get it to maybe two days what you do there for me listen yeah you don&#x27;t even know I said I don&#x27;t know you I am you just like so many other people on this planet that had bought what something they thought they were buying actually to not be something else well this man caught the catch in Hamburg I may not think it doesn&#x27;t cost me much to be great right so I&#x27;m in a position where I&#x27;ve got a few dollars I can afford to buy on the throttle body and I can afford to make it right so I did piece of broth you said you really do that one yes sure when in fact I&#x27;m getting ready to find out like you said dumb he said you see then it&#x27;s cool right so he sends me this third smaller body I modified a Senate back he gets 68 percent in place in his Jeep now he sent me five more throttle bodies without asking for a discount I really love those customers he is one of the most outspoken proponents of my business block because I did the best I could okay that&#x27;s what really want to do more we do that the stronger we become as an organization because it&#x27;s not I didn&#x27;t bring me here you guys problem in here whether you can be before or not it&#x27;s your efforts to make this better planet a better place that has brought me to where I am today everybody in my network I&#x27;m just you know I&#x27;m not a rocket scientist I don&#x27;t have a PhD I didn&#x27;t write an article right I&#x27;m just a deeper with a dream that God smiled on one day you gave me flashing inspiration that first Connor it was the 2000 land rover discovery get about 200 miles of time go to the airport talking to a pilot holds the world record for efficiency in flat broke his own record like six times right and he&#x27;s describing the turbulence over his wings oh this is going to take a look at you suban so I love it this crap and you think about fish you see a flight you think it&#x27;s slicing through the air right you want least resistance possible right everybody agree with that right ah no I look this way until later in front of is ailerons he&#x27;s got these little plastic things sticking up we&#x27;ve seen them write generators right let&#x27;s sing on I know what they were but I couldn&#x27;t figure out what they were to hear all right so I moved on I said Strega must bid 30 alone each plane I said it&#x27;s good what are those he said those are called boards generators on Tyson I&#x27;ve known that but I could never quite be in my head realize what was happening yeah I saw know that there is it one thing they do yeah and that&#x27;s when it hit me he said Ron what those things do is they grab the air and force it to roll down over my ailerons so I have more control of my path in flight don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve never studied aerodynamics until after the group never before in my life have I ever stood each other&#x27;s ever and I go wow if I could do that inside an engine something great what happened and there&#x27;s this energy that comes with a good idea right you know you can&#x27;t put the idea down and I couldn&#x27;t and then instantly the shape was in my head as to what I had to did the idea didn&#x27;t come from me all right I&#x27;ll give God credit Porter so I&#x27;m like man and this this idea will not leave I cannot get it out of my head and as soon as I get home I can&#x27;t wait I don&#x27;t even go in the house I pop the hood on the Land Rover and pull the throttle body off it and guys I&#x27;m broke I don&#x27;t even have five bucks to my name and I look at this I use a dead man&#x27;s friends folding table gravel driveway hundred and two degrees right Phoenix is not a cool City all right some people think I yeah and that&#x27;s where this came from when I cut the groove into the first of all but it was nowhere near as good as it is today the first thing that happened when I stepped on the gas that was the tires broke loose you guys don&#x27;t land over there dogs they may climb a tree but they&#x27;re not going to do it best okay getting worried because it&#x27;s something worked you don&#x27;t know done is it gonna break you know this is having haulers we do something it really responds well at first but then disaster strikes Oh Land Rover right so okay well you know I&#x27;m not the best but it seems like the engines running smooth look at the sanding good it&#x27;s got more power and we take it out right my girlfriend&#x27;s out running around in town the following Friday I just pulled up to a red light and she&#x27;s got you near miss Knight and so so she pulls up to red light and as dude the Corvette pulls up next door told the story today yeah so she looks back in run run back get your son right when the light changes they both punch okay teeth this day she swears that that Land Rover was in front of the Corvette for 400 yards 7,000 pounds being pushed by a 4.0 liter beginning you guys know your physics right 7,000 s plus the brush popper and the running board from the driver you look at 7,500 maybe 8,000 pounds by time you get done with everything she had on that hard including her oh I&#x27;m running a 2,000 pound car with an L - 35.7 engine that&#x27;s impossible the Corvette is designed to race nothing ever happened it be but these stories didn&#x27;t need to come in day after day today IV phone calls all the time my favorite a little women but it all makes eighties nineties it&#x27;s crazy but yeah then I take the informations Phoenix is one of the cities blessed with that organization and Latin PM says fails because the computers not ready so here&#x27;s a here&#x27;s a slip right this&#x27;ll teach you how to maintain its it&#x27;s good for 30 days take it up drive it for a couple of miles and come back and see oh okay good time for a road trip alright so we leave paintings we go from northern Arizona which is mountainous we we don&#x27;t stay on the highway we&#x27;re doing national forests around 30 miles back just in case right and we just drove that thing and drove it and drove it and drove it drove it drove it and it had more power more pep you could smell the tailpipe you know I said man it&#x27;s a land run right so it&#x27;s got everything you make it out yeah wonder does it work on other cars one limousine my neighbor&#x27;s crosses faith is that one thing so I thought I said mine what&#x27;s up brother I see man you don&#x27;t want to do it right of course I can&#x27;t keep my mouth shut it&#x27;s for not be 200 billion dollars by the way one of the stipulations we&#x27;ll never speak to back well that totally makes the deal sorry I can&#x27;t keep my mouth shut so goodbye this is my club did you talk dude he&#x27;s supposed to my wives he said sure a little did he know her her truck was getting max at 40 miles an hour which isn&#x27;t too bad for two well it&#x27;s about everything well from 14 to 21 miles a gallon okay this is pretty cool something I started throwing out the neighborhood cars I still have told anybody this except the people on the lawns for maybe the 23rd that&#x27;s a development launch mode 9 during the month of April on the land rubber then you start doing other people&#x27;s cars May the 23rd and phone call hi this is Jim flat do motors I heard about what you&#x27;re building we&#x27;d like to talk to you yeah I&#x27;ve got half a dozen different projects on my I still come in my head today right then I&#x27;m going to be bringing out so I don&#x27;t know what do you say exactly he&#x27;s talking about what you doing that day said yeah I said well what are we talking about right what are we talking about here it makes perfect sense to me tell me what you&#x27;re interested in well learn another talk I&#x27;m gonna start with about 50 million dollars I would into instantaneous talk because I was not okay so I started laughing lock behind could not control myself yeah and I&#x27;m sure the guy thought I was nothing squirrel good a lot of people agreed and he made some noise that started with Evan Enid with you and hung up the phone I&#x27;m still laughing okay laughing for good reason I just laughed away fifty million dollars what do you light up a crop you know yeah and then I said you know I said to myself well then I guess I&#x27;m not supposed to sell it and when I heard that thought this feeling of rightness came over all right just just yes that&#x27;s right and then wouldn&#x27;t it be led to we all need to know all right that there&#x27;s wave of energy has been just that&#x27;s the right sources right choice it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re supposed to do that&#x27;s only after a crowd a little bit less fifty million dollars at all I decided that that&#x27;s what I was going to do and I sort of put my mindset and to bringing this to the public to the people on this planet to help corporations right they&#x27;re interested in lining their pockets at our expense and the more it costs us to happier they are right back story I don&#x27;t know of one that is already in it to help people I said but a district so to the first to make the announcement public well as using the 14th for cults they&#x27;re all produced by a bit more substantial this time says probably you&#x27;ve heard about what you&#x27;re doing pretty much the same opening it says uh we&#x27;d like to fly you up to each one which up top floor the high get you a rental car for a whole week tickets to all the best shows in town this will they come taste all the best shows in town all we wants about six hours in time on Friday meet with old okay um what are we talking about here they said well we&#x27;re gonna start talking at four hundred million dollars I said well okay now by this time I&#x27;ve had three weeks to condition myself get ready you know this operas going to come in I said well okay well we can talk licensing for that nothing since to me there are manufacturing right but they want they want to license the technology or on new cars because that&#x27;s what they do right not exactly I said what we can talk licensing for that listen up hub what do you mean wiesen see mister having it like it&#x27;s a foreign language damn right I suppose you be the only new car manufacturer authorized to use the technology in the United States oh no no no mister you misunderstand I say oh really well clarify for me help me understand no we want to buy your technology we want to buy the technology I say okay I what does that mean to all the people that have the group on the cars right now well mr. hatten those peers would have to come off I said what they don&#x27;t want to sell me their total bugs I have a new car it&#x27;s 400 million you can afford it and buy and I&#x27;ve got you on a member of this family guys just like you guys on now dr. Kalam Ibiza because I&#x27;m only one person I can only do so many cars but but you guys we can do a whole hell of a lot more right so I said a lot about all the people I promised technology to they said well mr. hatten any contractor either into on behalf the technology would have to be finding the guy wanna make more than me to make myself out to be a liar to my customers and the colleagues that ain&#x27;t happenin not this one I said well let me make a couple things on the table for you sir I said I don&#x27;t want your response I&#x27;ll let you know what I want you to answer me but I&#x27;ve got a few things over saying I said there are 54 cities in Mexico right now under pollution alert where the area is considered unfit Thank You mr. breathe and it&#x27;s 90 percent due to the pollution created by gasoline engines you know this I said they won&#x27;t even talk about Pakistan and let Mongolian India and all the other places that are suffering from extreme pollution caused by combustibles in combustion engines let&#x27;s bring back home I&#x27;m starting to get charged now I said there are 30 million people out of work in the United States right here today that was the published figures back then it&#x27;s still alive like it is now 30 million people out of work I said at least half of those are at least half of those men work on their own cards I could put them to work I could teach this technology they could apply it in their various help their families maybe save their houses I said what about the major cities in the United States right here our asthma rates are going up over 200% as a direct result of the pollution company all these engines I can help with that so forget about all that and me going background my dad wasn&#x27;t around very much when I was kid my mom works second third shift place called Lake manufacturing the owners I&#x27;ll remember it to this day so many weeks we ate peanut butter macaroni and cheese and I would go down the street but I had a lot of listeners and I&#x27;ve known my neighbors say hey let me trim the front yard and I take the money giving my mom for gas a lot of us you know a lot of students like that I said I said sir final statement I said what about all the families out there right now that are happening choose between gasoline to get them back and forth to work and grocers don&#x27;t show what about you said I&#x27;m in tears just like I am right now it was so frustrating how many tons have they done that he said mister he said for 400 million dollars you have to get all about them uh-huh yeah wrong answer wait wrong answer I said then you have to forget about me and my technology hung up the phone and I set it down relative broken six pieces new cell phone and that&#x27;s what these guys have done then they continue to do it they use money to buy people because people think money is the answer to their problems it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s community working together is the answer that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m in tears right now on this stage because God saw fit to give me I put together with my vision and now guys we have something that only works every time doesn&#x27;t learn it you don&#x27;t have to be king with we can help stuff like that and it&#x27;ll help whatever you&#x27;re doing because it works in harmony with the engine how much time do I have left show you if I may how many of you guys have seen some of my videos all ophélie few I guess I&#x27;m not as famous as I thought I was oh yeah I&#x27;m a gadget man global are you really gonna do is look up one more gadget ge ge ge ma a.m.</p>
<p>if you type that into your Google you&#x27;ll find me on the front page if you type if you type GAE Chi into YouTube on your own computer by the time you get to the e it&#x27;s already suggesting that you look at against me rude okay that&#x27;s definite president first of all time  Wow but I guess I guess YouTube does recognize me a little bit because my videos have been watched only about two hundred thousand times that&#x27;s not a lot on YouTube some video is get a million beautiful is it - Jonathan Bieber is a baby right so so good man go write this down for you real soon this is this is my corporate channel I know you guys probably can&#x27;t see this and if you want to learn something about me as a person also got another channel the poet okay I think I do want to be a punk because I&#x27;ve never done topic before group like this so almost one way in an internal combustion engine piston driven you know crankshaft that rolls it pulls the piston down as the crankshaft holes pretty simple right top dead center for five degrees rotation of the crank there&#x27;s virtually no vertical movement of the piston against no demand for the air right here at 90 degrees five degrees rotation the piston moves the fastest the highest demand for air then as the crankshaft continues to rolled up to the bomb the demand decreases until it reverses direction it goes back up the other way on the compression strap we&#x27;re only going to talk about the intake struggle because that&#x27;s what it feels better that&#x27;s when everything happens with gage you may agree after that after about 95 degrees rotation is mengu is almost done okay so the piston speeds up and slows down this creates a personal curve the intake manifold that runs something like this from about 19 inches to 15 inches and just like the EPA says your your mileage may vary these numbers will change so don&#x27;t hold me to this but that&#x27;s about wrong well the kids from your group both this discrete said personally right well there&#x27;s a hole in the neural acts of the pole so it&#x27;s just like this is constant way forever going on in your inches long it&#x27;s going up and down another with the groove the latest design yes the follow plate it sits like this inside of the tube right all of the air is moving this direction dad all right so all of the air is moving this direction that means whatever there is this throttle plate right here in order for it to be going that way has to come down the frontal plane yeah okay so that means all of this air underneath there also gets compressed so when you wind up with a very high pressure zone right there at the bottom of the table okay as it is it&#x27;s got to shrink down so this is a huge level of compression you getting that little crack and then it starts expanding as it goes out okay that&#x27;s the way in Memphis now now with the gauge man group this is what creates laid in between those large balls is this okay so what we&#x27;re going to do is I&#x27;m going to put the groove in there for my tripod falls over just shoot me all right okay so now here&#x27;s it&#x27;s all about now the kids man group is extremely particularly if it&#x27;s off by more than six degrees it ceases to provide my lodgings okay it is freaking sensitive that they you&#x27;ve said no matter who you are the first time you apply prove your vehicle will run better this is consistent and I guess good job with the training on you know guys just understanding I don&#x27;t know so here&#x27;s the tall but now we&#x27;re gonna dozen right here is kind of semicircular this a little bit Margaret but all we do is machine out of the meat of the throttle this kind of thing so that when you&#x27;ve got that high-pressure compressed air here it&#x27;s being pushed up it drops right in to through there&#x27;s an expanse extent of both ways little errors of fluid it moulds itself the shape of its container okay so when I cut the groove in there that&#x27;s the pressure zone you&#x27;ve got so many others being drawn in this way has to be going down right well this air speeds up and as this air speeds up this direction so knows the downward pressure on the group of salt as the expense against this curve right here because this intersection point the radius of this arc this intersection point and this angle here is all credible okay yes this here and rolls up here you guys can see that happening right this is the this is the wave that is ejected but there&#x27;s more the true secret the magic power behind against members of this ball which is huge it&#x27;s right down here because there&#x27;s also airplay moving along the throttle passage right down through here if it gets forcing on this side the river right okay so when these two balls of beer yet they collide and they roll up just like that okay this Airstream right here the faster it moves the more pressure is put on the groove causing it to gather more and more here this is all in the first 90 degrees the downstroke guys okay thank you so this follow gathers up more and more there this Airstream creates this ball this ball watch that be about a thousand times and I think that&#x27;s extremely conservative I think it&#x27;s about a thousand times more dense than the engineers pin itself okay you see how that what happened it&#x27;s only an eighth of an inch deep way outer scale alright this stream creates this ball this pressure this ball creates this one so this one to a thousand one to a thousand this one&#x27;s up being a thousand times more this than that or 1 million times as this is neat a history there is a huge difference between a thousand times something and a million times huger so the first half of the downstroke basically speaking up right but the hitters being gathered in the group it&#x27;s not in the indictment pulse was it causes it to spike but the first thing of the Daryll stroke is holding the year right well then as the piston s is the midpoint this secondary ball the aerodynamics reversed because the pressure begins to come off of the bridge this has just been sitting error like it&#x27;s down your drain roll and then when the pressure begins to reduce this goes off like the primary shotgun shell and shoots this bomb up into the engine okay so you can continue its travel down the intake to provide the air that is needed to burn the fuel vapor that you&#x27;re affecting just created okay yes no I mean it is as the end result but now is there a demise in the field with injectors that&#x27;s not vapor it&#x27;s still a liquid set liquid does not mix with paper just doesn&#x27;t you&#x27;ve got to have both substances in the same state some rather have to liquefy your auction with these thousands of pounds of pressure medium not going to get that inside a gasoline engine okay or you reduce the pressure on the liquid to turn it into a vapor you say so it only takes a fraction of a second anybody that&#x27;s done any experiments with the pressure tell you that as soon it just dissolves just turns into vapor stick what happens not that calls for Custer&#x27;s telling me that they&#x27;re digital gauges are reading 28 to 29 inches of vacuum there&#x27;s no liquid on analog that will withstand 24 inches of vacuum and stay in a liquid state I don&#x27;t care what kind of chemicals and garbage is in there it&#x27;s still a liquid you get more than 24 inch the fact that one that into the hope ins when the fuel is delivered and your fuel must be rendered into vapor state cannot resist it it has to it&#x27;s a law of physics so the more vacuum you get applied to your fuel the more fuel you have ready to mix with the oxygen so here the fuel is being of the air is being gathered that while the fields being delivered the fields being ripped into vapor state halfway through the checks this pressurized to about six to eight inches so what it&#x27;s doing is it&#x27;s not reducing the amount of air or increasing the amount of air that goes into it actually it does reduce it minimally what it does is it changes the tiny with which the air is delivered okay that&#x27;s it it&#x27;s that simple there&#x27;s only one other aspect of this that matters and that is the vacuum leaks whether they are engineered or accidental doesn&#x27;t matter that you witness to evacuate anything that allows air into the system will allow more air into the system here okay so your vacuum must be okay if you put it into the manifold it is vacuum like but doesn&#x27;t it go with the manifold doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t can it be delivered before the throttle plate yeah see that&#x27;s where the main rotor I was also playing with hho all right yeah - I think 275 miles tank I&#x27;ll put the grill on it the winter 350 okay turn it off the hydrogen because I had to go through emissions right I turned off the hydrogen 600 miles of tank did I turn back on the hydrogen unit no no no because it was half of my fuel consumption why was that because of the extra oxygen the HHO consistent I couldn&#x27;t find anything to work with the sensors on the Land Rover nothing because the electronics just use different waveforms I bought a brand new computer to go into it maybe that right so how you take over the fuel delivery because I do not like car manufacturers decide how much fuel I should burn I want that decision okay you have the people have burn out their engines before about playing with their adjustments in the computers but that can be avoided if you know what you&#x27;re doing take some time research your stuff questions learn what you need to learn before you act look before you leave sound player okay people to get out there there make rash decisions they do something on their car and it&#x27;s go back okay then within a week they&#x27;re out there telling people maybe you gonna do this you got to do this guy to this device looking for the answers okay great then a week later the car blows up but they&#x27;ve already told 15,000 people the 15,000 people out there or never go to the same thing their engines and telling everybody about it for the first week until their agents bullet okay don&#x27;t do that please don&#x27;t do that okay - man grew I tested it for months and months most before it actually took it but to a more direct level okay everything about an engine is better yes but you know there&#x27;s a magic letter written by the director of the EPA he does write this down look for it find it I&#x27;m not going to provide it to you okay the Church of the EPA wrote a letter explaining why or explain that the terms of this $5,000 $2,500 15 whatever that hell how much money they want to try to take for playing with the emissions control systems said so long as the emissions are not adversely affected so long as the admissions are not adversely affected okay then you want the other thing you want your own car - at first I was I was so scared that I would have my customers put the backing kept on the PCV bill okay so it wasn&#x27;t me but they&#x27;re doing it no no I just helped them you see and that&#x27;s how you get around to go through customers and if you&#x27;re scared just let the customer just say what&#x27;d you do that for me as long as they finish it you help them right okay but don&#x27;t be scared don&#x27;t be scared okay would you see what happens to view those how that&#x27;s what the EPA hasn&#x27;t mess with me because I&#x27;m showing the one out of every three vehicles that I do show 100 percent reduction in hydrocarbons 100 percent reduction hydrocarbons 100 percent complete total elimination of carbon monoxide complete and total elimination of oxides of nitrogen and as much as 95% reduction of co2 emissions operating temperatures drop like a rock I got calls from customers that one customer type of Prius but he did a whole change right after I did the bottom of the case on his vehicle was getting 42 miles gun again the estimates lie okay this person 42 miles per gallon afterwards 66 miles per gallon 66 and that&#x27;s not really impressive it&#x27;s good for a solid press I want every day we&#x27;ll get double the gas everyone says Ron say if you know if I did those miles on my car since I had banana please call me up with a moment report said you know do you think I should change the world I said are you a fool I said yeah you know three to five thousand miles is pushing it they said no I don&#x27;t think so no no thank you come on all right tell me what&#x27;s going on this is that piece of wrong is the tip the truth is that the oil is still honey Brown he said there&#x27;s no sign that use it in the engine why why why how can you produce it but why would such a report come in because when you kept PCV valve this vacuum is no longer pulling off the higher-level hydrocarbons in your oil to make it turn thick and black okay it&#x27;s also not sucking as much on the on the fuel that lines your combustion chamber on the walls as the Pistons moving up and down before the ignition struck some of that fuel gets into your work well it&#x27;s exited more of its pulling the higher the vacuum is any crank games so there&#x27;s less pollutants going into your system make sense right operating temperatures the most immense change in operations or how they receive was on my RV it was 1988 John Deere with 460 exhaust manifold temperatures were in the high sixes to the low 70s I checked each individual point I did the modification high threes to low 400 300 degrees of the exhaust manifold routinely documenting 100 150 200 degree drops and hospitable tip line how could this be true because the fuel is burning inside the engine and on inside the exhaust manifold you see yes uh he says that that five words left now listen five minutes I don&#x27;t mind if I wear a watch I can&#x27;t keep can&#x27;t keep our keep right lot of things all right so he says five minutes so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s sit it who&#x27;s got questions Wow okay yes sir yes sir stand up seven let everybody here putting the banking code this is the low pressures home on the throttle plane this is the high pressure zone okay the air is going this way this is the engine side yeah this is the air filter side huh yeah the bad key was on this side so the low pressure zones on the engine side yes okay hey there&#x27;s something look it up and I want you to send me a copy of it I want all the beautiful ecologist showing you how to do your research okay I kid you not that&#x27;s one of the biggest headaches I have is I put up this information because it&#x27;s really technical but there&#x27;s a lot of dynamics I understand that it&#x27;s not easy to understand sometimes a little lot of things not all the information out there internet anybody that wants to build and build their own if they want it it&#x27;s better to get my beds all right but if you don&#x27;t do your research you call me I&#x27;m gonna ask you look it&#x27;s not for me I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m in there did you look at my videos of your videos okay well look don&#x27;t look thank you yes I don&#x27;t mean to be unkind you understand yes sir he said that I&#x27;ve marked a simple one years it a 74 mark for Lincoln [Music] [Music] when your pill birds weren&#x27;t supposed to amazing things having your engine yeah somebody back there one more question please yes denim [Music] doesn&#x27;t matter doesn&#x27;t wanna play that is the only question that matters not even some kind of fuel apart some it has a problem play today&#x27;s menu will help it does that answer your question okay guys I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m out of time all right I&#x27;ll be available I&#x27;m going to be getting out of these duds I like dress-up day but I&#x27;ve gotta go to work alright so if you want I&#x27;ll be outside here doing modifications please get a hold of me again my um gauge man I&#x27;m happy you&#x27;ve read to me - man engage me prove any got myself [Applause]</p>
