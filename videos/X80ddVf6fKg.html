            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Good afternoon. My name is Jacqu Valet. I&#x27;m speaking at the request of Mr. James Fox because a few years ago I initiated the system of multiple databases used by a DIA sponsored program at Bigalow Ayerospace as a cleared member of a scientific team charged with study of UFO UAP phenomena. The data warehouse system contained data about 260,000 screened reports of anomalous objects in flight and hundreds of reports of creatures live or dead associated with crashed or landed vehicles of unknown provenence, including some similar to those in Virginia, thus providing useful multinational and historical context.</p>
<p>My current research is taking us to deeper levels with new onsite analytical and physical research on historical cases such as the 1945 case in San Antonio, New Mexico. the 1964 case in Soro, New Mexico also and the 1965 case in Valencol in France. In those and several others, new physical and environmental data was collected. The observations involve a total of seven creatures, generally similar in size and general body shape to those described by the witnesses in Virginia, Brazil, and by Mr. Fox, providing both context and statistical support for current and future findings.</p>
<p>In particular, all the creatures just [snorts] mentioned breathed air normally. Beyond this, I currently serve in a private capacity on the scientific advisory board of the French government national center for space studies, CNES. That unit has actively researched the UFO problem since 1975, including national cases of close encounters with the presence of occupants. A number of which I have also studied on site. It should be clear, however, that I do not represent any of these government organizations in this or any other context.</p>
<p>The Virginia incident of 1996 in Brazil, researched and documented by James Fox, fits within cases already known in scientific and medical records. many of which have remained classified. Relaxing the classification requirements while preserving security of essential facilities such as the nuclear labs would make it possible to inform and enlist the scientific community at a higher level. Action by the executive branch to allow more open exchange would be worldchanging. As the Virginia case proves, allowing more open contact at an international level would yield better understanding of the global issues.</p>
<p>The current segmentation of the data hinders any serious research into what appears to be an extraterrestrial phenomenon empowered by advanced artificial intelligence. Open archives do exist to some extent describing the physical and biological environment of the crafts and their occupants. Soro and Valencol in particular, two unclassified cases officially deemed unidentified by multiple government agencies have yielded evidence of traces recovered. materials and environmental effects. But we know that much more is available.</p>
<p>The Virginia case presents exceptional new knowledge beyond what was already known. It improves our information in two fundamental ways. first in the ability to reconstruct what happened to the craft and its occupants from beginning to end. And second, in the professional description of the anatomical and behavioral features of the live creature recovered by authorities within a short time of the crash and to the point of its death. By this achievement, James long and perilous project has opened up an entirely new field of research.</p>
