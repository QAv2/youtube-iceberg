            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>A government project established direct communication with a nonhuman intelligence. As always, I&#x27;m here to report the information without bias and you can decide what to believe. You can find the sources and my detailed articles at ufonewe.co along with in the description box below. Hey you followers, I&#x27;m Christina Gomez and welcome to this episode of UFO News Updates. So, what did Valet say? Let&#x27;s get straight into it.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what he mentioned on weaponized. this happened in government facilities, but nobody is talking about that. So, I suspect that that&#x27;s true based on the people I&#x27;ve met. But what they described to me is a very sophisticated process by which we may be able to interact with the entities. &gt;&gt; And he went even further.</p>
<p>Valet explained that this interaction took place in what he called a secure facility he had never heard of anywhere else. There was structured interaction on a continuing basis with specialists from different areas. And the people who told him about this were extreme specialists in a particular discipline, not a casual observer. But the name of course was not disclosed on who he was talking to. He did add a caveat as well.</p>
<p>He said he could not determine whether the entity presented was a simulation or the real thing. &gt;&gt; There may be a group that I would respect that has access to that and this was from years ago by the way. I mean that report of of that that particular interaction was more than 20 years in a in in a lab somewhere in control conditions. If that&#x27;s true, then uh there is a process ongoing where we may be able to acquire information at a very sophisticated level. That could be a reason for stalling quote disclosure until there can be a a rational way uh that we&#x27;re not confronted with something so uh overpowering that it would destroy our culture and our society.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now keep in mind this is a man who has been working inside classified government programs for decades. He has had a top secret clearance and he knows about facilities that the public has never been told about. And yet this one was unknown even to him. Now what happened inside that facility was not a one-time event. Valet described multiple interactions on a continuing basis.</p>
<p>This was not a random encounter that someone stumbled upon by mistake. This was organized. This was methodical and specialists from different areas were brought in to participate. These were people with specific expertise in particular disciplines who were selected to be part of this process. Think about that for a minute.</p>
<p>If what Valet was told is accurate, there was a program where trained specialists conducted ongoing structured communication with a nonhuman intelligence. This was not accidental contact. This was a deliberate agreement. And this raises a very obvious question. If this is true, why are we still having congressional hearings where officials claim ignorance? Why is the disclosure process moving at such a slow pace? Valet addressed this directly.</p>
<p>He suggested that sophisticated communication at this level might actually be one reason for the careful approach to the whole disclosure thing. &gt;&gt; They may be the controllers. maybe the higher level entity. They if if what I&#x27;m told is true, the communication with them is very sophisticated and it&#x27;s complex. &gt;&gt; What makes this even more significant is who Valet is.</p>
<p>He worked on classified programs for the Defense Intelligence Agency. He built the largest UAP database ever created. Over 260,000 cases from around the world organized across 14 databases with translators covering French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian. Everything converted to English. Everything structured for analysis.</p>
<p>That database unfortunately remains classified. Valet was never briefed on when that project ended. &gt;&gt; The project was cut off. Um usually as you know I had clearances on other projects at at Stanford Research Institute working with Dr. Putoff and and his team and so on and uh at the end of the project I was debriefed uh and there was a second project with Ed May uh and again I was debriefed here I I wasn&#x27;t debriefed so I I called Dr.</p>
<p>Putoff I called Dr. Keller, they haven&#x27;t been debriefed either. So, we don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s still classified and what&#x27;s not classified. So, I&#x27;m treating essentially every everything we did, including the data, as know as classified. &gt;&gt; No one told him what was still classified.</p>
<p>So, stay with me here. Valet told the Soul Foundation back in August of 2025 that rebuilding what they created would take 10 to 15 years, referring to the UAP database with over several hundred,000 cases. And nobody&#x27;s telling Congress that. Meanwhile, he pointed out that Arrow, the Pentagon&#x27;s current UAP office, is only looking at cases from the last 12 months. Then he said something during this Soul Foundation interview that I think will really resonate with you.</p>
<p>Take a listen to this. &gt;&gt; When is the last time science had to wait for a decision of Congress to study something? I mean, that&#x27;s not the way a university works, you know? So why are we spending all this time in Washington assuming that Congress is going to do science? This is not what we pay them for. But Congress does a fantastic laws and the laws may or may not have anything to do with science. So we&#x27;re talking they certainly have a role in this which is very important but we are misunderstanding the the role of the legislature. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s also a darker side to what Valet revealed in his files which he contributed to the government database.</p>
<p>there are cases where UFOs cause injuries and deaths that he believes were not accidental. He stated there are at least half a dozen well-documented cases where the injuries were deliberate. The program also sent investigators to Brazil to collect files on hundreds of people who needed medical treatment after UAP encounters. And here we can infer that some of those cases are pertaining to the Colaris Brazil incident from 1977. &gt;&gt; I think there are cases where people have been injured.</p>
<p>There is a potential that it could be a threat. There is radiation from it. I mean that&#x27;s well recognized in that that last latest case I published you know with with Dr. Nolan and with uh with the group maybe they don&#x27;t care we don&#x27;t know what they are doing. &gt;&gt; When Valet spoke with the soul foundation he connected all of this is something much larger.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the phenomenon has been with us for a long time actually as long as humans have existed. So why are we seeing this concentration of activity right now? He answers that &gt;&gt; now we&#x27;re coming to a test and astronomers have have said you know for many years that in the evolution of a planet in life evolving on a planet will get to a point of discontinuity where it assembles technology to the point where it can destroy its own environment. And there are indications that maybe we haven&#x27;t destroyed it, but we have committed a number of faulty decisions in in our technical development and um in our economic development that threaten our own existence on the planet. So, what do you think is really going on and why do you think they are being so careful about what gets released? I want to hear your thoughts in the comments. I&#x27;m Christina Gomez and that is it for today.</p>
