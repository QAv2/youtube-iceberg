            <p>but those two cerebral hemispheres in your head are in fact two scalar potential generators and functions and under just the right circumstances they can indeed generate fields on the bottom and energy on the bottom or convergence or cooling on the bottom of your feet and you can in fact walk across coals because the heat is being cooled at your feet and there are some folks in Japan who do this once a year as a religious thing and they do not run across the 1200° red hot colds they stroll sedately and you can see it anytime you want to go to that Monastery that time of year and look at it it&#x27;s not hard to see it all it&#x27;s not hard to measure the colds it&#x27;s real but you can&#x27;t fake it you can run out there with all the thoughts in your head you want to and you just burn the hell out of your feet is what you&#x27;ll do the other thing is did you ever worry about Metal bending have you ever been to one of Jack Hal&#x27;s metal bending parties anybody in here well there&#x27;s a few that have Jack&#x27;s a good scientist uh I mean conventional scientist but he got curious about the phenomena and he gives these parties to see if people can&#x27;t bend metal he gets 80% of them on the average to bend metal I&#x27;ve bent metal my wife bent metal and now the metal we bent was very simple I held a knife and she held a fork between these two pinkies and I held it by the end I did not have this on the knife nor did she have this on the fork and when everybody got in the right mood and things begin to happen all of a sudden at exactly the same instant her fork laid over and the times begin to furl around like that and my knife laid over and I&#x27;m holding it between these two little pinkies right here and I defy any physicist to honestly do that experiment within the bounds uh replicate that within the bounds of present Theory you can fake it like a magician does deceive you to look somewhere else and substitute the fork or the spoon but you can&#x27;t do it on camera without any change at all and I like to think of a special I saw some time ago in the south sea Islands of amazing Randy watching the natives stroll sedately across the red hot cods and shaking his head and saying I have no explanation of that that&#x27;s on tape next slide please oh no let&#x27;s go into this one this one&#x27;s very important well we&#x27;re talking about all this energy and all that stuff uh we never did really say what was out there in the vacuum did we we said there&#x27;s no electric fields and we said there&#x27;s no magnetic fields but the Cajun comes back and says well Tom what in the hell is out there you done got rid of the ducts what else is left so we said we got we got a strange kind of them duck that Einstein dug up called them SpaceTime that&#x27;s what exists between the transmitter antenna and receiver antenna SpaceTime nothing else but ladies and gentlemen in general relativity SpaceTime is an active medium the geometry is active it acts on mass mass acts on if to curve it as wheeler says and the curvature SpaceTime acts right back on that Mass to produce a force on him and to move him SpaceTime when it changes when it curves is active upon mass at whatever level you take as a matter of fact it views all the forces being generated by the the interaction of a little curvature space time on a little piece of mass every force can be represented that way so what happens is when we shake up these electrons and we eliminate from our thinking the fact that we also took up the nucleons and the nuclei the the protons but anyway we agitate and curve the SpaceTime and what actually gets formed is an oscillation of SpaceTime curvature a pure general relativity wave and what propagates through SpaceTime is this propagating space-time curvature oscillation now when it strikes the electrons down in the receiving antenna wire Being A Spacetime curvature propagation uh uh oscillation or disturbance it does what such disturbances do it works on the mass that it hits and it oscillates those electrons they can&#x27;t oscillate longitudinally so they TR they move sideways and we get our transverse electron wiggle waves and all other detectors but the wave in the inum is a general relativity wave so hidden inside electrodynamics has always been general relativity and we never knew it and it&#x27;s a very powerful general relativity far more powerful than our physicists go off chasing particularly in astrophysics because it uses the strong electromagnetic force as the agent of curvature not the little weak G Force you don&#x27;t have to have a humongous collection of mass now you can do it with little bitty stuff on the lab bench you don&#x27;t have to be out on interior of a neutron star all this stuff we&#x27;re talking about in astrophysics can at least in theory now be engineered on the bench if we pay attention now to the general relativistic curvature waves that we can create and what we can do with them next slide please I want to be a little more exact on this for those of you that are technical basically electrodynamics today because of the still assuming the material ether if I look at transfer functions Transformations the equations are transformations from Mass perturbation to another Mass perturbation that&#x27;s all they have nothing to say about what goes on in SpaceTime nothing whatsoever they are missing two enfolded Transformations shown in black on the left matter to SpaceTime transformation where we produced now a general relativity wave of the oscillation of SpaceTime curvature and over on the right when that reacts back upon mass in Our receiver it produces again electron wiggle waves so we really go from electron wiggle waves electrodynamics tells us how the next electron wiggle waves will work there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that works fine but it won&#x27;t give you how to engineer what&#x27;s in the middle it&#x27;ll just do it automatically and that&#x27;s it you can&#x27;t get refined in the art but what actually happens is we put in these two extra functions first of all we made a peration in SpaceTime that propagated down to the other receiving antenna and reacted on those electrons to produce that transverse wave so those hidden two Transformations are actually nothing but hidden general relativity but the electr gravitation this is the secret of electr gravitation right there on the slide if you want to do any Gra gravity you&#x27;re going to have to understand this in your head next slide please when you make forms of these curvatures of SpaceTime I use two names to speak of those I took the names basically from other folks they&#x27;re not original with me one is spacetime curvature engines because they act on mass like an engine would and do some action and the other is vacuum action because they twist up the vacuum if you&#x27;re considering that a vacuum instead of SpaceTime okay you&#x27;re in quantum mechanics so what you change all the particles and you change the particle flux and the density of the particle flux and the direction of the flux and all of that stuff and it still has the same effect on the other end one way you looked at it with wave theory the other way you looked at it with particle theory same result now the difference is this if you receive a signal and you are the receiver you have some choice about whether you do that or not he says hey Tom I want you to leave the platform and go out the back door and I say hey man I ain&#x27;t finished yet I&#x27;m going to keep on till they finish or they run me off on the rail but if he sends you a vacuum engine it don&#x27;t say nothing to you about that it grabs a hold of you and drags you out the door and throws you out in the street you see the difference one is the Deliverance of a request what I would like for you to do if you would be so willing as to do this and the other one is not just an order it&#x27;s an engine that goes in and grabs it and does the action wasn&#x27;t it nice if I want to do stuff with matter should I keep using signals well maybe the matter if I find how to trick it maybe I can get it to do it maybe I can&#x27;t but if I hit it with an engine it doesn&#x27;t have a choice all I have to do is learn how to tailor the engine now I&#x27;m using applied electral gravitation I&#x27;m using general relativity but initiated with the strong electromagnetic force is the agent of curvature I&#x27;m doing something very precisely yes what happened so much of my work in the last years</p>
