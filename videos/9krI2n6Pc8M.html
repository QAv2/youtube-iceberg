            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>that we live in a divinely constructed, intelligently designed reality. I was raised to believe that there are worlds of that number, [music] that we&#x27;re not alone in the universe, and that there is a plan, that there are no coincidences. Our consciousness, our collective consciousness is to a degree connected, and there&#x27;s much [music] to be learned. I think we&#x27;re we&#x27;re right now barely scratching the surface of understanding the nature of our own existence [music] and the rules of engagement relative to our place in the universe, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I just want all the answers. [music] Everything happens for a reason.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good and bad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know a lot [music] of people something bad happens to them and they want to like make excuses, but I think it happens for a reason. [music] &gt;&gt; Sure.</p>
<p>And I think that this uh this mortal existence that we&#x27;re all trying to survive [music] that we ultimately realize no one gets out alive. Okay guys, we got Brandon here today. Season 6 is wrapping up. I think by the time they see this, it&#x27;ll be over. So, thanks for joining us, man.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You bet. It&#x27;s a pleasure being with you. &gt;&gt; Absolutely, man. And one of the top shows in the world right now, you said, right? &gt;&gt; It is. Uh we&#x27;re the number one uh docue series uh reality docue series on cable presently with The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
<p>Uh just wrapping up our sixth season and looking forward to unveiling some really exciting discoveries and insights. It&#x27;s a &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s an interesting departure from my primary focus, which has been commercial real estate. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And other business endeavors. It&#x27;s &gt;&gt; what a big change.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] It&#x27;s it&#x27;s the most uh exciting adventure right now going on in my life and uh a number of others. &gt;&gt; Did you expect all this when you bought it? &gt;&gt; No, I bought it as a skeptic. So, I bought Skinwalker Ranch really as a skeptic. &gt;&gt; I did not believe there was anything re to the phenomena.</p>
<p>Uh I had grown very critical Yeah. of any paranormal claims uh even religious claims at that point in my life and acquired it fully expecting to debunk the claims that have been made for a very long time and instead ended up going from a skeptic to not a believer but an experiencer. &gt;&gt; Wow. seeing phenomena, seeing things in broad daylight with multiple witnesses at my side that defy any conventional prosaic explanation. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s incredible.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a life-changing experience, and it is without question the most unique real estate project you could ever conceive of. Uh, at the time, I thought I was just going to ultimately donate it to the Boy Scouts of America. I was in the scouting program growing up &gt;&gt; and as an Eagle Scout, I thought this would be an incredible property. 512 acres sequestered in the center of the Uenta basin surrounded by thousands of acres of Native American tribal land with a strikingly beautiful landscape and backdrop. Old pioneer homesteads that are still standing, coupled with a Red Rock Mesa plateau and waterways that snake through the property.</p>
<p>all add up to a a very unusual landscape. You add to that the fact that this property under my predecessor, Robert Bigalow, was part of a Pentagon funded black budget program &gt;&gt; studying everything from the UFO phenomenon to &gt;&gt; uh bizarre cattle mutilations and other high stranges only makes it that much more unique. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What did Biglo tell you when he sold you this property? you know, he wouldn&#x27;t say a whole lot other than of course the phenomena was real. uh he uh he was turning his attention at the time to really leading the private space race.</p>
<p>bought the Space Habitats program, the inflatables program from NASA &gt;&gt; and was working with SpaceX, a very young SpaceX at the time &gt;&gt; in uh in really positioning to be the real estate developer of space to put his space habitats up on the International Space Station, &gt;&gt; the lunar surface, and ultimately Mars has been his focus uh over the years. And I think even though Skinwalker Ranch was a a very important part of his history, I think he was ready to close that chapter and pass the baton to another steward, if you will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh I expressed my skepticism uh and we uh we developed a good relationship. I have great respect for Mr.</p>
<p>Bigalow. &gt;&gt; Nice. &gt;&gt; Uh he was a trailblazer, someone who was willing to take risks. I respect anyone who is willing to put their money and their reputation uh on the line especially in service to frontier topics. There are very few people on the planet that are willing to put their money and resources and reputations on the line when it comes to certain topics that uh that many consider not only frontier science topics but also fringe.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. uh there&#x27;s understandably a lot of skepticism. I was one and I thought that just by simply using the scientific method, bringing in my own third party experts and some critical thinking uh and instrumentation, we would ultimately show that there was a natural prosaic explanation for all that had been reported or claimed &gt;&gt; there for decades, if not millennia. and ultimately went from being a skeptic to not a believer but an experiencer. And now you know the world is watching.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We have uh a global audience that is watching the investigation unfold that is showing that not only is the phenomena real but with scientific data and instrumentation we&#x27;re documenting uh the phenomena. We&#x27;re documenting the reality that our skies are being violated by craft and objects of unknown origin. There are certain things happening in our world that defy conventional explanation. I believe that we&#x27;re just barely scratching the surface of understanding the nature of reality. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>Sounds like a lot more seasons to come then. &gt;&gt; Uh we&#x27;ll see. Uh everything that we are discovering we&#x27;re we&#x27;re presenting transparently to the public. &gt;&gt; Respect. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t really have any obligation.</p>
<p>I I really feel it&#x27;s part of my stewardship to share the insights that uh that are rendered there and our discoveries. We&#x27;re all in this together and uh I think it&#x27;s the greatest science project of our time and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a fun departure from the typical business activities that I&#x27;ve been involved in for decades. &gt;&gt; Which discovery I know there&#x27;s been a lot. Which one stands out to you the most at the moment? uh repeatable electromagnetic anomalies, GPS malfunction and manipulation &gt;&gt; coupled with the appearance of unidentified aerial phenomena &gt;&gt; that seems to attend many of the events. We&#x27;re also utilizing LAR and other survey technologies that have repeatedly shown that there&#x27;s something unusual going on in the environment.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow, that is crazy. So, is that like a heat map? What is that? &gt;&gt; Uh, it&#x27;s a scan the property. It&#x27;s a laser scan, but we use other technologies as well in service to understanding what is going on both above and below the property. It was funny when I acquired Skinwalker Ranch, one of the first landmarks on this really unique piece of property that I that I happened on with the security was a what looks like a Masonic symbol etched &gt;&gt; on the sandstone face of the mea. not far from what we call the ranch house or homestead one.</p>
<p>Uh the the symbol many people believe uh is as above so below. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That that it it denotes there&#x27;s something going on both above and below that location of significance. as we found other ancient rock art and uh symbolism on the site, it it only seems to point to a a very unique historic um uh I think mission to whatever has happened there for a long long time. We have uh now through our archaeologists dated artifacts going back as far as 10,000 years.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Holy crap. &gt;&gt; Paleo. We have uh paleo points, grinding bulls, and other artifacts that have been excavated on site that speak to a very significant ancient history associated with this enigmatic piece of property. &gt;&gt; I wonder why they all concentrated in that specific region. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re getting to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping to learn is why is this site so significant? Uh on one hand you if you look at a topographical map of the Uenta basin which is this huge bull you know natural bull type of formation out in northeastern Utah. &gt;&gt; The property sits right in the dead center &gt;&gt; wow &gt;&gt; of this uh this region and that may have something to do with the unique nature of what has been observed there for generations. &gt;&gt; That is fascinating. So you bought it in 16. When did it shift from skeptic to you said experiencing? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so I bought it on April 1st, April Fool&#x27;s Day of 2016.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Was that strategic? &gt;&gt; Uh, no. Uh, but there are no coincidences I&#x27;ve learned in life. And uh, uh, and I went for 6 months without seeing anything &gt;&gt; unusual or feeling even anything unusual. I was flying in secretly uh on my helicopter, meeting with uh scientists, with my drone surveyors, security, and my on-site caretakers, &gt;&gt; and personally not seeing anything that would &gt;&gt; that would seem unusual. I thought it was just a very beautiful piece of property that I was going to to prove to be nothing more than that and ultimately use it for philanthropic purposes.</p>
<p>My whole world view changed on uh was October 14th, 2016 at 4 p.m. when hosting some visiting dignitaries and their security personnel. We experienced everything from equipment malfunction, rapid battery depletion with all of our smartphones going from from essentially a full charge to zero to one of the uh security personnel being rendered catatonic &gt;&gt; for a period of 10 minutes. And then when going back to the security trailer or the command center on site to retrieve our phones, uh to my surprise, one of the gentlemen in the back of this open air Polaris Ranger that I was driving started yelling to stop the vehicle and was waving his arms up in the air. And I looked back and was wondering what what is he what is he trying to draw our attention to? And as I brought the the vehicle to a stop and looked right ahead where he was pointing, there was a 50 foot 40 50 foot long silver grayish disc-like object about 100 ft above the mesa as clear as day.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right in front of us, 4:00 in the afternoon. I I recall seeing kind of a glint kind of reflection off of one side because the the sun had had passed to that side of the sky and and we were all sitting there in stunned silence and within seconds it changed position in the blink of an eye. It moved probably about 50 ft. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; In a blink.</p>
<p>You didn&#x27;t even see a blur. And then a few seconds later it dropped down to what appeared to be kind of a low hover above the mea. and it darted a few seconds later to the right almost as if it was scanning the environment or even us and then in a moment it was gone. &gt;&gt; The whole event lasted 20 seconds was undeniable uh witnessed not just by myself but other credible observers and it immediately followed the the anomalies that I mentioned. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And it changed me from being a skeptic to an experiencer. And from that moment forward, I I have been hellbent on getting the answers, documenting the reality of what I know to be happening on that property and above that property and making it available to the public. Now, I never really had a desire uh to go public with my identity as the owner. In fact, I had everyone signed off on non-disclosure agreements and confidentiality agreements for years. &gt;&gt; Uh even after that experience, I did not want my identity ever associated with these topics in the public domain.</p>
<p>uh I didn&#x27;t want them, you know, my research and funding and involvement in Skinwalker Ranch in these topics to in any way undermine or distract from my business activities as &gt;&gt; as chairman of Collier&#x27;s Inner Mountain operation. I we have the privilege of leading the largest commercial real estate enterprise &gt;&gt; in the region &gt;&gt; and you know we&#x27;re the fastest growing of the big three globally. &gt;&gt; Wow. represent so many uh major companies, institutions. I just didn&#x27;t want those worlds to collide or or anything to be called into question.</p>
<p>And so I kept my identity secret as the owner for a period of time until the History Channel after a year of persisting every week with producers to get an audience with whoever the owner was. They didn&#x27;t know who it was. There was wild speculation &gt;&gt; online. Some people thought it was Elon Musk, others thought it was Tony Robbins, the motivational Yeah, I know Tony speaker. Um, and uh, it was funny after after about a year, I finally took a meeting with History Channel executives that flew in and and I told them I said, &quot;Look, I would be open to having a discussion, but I have no desire to allow cameras and any public access to this property.</p>
<p>It is the most scientifically studied paranormal hotspot on the planet and has been under armed guarded surveillance since 1996 for a reason. There is danger there. There have been unfortunate very negative incidents and it is an ongoing scientific investigation. Well, the the the producers pointed out the fact that uh that for me to turn away the opportunity to have the finest documentary film professionals on the planet uh there to document the reality of the investigation that I&#x27;ve been privately funding for years on my own would be a huge missed opportunity. &gt;&gt; And it made logical sense.</p>
<p>Why not have a a team, an army of documentary film professionals there to document every detail of the ongoing scientific research, experiments, and investigation on this unique piece of property. Yeah. That had been &gt;&gt; part of a Pentagon funded blackbudget program between 2008 and 2013. Mh. &gt;&gt; Uh, so I stated that I would be willing to look at allowing them to come document it and have access, but I had conditions.</p>
<p>I said, number one, I I can&#x27;t allow anything to be faked, manipulated, or contrived. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t want to be part of some ghost hunters effort. This is a this is a serious scientific investigation. I don&#x27;t want my integrity or my reputation questioned as a result. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Number two, you&#x27;re going to use my team, the team of professionals that I had assembled, many of which I&#x27;ve known my whole life. Uh my head of security, Dragon, uh someone that I&#x27;ve been dear friends with since 19. &gt;&gt; Uh Jim Morris, who is my community liaison, was my first big client in commercial real estate. He&#x27;s the developer of a project called The Towers at Southtown, not far from this studio. &gt;&gt; Nice.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh just 10 minutes from here, off 106 South. &gt;&gt; Uh and a host of others. Eric Bard, our chief scientist and principal investigator I&#x27;ve worked with since 2010. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; I I did not want to have a Hollywood casting call take place to sensationalize this.</p>
<p>I wanted it to be a sober document documentary record of what is happening. And I also asked that my my reputation be held intact and that I uh that I keep my identity confidential and private. They granted me everything but that. They said, &quot;Look, uh the the only way for this to be taken seriously by the general public is if you come forward &gt;&gt; because this is your story, Brandon Fugle. This is your team.</p>
<p>this is your journey from being a skeptic to an experiencer, you know, and and I I&#x27;ll say that the the producer uh Jedi mind tricked me quite masterfully into uh agreeing to do the deal. So, the rest is history. Uh we have seen this investigation evolve over the course of the last years. um this season has uh has revealed some of I think the most stunning discoveries yet relative to what is happening, what is buried on that property and uh the nature of the strange phenomena that has been documented uh and and now we&#x27;re bringing it to the public. &gt;&gt; You said earlier there&#x27;s danger there.</p>
<p>Is that recent danger or you talking about prior events on skin? &gt;&gt; No, ongoing. We&#x27;ve had numerous professionals and participants end up in the hospital. &gt;&gt; Holy crap. &gt;&gt; Even the emergency room with life-threatening unexplained illness, injuries. Uh we&#x27;ve had cardiac events on site that have occurred in tandem with some of the the digging activity and exploring and trying to get the answers relative to what is potentially on the ranch that is uh behind some of the high stranges.</p>
<p>Uh and I think it&#x27;s important to note that the ranch appears to amplify intention consciousness &gt;&gt; if you will. So if you bring a spirit of contention with you to the property, if you bring an adversarial nature, I&#x27;ve seen and I have data demonstrating that those who bring that type of intention or attitude most often end up having very negative experiences. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I I advise everyone who enters, regardless of their religious belief system.

I tell them you need to prepare yourself spiritually, consciously enter with a spirit of reverence and humility for we are engaging phenomena that we do not understand and there are malevolent forces as demonstrated by the events that have unfolded. And also I think there are benevolent or even benign neutral uh forces at work on the ranch that are displaying uh advanced physics capabilities and command over spaceime and even consciousness itself.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I was just going to ask you was there any similarities between those who got sick but it sounds like it&#x27;s their intention, right? Well, most often there there seems to be a uh a correlation behind intent or the attitude of those who are engaging. If I think if they&#x27;re perceived to be a threat, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; by whatever phenomena, whatever intelligence that we&#x27;re interacting with, we&#x27;ve seen repeated data and incidents that that point to that. Uh people often ask me I get interviewed all the time for various publications and media where they they understand understandably ask Brandon Fugal is is it aliens? Are you are you seeing evidence that there are beings from other worlds that are visiting this property? Is it alien visitation or is it interdimensional or multi-dimensional even travel time travelers that could be behind this or is it more spiritual in origin? Is it angels and demons? And I would say that &gt;&gt; based on the evidence, the data that has been assembled to date, &gt;&gt; I would say it&#x27;s D.</p>
<p>All the above. Wow. What we&#x27;re what we&#x27;re I think witnessing and documenting is a diversity of origins and agendas associated with the activity at Skinwalker Ranch. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s fascinating. &gt;&gt; Um so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s quite a uh a unique opportunity.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s I consider it a privilege to be the steward of this property. Um I don&#x27;t have any partners. I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve uh I&#x27;ve been, you know, moving through this process of discovery. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh and we&#x27;re trying to to get the answers.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m lucky I have the resources to be able to um study the property more dynamically than anyone in the private sector has ever &gt;&gt; tackled. You&#x27;re definitely the right guy for the job. &gt;&gt; No. So, I I&#x27;m very fortunate. I have a I have a brother who is a skilled pilot, arguably the most qualified aviator in the region &gt;&gt; who pilots the helicopter uh my helicopter and and jet.</p>
<p>We use aircraft and aviation resources &gt;&gt; uh to to study interesting &gt;&gt; the property. I also use it primarily for my commercial real estate business. I mean we we use aviation to u assist the companies and the entrepreneurs that we have the privilege of representing. Uh countless headquarters here in Utah and what we call silicon slopes which is our growing dynamic tech community uh in many cases have been secured and identified using the helicopter and and aviation assets as a key part of the site selection process. &gt;&gt; Well done.</p>
<p>Have you guys seen anything from up up on the helicopter? &gt;&gt; Uh yes, I have. In fact, we&#x27;ve had a few incidents and uh occasions where unidentified flying objects or UAP, unidentified aerial phenomena has been observed from the helicopter. In fact, some of our most stunning footage capturing an object that descended from high up in the sky, dropped down, disappeared into the far region of the mesa, and then exited right below the helicopter, uh was caught on GoPro cameras that were situated on the helicopter. and um and we were fortunate to be using it in service to documenting what we were doing that day. &gt;&gt; It makes you wonder since there&#x27;s so much UFO activity there if it&#x27;s a portal.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh yes, there is a lot of speculation that we may be dealing with portals, um wormholes, some some type of interstellar or interdimensional highway. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A Stargate. Uh who knows? There&#x27;s any number of theories and speculative um directions that the team of scientists and researchers uh re researchers have taken. &gt;&gt; You said uh time travel earlier.</p>
<p>What what makes you believe that&#x27;s a possibility? I guess &gt;&gt; well we&#x27;ve seen um time dilation on the property. We&#x27;ve seen through a series of experiments with drones with instrumented drones and GPS that time does not operate uh reliably. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; On the property. We see that um there have been shifts in the data and the uh the clocks if you will &gt;&gt; that have been involved with a lot of the research.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That is interesting. Well, they&#x27;re they&#x27;re challenging time right now. They&#x27;re saying it might not even be linear as people were taught. Sure. &gt;&gt; Isn&#x27;t that crazy? &gt;&gt; Uh, nothing&#x27;s crazy [laughter] to me anymore.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; I love how open you are about all this. &gt;&gt; I Yeah, I used to think it was all  [laughter] and now I&#x27;m humbled and I I feel like the older I get, the less I know. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Um, it has been incredibly humbling. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>to be involved with this endeavor and and and it has been a uh an unexpected turn in my path. Uh a very unconventional uh pursuit. Even though it only occupies maybe 5% of my overall time and bandwidth, it &gt;&gt; is perhaps the highest profile. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s what you&#x27;re known for these days, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. We we we&#x27;re fortunate to have a global audience, a lot of people that are following our research and investigation.</p>
<p>And so I I uh I have to always keep that in mind. Um you know, this is this is important, but I also keep myself grounded. &gt;&gt; Yeah. with my commercial real estate practice, have the the privilege of representing hundreds of projects along the Wasatch front, a number of national and global client uh assignments and those keep me grounded &gt;&gt; in the physical reality and the uh the more conventional reality [snorts] because I think it would be very very easy to lose u one&#x27;s grip on reality and and and uh I I I think be distracted to put it mildly. &gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s a valid point because you see people on both sides, they go too far down one route, whether it&#x27;s the materialistic route or the spiritual route.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. U it&#x27;s very easy to become obsessed. I mean, the the community that follows these topics um uh it&#x27;s a very diverse community. you know, a lot of very um enthusiastic, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; uh observers. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people want to be part of history, right? They want to see what can happen here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we&#x27;re all in this together. I mean, we&#x27;re all connected. I I believe in that.</p>
<p>I think that uh in addition to there being no coincidences, I think our consciousness, our collective consciousness is to a degree connected and and there is uh there is much to be learned. I think we&#x27;re we&#x27;re right now barely scratching the surface of understanding the nature of our own existence and the rules of engagement relative to our place in the universe. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I just want all the answers. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Hopefully. And I and I want to share them with everyone else because I I truly believe that we are all in this together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don&#x27;t believe in coincidences either. I think everything happens for a reason.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good and bad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know a lot of people something bad happens to them and they want to like make excuses, but I think it happens for a reason. &gt;&gt; Sure.</p>
<p>And I think that this uh this mortal existence that we&#x27;re all trying to survive that we ultimately realize uh no one gets out alive. &gt;&gt; Just people trying. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I know you we we know you have mutual friends on the show &gt;&gt; that are uh that are focused on life extension and more power to them. I hope that they unlock the secrets of immortality. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t want to live forever.</p>
<p>No, I only if only if I can maintain my quality of life, &gt;&gt; right? Right. &gt;&gt; Uh but even then, would you actually want it though? &gt;&gt; Like if you stay the same age right now for the for eternity, would you want that? &gt;&gt; Uh I probably want to be a little younger. [laughter] Um but hell yeah. I mean &gt;&gt; Oh, really? &gt;&gt; Do I want to live forever? Yeah. I I grew up one of my favorite movies growing up is Highlander.</p>
<p>You ever seen Highlander? &gt;&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen that one. &gt;&gt; What the &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m 28. &gt;&gt; Have you seen Highlander? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m 28. That sounds like an older movie.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You are so young. Yeah, it&#x27;s from the &#x27;8s. You know, all really good music, pop culture. &gt;&gt; I listen to 80s music. So, &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s a movie.</p>
<p>You need to check it out. &gt;&gt; Um, my wife gives me crap about it because she&#x27;s she doesn&#x27;t share the same &gt;&gt; uh appreciation for it, but it&#x27;s called Highlander. And you&#x27;ll see anyone who&#x27;s watching this podcast, if you know, you know. &gt;&gt; Highlander. Um, they&#x27;re remaking it right now with Henry Cavl.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, so I&#x27;ll watch that one. &gt;&gt; Well, no, [laughter] no way. No, go back to the original one for me. &gt;&gt; Uh, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a classic and you&#x27;ll know why I&#x27;m kind of they&#x27;re topics of immortality. Immortality plays a central role in this &gt;&gt; fantasy sci-fi adventure.</p>
<p>But, uh, &gt;&gt; so my whole thing is like I believe in reincarnation. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t want to live forever. I think we&#x27;re meant to live this life out and then we have another life. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; People label it differently. Some people call it multiple mortal probations. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Reincarnation, many lives. Uh there are many people of course that speculate that we&#x27;re we&#x27;re living countless different lives &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; right now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve seen that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In different dimensions of reality. And there there are a number of books that uh fiction and also non-fiction that speculate on the nature of reality and [clears throat] our existence. Um &gt;&gt; I believe what we&#x27;re seeing at Skinwalker Ranch and what we&#x27;re documenting &gt;&gt; uh to some degree attests to the fact that we live in a divinely constructed intelligently designed reality.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s exciting. &gt;&gt; Interesting. I find that inspiring. Uh you can either look at it optimistically or you can say well we does that mean we&#x27;re living in a cosmic zoo? Um are we in a prison planet? You know some people speculate that uh that there are any number of uh frameworks to &gt;&gt; what we&#x27;re experiencing right now. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Because we&#x27;re a low density planet. So they call it a prison planet. I&#x27;ve heard that. Yeah. So, &gt;&gt; so when you say divi divinely constructed reality, what do you mean by that? &gt;&gt; That we live in a divinely constructed, intelligently designed reality.</p>
<p>Um, I was raised to believe that there are worlds of that number, that we&#x27;re not alone in the universe, and that there is a plan, that there are no coincidences that that that um that we existed before this life, before mortality as we know it, and will exist [clears throat] &gt;&gt; eternally. And one of the greatest challenges is is is proving that scientifically, you know, not just by faith or religious dogma alone, but proving with critical thinking and the scientific method that there is more to our reality that there is um more to the nature of consciousness, our souls, spirits, whatever label or taxonomy that you wish to apply &gt;&gt; and I think it&#x27;s exciting to see um patterns emerge not only in nature but in the way that that society operates. And I think there are undeniable clues out there that point to the fact that we do live in a an intelligently designed sphere that uh that there is some divine intelligent design and force behind it all. And it&#x27;s uh &gt;&gt; understanding the physics behind that, how that works uh is is is it&#x27;s pretty fun to speculate on. &gt;&gt; And now with quantum physics emerging, it&#x27;s going to be interesting to see what they can prove, right? Well, you have string theory, M theory, a number of real leading thinkers in physics that are trying to come up with a unified &gt;&gt; theory um that that brings it all together.</p>
<p>uh Eric Weinstein who is one of my favorite &gt;&gt; he&#x27;s great &gt;&gt; uh physics experts one of the greatest thinkers on the planet right now is trying to I think advance uh new approaches to to resolving the disparity between quantum and relativity and I think all of that plays into these topics I think it&#x27;s all interconnected &gt;&gt; are you familiar with this guy named Carl Crusher Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, he&#x27;s been on my show. &gt;&gt; Carl is an enthusiast. He&#x27;s in the field. It&#x27;s been fun to watch some of his expeditions.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. He&#x27;s been on the show. He talked about &gt;&gt; enthusiastic. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He talked about like remote view.</p>
<p>Are Do you believe in remote viewing at all? I know it&#x27;s a controversial. &gt;&gt; Do I? No, I know it&#x27;s real. &gt;&gt; Oh, you &gt;&gt; So, I don&#x27;t I No, I don&#x27;t believe in it. I know that remote viewing is real. Psychic functioning is &gt;&gt; is a reality.</p>
<p>Um it a number of the science advisers that I have consulted with over the years were involved with the classified programs involving the CIA, &gt;&gt; you know, the Pentagon. Um I was a skeptic. Again, a decade ago, I didn&#x27;t believe any of this. If you would have asked me, do you believe that there&#x27;s any validity to remote viewing, psychic functioning, UFOs, Bigfoot, whatever. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s pretty &gt;&gt; angels, demons. &gt;&gt; I would have told you that I I have a hard time believing that there is any reality to those things. &gt;&gt; Yeah, some of his stories were just nuts. When he was on the show just talking about remote viewing, I&#x27;ve seen Walker. It was like crazy.</p>
<p>Uh yeah, we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve engaged um gifted intuitives in service to documenting and taking a scientific approach to either debunking, disproving, or validating those claims. And I&#x27;ve found that there is compelling evidence. In fact, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m certain. I&#x27;ve watched it play out. I I have data.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. uh my chief scientist and principal investigator has uh has been engaged by me to conduct research and experiments in the realm of remote viewing. And much to both of our surprise cuz he was he was very skeptical as well. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; we we&#x27;ve seen data that proves that it&#x27;s &gt;&gt; that it&#x27;s real.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. I don&#x27;t think anyone fully understands how it operates or the mechanism or the rules, the the physics behind it. &gt;&gt; There are a number of theories, but uh yeah, &gt;&gt; I mean, I know it&#x27;s real personally. I know people that went to Monroe Institute and learned how to do it and they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve proven it to me. I know there&#x27;s CIA operate like operations about it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You bet. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s legit. So, have you brought psychics on site, too? You mentioned &gt;&gt; we have. &gt;&gt; What have they kind of taken away from those? Uh &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; Uh there have been some interesting observations. I, you know, I&#x27;ve brought Native American shaman, spiritual leaders.</p>
<p>We brought a rabbi, a worldrenowned rabbi &gt;&gt; out to the property &gt;&gt; to conduct experiments and research with the team that ended up yielding shocking results, some changes in the environment associated with his visit. &gt;&gt; Wow. and uh simply you know giving a a a prayer a rabbitical chant prayer uh ended up resulting in changing the environment and it all played out on our docue series I think it was in season two Rabbi Ariel&#x27;s a do so I think engaging a diversity of talented people of professionals researchers in service to getting the answers is an important part of my stewardship. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh I do believe we we try to hold up as paramount the the scientific method and and bringing credentialed third party experts to the table relative to you know LAR uh ground penetrating radar studies environmental testing.</p>
<p>Uh I mean I have the the former executive director of the International Space Station National Laboratory who&#x27;s now CEO of Omnitech Jim Royston and his chief scientist Sam Durizo. Uh they are on site almost full-time for months of the year. Uh, General Lance Lord, who is a retired four-star general and a former head of Air Force Space Command, is a trusted adviser and uh consultant with respect to what is happening on the property and a host of others that uh that have helped us get the answers and are are actively engaged putting their their resources on the line, their reputations in service to getting to the bottom of what is happening. &gt;&gt; Well done, man. You&#x27;ve got the Avengers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, we&#x27;re trying. I mean, there&#x27;s you we&#x27;re we&#x27;re constantly working to improve. Again, it is a humbling learning process. I I never would have imagined &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; that this would play out the way it has.</p>
<p>People often ask um you know, if if it if I&#x27;m if we&#x27;re all going down the rabbit hole, if it feels like we&#x27;re all falling down the rabbit hole, and I tell people, I own the rabbit hole. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I love that answer. So, &gt;&gt; I mean, you&#x27;re providing legitimacy. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re a conspiracy theorist. &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>And I have everything to lose. I haven&#x27;t taken a penny relative to this effort. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve lost money probably, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I have I have invested more than any private individual on the planet over the last decade into frontier science topics and getting the answers. Um, I&#x27;ve donated the proceeds that would have been due to me through the television docue series to um philanthropic [clears throat] &gt;&gt; uh priorities and also pour right back into the instrument instrumentation in the scientific platforms.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, I have yet to even buy myself a &gt;&gt; a hamburger with the proceeds. Um, because I don&#x27;t want anyone questioning my integrity or my motive. I have zero profit motive. &gt;&gt; Wow. zero motive to sensationalize these topics to try to conjure up anything that is uh other than the absolute truth.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s incredible because a lot of these paranormal investigations, they make a living off the show. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. And I hear even on social media, even with that disclaimer, even with me pointing that out and the the fact that anyone who does their due diligence on me knows that I don&#x27;t need the series. The series, this investigation is a liability, &gt;&gt; right? [laughter] &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a liability. It costs me more reputationally and financially and is a deviation from those efforts that actually pay the bills.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh but I I get no end of criticism at times on social media from people saying, &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re a grifter.&quot; I didn&#x27;t even know what the hell that term was. And I love the keyboard warriors who who are happy to sit behind their sock puppet anonymous accounts and throw stones from the peanut gallery. &gt;&gt; Um people only knew I mean we were putting so much on the line. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And making it available to the public.</p>
<p>My predecessor didn&#x27;t make anything available to the public. In fact, he didn&#x27;t make it available to me when I bought the ranch. I bought it &gt;&gt; with nothing. he would not turn over any of the data both because of it its confidentiality but also it was part of a classified research study and I respected that even though I was hopeful &gt;&gt; I respected &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; his request &gt;&gt; to retain that and we&#x27;re doing the opposite we&#x27;re making this available to the public and engaging the public like never before. There&#x27;s never been an endeavor like this that has been more transparent, more open, more engaged than Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Anytime you do something new and disruptive, people are going to hate. Mr. Beast gets hate for saving kids lives, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he&#x27;s like literally donating money to save people&#x27;s lives, and he gets hate on social media. &gt;&gt; If you if if you&#x27;re in the public eye, you&#x27;re you open yourself up to criticism, and I understand that. I I do respect the skepticism.</p>
<p>There are a lot of con artists. There&#x27;s a lot of BS. &gt;&gt; Um, there is a lot of noise in this space. &gt;&gt; Being able to separate the signal from the noise to separate that which is legitimate, which is real, from that which is either fraud or exaggerated or or even misunderstood. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I think most of those things that happen that people ascribe to being paranormal or strange phenomena, I think I I think 90 95% have a natural explanation &gt;&gt; if people just apply critical thinking and scientific reasoning and and the scientific method. uh one of my favorite magazines, I have two magazines I read every month uh that are at the top of my list when I go to Barnes &amp; Noble &gt;&gt; and that is Skeptical Inquirer and Skeptic Magazine and it&#x27;s because I do value critical thinking and I often totally agree with the conclusions reached in those articles. I appreciate the the fine-tuned approach uh taken and and I think that we need to be grounded. We always need to question. There is nothing wrong with questioning assumptions, with questioning claims.</p>
<p>Um, and I hope to continue to back it up with reality. &gt;&gt; I love it, man. Well, Brandon, where can people watch the show and support you? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s a privilege to be with you. Any final questions? Ask me anything. &gt;&gt; We went through a lot.</p>
<p>Uh, I watched a 4-hour podcast with Sean Ryan. Well done there. &gt;&gt; Love Sean. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Sean&#x27;s a beast. But uh &gt;&gt; yeah, I guess let people know where they could find you, support you, and everything.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh we have a website for our ranch research project. In fact, there is a 24-hour live stream that you can access uh via our insider portal. It&#x27;s at www.skinwalker-ranch.com. That&#x27;s skinwalker-ranch.com.</p>
<p>You can find me easily on Instagram, uh Brandonfugal X. Uh same thing, Brandonfugal. I&#x27;m also on LinkedIn for those of you who use that platform. Very active across all of those platforms. Be patient with me.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m receiving so many messages, thousands, even tens of thousands of messages across all platforms. It is difficult to try to to engage to respond, but I&#x27;m doing my best at the same time still trying to lead the commercial real estate market and representing hundreds of landmark projects. So, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m trying to live 10 lifetimes at once, I think. &gt;&gt; Yeah. [music] Busy, man.</p>
<p>So, &gt;&gt; thanks for your time, man. That was a fun episode. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a pleasure being with you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Check them out, guys.</p>
<p>Peace. &gt;&gt; I hope you guys are enjoying the show. Please don&#x27;t forget to like and subscribe. [music] It helps the show a lot with the algorithm. Thank you.</p>
