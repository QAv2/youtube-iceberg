            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel we do educational videos on this channel we try to shed light on uh things that you may not have ever heard of before but if you did you&#x27;d be glad you did and um today is our 404th video on the reciprocal system of theory from one Dey burn Bernard Larson Mr Larsson was a uh mining engineer I believe in the uh 20th century lived out west uh Portland area and around 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates which were a um distilled version of his overall theory of how the universe operated and then through a process of deduction he went from his fundamental postulates to a um a uh theoretical Universe about okay if my postulates are correct my two fundamental postulates if those are correct then it would lead to a universe that looks like this uh I documented Larson&#x27;s chain of deduction in my 15 videos that I did about a year ago called um the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so if you go back to those you can um you know see his chain of reasoning and then uh from his theoretical Universe in his books he compares the findings of the Legacy scientists uh what they measured in their Laboratories uh their observatories and through other empirical means um and compiled in their cables um he compared his theoretical Universe with the uh so-called actual universe of the Legacy scientists and uh those kind of comparisons are what kind of DW drew me to Larson because he was able to in many cases recreate scientific tables strictly from Theory um not requiring billion dollar grants and teams of armies of teams of scientists um you know shipping away at it over the course of centuries um but instead it was just one guy with no budget and a slide rule that uh was able to uh put these tables together um you know it&#x27;s not like there was absolutely no disagreement but um the majority of the findings were really the same or identical to a lot of the findings of Legacy science so uh Larson&#x27;s two fundamental postulates kind of started all off uh publicly although it took him about 25 years to come up with those through a process of induction um where he had you know started having his first inklings way back around 1930 and it took him forever to kind of um you know take all of those different findings and put them into a generalized situation and uh but his uh his two fundamental postulates kind of um provide an introduction for the reciprocal system of theory the first postulate is um you know the meal ticket uh does most of the work and the second postulate is primar primarily mathematical the first postulate states that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two fun uh two reciprocal aspects space and time and then uh the second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is Clan now the second postulate is more controversial especially among some of larsson&#x27;s followers uh they uh many of them reject the idea of ukian geometry as being the uh geometry of the Universe um not rejecting it outright but saying that ukian geometry is the geometry of certain um subsets of the universe certain situations in the universe but um it is not controlling in all situations and that uh we would be better off substituting projective geometry for ukian geometry um as projective GE ometry contains ukian geometry um but it is more inclusive uh the same is true of the commutative mathematics in that second uh POS second postulate but let&#x27;s talk about the first postulate um maybe just restating it um the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy or anything else except it that it is made out of motion in particular it is made out of a um obscure kind of motion that Larson calls scalar motion and a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction so it is a much more General kind of motion nonlocalized there&#x27;s no direction to scalar motion you would Envision a scalar motion using a balloon uh that has dots on it as you blow up the balloon all of the dots will be moving away from each other uh but they will not be moving in any specific Direction every dot will be be moving away from every other dot um but you know you wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply a direction to that movement uh really you would apply all directions to that movement and uh you wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply a specific Direction until you declared one of the dots as the reference point once you say okay this particular dot is the reference point meaning that we are going to arbitrarily decide that this particular dot is motionless and then measure then we can measure the directions from uh from that dot to the other dots but but that is basically stopping the universe or you know freezing the universe so that we can make a measurement it the direction is not part of the motion itself it is part of the reference system that you&#x27;ve assigned and by holding one of the dots still um then you know you&#x27;re able to make those measurements um okay so the universe is composed of motion you know particular this kind of motion that&#x27;s called scalar motion and motion is the relationship between space and time and that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other uh which means that they are identical to each other except that um they are in reverse order um they do not exist in and of themselves only existing together in motion motion is basically a fraction where time or space is the numerator and space or time is the denominator and as a much more generalized kind of motion all of our scientific quantities fit into the uh purview of scalar motion so all of our scientific quantities are motions which includes um matter and energy and force these are all uh relationships between space and time um matter is time to the third power over space to the third power energy is time over space force is time over space to the second power as you know speed is space over time the car is moving 15 mil hour 15 miles of space in one hour of time space over time acceleration space over time to the second power the ball fell out the window at 32 ft per second per second 32 ft of space in 1 second per second space over time to the second power um now uh one thing that Larson observed about space is that it is multi-dimensional you called it three-dimensional XYZ coordinates or volume three orthogonal dimensions uh in a still frame this is what Larson refers to as coordinate space and since space and time are reciprocals of one another we also have something that&#x27;s called coordinate time and this is three-dimensional time in a still frame um and then also we have the so those two are vectorial motions and they are meaning they have Direction and they are the result of really stopping the universe but if we allow the uh Universe to continue in motion then we deal with the scalar aspects of those Larson refers to those as clock time and clock space the clock is always getting later and later and later later but it is not getting later in any specific Direction and space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart just like on the surface of an expanding balloon but not moving in any specific Direction and then space and time also are um only in discrete units you have to have a full unit of space to have space you have to have a full unit of time in order to have time [Music] and um if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have what Larson refers to as units speed 1 over 1 equal 1 and this unit speed is also equal to the speed of light so the speed of light is really one and as uh in all reciprocal systems one is at the center when you take any two reciprocals and you multiply them together you get one and you know so one of them one of the reciprocals is on the positive end and the other one is on the negative end and one is in the center and uh that basically means that this speed of light this one is the neutral point of larsson&#x27;s universe it is the what he calls the null point or the progression of the natural reference system The Ether the origin um the background the um zero point um these are all descriptions for moving outward at the speed of light in all directions so if you have an entirely empty Universe you have nothing in your Universe you still have motion outward at the speed of light in all directions that is the nature of a universe of motion or of larsson&#x27;s universe so in order to really uh grasp Larson&#x27;s Universe you have to be able to grasp the concept of motion without any thing moving the motion precedes the thing that&#x27;s moving and then ultimately that thing that&#x27;s moving is actually made out of motion also uh that&#x27;s another important um caveat of the reciprocal system is that um normally throughout the many years of science uh We&#x27;ve envisioned space and time as being really like the container of the universe the actions of the universe are occurring in space and in time um the players of the drama of the universe are acting in a setting or in a um environment of space and time but in larsson&#x27;s universe space and time are the contents of the universe not the container they are the actors on the stage um and so that is another kind of a paradigm shift uh there and so uh when you have the speed of light as the midpoint of the universe that means that half of the universe is moving moving faster than the speed of light half moving slower than the speed of light Larson refers to these as the cosmic sector and the material sector and really the material sector is the only one that is known by Legacy scientists Einstein himself said that uh the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe so by saying that he&#x27;s really eliminating half of Larson&#x27;s Universe the cosmic sector but the scientists if they ever acknowledge their mistake would be able to catch up very quickly because uh the uh operating uh laws of the cosmic sector are identical to those of the material sector except that they are reciprocals of one another so that you have to uh reverse or um reverse the roles of space space and time so in the material sector you have relationships based on coordinate space three dimensions of stationary space and clock time the clock&#x27;s always getting later and later and later in the cosmic sector once you cross that speed of light boundary and move into this faster than light realm then you have relationships based on coordinate time three dimension of time in a still frame and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart so uh that shows that reciprocal relationship there and Larson uses that reciprocal Rel relation to great effect um in his analysis of things today we are going to embark on um a reading of uh one of larsson&#x27;s great books it&#x27;s called basic properties of matter and here you will see how Larson um takes his theoretical universe and he um Compares it to the atomic the um periodic table um and also to compounds and so he uh is able to you know come up with equations to determine things like the melting point and the boiling point um of different uh different elements and different compounds and then he Compares those numbers to the tables that have already been derived uh have been measured in the Laboratories um and so this is a you know a test for the reciprocal system more or less as well as a test for the um Legacy science system so we&#x27;re going to start uh this book uh was came out in 1987 when Larsson was almost 90 years old and just a few years before his death and um he clearly was uh was thinking clearly uh at this time in his life and um I believe Up Up Until the End was thinking quite clearly um and so we&#x27;re going to at least read the preface here of this uh of this book to start with okay the preface this volume is the second in a series in which I am undertaking to develop the con consequences that necessarily follow if it is postulated that the physical universe is composed entirely of motion the characteristics of the basic motion were defined in the book nothing but motion the first volume of the series in the form of seven assumptions as to the nature and interrelation of space and time uh just for the record we went over that book probably about 6 months ago uh we we didn&#x27;t cover the entire book I think we only covered the first three qus of it or so we&#x27;ll probably go back and the the last part of it is like on organic chemistry the the the beginning of nothing but motion is mostly on Atomic physics and so we did go over that whole book and so you can refer back to that um but um that&#x27;s about six months ago so that book&#x27;s called Nothing But motion and this one is basic properties of matter okay so uh the first volume of the series in the form of seven assumptions as to the nature and interrelation of space and time in the subsequent development the necessary consequences of these assumptions have been derived by logical and mathematical processes without the inter uction of any supplementary or subsidiary assumptions and without introducing anything from experience coincidentally with this theoretical development it has been shown that the conclusions thus reached are consistent with the relevant data from observation and experiment wherever a comparison can be made this justifies the assertion that to the extent to which the development has been carried the theoretical results constitute a true and accurate picture of the actual physical Universe in a theoretical development of this nature starting from apostate as to the fundamental nature of the universe the first results of the deductive process necessarily take the form of inclusions of a basic character structure of matter the nature of electromagnetic radiation Etc in as much as these uh are items that cannot uh be apprehended directly it has been possible for previous investigators to formulate theories of an ad hoc nature in each individual field to fit the limited and mainly indirect information that is available the best that a correct Theory can do in any one of these individual areas is to arrive at results that also agree with the available empirical information it is not possible therefore to grasp the full significance of the new development unless it is recognized that the new theoretical system the reciprocal system as we call it is one of General application one that reaches all of its conclusions uh in all physical Fields by deduction from the same set of basic premises experience has indicated that it is difficult for most individuals to get a broad enough view of the fundamentals of the many different branches of physical science for a full appreciation of the unitary care character of this new system however as the deductive development is continued it is it gradually extends down into the more familiar areas where the empirical information is more readily available and less subject to arbitrary adjustment or interpretation to fit the prevailing theories thus the farther the development of this new general physical theory is carried the more evident its validity be Comes This is particularly true uh where as in the subject matter create U treated in this present volume the theoretical deductions provide both explanations and numerical values in areas where neither is um available from conventional sources okay just to kind of add to that point uh I do find that you know in order the the more you read Larson the more valid uh it it appears you know when you start uh reading Larson you&#x27;re just kind of like where&#x27;s he getting this from he&#x27;s just kind of pulling this out of no place and you know it&#x27;s he&#x27;s just fitting this into uh into the discussion so that his data coincides with the data that already been around red at but then you read another one of his books in a different an entirely different field and he&#x27;s using the same equation and the same equation is coming up with answers in a different field you know so it&#x27;s not that he just pulled it out of no place he&#x27;s actually he actually derived it um deductively and maybe you got lost in the chain of deduction but he&#x27;s not just uh you know tailoring the the uh equation for this specific set of circumstances because he&#x27;s using the uh he&#x27;s using the equation in entirely different fields um but you can&#x27;t but you never really detect that unless you have looked at a number of his different books okay there has been an interval of 8 years between the publication of volume one and the first complete edition of the second volume of the series in as much as the investigation whose results are here being reported is an ongoing activity a great deal of new information has been accumulated in the meantime some of this extends or clarifies portions of the subject matter of this volume I&#x27;m sorry of the subject matter of the first volume and since the new findings have been taken into account in dealing with the topics covered in this volume it has been necessary to discuss the relevant aspects of these findings in this volume even though some of them may seem out of place if and when a revision of the first volume is undertaken this material will be translated to volume transferred to volume one the first 11 chapters of this volume were published in the form of reproductions of the manuscript pages in uh 1980 publication of the first complete edition has been made possible through the efforts of a group of members of the international Society of unified science including Rainer Huck who handled the financing Phil Porter who arranged for the printing and Eden yure who prep prepared the illustrations and Yan Sumer who was in charge of the Project D LaRon 19 December 1987 okay and um that brings us to chapter one and chapter one is called solid cohesion okay so he&#x27;s going to be talking about you know how Adams Stay Together together in the solid state um you know how they each uh each separate Adam clings to uh each other and uh we&#x27;ll be uh delving into at least the beginning of that chapter starting tomorrow in the meantime thanks for tuning in today and have a great day</p>
