            <p>According to rumor, someone built an anti-gravity device, a machine that could nullify gravity at the push of a button. Of course, Newton tells us that anything with mass attracts everything else, and Earth&#x27;s massive pole keeps objects firmly grounded. [music] To test the claim, the Mythbusters tried three different setups. First, Carrie used a levitation gyroscope. Although the top seemed to hover, the effect came from magnetic forces, [music] not gravity cancellation.</p>
<p>Next, Grant brought in a triangular device powered by 30,000 volts. When activated, it did indeed lift off the table. But further analysis showed this wasn&#x27;t anti-gravity. The high voltage ionized the air, and the ions were pushed toward the foil beneath, creating an ion wind that lifted the triangle. When tested in a vacuum, the effect vanished because there was no air to ionize.</p>
<p>For the final attempt, the team tried to replicate the legendary Hamill generator said to contain three cones that vibrate inside a magnetic field to produce a special electrogravitic field. The device was carefully assembled, but even the most sensitive gravimeter detected no change in gravity. Conclusion: Although some devices appeared to float, their behavior was explained by magnetic or ionic propulsion. Gravity was never actually cancelled. The anti-gravity myth was busted.</p>
