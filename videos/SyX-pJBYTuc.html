            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein believed that for time travel to  be successful it would need to be at the speed of   light and that traveling at that speed slows the  time reaching the speed of light will stop time   and if it will be ever possible to pass the speed  of light time will reverse. Another theory was that   time passes slower for objects in a gravitational </p>
<p>field than for an object which is far from such a   field but he said it was possible. Did the Germans  invent a time machine being an anti-gravitational   machine known as Die Glocke or the Bell? What was  the purpose of the supposed anti-gravity machine?   If they were successful why do we not have  their captured prototype and research? Hello   i&#x27;m Colin Heaton former soldier Marine Corps scout </p>
<p>sniper history professor historian and book author   and we&#x27;ll answer these questions and other  issues on this segment of Forgotten History. German scientists were unfettered by cost  restrictions and an inexhaustible supply of   slave labor so German firms were given free reign  and created the most revolutionary machines and   projects in human history up to that time.</p>
<p>The  earliest mentions come from the 1920s during the   Weimar era with the supposed development of the  RFZ-1 anti-gravitational flying saucer possibly   with an anti-magnetic propulsion system. This  research was created in 1923 and continued after   the creation of The Society for Space Travel </p>
<p>in 1927 in Berlin of which Dr. Wernher von Braun   was a member. The bell was to be the vehicle for  time travel. It was described as being constructed   from about three inches of ceramic based content </p>
<p>about 14 feet in height and about 9 feet wide   at the base. The supposed fuel for this project  was beryllium called red mercury or Xerum-525   and due to the design as well as the fuel the  Bell was considered dangerous. Fhis fuel was used   in the Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet and V2 rockets </p>
<p>combining the mixtures to create rocket propulsion.   So why was the Bell fuel if true also  so volatile and why was it required   for anti-gravity? As may have been expected  given the top secret nature of these projects   Heinrich Himmler had to have his foot in the door  and his SS managing every aspect of most of these   programs. His appointee SS Lieutenant General Dr. </p>
<p>Hans Kammler was the force behind most of the   top secret projects working in conjunction  with Reich Armaments Minister Albert Speer. Under Kammler&#x27;s direction the SS was in control  of these projects with some Army oversight such   as Major General Walter Dornberger at Peenemunde  where the expert scientists were involved in the   V2 project.</p>
<p>Others believed to be involved in the  anti-gravitational belt project were Dr. Werner   Heisenberg and Dr. Wernher Magnus Maximilian &quot;Freiherr&quot;  (Baron) von Braun who would be the greatest prize   captured by the United States.</p>
<p>Heisenberg was the  chief physicist on Hitler&#x27;s atomic bomb project   working with uranium yet despite his capture  and post-war interrogations the Bell project   never came up. Heisenberg had built an  atomic reactor yet was never able to   complete his atomic bomb project for a variety </p>
<p>of reasons. Likewise von Braun the rocket genius   never mentioned the project as he created  the Redstone Gemini and Apollo programs   and the Saturn V rocket. Yet although Operation  Paperclip harvested the best and brightest German   minds in the fields of science nuclear fission </p>
<p>electronics aeronautics and rocketry and Operation   Lusty grabbed all the high-tech German weapons  aircraft and technology why did they not also   capture the mysterious and unknown bell and its  scientists along with their research documentation?   The Western Allies had the V1 flying bomb the  V2 ballistic missile the Messerschmitt Me-262   the Heinkel He-162 Volksjaeger or &quot;people&#x27;s fighter&quot; and  the Arado Ar-234 jets the Messerschmitt Me-163B   Komet and the Bachum-349 &quot;Natter&quot; rocket fighters and </p>
<p>the Fritz X radio guided missile that sank the   Italian battleship Roma etc. They had also  captured and built the high-tech electric-powered   stealth submarines with propulsion systems that  were decades ahead of the Allies&#x27; technology.   Also captured were additional ultra-sensitive  radio airborne radars and emission detection   systems used by the Luftwaffe night fighter </p>
<p>force as well as infrared technology.   But what about the bell? Yet despite the  lack of any mention of the bell in immediate   post-World War II intelligence and interrogations  in 1960 there was a French publication titled The   Morning of the Magicians translated into English  in 1963 that first mentioned the bell project.   Some of these subjects also included Himmler&#x27;s and  Hitler&#x27;s fascination with the occult other secret   projects already mentioned and even Germany&#x27;s </p>
<p>handling of UFOs for gathering their technology.   Part of this theory was sustained by  the development of the various Horten   aircraft designs such as the Horten Ho-229  flying wing also known as the New York bomber.   It has been surmised that the Horten brothers  used captured alien technology in their design of   their aircraft designated number 18 which is the  design of the Northrop Grumman B2 stealth bomber.   Due to the perceived mass of German technology </p>
<p>and the subsequent research and development at   places such as Area 51 the rise in  UFO interest is probably explained.   The greatest issue with researching the  Bell is the unusual lack of documentation   which is contrary to all the other Germany&#x27;s  special weapons and development   projects all of which became part of  Operations Paperclip and Lusty at the   end of the war.</p>
<p>In fact it would appear that the  only hard source is from a supposedly affluent   and interesting polish intelligence officer  who was privy to documents gathered from the   interrogations of captured SS project officers.  However we do not have the names or copies of   any of this documentation otherwise the very  story itself seems to have possibly sprang from   the intense interest and sensationalism of the </p>
<p>science fiction community and conspiracy theorists.   Rumors even surfaced that Hitler used the  time machine to escape the parts unknown   even the moon has been mentioned. The anti-gravity  mechanism would have been revolutionary if in fact   it existed and worked. NASA and the Russian </p>
<p>space programs and even private companies   not the least of which being Boeing and others  are known to have been actively working on such a   project for decades. It would only make sense that  if in fact Germany had developed a working model   of the Bell then why was it not in use? On December  9th 1965 a large fireball was seen by thousands of   people as it flew across northeast Canada and the </p>
<p>USA crashing in a forest in Kecksburg Pennsylvania   about 30 miles northeast of Pittsburgh a heavily  populated area. The U.S. Army sealed off the area and   listed the event as a crashed UFO and then went  to investigate.</p>
<p>Despite the rumors and conspiracy   theories it was determined that the UFO was in  fact the Soviet satellite Cosmos 96 that had   re-entered the earth&#x27;s atmosphere leaving a long  fire trail behind it. Many initially believed that   this was in fact the Nazi Bell that had been  traveling through time and returned to earth.   The only seemingly supportive piece of evidence </p>
<p>is &quot;The Hinge&quot; in Poland where the structure was   believed to have been where the Bell was being  developed and tested. But if so then that would   have placed the Bell technology and scientists  within reach of the Red Army so logically they   would have secured the evidence unless the workers  escaped to the west with von Braun and Dornberger.   Other than rumors we do not have any confirmation </p>
<p>that the Bell ever existed but it does make for   a good story.
