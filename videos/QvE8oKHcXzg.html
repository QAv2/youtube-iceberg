            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What&#x27;s up vettors? Patrick here with vetted. Today we are talking about this. &gt;&gt; Welcome back to special report. Tonight we continue our series looking at unidentified anomalous anonymous say that [music] easy phenomena. &gt;&gt; Very credible sources told me that some of the UA UAP activity in space specifically is reverse engineered technology.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Does that mean in space in low Earth orbit or does that mean traveling through the solar system? the what was implied to me was traveling through [music] the solar system. &gt;&gt; Jeez. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Believe it or not, we&#x27;ve recovered the vehicles um and [music] we actually have physical proof and I was actually uh partially cleared into some [music] of those activities. It was beyond uh oral testimony provided to me.</p>
<p>I actually had partial access uh to the data and actually read the intelligence [music] reports uh resulting from those programs. &gt;&gt; With your own eyes, you saw it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Nuclear weapon testing, atomic weapon testing create has a ripple effect that can down these things, &gt;&gt; especially high altitude nuclear testing, which is one of the things that they did in the 1950s in particular. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And so they started doing it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To like shoot fish in a barrel, basically. &gt;&gt; They did it on purpose. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And so did Russ. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s why they were doing it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then Russia Russia started doing it. &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then &gt;&gt; we [music] think China and Russia both have retrieved alien spacecraft as well. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what the officials in my film go on the record stating. [music] They go on the record in fact saying that what what in 1989 we think the [music] Soviets retrieved a tic tacshaped spacecraft. All right, betterers.</p>

I&#x27;m trying to get to 100,000 subscribers by the end of the year. All right, so what&#x27;s today&#x27;s video about? Well, today&#x27;s video is about a lot.</p>
<p>So, this is the only video you need to watch about the age of disclosure and of course the one I released yesterday, too. All right, so I&#x27;m going to be covering David Grush&#x27;s brand new interview where he talks about the age of disclosure. Mind you, David Grush hasn&#x27;t done an interview in a really long time, well over a year. And we&#x27;re going to be talking about Dan Farah&#x27;s new interview on Joe Rogan. Dan Farah is the director and producer of The Age of Disclosure.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m also going to be giving my review of The Age of Disclosure. I have seen it and I&#x27;m going to tell you about it. Now, let&#x27;s start with a little mini review of The Age of Disclosure. All right. Now, people are going to be concerned about the price, okay, of the [music] film.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not really here to talk about that to be honest with you. you know, you decide if that&#x27;s too expensive for you. It&#x27;s around $25 or so. Um, [music] now I will say Amazon and other platforms, they take like 50% of what you make. So, just keep that in mind.</p>
<p>I think if we want to blame anybody for high prices, it&#x27;s these platforms because, you know, I&#x27;m also working on a documentary and we&#x27;re running into these same issues. And then if you get a distributor to help you put your documentary on other platforms, they also take a cut, right? So, you&#x27;re like having to bump the price up just so that you can make a profit at the end. That&#x27;s why a lot of these films, you know, don&#x27;t get made or just run into problems. It&#x27;s all these fees and everything that these people take and they&#x27;re crazy ass fees, I&#x27;m telling you. Right.</p>
<p>So, you know, price, that&#x27;s up to you. Now, the film itself, it&#x27;s going to break it down into two categories. Production and content. Production 10 out of 10. Beautifully shot.</p>
<p>the opening especially very House of Cards style. Um, [music] very, you know, just so well lit and shot and the cinematography is amazing. The content, you know, it depends who you are, right? I&#x27;m a UFO researcher. I look into this stuff all the time. So for me, I learned some things, but you know, things I hadn&#x27;t heard before.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#x27;t really mean anything to me to be honest with you, because what the film made in claims, it lacked in proof or evidence. Basically, it just wants to tell you that if you combine all these people&#x27;s stories, there&#x27;s something there. It&#x27;s ev that&#x27;s proof. But that&#x27;s not proof, right? And as I&#x27;m going to explain in this video, there&#x27;s a lot of contradictions in that documentary that [music] your average Joe is going to have no idea about. But you know what I do like about it is that it creates a conversation.</p>
<p>People are talking about it. People are talking about this topic. So [music] that in and of itself is a great thing. And putting together a documentary like this is literally so difficult. So much respect to the team to put this together.</p>
<p>Um, you know, you can&#x27;t get everything right. I get it. But when you make a documentary that&#x27;s like, hey, we&#x27;re here to prove claims and that, you know, claim thing like just a different style of documentary, right? Um, so, you know, I&#x27;m just trying to be honest here. All right. Probably going to get some hate in the comments.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. But I just felt that this was lacking, right? There was just a lot of shine but no substance. You know what I mean? It was like a kit car. You ever heard of that? It&#x27;s a a car where they would take like an old Fiero and then make it look like a Ferrari, but it&#x27;s not really a Ferrari. That&#x27;s what this is in my opinion.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just a kit car. It it says a lot of things and it felt very much like a lecture. Lu Alzando in front of a chalkboard and all that like and that guy&#x27;s burned his credibility, you know, in the last year or so or more to a lot of people in the UFO field, you know, so having him at the center of it for the UFO community, for most people, not a good thing, right? For the average Joe, this will get people interested. But they&#x27;re thinking this documentary is going to bring disclosure. the president&#x27;s going to come out and and talk about this stuff and I&#x27;ll get to that in a second.</p>
<p>Now, let&#x27;s move on to some clips and I&#x27;ll discuss the documentary as we go through. But again, I mean all of this with respect. It&#x27;s just my opinion, okay? But I am going to prove some contradictions uh that are in the film. So, let&#x27;s start with Dan Farah&#x27;s interview on Joe Rogan. Here&#x27;s clip number one of many.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; First time I saw you was the first time I saw your documentary, which is [ __ ] excellent. Thank you, bro. &gt;&gt; Uh, The Age of Disclosure. Really good. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re a UFO dork like myself and you&#x27;re in and out like sometimes like, &quot;This is [ __ ] Maybe it&#x27;s real. This is [ __ ] Maybe I&#x27;m wasting my time. Maybe it&#x27;s real. Maybe it&#x27;s Go see the Age of Disclosure.&quot; And then you&#x27;ll be fully in the I don&#x27;t [ __ ] know, but who? Something&#x27;s going on. That&#x27;s where I am right now.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know, but something&#x27;s going on. &gt;&gt; Definitely something going on. It&#x27;s a real situation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That&#x27;s a real weird one when you see all these like highlevel government employees talking about secret access programs and back engineering programs that have been going on for decades and decades and secrecy and you&#x27;re like your documentary did a fantastic job of highlighting a couple of reasons why I always when people are skeptical and they go okay if there was a program like this why wouldn&#x27;t they just tell us you you have to really understand the consequences of what they&#x27;ve done because what they&#x27;ve done has lied to Congress for a long time.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s misappropriation of funds, &gt;&gt; clear felonies, like &gt;&gt; lied to the public, lied to Congress, lied to sitting presidents, &gt;&gt; just the money stuff. And also, let&#x27;s just be really, let&#x27;s be just honest about human nature. If you have complete access to enormous amounts of money that&#x27;s not under any oversight at all, &gt;&gt; for sure. [laughter] Some of it some of it went in the pockets of people that probably shouldn&#x27;t have got it. 100%.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s safe to say &gt;&gt; 100% has to. &gt;&gt; Everyone I&#x27;ve talked to who&#x27;s aware of the details of the deeply hidden legacy program says that it&#x27;s at least over a trillion dollars spent since the 40s. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s an enormous amount of money. &gt;&gt; Now, this is an interesting point to make here. You know, secret of this and that.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve been lying to Congress. Nobody&#x27;s talked about it. What do you mean? I mean, everyone talks about it. Joe Rogan especially should know this that how many people have gone on a show to reveal all of these secrets, right? Everyone&#x27;s talked about it. People ran books, made other documentaries, podcasts, all kind I mean, what are we talking about? Literally, everyone talks about it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like the biggest nonsec secret there is. It&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t understand, right? And you even have people quote within the program who&#x27;ve come out like I&#x27;m I&#x27;m really confused by that to be honest with you. &gt;&gt; Rubio and Rounds and Jill Brandan, three of the most senior leaders in our government, um talk very openly about their concern about China and them getting ahead of us on reverse engineering this technology. Rubio says it keeps him up at night. rounds very animately animatedly says in the film, um, do you think for one second that they wouldn&#x27;t use this technology for their domination um, if they didn&#x27;t think we had access to the same technology? &gt;&gt; How is everybody getting these crashed UFOs? What&#x27;s the story behind that? &gt;&gt; So, here&#x27;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Um, one of the one of the unexpected things I learned in talking to sources like real credible people &gt;&gt; is that some of the cra some of the the crashes were actual crashes where just you know crashes happen just like they do for you can drive as safe as possible, fly as safe as possible, crashes are going to happen. But some of them were actually caused by elements of our military intelligence community and elements of foreign military intelligence community people. So like one of the realizations early on was that um atomic weapon test nuclear weapon testing atomic weapon testing create has a ripple effect that can down these things &gt;&gt; especially high altitude nuclear testing which is one of the things that they did in the 1950s in particular. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so they started doing it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To like shoot fish in a barrel basically. &gt;&gt; They did it on purpose. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so did Russ &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s why they were doing it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then Russia Russia started doing it. No. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then one of the &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like throwing dynamite into the river.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like fishing with dynamite. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Fishing with dynamite. Oh my god, that&#x27;s so crazy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Which is crazy on multiple levels. A, you could accidentally provoke a nuclear conflict with another party that doesn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. B, um, you&#x27;re, you know, you&#x27;re picking a fight with a more intelligent, superior species, right? Which is probably not going to work out great for anybody. &gt;&gt; They probably couldn&#x27;t believe we were using nukes in the sky. These [ __ ] idiots nuked some of our spaceships &gt;&gt; and the ocean.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now, this clip is definitely something new that I hadn&#x27;t heard before. That basically all these tests that we ran uh before of shooting, you know, detonating nuclear bombs, missiles, whatever in the atmosphere, we were actually doing it on purpose to shoot down UFOs. What? Where&#x27;s the proof? Where&#x27;s the evidence? Right. where I mean in the documentary they go through it like they&#x27;re gifting us the UFOs, [music] right? Hal Putoff brings it up in the movie, right? And then here some do crash because we make them crash from nuclear blast which first of all why would a UFO why would this advanced technology that can go through space time all this stuff that they claim it can do you know a nuclear bomb going off is going to affect it? That seems so I don&#x27;t know. so primitive, right? The sun detonates a bazillion nuclear bombs a day.</p>
<p>I mean, why aren&#x27;t they affected by that? I don&#x27;t know. I just so confused by this comment, right? And again, there&#x27;s no proof presented, but we&#x27;re getting UFOs from that. How many? What? Let&#x27;s get into details. But we can&#x27;t, which is again an issue with this documentary and an issue with just this topic in general. And I think the documentary is just a reflection of the topic and the secrecy that still holds.</p>
<p>But they want you to be, you know, on the edge of your seat because, you know, we&#x27;re telling you what we can. There&#x27;s way more stuff classified. If you knew that, holy cow, you you&#x27;d believe everything. You&#x27;d be convinced. I don&#x27;t want to be convinced of anything, right? I just want to know.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s either yes or no. There&#x27;s either proof or there&#x27;s not. There&#x27;s no convincing when there&#x27;s proof. &gt;&gt; An analogy that multiple people actually use with me. They said, &quot;Put yourself in the shoes of advanced non human intelligent species.&quot; Here&#x27;s the analogy.</p>
<p>Imagine you&#x27;re a zookeeper and you see this gorilla in a cage and you love this gorilla. It&#x27;s sweet. You watch you watch it evolve over the years. You see it communicate. It waves to you.</p>
<p>You know, you have no issue with this gorilla. You don&#x27;t wish it any harm. But what happens if one day you come in and the other security guards say, &quot;Hey, last night the gorilla got out of his cage, walked around the park, was playing with the gun cabinet, and then he went back in his cage.&quot; You&#x27;re like, &quot;All right, that&#x27;s concerning. Let me keep an eye on this.&quot; Right? And then and then what happens if you know a month later you come in and they&#x27;re like, &quot;Hey, the gorilla this time he got in the gun cage. &gt;&gt; He was playing with the gun and then he went back in his cage with the gun.</p>
<p>What do what do we do here?&quot; Right? So, &gt;&gt; what&#x27;s even worse than that? So, it&#x27;s like, we&#x27;ll take the gun out of his hand, we&#x27;ll put it back, we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll change the lock and all stuff, right? But then what happens if it evolves to a place where sometime later you come out of your house on a Sunday, you&#x27;re not even going to work, you got your daughter&#x27;s hand in your hand, and the gorilla is standing on your front lawn with a shotgun. Then you got to make a choice really quick, right? Like, do I just take this thing out or do I try to communicate with it and risk my daughter getting shot? And this analogy has been used with me multiple times to describe the dynamic we have with non-human intelligent life and the situation we&#x27;re barreling towards. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It would almost be like you went into the cage and the grill was welding and [laughter] the grill&#x27;s got gs on. He&#x27;s making a boar.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s putting together a shotgun. &gt;&gt; So, this is what&#x27;s interesting about this analogy is that I think a lot of this happens behind the scenes, not just with people like Dan Farah, but just anyone getting involved with all these government, you know, agents and government officials. Like, instead of showing you proof, they give you these weird analogies to make you understand where we&#x27;re at with this, right? put yourselves in advanced uh civilization um shoes and imagine we&#x27;re this gorilla in the zoo who gets it. What? Wait, what? We&#x27;re not in some zoo. We&#x27;re our own people.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t care if they put us here or not. If that&#x27;s the theory, you know, which first of all, in the age of disclosure, they pretty much say they don&#x27;t know anything. They they don&#x27;t know who they are or where they come from. They even even Lu Alzando claims in the movie that they could be humans [music] that have just been here that branched off. So why do they keep calling it nonhuman intelligence? They don&#x27;t [music] know that it could literally be human intelligence.</p>
<p>Now we say this is not man-made. But then you give the theory that it could be man that&#x27;s here like or us from the future like again contradictions a lot of them. But this theory that we&#x27;re this gorilla in the zoo I don&#x27;t like that analogy. I don&#x27;t think that fits at all. Right? Because one, where&#x27;s the proof of this advanced civilization, right? Where&#x27;s the proof of the zookeeper, you know? So, I don&#x27;t know, whatever.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of these analogies are used to convince people of things. Oh, I get it. Okay. Yeah. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think in the comments of that analogy. And what I think ultimately is going to have to happen, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised, man, if it happens soon after the film comes out. I think a sitting president has to step to the microphone and say definitively, humanity is not alone in the universe. We have recovered technology of non-human origin. So have other nations.</p>
<p>There is a highstakes secret cold war race to reverse engine this technology. We need to win this race and the US intends to lead in this new chapter. I think that needs to happen like a level set of basic facts and I really I really do think it will happen. &gt;&gt; Well, if that is going to happen, I think Trump might be the only guy that&#x27;s willing to do something crazy. &gt;&gt; I I think I think it&#x27;s very likely that he does that.</p>
<p>I know that I know that he is aware of the film. I know he&#x27;s aware of what people in his administration say. &gt;&gt; Has he watched it? Do you know that? &gt;&gt; He has not watched the film, but I know he&#x27;s very aware of it. And I know that they are discussing internally how they&#x27;re going to react to the film publicly. And I also know that he has recently, very recently, tasked Tulsi Gabbert with getting to the bottom of the situation and finding out for him what he needs to know that he doesn&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And as Rubio said in the film, Rubio says on on camera on the record on the film that this has been kept from sitting presidents and he goes into detail on how that&#x27;s been done and how it&#x27;s the career bureaucrats at certain in certain elements of the government that control this information and just wait presidents out and don&#x27;t feel like they have a need to know. &gt;&gt; Right. Well, there were some people that tried to find information out in the beginning of the Trump administration. Who was it? There was someone that talked about it on record and said he was told at every turn that you don&#x27;t have the clearance.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. But here&#x27;s the thing. Trump actually found out about the base facts in his last presidency and [snorts] was contemplating stepping to the microphone. Then &gt;&gt; now this is an interesting part that Dan Farah and others have brought up that Trump is is going to make, you know, an announcement or, you know, but he hasn&#x27;t even seen the film, right? I mean, what are we talking about? Clearly, he&#x27;s not convinced of anything and even people around him, but he hasn&#x27;t even seen the film.</p>
<p>So, you know, the fact that Trump&#x27;s going to come out after this documentary, I think, what if it doesn&#x27;t happen, right? Where where are they going to go with this thing, right? I think everyone&#x27;s expecting Trump to come out and say, you know, we&#x27;re not alone and this, but he&#x27;s not going to do it without any proof. That&#x27;s one thing. Good on good on Trump, man. we hate him or like at least with this he&#x27;s standing his ground and he&#x27;s not going to come out with any proof cuz he&#x27;ll look like an idiot. He&#x27;ll look like the biggest goofball in human history, not the biggest hero, right? So, I I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>I just, you know, I think they&#x27;re waiting for that stuff to come back from Mars and that will prove that we&#x27;re not alone and then he could say it and then people will attach that to this. But whatever. Anyway, it&#x27;s just an interesting thought, right? And look, he&#x27;s not the only one that&#x27;s said that. David Grush also brought this up in his interview. &gt;&gt; Uh certainly the the current president um is very knowledgeable on this subject and I trust his leadership on it.</p>
<p>And I think he&#x27;s assembled an an A team cabinet and I really believe uh if Trump wants to be the greatest president and the most consequential leader likely in world history, he certainly um has the knowledge, the capabilities and understanding of some of these sensitive government transparency issues. I have access but and I I speak to people about it. I&#x27;ve had actually meetings on it. People that are very smart and very solid have said they believe there is something out there and you know makes sense that there could be. I&#x27;ve never been convinced even despite that you know I just for some reason it&#x27;s not my thing.</p>
<p>So you think one he knows and two he&#x27;s open to transparency on UAPs? &gt;&gt; Uh he certainly is very well informed on this issue. Uh leave it at that. I don&#x27;t want to get ahead of what the president might want to reveal personally. &gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s like he knows they&#x27;re aware of all this stuff, but you know, we keep hearing that, but we don&#x27;t know. Again, no proof, just people talking about things coming.</p>
<p>They know this is happening behind the scenes movement. It&#x27;s just one of those things where you should just check out and see what happens if anything breaks because trying to follow this is impossible. though there&#x27;s something that Dan Feroh said you know right after you know talking about Marco Rubio [music] and I remember this part in the film where Marco Rubio&#x27;s like you know strategic surprise right people [music] didn&#x27;t we didn&#x27;t think Japan could bomb Pearl Harbor we didn&#x27;t think this about another country this that the other okay and then they say well it&#x27;s not China it&#x27;s not Russia okay but you just said we thought that before and we were wrong many times So, it literally could be them. Again, another contradiction. In fact, Rubio&#x27;s openly saying it could be China and it could be Russia, right? Again, [music] it&#x27;s this is so weird.</p>
<p>And look, there&#x27;s more to this that we&#x27;ll get to in a second. When it comes to China, Russia, and reverse engineered technology, you&#x27;re going to want to hear this microphone. &gt;&gt; How much do you think Elon knows? &gt;&gt; Look, I&#x27;ve seen him obviously talk to you about it. I think he knows a lot. &gt;&gt; Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think you get the contracts and the clearances you need to operate in in space. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Without some horse training. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When I went to SpaceX, I&#x27;m like, &quot;Motherfucker, you know everything.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s [laughter] no way. There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re launching these [ __ ] things into space without them keying you in on exactly what&#x27;s going on.&quot; He&#x27;s just sly about it. &gt;&gt; Well, I Well, if they are aliens, they&#x27;re certainly all subtle. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what he says. Like, are they really? I don&#x27;t know, man.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s impossible to operate in space like like he does and not be aware of everything and and also at the level he he operates clearance-wise. Um I held a secret screening at the National Space Symposium earlier this year, which is the Super Bowl of the space industry. It&#x27;s like 60 people, heavy hitters from the space industry. We didn&#x27;t promote it or publicize it at all, but there were a dozen guys from SpaceX there, and they all and [laughter] they all seem very aware of everything revealed in the film. All right.</p>
<p>So, this is interesting, the Elon Musk part, right? Because even Elon Musk has said on Joe Rogan, if he knew anything, he would come on Joe Rogan and say it. Now, I&#x27;m not saying Elon doesn&#x27;t know anything because of his involvement with Tim Taylor. If you know what I&#x27;m talking about, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. But, I don&#x27;t know. Does Elon know more? I mean, it&#x27;s just a weird thing.</p>
<p>I I don&#x27;t know. And then they screened it for people at SpaceX and they knew what was in the film. I mean, that just means that could just mean they&#x27;ve heard those stories before. Again, not proof of anything, but that&#x27;s the point. They bring you to the line just before proof and then they exit and hoping you won&#x27;t notice you didn&#x27;t get to your destination, right? Imagine if your Uber took you to another place you didn&#x27;t tell them to take you and then it&#x27;s like, &quot;Yep, here we go.&quot; That&#x27;s basically what&#x27;s happening here.</p>
<p>I &gt;&gt; mean, one thing I can say is like, look, I I if if I was aware of any evidence of aliens, um you Joe, you have my word. I will come on your show and I will reveal it on the show. &gt;&gt; Now, let&#x27;s move to the biggest bombshell that I heard in this Dan Farah interview that&#x27;s also included in the film. &gt;&gt; When people talk about the successful back engineering of these things, what are they saying? Are they saying that they can fly around Earth? Are they saying they can go outside of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and go into deep space with these things? Like what what have they said we are currently able to do with these back engineered crafts that we&#x27;ve supposedly &gt;&gt; people that I can&#x27;t attribute the statement to that &gt;&gt; were very credible sources told me that some of the UA UAP activity in space specifically is reverse engineered technology. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Does that mean in space in low Earth orbit or does that mean traveling through the solar system? &gt;&gt; The what was implied to me was traveling through the solar system. &gt;&gt; Jeez. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So are these &gt;&gt; here&#x27;s another thing someone that that same person said to me by the way. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>So before I forget that their belief is that the technology we have would not be pulled out even to stop a world war. It would not those cards would not be shown until moments before like a nuclear war situation. So they wouldn&#x27;t pull it out to stop like any of the wars we&#x27;ve experienced in the last, you know, since World War II. Um they wouldn&#x27;t, you know, regardless of how many &gt;&gt; It has to get to nine. &gt;&gt; It has to get to a level where there&#x27;s no Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s no other option. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Because it&#x27;s show your cards. &gt;&gt; Now, when they say that they&#x27;ve traveled through the solar system, &gt;&gt; is this biological human beings or are these drone crafts? Like, what are they saying? &gt;&gt; I I I never got any of that. I never got any of that.</p>
<p>All I was told is there&#x27;s some of the some of the UAPs that are seen that have been seen by our astronauts on space missions are non-human intelligent life and some are reverse engineered craft. That&#x27;s what I was told. &gt;&gt; But we don&#x27;t know whether there&#x27;s a person inside of them. &gt;&gt; I I don&#x27;t &gt;&gt; if they are reverse engineered and they are ours and we figured out how to make our own &gt;&gt; that I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I need to know that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, [laughter] &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s kind of important. There&#x27;s a lot. &gt;&gt; Is there [ __ ] some dude named Bob flying through space? some Top Gun guy that they&#x27;ve [laughter] given the task of traveling to Venus real quick. &gt;&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me. You know, one of the other things that, you know, we were talking about Clapper and Ruby and what they said about China, something else that they both said despite these guys being completely ideologically opposed, right? Like they have no nothing else in common.</p>
<p>Um, they both spoke to how we as a species, not just our country, but entire human species is held back by this. there&#x27;s something the fact that there&#x27;s something in the human psyche that says I can&#x27;t prepare for or wrap my head around something I haven&#x27;t experienced yet, right? And how that leads to strategic surprise because you&#x27;re not preparing for something that can ultimately end up happening. And Rubio makes great examples. He says, you know, we didn&#x27;t think the Japanese could torpedo us at Pearl Harbor till they figured it out and they did, right? We didn&#x27;t think that terrorists were going to come here and learn how to fly commercial airplanes and use them in a terror attack until they did. And with this he&#x27;s like we don&#x27;t want strategic surprise to lead to a disaster on this front.</p>
<p>We need to be ahead of it. And he very powerfully says you know often strategic surprise changes the course of human history. &gt;&gt; So this is the question. If we have craft that we can travel through the solar we meaning someone in the United States of America. Does China do they have the same ability right now? Is there an understanding of where they&#x27;re at in the race versus us? Everyone who talked about the race with China was extremely concerned about how close they were and multiple people talked about how these incursions over our sensitive bases and nukes could in fact be reverse engineered Chinese craft.</p>
<p>So what so basically he&#x27;s saying that we have reverse engineered some of these craft and we&#x27;ve been out there in space traveling around. What? What are we talking about? Huh? Let me tell you why that&#x27;s [music] interesting. Because Eric Davis, who is heavily featured in the documentary Age of Disclosure, doesn&#x27;t think that at all. He doesn&#x27;t think ARVs, which stands for Alien Reproduction Vehicle, exist at all. Check this out.</p>
<p>One of the things you kind of definitively said during your uh talk up there was that there are no ARVs or alien reproduction vehicles. And so I think that&#x27;s really kind of a bombshell because there&#x27;s so many theories out there like oh this incident or that incident or thing ARV but you know we I can sort of take their word for it. &gt;&gt; Um because we barely scratched the surface of how they even &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I have some questions about this. So like do you think anything&#x27;s happened recently maybe like in the last like 10 years that&#x27;s real new like advancement like progress? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not aware of it because I&#x27;m out of it now.</p>
<p>Sure. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been out of it since the AIP ended. So &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; So I&#x27;m not read into it. Um at the level I was for the OSAP and ASIP AIP purposes.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. All I do know is I was given a firm, hey, in 1989 the CIA shut it all down because nobody us and we know the other companies that we had been found out from our customer didn&#x27;t make any progress after several decades of investigating. There was no progress made. So I said, &quot;So what&#x27;s the story about Northrum having an ARV or somebody out at Area 51 having an ARV?&quot; And he said, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s all myth.&quot; They said the people that have been putting out there don&#x27;t know what the hell they&#x27;re talking about and they don&#x27;t know why unless they&#x27;re just another Bob Lazar type. They&#x27;re just going to they&#x27;re long on the tooth and they&#x27;re going to tell a story.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Is there any chance that was disinformation or that was passage material? &gt;&gt; No, actually it wasn&#x27;t disinformation. It was even Bob Lazar&#x27;s information is disinformation. It&#x27;s because they they believe their own [ __ ] &gt;&gt; I mean that they were telling you that there&#x27;s no ARBs. We&#x27;ve made no &gt;&gt; Oh, no.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not disinformation. You know, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s coming straight on a classified level &gt;&gt; with me having the need to know and they don&#x27;t have a need to give me this information. We&#x27;re on a program and we&#x27;re going to give them contract money to work with us and they&#x27;re not going to sit there and [ __ ] with us &gt;&gt; if we&#x27;re going to give them money. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think so. It&#x27;s way too 5D chess, right? Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess &gt;&gt; when you&#x27;re when you&#x27;re saying ARV, do you mean like a onetoone recreation of a UAP and an HI vehicle or do you think there&#x27;s aircraft systems that have kind of leveraged technologies off? &gt;&gt; Definitely no aircraft systems that have leveraged anything. Um, and there&#x27;s been no one toone reproduction. A lot of that fell into the psyche of of of the UFO community because of Bob Lazar and then Brad Serenson and Mark Mark McCandless. So, &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re coming from. And then other people kind of came out of the woodwork saying the same thing, but no proof.</p>
<p>I mean, there&#x27;s been photographs, but those photographs I I haven&#x27;t analyzed them. I don&#x27;t remember if Bruce McCabe looked at them. I know Bruce Mcabe had only said um they definitely looked like hoaxes to him, but I I don&#x27;t think he ever issued a report on them because he&#x27;s got lots of reports on UAPs that he has done photo and and film and video analysis of. &gt;&gt; Have you ever spoken to the Brad Sorenson and Mcandish? How put off? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Brad, what do you think about adversarial governments having uh you know functional vehicles that they&#x27;ve that okay if they do then basically uh why are we still a country you know why haven&#x27;t we been conquered &gt;&gt; and it doesn&#x27;t just stop there right I mean again I thought we were saying you know China Russia can&#x27;t have it strategic surprise you know all these things and then Dan Farah says on this other interview on News Nation that Russia had a tic tac you know back in the 80s. &gt;&gt; We think China and Russia both have retrieved alien spacecraft as well. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what the officials in my film go on the record stating &gt;&gt; they go on the record in fact saying that what what in 1989 we think the Soviets retrieved a tic tacshaped spacecraft that had crashed &gt;&gt; which was which was significantly larger than the tic tac encountered by the Nimttz carrier strike group. &gt;&gt; And what&#x27;s also interesting is Dan Farah&#x27;s comments about the tic tac. Listen to this and then I&#x27;ll explain after.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And whether the Tic Tac is one of ours. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think it is. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. I talked to everybody who ran actually ran the investigation of Tic Tac from various agencies and to the pilots.</p>
<p>No one no one thinks it&#x27;s man-made. &gt;&gt; And also, if it was man-made, that would mean that someone cracked a new energy source that far back, which is like what, 20 years at this point, right? um and has never used it to benefit our country or another country to solve the energy crisis to make a superior craft that we&#x27;ve seen used. It&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just hard to believe that no one would use that to like fuel their economy. I mean, it&#x27;d be it&#x27;d be like a total, you know, restart of everything if you had that technology. I mean the craft with that that tic tac was going from sea level to 80,000 ft which is space and hovering at in space going back down hovering at sea level and doing this for hours we we don&#x27;t have anything the one of the scientists who was involved in one of the UAP programs for the government in my film does the math and says the energy required to do that is the electrical output of the entire United States for I think he said a week some stupid amount of energy required.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s even more than a week. But yeah, I remember him saying that. &gt;&gt; So he&#x27;s basically saying, &quot;No, this this can&#x27;t be ours. You know, this isn&#x27;t man-made.&quot; And then claims that we have reverse engineered stuff and are flying around space. So that tic tac could be an ARV and it could be from China.</p>
<p>But but again, we just said they don&#x27;t have this stuff, right? They can&#x27;t have it. It&#x27;s just so weird. It&#x27;s all convoluted if you ask me. Nothing makes sense. I It&#x27;s like maybe they should use that chalkboard in the movie to lay out these facts so that they don&#x27;t contradict themselves.</p>
<p>Again, nobody&#x27;s going to catch this stuff. Unless you&#x27;re deep into it like me, like an idiot, you know, then you know this stuff, right? But most people aren&#x27;t going to know this at all. And to be fair, they&#x27;re not promoting this film to the UFO community. This is strictly for people outside the UFO community because if you&#x27;re in it and you&#x27;re quite knowledgeable, you would see these contradictions. I think anyone not pointing out these contradictions that knows this stuff is being a little disingenuous.</p>
<p>And one other contradiction that was very interesting is in the documentary they talk about ATIP a lot, right? Atip. They don&#x27;t even bring up OAP. Yeah, exactly. If you know about OAP, then you know this doesn&#x27;t make sense. Why wouldn&#x27;t they bring any of this up in the film? Right.</p>
<p>Because in 2017, the New York Times released an article, right? Huge news, broke the seal, if you will. Um, well, George Knap came out after and said that they got a lot wrong in that article. Take a look at this. Every news organization in the world started reporting on UFOs after the Times did the story. The the report in December of 2017 was explosive.</p>
<p>You and I knew it was coming and had done some things in advance. It&#x27;s in even in your film Hunter Skinwalker. Hey, in a couple of weeks, something big is coming. &gt;&gt; Um, but the New York Times story, as important as it was, got it wrong. They had reported about the existence of a program called ATIP, and the guy who was in charge of it was Lou Alzando, who had worked as an insider.</p>
<p>He had had uh and came forward. He was upset that the secrecy existed. The Times said that the ATIP had a budget of $22 million that had been arranged by Senator Harry Reid that the money went to Robert Bigalow and they were studying UFOs. Well, a lot of that was right and it was a crucial and important story, but a lot of it was wrong. The actual program was called something else.</p>
<p>And in the months that followed, um, I started digging into that. I I was invited to go to a wa a meeting in in Washington DC with Senator Harry Reid and an intelligence guy that I can say the name of it now. His name is Jim Latsky. He had worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency, had spent 20 years as a rocket scientist analyzing enemy systems and and doing reverse engineering things of that sort. Uh and he took an interest in Skinwalker Ranch and the possibility that there were national defense considerations based on our book, Hunt for the Skinwalker.</p>
<p>He read the book. He shared it with other intelligence officials. They thought it was interesting as well. So he asked his superiors for permission to go visit the ranch. He reached out to Robert Bigalow, went to the property, had a dramatic experience, went back to Washington, wrote up a proposal for a program, sold it to Harry Reid, who pitched it to fellow Sen senators.</p>
<p>They secured $22 million. The program is called OAP, Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Application Program. It does not mention UFOs in any of the documents. It was put out as a contract. Robert Bigalow created an organization called BASS.</p>
<p>Apologies for all these acronyms, by the way. OAP is the program under DIA. BASS is the organization that got the contract. And they started a study. It was a secret study.</p>
<p>Um, it was supposed to last for 5 years. Skinwalker Ranch was used as a sort of a base of operations, but it wasn&#x27;t the focus of the study. and they proceeded to hire 50 full-time investigators, biggest UFO program in the history of our government that we know of. &gt;&gt; And look, like Jeremy Corbel says right after George Knap says that, we&#x27;re here to poke the bear on this show. Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re also going to poke the bear on this show. &gt;&gt; And there was a lot of confusion about ATIP, OAP, this that Luisando. This is what Jim Latsky had to say about Luis Lazando. and George Knap asked Lu Alzando about this. &gt;&gt; Dr.</p>
<p>James Lat James Lowsky answered an email. Some news organization asked him for a photo and along the way they said something about OAP that he corrected that it seemed like the questioner uh got it wrong and he just corrected him but he didn&#x27;t want to give a comment. They used his comments anyway [music] and it sounds like he&#x27;s coming after you. I&#x27;m telling you he he was not coming after you. He was not he was just pointing out you weren&#x27;t really a big part of OAP.</p>
<p>you were invited to be part of it and if it had survived you would have been part of it but he was just clarifying that and it sounds like &gt;&gt; he was not part of it I made it very clear in my book in fact you know Jim Jim was Jim was was one of the founders and creators of that you know he he the guy deserves enormous credit for that he really does uh he he we would not there would not be an ATIP [music] had there not been Jim Lowsky &gt;&gt; again there would be no ATIP without OAP why didn&#x27;t they bring that up in the film why didn&#x27;t they talk about this at all and I even made a video about all of this. Luis Alzando is at the center of another controversy. [music] And in today&#x27;s video, we&#x27;re going to be jumping in on that because the controversy is did Luis Alzando run a program called ATIP, right? Or OAP. And in today&#x27;s video, we&#x27;re going to look at what is ATIP and what is OAP and some of the comments from the community about this because Eric Davis just posted on Facebook some quite controversial comments about Luis Alisando and his involvement with this Pentagon-run UFO [music] program. All right, I&#x27;ll put a link in the description.</p>
<p>Feel free to go check that out. Now, let&#x27;s jump to the rest of David Gush&#x27;s interview on Fox News. &gt;&gt; Welcome back to Special Report. Tonight we continue our series looking at unidentified anomalous anonymous say that easy phenomena. What uh many people still call UFOs UAPs.</p>
<p>Last week we spoke with the director of the age of disclosure. It&#x27;s a new documentary out about a suspected government cover up over UAPs for decades which debuts tonight in select theaters around the country. Is also available on Prime Video. It&#x27;s powerful. It features testimony from 34 former and current government officials, including witnesses who have testified before Congress.</p>
<p>Earlier, we spoke with another whistleblower who is now a congressional task force member on the UAP subject. &gt;&gt; If you believe we have crashed craft, uh stated earlier, do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? &gt;&gt; Biologics came with some of these recoveries. Yeah. Um, were they, I guess, human or non-human biologics? &gt;&gt; Non-human. &gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s get some insight into the UAP or UFO it used to be called, controversy, and what Congress is trying to do about it.</p>
<p>Joining us now, retired Air Force Major David Grush, who has been a whistleblower on the subject of UFOs, UAPs, and government transparency. He&#x27;s a special adviser now to the House UAP Task Force. Thanks for being here. &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me on, Brett. So since then people say where is the evidence? What&#x27;s happening? Why don&#x27;t we know more right now almost two years later? &gt;&gt; Well certainly the last administration didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t help and my my hearing of course was during the last administration and they were not exactly super transparent on this issue unfortunately.</p>
<p>Uh but now that the task force has been created um I&#x27;ve been able to you know guide the members within the boundaries of uh what they&#x27;re actually cleared for. When people look at this, they look online, they say, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot out there. There&#x27;s a lot of people talking about encounters. There&#x27;s a lot of people talking about videos, and we&#x27;ve seen a lot of that.&quot; &gt;&gt; Can we just cut it down to you believe that we have encountered alien beings and that they&#x27;ve come to Earth and that we know about it as a US government? That seems to be the case. I don&#x27;t like to characterize necessarily where they came from.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re definitely some kind of nonhuman sentience, but it is true. Believe it or not, we&#x27;ve recovered the vehicles um and we actually have physical proof and I was actually uh partially cleared into some of those activities. It was beyond uh oral testimony provided to me. I actually had partial access uh to the data and actually read the intelligence reports uh resulting from those programs. &gt;&gt; With your own eyes, you saw it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, that&#x27;s interesting. David Gush is saying with his own eyes he&#x27;s seen this evidence. First of all, great question by Brett Bearer.</p>
<p>You know, where&#x27;s the evidence, right? And David Gush is claiming it wasn&#x27;t just oral testimony. He saw intelligence reports from these programs, but again, he&#x27;s seen no craft or bodies, right? And then he brings up the well, you know, some sort of non-human sentience, but again, you just said you don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re coming from. So, it could be human, even if it&#x27;s a different type of human you&#x27;ve never heard of, one that branched off. They call that cryptoaterrestrials or ultraterrestrials or timetraveling humans, right? [music] But again, they keep calling it nonhuman sentience, which could be my [ __ ] dog, right? So, it&#x27;s just again ambiguous, mysterious, um, you know, to confuse you so you don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going on. And he doesn&#x27;t want to talk in exacts, right? Like, we have proof, you know, we have these things.</p>
<p>Where&#x27;s the evidence? is the biggest question. Where&#x27;s the proof? &gt;&gt; And so when people say this is kooky, this is out there, there&#x27;s nothing to back it up. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t speak for other parts of the government, but I can tell you NASA, which I speak for, is open and transparent with our data. &gt;&gt; Do you believe what Mr. David Crush said or is he lying? &gt;&gt; Whatever he said, where&#x27;s the evidence? What do you say? Certainly members of this current administration are very very well aware of this reality.</p>
<p>Um &gt;&gt; so again getting into this, you know, is it intradimensional? Is this is it non-human? You know, again, you don&#x27;t know what it is. So you can&#x27;t say nonhuman. I&#x27;m sorry. You just can&#x27;t say that. That doesn&#x27;t make sense.</p>
<p>And it doesn&#x27;t make sense. You know, he&#x27;s seen photos. We know those could be doctorred. Videos can all be doctorred. Again, you can convince someone with just an analogy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s been a role to cover this up, you&#x27;re saying, uh, through administrations. &gt;&gt; Um, and there have been people who have been threatened and told not to testify. &gt;&gt; I was, uh, physically threatened even before I sent in my intelligence community, Inspector General report under the previous administration. I actually had to go and and seek legal protection that way because I was, you know, literally in fear both professionally and in my personal life. for the other people who are coming out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You say to them what? You&#x27;ve obviously faced intimidation. You talked about harassment. Uh there are reports that others have too. I say that uh there&#x27;s hope. Um certainly uh Congress values whistleblower information right now and certainly I believe there&#x27;s an appetite with the administration to do the right thing on this as well.</p>
<p>Um, and there&#x27;s some other things that are happening behind the scenes that I&#x27;ll let the administration discuss when they&#x27;re ready. &gt;&gt; But let me be clear, David Gush being threatened, his life being threatened. I saw a journalist from the New York Post sort of docks his wives and all this [ __ ] that&#x27;s unbelievable. I am not for that. I have no problem pushing back on some claims and asking questions, but crossing the line like they do with David Gush and they have is despicable to me.</p>
<p>Okay. threats, however they may be, unacceptable. Doxing his wives and all that, showing their picture, bringing in the families, unacceptable. People that brought out his me medical history, hey, he, you know, had these mental moments and, you know, all this stuff and whatever. It&#x27;s like, dude, the guy had issues, understandably so, from his time in the service, right? And then he got help.</p>
<p>He got help. He had problems and he got help. So, I&#x27;m here to stand up for David Gusher in that st in that instance, right? That&#x27;s unacceptable to me. And people using that against him, his medical history, [ __ ] despicable if you ask me. Again, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m have no problem asking questions and, you know, questioning all of this, right? I mean, we&#x27;re talking aliens like at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So, I just find that to be unexcusable if you ask me. Let&#x27;s ask questions, but let&#x27;s be cool about it. And when you mentioned in that testimony of recovering the pilots or or remains nonhuman, that&#x27;s something that you saw as far as the intelligence with your eyes. &gt;&gt; Yes. And it is a very uncomfortable even for me now as as somebody who&#x27;s seen it, experienced it, even talking about it because it&#x27;s so um outside a normal person&#x27;s worldview to understand that there is um this biological sentience that have piloted these crafts that don&#x27;t necessarily look 100% like you and I.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Were there pictures? Were there &gt;&gt; there were Yes, there were. &gt;&gt; When I said from another planet or from outer space, you said not. We don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re from. Is it interdimensional? What what are we talking about? &gt;&gt; Uh I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of I&#x27;ll call greybeards on the program. That is a subject of hot debate on origin.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve as a guy trained in physics formally as well in my background. I leave an open mind on what the origin is. Uh certainly uh there is the extraterrestrial hypothesis and they could be coming from elsewhere off earth, but I don&#x27;t usually go there because I did not see that data. I and I&#x27;m not conversant in the high confidence theories that the US government had. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not aware of any remains that the department has um uh of you know any signs of extraterrestrial beings or activity or technology.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You say we the US government knows but there are many other governments around the world. &gt;&gt; Do they know? They have their own programs and like I said two and a half years ago uh we have been an arms race with our peer competitors you know namely Russia and China and they have their own programs in that in this regard and I was actually able to view a body of intelligence that discussed um adversarial programs and I&#x27;ll leave it at that. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve recovered things you say yeah &gt;&gt; bodies and physical remains. Was there a sense that the motive of whether how they got here, what they were doing, was it peaceful, not peaceful? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve seen a mixed bag of activity. Um, and uh motive and intent, why they&#x27;re visiting.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s once again that gets into our assessments, not necessarily, we can&#x27;t quite understand the intent of some of the sentients and why they&#x27;re visiting. Could it be because uh we have interesting genetic material on Earth? uh we&#x27;re uh Jurassic Park tourist attraction for them. Could be a myriad of reasons. &gt;&gt; So again, we bring up all of this that other countries may have, but in the film, remember, like I said, in the film, they say there&#x27;s no way China or Russia could have this. And then in the same breast, they talk about they do have this stuff.</p>
<p>Like which is it? Again, it&#x27;s all over the place. I&#x27;m so confused myself. And I do this every day, y&#x27;all. And I&#x27;m confused as hell because all the information never adds up because it is just stories and you just have a bunch of people across a bunch of different military agencies and intel agencies and government officials and Congress members and this and that and secret yahoos that all just tell different stuff that doesn&#x27;t add up. So whatever, you know, maybe it&#x27;s just me.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t put the puzzle pieces together, right? [music] It&#x27;s pretty simple. It&#x27;s one question. Are we alone on this planet? Where&#x27;s the proof or evidence? If it&#x27;s yes, right? Where&#x27;s the proof? All right, y&#x27;all. We&#x27;ll see you guys on the next one. Remember, everyday is a gift, y&#x27;all.</p>
<p>Peace. So yeah, this uh alien that had the glowing eyes that&#x27;s just, you know, I don&#x27;t I can&#x27;t explain it. He went from ground level to like well above the onestory house um in the tree and like like I was saying like I knew exactly where he was going to go. It was the weirdest thing. [music] And in the eyes just the glowing eyes just looking down at me.</p>
<p>And yeah, I closed my window. I locked it. I undid the twist knot [music] and I pretty much face planted in my bed and I just I just remember telling myself over and over and over again [music] like saying out like kind of out loud, not too loud, but just saying it out loud like, &quot;Please don&#x27;t come get me. Please don&#x27;t save me. Please leave me alone.&quot; I just kept repeating that stuff.</p>
<p>And I remember like I still felt uneasy. And I remember going to my closet and opening my door, turning on my closet light. And I did that all the way through high [music] school. Um, the second experience that I had, I don&#x27;t remember anything after that, okay? I don&#x27;t remember falling asleep. Um, I just I just remember that thing being outside my bedroom window.</p>
<p>[music] Um, and then a couple years ago, um, I&#x27;m now in the Hawaiian Islands. I live on Aahu. Um, couple years ago, I had finished up this one law class. It was um during CO and um I I just went outside into the culde-sac and I just you know I saw this like cigar shape. I reported this to MON.</p>
<p>Um it was it was like a bluish purple hue. It was large. It was not a spacecraft. Uh I mean like it was not an airplane or an aircraft like that. I mean it was it was it was moving effortlessly.</p>
<p>There was no noise like what you would hear from an airplane or a helicopter and yeah, I just watched it go from essentially the plane towards the wai coast and it just it was gone within a couple of seconds and I wasn&#x27;t scared at all. Like when I saw that thing I was like whoa that&#x27;s so cool. And I grabbed another roommate. I was like hey come look at this before it&#x27;s gone. And that roommate was like, &quot;Ah, that&#x27;s just the military.&quot; I&#x27;m like, &quot;No, that&#x27;s not the military.</p>
<p>That thing is huge and moving fast.&quot; Anywh who, um, [music] yeah, th those are my two experiences. Sorry, first two messages.</p>
