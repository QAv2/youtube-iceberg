daily videos ad free early before anyone else gets to see them how about it and you can help support the channel Dr Steven G says he has a brand new whistleblower and if he comes forward it will change everything apparently he is a former chairman of a Fortune 50 company a quote household name as he puts it probably one of the most significant uh people to come forward if we can protect him is the former chairman of a Fortune 50 company that&#x27;s been involved with this it&#x27;s a household name I won&#x27;t say which one and he wants to come forward he&#x27;s like 80 years old this year and he deeply regrets what they&#x27;ve done and you know he&#x27;s admitted that they have the schematics and the designs to provide free energy quote unquote to the whole world and he he really regrets all the secrecy he&#x27;s got the designs for free energy who is this guy but at the same time he as soon as he reached out to me through his assistant and friend Fortune 50 one of the top 50 companies yeah it&#x27;s huge and can we play Can Can I guess no I&#x27;m not going to play that game no I don&#x27;t but I I would betray that man&#x27;s trust because it&#x27;d be easy for someone to figure out who it is wasn&#x27;t a military contractor though it&#x27;s a big company that has a lot of finger and a lot of Pies right okay big company that has a finger and a lot of Pies um I mean he doesn&#x27;t want to bate the guy&#x27;s trust but then here he is kind of talking about him I mean he&#x27;s limiting it down how many companies are in the Fortune 50 chairman household names free energy they&#x27;re older right like um he&#x27;s kind of you know kind of narrowing it down for us um if someone wanted to do a little bit of digging they probably could figure it out but the problem is Steph Greer a lot of times will embellish or exaggerate certain people&#x27;s positions or you know things like that so it&#x27;s probably not a former chairman of a Fortune 50 company you know it&#x27;s probably maybe still in the Fortune 500 but you know 51 or there some there&#x27;s always something off about it right like he said you know oh when his assistant and friend reach out to me I mean you know what I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s so it&#x27;s hard to find out what exactly and who he&#x27;s talking about this man then was threatened and they threatened to kill his whole family and his grandchildren so uh what I&#x27;m trying what I&#x27;m trying to get and it was you know the Senate intelligence committee passed in 2023 unanimously uh the provision to give amnesty or Safe Harbor to these kind of people right y but the house in the reconciliation of the bill took it out due to couple of guys who were I think Bad actors there yeah who were those guys again were those the Ohio guys the Ohio no yeah Turner Mike Turner was chair of Senate intelligence and the other Mike Rogers who is chair of armed services and a few other people gutted that and it kind of and why why do you think those two guys because I think they receive a lot of funding from the very people that that need to be exposed I mean you know I I think it&#x27;s obviously they&#x27;re carrying water for someone which is corruption so Steven G is saying that this guy&#x27;s you know family um was threatened and that&#x27;s horrific right if that&#x27;s the case and he&#x27;s basically saying that amnesty was taken off the table um by Rogers and Turner right who are no longer there so hopefully maybe that will change um but basically that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s getting at that this guy was going to come forward but realized oh you know I&#x27;ve done some bad things you know I&#x27;m not going to have any protection I don&#x27;t really you know maybe I don&#x27;t want to come out right and and to be fair that is a conversation that&#x27;s had a lot in this topic which is if there is this government cover up for so long right and to what extent and all that then people have done some bad things to sort of you know Aid the cover up right right you know whether it was what they thought was right or wrong doesn&#x27;t really matter it&#x27;s just that you know some lines have been crossed allegedly right over the last 80 years and if those people come forward if you know some of them are still alive right coming forward the people that are currently in these programs right they come forward are they going to be prosecuted for their crimes right so they want amnesty right essentially so I guess Stephen is implying that this guy has done some things right otherwise why would he care about the amnesty right it can&#x27;t be justo you know keeping the free energy designs secret right sure there&#x27;s more to it um but that&#x27;s Washington right I mean who&#x27;s got the money who&#x27;s got the blackmail file on you you know y people get bribed people get threatened people get killed it&#x27;s not a conspiracy theory it&#x27;s a fact um I&#x27;ve had all those games run on me so um you know I&#x27;m kind of like Stephen grer I always bring things back to myself as well right he&#x27;s like saying that you know that&#x27;s Washington corruption well you know and I&#x27;ve had all those things done to me too you know I just I mean nothing gu I again I&#x27;m guilty of it myself now let&#x27;s get back to talking about this brand new whistleblower that wants to come out right there&#x27;s also other reasons that could be preventing him from coming out but I think that there you know someone like that would have you know a lot of the keys to the kingdom but if you&#x27;re at risk for Rico charges right Federal rariane to the the criminal activity that you oversaw as an executive and maybe worse things but you&#x27;re also under threat from the organization keeping the secret of having you or your family killed like this gentleman I don&#x27;t think he would mind if he got killed but he doesn&#x27;t one of his children and grandchildren killed now let&#x27;s be reasonable here these are valid concerns if this is all true right again this is all according to Dr Steph Greer but if that is the case I can understand this whistleblower being concerned for the safety of his family right um and not wanting to go to prison for the last part of his life right these are legitimately valid concerns and and to be fair if all of this was true and these whistleblowers are then these concerns are valid right in fact they should be at the Forefront no matter what because you wouldn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen especially the safety of your family if there is this is true and this is the biggest cover up of all time you know that&#x27;s the least of your worries to be honest what is his what did he see what is his what is his connection to this stuff no he&#x27;s a chairman of a massive Corporation but he was read into a very special Project&#x27;s compartmented area dealing with the technology and and that&#x27;s the reason he won&#x27;t he doesn&#x27;t want to come forward publicly because he&#x27;s he&#x27;s been threatened his family&#x27;s been threatened of course yeah and so it&#x27;s now I know who he is and the people who are going to need to know you know the president uh you know attorney general law enforcement and on down the system will know or do know by now so the only question becomes what are they going to do about it what are they going to do about it right um You have this former chairman of a Fortune 50 company who holds keys to the kingdom right he has the knowledge of free energy right that I guess he&#x27;s alleging is reverse engineered from Alien that isn&#x27;t made clear here but that is my guess right and clearly he&#x27;s done some things he&#x27;s maybe not proud of and is concerned for the safety of his family and without the protection of amnesty uh from the government he&#x27;s worried about coming forward but sounds like they&#x27;ve already revealed them right at the end of it all stepen G just says well you know law enforcement knows about him knows about what&#x27;s going on so I mean that&#x27;s like a criminal going to the police station to confess to murder and then asking for a pardon right like afterward like just out of nowhere like you got to secure the pardon before right like secure a deal beforehand I mean this is kind of or I guess he&#x27;s going to him trying to make a deal I don&#x27;t know but you&#x27;re kind of I don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re stuck a little bit here so I don&#x27;t know that may not have been a good analogy but you know I don&#x27;t understand so like everyone&#x27;s kind of knows about him cuz he&#x27;s in this briefing stepen G gave this briefing to president Trump allegedly or people around him or something right I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re getting all kinds of stuff you know it&#x27;s worded as a briefing but you know in it is this guy&#x27;s name it&#x27;s in there right so it&#x27;s like just being passed around and again different levels of law enforcement already know about him so I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know right household name who Could That Be you know guess we&#x27;ll but again it&#x27;s hard to tell if he&#x27;s actually Fortune 50 chairman right that&#x27;s a big deal I don&#x27;t know if you you know that&#x27;s a huge that&#x27;s a these are that&#x27;s a billionaire we&#x27;re talking billionaires here right who and this guy doesn&#x27;t have any power to make some moves you know what I mean to affect Mike Turner and um um uh who was the other guy I already forgot the other guy&#x27;s name but right the two guys who had taken away amnesty being paid off by Advanced Aerospace it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re being paid off billions right this this billionaire multi-billionaire doesn&#x27;t can&#x27;t pull any strings or do anything that that seems odd to me that right this all seems a little strange to me um as you start to kind of think about it a little bit more of what Steven G is saying that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying I don&#x27;t know if this guy is Fortune 50 or you know maybe met fortune cookie 50 I don&#x27;t know maybe he met something else I don&#x27;t know um we&#x27;ll never know to be honest cuz who knows if this guy&#x27;s going to come forward probably not I don&#x27;t know who knows anyway put a link in the description go check out the full interview on Danny Jones podcast we&#x27;ll see you guys in the next episode remember everyday is a gift y&#x27;all don&#x27;t forget leave me your comments down
