            <p>all right hello everyone my name is Thomas and welcome to my channel I do uh educational material on this channel and uh we are uh doing one video after another on the reciprocal system of theory this is a theory of everything uh proposed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century up until the time he died in 1990 uh we are actually looking at his final book called The beyond space and time and that actually came out posthumously in 1995. most of his earlier work is on the hard Sciences uh chemistry and physics and astronomy this book though is on the softer stuff uh religion philosophy psychology and um uh we&#x27;re looking into this because it&#x27;s a little bit more accessible we&#x27;re we will be going back and looking at his earlier stuff here after this but um we&#x27;re right now getting toward the end of beyond space and time and uh the basic idea on the reciprocal system is that it is a theory of everything so you just have to if you learn how it&#x27;s a system of theory if you learn how it works then you can command the reciprocal system and you can plug it into any subject that you want so it puts the power into your hands to do science for yourself um mainly by um induction and deduction and uh if you can figure out how the reciprocal system works and then you plug it into your subject it will um you know confirm benefits on you it will it will yield answers uh and many of those answers might be answers that are uh long-standing mysteries in your field uh and that&#x27;s what Larson did here with the metaphysics uh and he&#x27;s attempting right now in this chapter to really uh kind of reconcile science and religion uh this chapter is called religion re-examine before we get to that let me just go over the reciprocal system real briefly uh the according to Larson the universe is not made out of matter and it&#x27;s not made out of energy the universe is made out of motion emotion is the relationship between space and time a relationship rep implies a fraction uh and a reciprocal relationship so the space and time are in a reciprocal relationship with one another uh basically meaning that uh any quality that adheres to one adheres to the other as well such as uh three or more dimensions of space uh so there are also three or more dimensions of time there are uh a there is a progression of time time is always getting later and later and later for space if the space is also flowing or progressing meaning that face is always getting farther and farther apart um and that was observed by the Hubble telescope in the recession of the distant galaxies uh space and time are also uh in discrete units there&#x27;s no half a unit or 0.3 units there&#x27;s only one unit two units three units four units and so on and those units are very very small so it&#x27;s kind of hard to see that but one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light space over time is speed all uh scientific entities are are um fractions of time over space or space over time and the speed of light is really kind of like the boundary between them the speed of light one over one and so where Einstein says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson says the speed of light is the null point or the uh neutral point or even the origin of the universe and that um half the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light he calls this sector two or the cosmic sector and sector one is the sector we&#x27;re familiar with the material sector that&#x27;s slower than the speed of light phenomena this is mainly you know chemistry and physics atoms and particles are really atoms and molecules um atoms and molecules of sector one build up to their most complex level which is uh DNA having a few billion uh atoms per molecule at that level DNA becomes eligible to be controlled by a sector 2 entity and that uh combination of the sector 1 and sector two is what Larson calls the life unit life is a combination of material and Cosmic entity and life then evolves or develops and uh eventually reaches uh goes from all the way from a single-celled organism all the way up to the most uh complex form which is Larson says the intelligent human being at that point the intelligent human being then becomes eligible to be controlled overall by a sector 3 entity sector three is this and is this a region that is independent of space and time or beyond space and time I would argue that that uh is what other people call God or the religious the spiritual and that it has something to do with the speed of light with this origin with this null point or neutral area and um but when a um human being an intelligent human being becomes uh controlled by sector three it finds itself kind of between two controls one is uh the life unit of sector two which is uh controlling uh directed by survival whereas the sector 3 unit is controlling directed by ethical Behavior or good behavior sector three is always good sector three is always right uh sector 3 communicates with us through various means such as Revelation and intuition but it also um requires us to be able to translate those messages and that&#x27;s where we fall into mistakes because we&#x27;re not quite prepared to take those messages and understand them properly that comes over time and with practice okay now uh we are here in the middle of chapter 23 religion re-examined and he&#x27;s uh you know talking about science and religion and so he just the last uh paragraph he was saying that the heresies for which men are imprisoned or executed in one era often become perfectly respectable of beliefs respectable beliefs a few centuries later the scientists cannot be expected to accept the transient and questionable items that make up such a large part of religious Doctrine in his own field his aim is to accumulate a store of knowledge that is valid for all time and he sets up some exacting requirements that must be met before any proposed addition to this accumulated knowledge is admitted religious doctrines are fully acceptable to him only if they are capable of meeting the same requirements or other equally rigid criteria of validity those items that cannot stand up under critical scrutiny or conf or conflict with established knowledge in any field must be rejected but neither science nor religion can arrive at a definite and unequivocal decision on every issue as matters now stand in both the religious and the scientific Fields therefore many doctrines or theories are accepted on a tentative basis pending further clarification much of the religious Dogma that the scientist is somewhat reluctant to accept falls into this category since all that can be reasonably expected of him is that he accept these unproven ideas on a provisional basis just as he might accept a somewhat questionable scientific theory as a working hypothesis in spite of a belief that it will ultimately be replaced by something better they should not constitute a serious obstacle to his participation in a religious Association of some kind of course if the requirements of a particular religious group in this respect are unreasonable the situation is different for example the scientists cannot accept the word of authority in lieu of the standard proofs of validity and hence he cannot in his capacity as a scientist adhere to any organized religion in which submission to the authority of the ecclesiastical leadership is mandatory he can do so if he continues to follow the currently popular practice of leaving his scientific beliefs and practices behind him when he closes the door of his office or Laboratory but we are now considering the situation of the scientists uh or any other person who wants to eliminate this dichotomy and to govern all facets of his life by the same basic rules a scientist must reject any claim to the exclusive possession of the truth by any religion or Creed although he may legitimately conclude after examining uh the various beliefs that some one of them has a better perception of the truth than any other every major religion of the present day contains many elements that meet all of the requirements of validity in fact there is a basic framework of religious belief which is common to all furthermore the evidence indicating that the Earth is only one of a great many abodes of intelligent life in the physical universe is sufficient in itself to Brand all claims of exclusive knowledge or special privilege as presumptuous but there is no General agreement on details even after the scientifically unacceptable items are eliminated and we are down to the hardcore of the doctrines of the various religions there will still be major differences with respect to questions with which science is as yet unprepared to deal all of the religions claim to be right about these matters and any one of them could be so far as we are able to determine at present thus there is no obstacle that would prevent a scientist from becoming an adherent of any one of the modern religions or their constituent organizations providing that the governing rev regulations thereof are sufficiently flexible or liberal to permit him to disregard scientifically unacceptable items of Dogma in an earlier era it would have been difficult to find a Western religious organization with a necessary degree of flexibility some of the Eastern religions particularly the major Hindu sects have always taken the attitude that every religious view has some relevance to the truth and that none is perfect all are therefore entitled to respect and sympathetic consideration even though by accepting certain features of his own religion as authoritative one automatically rejects the specific doctrines that are in direct conflict thus there is no problem here for the Hindu scientists but for most of the readers of this work the poignant issue will be the justification for affiliation with a religion such as Christianity which until recently has taken a rigid stand on the question of the validity of its doctrines there has been little or no real relaxation of the official attitudes of many of the western religious organizations thus far and the governing bodies still take just as hard a line on the question of deviation from their theological positions as they did in past centuries even though these positions have changed significantly in the meantime but the membership at large no longer responds automatically to the directives of the leadership and even the most authoritarian religious institutions have to recognize that there is now a considerable degree of de facto flexibility in the tenets of their respective Creeds regardless of the official pronouncements to the contrary indeed the differences in Viewpoint within a particular denomination of one of the uh of one of the major religions are now usually greater than those between denominations uh and now he&#x27;s looking at uh Theologian here who um says a striking development of our century is that the theory theoretical difference is no longer follow denominational lines in a particular denomination we may be somewhat more likely to find a particular type of theology but in every case there are exceptions while this relaxed back to Larson while this relaxation of the earlier theological rigidity has been going on uh the individual members of the religious organizations have been growing increasingly impatient with what they regard as theological hair splitting and are more and more inclined to dismiss theological issues as inconsequential this is particularly true among Mainline Protestant denominations uh one uh Theologian says individuals and families shift their allegiance from one Protestant denomination to another as casually as they switch brands of toothpaste today if a pastor refers to our denominational Heritage he can reasonably be reasonably sure that one-fourth of the congregation won&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about and another fourth won&#x27;t care okay back to Larson where the theological and organizational differences are greater as between Catholic and Protestant or between Christian and Jewish religions The Interchange is not as casual but even so there is an increasing amount of switching from one affiliation to another uh for other than doctrinal reasons mainly Interfaith marriages which are becoming more common as the isolation of various religions religious groups continues to break down under the influence of modern living conditions because of their vested interest in the prosperity of their individual organizations the ecclesiastical authorities generally view with alarm the loss of members by reason of marriage to individuals of other faiths and are inclined to predict emotional disturbances and other damaging consequences the available evidence seems to indicate however that these gloomy views are unjustified uh any quotes uh one priest by far the largest number of those who have disidentified from the Roman Catholic Church have done so in association with religiously mixed marriages they are happily married devoutly practicing members of Protestant denominations they may have gone through a crisis of in institutional affiliation but they do not seem to have suffered any acute crisis of religious convictions all of the following tends to show that while basic religious convictions beliefs about the assertions of religion in general are the products of an intuitive understanding that is deeply embedded in human nature and extremely resistant to change each individual&#x27;s commitment to the doctrines of a particular religious organization is essentially accidental and not a crucial factor in his life the religious fervor that manifests itself in Holy Wars and bitter antagonism between neighboring groups of different faiths is mainly a matter of group solidarity rather than of intellectual or emotional attachment to specific religious doctrines one historian points out that most of the factors responsible for the uh present distribution of the higher religious uh religions are non-religious quoting they derive from physical geography or from technology or from politics or war or economics not from religion back to Larson recognition by the individual that his present religious affiliation is due to the accident of being born in a particular place and under particular social and economic conditions should make it easier for him to change that affiliation if this is necessary to harmonize his religious commitments with his intellectual convictions to The Devout adherent of any particular Faith this suggestion that one&#x27;s religious affiliation should be changed if necessary in order to achieve Harmony between intellect and intuition will no doubt appear as an utterly reprehensible attempt to subordinate religion to science an effort to force religion into a scientific mold but in fact the point that is being made is that a person&#x27;s religious commitments uh that is what he is required to ascend at to as a condition of affiliation with a specific religious organization should be consistent with his religious beliefs regardless of how those beliefs have originated a scientist can accept what he now knows to be true and anything further that he believes is true and he can tentatively accept that which may be true but being dedicated to the truth he must reject that which is demonstrably false even if this requires changing his religious affiliation on this basis it should not be difficult for a scientist to find a religious organization with which he can feel at home and certainly these religious groups would benefit by the acquisition of new members who are fully convinced of the validity of the most important doctrines of the organization and the strength of their own reasoning powers without having to rely on a rather uncertain faith this is especially true in the present when so many of the church members um who have been the most active in church Affairs have lost confidence not only in items belonging in the category of additions and interpretations but also in certain of the basic doctrines of their Church an ironic side light is that some of the doctrinal assertions that have been under Fire and are now being rejected by substantial percentage of the religious leaders have been confirmed by scientific investigation by the scientific investigation reported in these pages okay that&#x27;ll do it for today we&#x27;ll be taking over the discussion tomorrow have a great day</p>
