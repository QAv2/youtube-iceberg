            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>The year is 1915. World War I rages on.  Ford manufactures its millionth Model T, and  Einstein formulates general relativity. This  changed gravity from a force to the curvature  of a certain structure called spacetime, spurring </p>
<p>a surge of interest and research into gravity  and its effects. However, what  most people don&#x27;t know is that  this enthusiasm for relativity began to  wane shortly after this 1915 breakthrough.   The transition from a decades-long season of inactivity to the so-called renaissance   of general relativity is a tapestry woven</p>
<p>from the threads of political intrigue, changing   scientific norms, and a tale of two wealthy investors&#x27; obsession with antigravity that   changed the course of physics, the effects of which, much like spacetime itself,   are still rippling to this day. My name&#x27;s  Curt Jaimungal, and on this channel,  we explore theories of everything, </p>
<p>primarily in podcast form from a theoretical   physics  perspective, but today we  have something different. Hold on,   because this is a tale of secrecy, flying saucers, and some of the biggest   names in physics. This rabbit hole goes deep. </p>
<p>In the period following World War II, a shift  took place in the way physics was researched,  in particular regarding the then-nascent field  of quantum gravity. The study  of quantum gravity, a now-trendy  subject at the intersection of quantum field  theory and general relativity, was not a popular  choice among physicists at the time.</p>
<p>Other  areas, such as the behavior of particles  like quarks and gluons, held a more central  place in theoretical physics discourse. This   remained mainstream even until the 1980s, where physicist Marie Gell-Mann underscored   this by exclusion.</p>
<p>Gell-Mann,  in a famous talk, outlined four  problems in physics. Number one,  why is there chirality? Number two,   why are there three families? Number  three, how many sets of Higgs bosons  are there? And lastly, why </p>
<p>is it this particular group  instead of some other simple or semi-simple  one? Notice the conspicuous absence of quantum  gravity as one of the most important unresolved  problems, according at least to one of the  leading physicists of the day. Now,  there are two major players in this   story.</p>
<p>The first is Roger Babson. Born into  a merchant family in 1875 Massachusetts,  Roger Babson was a businessman and a  writer. In fact, Babson was a highly   successful businessman  and the </p>
<p>founder of Babson College as well   as Babson Statistical Organization. His  company pioneered financial forecasting  and investment analysis, earning him  pedigree in the business world. For   reasons that will become clear in a moment,</p>
<p>Babson had a morbid fascination with gravity   and in particular, anti-gravity. The second  player in this story is Agnew Bahnson,  an industrialist born in North Carolina in  1915. Having grown his family&#x27;s air conditioning  business into a thriving aeronautical equipment </p>
<p>company, Agnew wasn&#x27;t a physicist but developed  an interest in gravitational physics later in  life. Like Roger, he was intrigued by the concept  of anti-gravity and its potential applications.  Roger Babson and Agnew Bahnson leveraged their  wealth to influence the course of  gravitational physics.</p>
<p>Notice that I   keep saying gravitational physics and not say general relativity.   The reason is that Roger and Agnew, at least embryonically, were interested in modifications   to Newton&#x27;s laws as well as other accounts of gravity that weren&#x27;t relegated to Einstein&#x27;s   formulation. For instance, </p>
<p>Roger took the principle of  action slash reaction from Newton&#x27;s third  law as primary, even metaphysically relating  it to consciousness, which as you could imagine,  along with their interest in anti-gravity,  made most researchers disinclined to associate  with them in the early stages. Babson   unfortunately lost his older sister</p>
<p>and grandson to drowning,   which he attributed to gravity. Thus,  his interest in this force wasn&#x27;t mere  curiosity, but rather a vendetta. Now  why did he ascribe the fault of drowning  to gravity rather than to the myriad other </p>
<p>potential contributors like H2O, the seizing  up of muscles, or even the harmonic  oscillator? I don&#x27;t know. However,   we&#x27;re lucky that he chose gravity as a target given that you and I are interested   in this subject, and directly because of his vengeance, there&#x27;s now a profusion of work   that we can research and showcase in podcast</p>
<p>form on this channel, all the way from loop   quantum gravity to string  theory to even alternative    approaches to deriving general relativity  from what doesn&#x27;t look like spacetime, such  as Wolfram&#x27;s approach and others. Babson  firmly believed that conquering gravity  had the potential to revolutionize human life, </p>
<p>just as electricity had done some decades  earlier. While Roger&#x27;s impetus  into grand unified theories  was personal loss, as far as I can tell, Agnew&#x27;s  was intellectual curiosity, much like you  and myself. In 1948, Babson </p>
<p>established what&#x27;s called  the Gravity Research Foundation.  This is important to this   story and is a continuing  thread in the  development of modern theories of gravity.   Babson&#x27;s friend, Thomas Edison, apparently suggested the creation of the Gravity Research   Foundation to Babson as a way to encourage and support scientific research related to   gravity, focusing on developing practical</p>
<p>technologies to control gravity, in other   words anti-gravity. In the year of Einstein&#x27;s  death, 1955, Agnew  Bahnson, on the other hand,   initiated the Institute for Field  Physics at the University of North  Carolina. Both Agnew&#x27;s </p>
<p>institute and Roger&#x27;s foundation  were hubs that attracted leading scientists  from around the world to discuss problems  related to gravitation and ultimately  unified field theories. Note that   there are two separate organizations that were initially independent, the Gravity   Research Foundation and the Institute for</p>
<p>Field Physics. There&#x27;s usually   a large point of confusion here, and it&#x27;s worth pointing out so   that we&#x27;re not befuddled, because the names of the patrons involved also sound similar,   so I&#x27;ll try to enunciate when I can.  There&#x27;s Roger Babson, and then there&#x27;s Agnew  Bahnson.</p>
<p>Rather than using  their last names, I&#x27;ll attempt  to use their first to avoid ambiguity.  Their involvement wasn&#x27;t just about giving  out funds to universities. Both  gentlemen played an active role in the  research, and their financial resources allowed </p>
<p>certain universities to focus on these subjects,  a subject which at the time was  considered unfruitful and even fringe.   So why did private individuals need to come in to fund research into gravitational physics?   Why wasn&#x27;t this being studied by academia much after the 1920s? A combination   of world events and shifting academic furor to the quantum   world.</p>
<p>The atomic bomb&#x27;s success, if we can even call it that, had nations investing heavily   into atomic and subatomic physics. The  private patronage of Roger and Agnew was  unprecedented in physics. Remember this is the </p>
<p>1950s. Most of the time, when you wanted something  funded academically, you sourced it from  tuition or the government directly. Sure   there were donations here and there, but they didn&#x27;t prescribe specific   research directions generally speaking. </p>
<p>Roger Babson and Agnew Bahnson are seminal  in that regard. In fact, they meticulously  selected the researchers  and institutions to   fund, focusing on those that shared  their interest in gravitational  physics along with other idiosyncratic qualities  like radial distance from a major city sufficient  enough to evade fallout from a nuclear </p>
<p>bomb. Hey, this was the Cold War after   all. Each of these organizations were involved in manifold activities including theoretical   studies, experimental design and setup, data analysis, and even scientific communication.   This latter point is especially the case with</p>
<p>the Gravity Research Foundation&#x27;s Essay Contest.   This is an annually organized essay competition open to physicists around the world.   These essays actually continue on to this day and play a crucial role in this story. The   winners of this contest were awarded cash prizes and a degree of prestige in the   scientific community.</p>
<p>At least  that was the intention, though it  didn&#x27;t work out like that originally  and we&#x27;ll talk more about that later.   In other words, the story of post-war physics is often framed as this surge in federal spending   on research, namely defense-related agencies.  However, Babson and Bahnson changed that.</p>
<p>Their   private funding induced research from outside the government. In particular,   it did so for gravitational studies, which was actually by necessity   since quote-unquote gravity didn&#x27;t align with the government&#x27;s particle physics-dominated focus.   This is a theme Noam Chomsky talks about in</p>
<p>Manufacturing Consent. We tend to think   that academics just pursue what they&#x27;re interested in,   motivated purely by the love of truth and science.  However, professors are just like anyone else  and they need and want payment and prestige.  Thus, wherever the grants go, the research  follows.</p>
<p>The contest attracted  a variety of participants,  some of whom were already eminent in their  field, while others were yet to make their  mark. Notable participants  and even winners include  Cecile and Bryce DeWitt, Stanley Desser and </p>
<p>Richard Arnowit, Philip Morrison and Thomas  Gold, John Wheeler, Maurice Alais, Stephen  Hawking, Ilya Prigogine, and Roger Penrose.   We&#x27;ll get into each of these individuals, as well as their research, later. Cecile   and Bryce DeWitt play a pivotal role here, as they helped legitimize the   Gravity Research Foundation.</p>
<p>Most intellectuals  don&#x27;t want to associate  with something if they   perceive other intellectuals  distancing themselves from it.   However, someone needed to be there at the inception of burgeoning fields. In this case,   it was the DeWitts.</p>
<p>The physics  enthusiasts among us know about  Bryce DeWitt through the Wheeler-DeWitt equation,  as well as because he was the popularizer  of Everett&#x27;s Many Worlds interpretation. Some  of you may even recognize the name DeWitt  from Bioshock Infinite, as the </p>
<p>inspiration for the quantum mechanical   explosion of multiverses  and time  travel was indeed DeWitt&#x27;s research.   Cecile and her husband Bryce spent their academic life aiming to unify all interactions, akin to   Einstein, though they had more of a quantum algebraic approach compared to Einstein&#x27;s   classical geometric one. What you </p>
<p>may not know is that Bryce DeWitt&#x27;s  work gained considerable traction thanks to  the resources and platform afforded to him  by the Gravity Research Foundation. Topics  explored in these contests ranged from  the relationship between magnetism and gravity,  with some participants even echoing thoughts  attributed to Nikola Tesla, while some others, </p>
<p>including Oppenheimer, a physicist known for  his role in the Manhattan Project, explored  the cosmological implications for general  relativity and the nature of singularities.  The notion that progress in the disjoint fields  of particle physics and gravity could be achieved  through a union of them was further reinforced  by the victorious submission the following year.  This time it was penned by two postdoctoral  researchers at the Institute for Advanced </p>
<p>Study, namely Arnowit and Desser, both of  whom were protégés of Julian Schwinger at  Harvard. You may recognize their name as the AD in  the ADM decomposition. However, their paper  was a ruse.</p>
<p>It was submitted for fun and was   nonsense. This apparently upset Oppenheimer.  Desser apologized to Oppenheimer, stating  the sin of the entry was to win when it  was only meant to entertain. Nevertheless,   the paper&#x27;s concept that gravity  could be transformed into nuclear energy was </p>
<p>lauded by the less informed, and eventually  it caught the attention of  military and industrial sources... If you enjoyed this TOE Clipping,  then the full video is linked in the description. You should also sign up for TOEmail,  which is again in the description  and the pinned comment.  You&#x27;ll receive immediate </p>
<p>access to all exclusive updates  from the Theories of Everything podcast. It also helps me communicate directly  with the core TOE community. You&#x27;ll also receive my top 10 TOEs.  Think of it as the intellectual version of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s obsession.</p>
