            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Well, hello fellow UAP truth seekers. Ross Kulart here doing a quick commentary for this YouTube channel. I want to talk about David Grush&#x27;s interview with Megan Kelly, which was frankly momentous. It&#x27;s one of the first times that David&#x27;s put his head up in the last couple of years since he first spoke to me in June 2023. And what he said was taking on directly one of the people who appeared in the age of disclosure movie, General James Clapper, a fellow air force officer of David Grushes, no less.</p>
<p>Uh Clapper of course was a lieutenant general in the US Air Force and he went on to become the director of national intelligence, the guy who coordinated all of America&#x27;s intelligence organizations. an incredibly important oversight role. And it&#x27;s interesting because one of the big questions has always been in the age of disclosure movie, how much do these people know? How much did Clapper know? It was significant and it was very important that James Clapper appeared in the film, but he kind of gave a bit of an equivocatory Billy M comment admitting that there was a program that had been tracking UAPs. It was a bit of a blurrh moment. I didn&#x27;t really care about it that much.</p>
<p>But what was very very interesting was what David Grush is revealing. He has revealed that General James Clapper, the former DNI, he not only rose to the ranks as a three-star US Air Force general and that he David said quote that&#x27;s all he that&#x27;s Clapper said in the documentary that that was a program that he was aware of that there was this program that was monitoring UAPs. And then you could see David clearly made a decision to say a little bit more. And he went on to say, quote, &quot;In fact, without being inappropriate, I will say that General Clapper was well aware of the crash retrieval issue, managed the crash retrieval issue, and when he was the DNI director, he placed people in critical roles to manage this issue, both publicly and I&#x27;ll just say nonpublicly as well. not quite sure what that means and I&#x27;ll allow the audience to distill what I&#x27;m saying at the risk of being inappropriate or going too far with my discussion.</p>
<p>So, General Clapper, Stephanie O&#x27;Sullivan, other folks in the intelligence community that are well aware of this issue that were in rooms discussing this issue, I ask you to be greater leaders on this. I should not, says David Grush, be the only former military officer and intelligence official that is being completely candid with the information that they were exposed to. So perhaps, and once again, James Clapper understates what he knows and what he&#x27;s done, not wittingly. It is a very very important admission by David to say that General James Clapper who was the director of national intelligence managed the retrieval program. It does make you wonder how many other people with intelligence community links like James Clapper, who&#x27;ve taken a high-profile role in UAP advocacy and disclosure commentary, in fact have a secret past inside the legacy program.</p>
<p>Are there people who aren&#x27;t letting on on how much they know? Yes, there are. And the simple problem with them being able to reveal what they know is the constraints of their national security oath. Watch this space. There&#x27;s going to be more about this coming in 2026. Things are about to get very interesting.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s extremely significant that David Grush has called out former US Air Force Lieutenant General James Clapper for not revealing all he knows about the crash retrieval program. Because says David Grush, he managed it. Think about that.</p>
