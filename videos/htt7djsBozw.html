            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Former President Barack Obama Caroline was recently asked if aliens are real. He says they&#x27;re real, but he hasn&#x27;t seen them. President&#x27;s daughter-in-law Laura Trump told Morirana Divine of the New York Post that the president has a prepared speech on this issue that he prepares to deliver at the right time. Is that true? And [laughter] does the Trump administration believe aliens are real? &gt;&gt; Well, a speech on aliens would be news to me. That sounds very exciting, though.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll have to check in with our speech writing team. Uh, and that would be of great interest to me personally and I&#x27;m sure all of you in this room and apparently former President Obama, too. So, we&#x27;ll keep you posted on that. &gt;&gt; Tyler, Caroline, the White House has touted uh an unprecedented amount of cooperation with counties in Minneapolis after uh the negotiations with Tom Hman. Are those written or verbal deals with the sheriff? Um, how many have agreed to cooperate on immigration enforcement who previously refused to do so? &gt;&gt; Yeah, the last time I spoke with Mr.</p>
<p>Hman, which was just a few days ago, he assured us uh that nearly every single county in the state of Minnesota has agreed uh to notify ICE when they are releasing criminal illegal aliens from their jails. This is an unprecedented level of cooperation that we have not seen. Uh it has led to not only cooperation uh to detain illegal aliens in Minnesota, uh which just this past week, I have looked at the list, they&#x27;ve detained some very heinous people who none of you would want living in your communities. uh but has also led to a much more calm situation on the ground. We&#x27;ve also seen and you&#x27;ve seen this with your own eyes play out.</p>
<p>Uh the local police and the state police have now cooperated in the arrests of left-wing agitators and criminals who are unlawfully obstructing immigration enforcement in their efforts. So this is a huge win. Uh and again the president sent Mr. Hman to Minnesota to uh do a job and he has done it well and I think the situation on the ground proves that. written are those like written agreements that they&#x27;ve been signed by various officials in the state.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; These are agreements that have been made by state and local officials uh in the federal government and we are seeing that cooperation play out every single day. Uh these counties are notifying ICE when they are releasing criminal illegals from their jail and we do know that they are arresting left-wing agitators who are impe unlawfully impeding law enforcement. There&#x27;s video to show that them show it yourself. You can view it with your own eyes. Height search.</p>
