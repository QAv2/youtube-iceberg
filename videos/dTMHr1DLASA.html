            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>So, David Grush has been at the center of a lot of talk within the UAP community over the past few days and it&#x27;s got quite intense. So, you may remember David Grush obviously back in 2023 came forward on NewsNation to Ross Colart to talk about what he know with regards to UAPs, NHI, and pretty much everything UFO and alien, right? And that interview absolutely blew up and it really did trailblaze the way for a lot of things with the UAP hearings because of course the first congressional hearing took place with David Grush at the helm of it and kind of you know testifying to Congress under oath and that of course has spanned to many other UAP congressional hearings taking place in across the past couple of years. But there&#x27;s been a lot of controversy surrounding David Grush, especially with some significant disinformation campaigns against him with um some firearms being faced up against him and a lot of other stuff that&#x27;s been dragged up. Let&#x27;s get into the nitty-gritty of it. So obviously we all know David Grush as the US former US Air Force Intelligence Officer and combat veteran who served with National Geospatial Intelligence Agency otherwise known as the NGA, excuse me, and the R NRO, sorry, from 2019 to 2021.</p>
<p>He represented the NRO on the Pentagon&#x27;s unidentified aerial phenomena task force and the official term for what were once called UFOs, of course, now are UAPs. In 2023, of course, Grush went public as a whistleblower, alleging under oath before Congress that the US government operates a secret program to retrieve and reverse engineer nonhuman craft and biologics, for example, human bodies, which is actually hidden from the oversight committee. and he claimed these efforts were traced back to world the World War II era um secrecy models like the Manhattan project involving compartmentalization, private contractors like Loheed Martin and black budgets. So obviously those claims were pretty bombshell and ever since he did that and that congressional hearing he kind of just went really quiet. He went to the wayside.</p>
<p>He popped up on Joe Rogan, of course, but then after that, no one really heard too much from him. He just kind of fell to the shadows a little bit. Now, moving on from that, there&#x27;s been some significant developments, especially as of today, October 27th, 2025. So, Gush&#x27;s story has evolved into a mix of legislative progresses, personal threats, and community backlash. Like I say, he largely stayed out of the public eye since 2023, but continues advising behind the scenes.</p>
<p>So let&#x27;s talk about what&#x27;s been going on kind of with regards to the the the key timelines of events. So March 2025, he was actually hired by representative Berles to provide classified details to Congress and work as a UAP kind of advisor for Berles. By April 2025, NewsNation interview recirculated which warns of non-friendly NHI. By June 2025, uh, he sued the Virginia Sheriff&#x27;s Office over alleged medical leaks for a $2.5 million claim, which he actually lost, I believe. By September of 2025, he testified directly via hearings on nuclear UAP incursions, which we saw uh from images that circulated online.</p>
<p>And by October of 2025, there was a firearm threat reported and the community disinformation escalated. and Berles has announced suboners or subpoenas, sorry, for the people involved. That kind of gives you a bit of a a rundown on the entire David Gush situation thus far. But it does not stop there, ladies and gentlemen, as it just progresses even further. So, we kind of knew that someone brandished a weapon on David Grush as he was on his way to the skiff to be to speak to Berles, Anapolina Luna, and I think it was representative um uh Burchett.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure those were the people that were involved. Now, um Representative Luna has come forward to talk about a few more details with regards and share a bit more information with regards to that alleged incident. We have had an instance that happened with David Gush to where he was coming in to testify um or not to testify but coming in to do a video skiff conference with Berles and I and on the way in he had a very weird incident that happened that I&#x27;ve never you know it&#x27;s like very coincidental timing um where someone actually pulled a firearm on him as he was driving in. So and he also too was worried about um retribution. he had been messed with extensively after he testified um even leading up to that testimony.</p>
<p>So yeah, we definitely know that our witnesses are putting a lot on the line by coming forward and so that would also too push for like we need UAP disclosure, but every time we try to put it into the NDIA, it gets gutted. &gt;&gt; Now the the things that she&#x27;s talking about with regards to issues, right, is basically his medical records were just leaked online, which of course is a big no no. That that should never have happened. But to cut a long story short, the medical records controversy. So in June of 2025, of course, Crush sued the London County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in Virginia for $2.5 million, alleging that they illegally leaked his information um military medical records post 2023 testimony to try and discredit him.</p>
<p>The suit claims that the retaliation was for his whistleblowing trying to broader harassment. Luna condemned the leak online and in October 2025 as unacceptable from a government agency, though skeptics like Steven Greenreet, for example, argue that it stemmed from an a Freedom of Information Act release law enforcement file, not the direct medical leak uh revealing his mental health history. So obviously that was used to try and discredit him at the time. Now, obviously, there was Representative Luna kind of talking a little bit more about it, but um she goes on a little bit more about the NDAA uh and talks about the congressional staffers operating on behalf of the intel community and removing UFO legislations. Take a listen to this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, we definitely know that our witnesses are putting a lot on the line by coming forward. And so, that would also too push for like we need UAP disclosure, but every time we try to put it into the NDIA, it gets gutted &gt;&gt; for whatever reason. By who? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s It&#x27;s usually the staff that&#x27;s taking it out. For whatever reason, these like little I call them little trouble goblins. They pop up and they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll gut the legislation for disclosure or &gt;&gt; who tells them to do that? &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s a lot with the intelligence community 100% or DoD, whoever&#x27;s It&#x27;s definitely internal though because there have been uh Representative Burchett tried to come up with an FA reporting procedure for the UAP.</p>
<p>They would have put it on on the on the floor and then the UAP disclosure act was watered down and gutted. Schumer tried to push for that in the Senate and it was like completely just rolled. So, there&#x27;s definitely an effort which is why I think that this UA um Age of Disclosure movie coming out is so important because you have multiple people coming forward that have legitimate credentials. They can&#x27;t just be like, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s, you know, Luna talking about crazy UAPs again or Burchett or Berles.&quot; It&#x27;s, you know, when you have this Secretary of State up there, a little bit hard to argue with. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So obviously the age of disclosure movie is going to be pretty significant for a lot of reasons. Now David Gres has also alleged that the origins of UFO cover up trace back to the same government and uh cooperate network a corporate network sorry that managed the Manhattan project during World War II. Now he expressed this in a later um interview and this is a little segment from that as well. certainly been uh private corporations involved uh you know both you know federally funded research and development centers and for-profit uh companies that have contracted with the US government over the years. Um like I&#x27;ve mentioned in other interviews um the US government overlaid the Manhattan project secrecy personnel um you know generally what elements were involved corporately and and governmentally in that too atomic energy commission which you know morphed into department of energy nuclear regulatory commission later uh and that is why you see in the what we call the Schumer amendment in the in the United States that hopefully will be signed here very shortly and maybe it&#x27;ll be signed by the time uh the conference happens uh where they they cite the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 um and other provisions within the unclassified Schumer amendment.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s because they understand that the secrecy justification ran along the lines of uh you know US nuclear secrets and that&#x27;s a whole other discussion for now and it&#x27;s and I I&#x27;ll mention that&#x27;s you&#x27;ll notice in the Schumer amendment they talk about transclassified foreign nuclear information TFNI in the Schumer amendment and that is not by accident because you can imagine um what that means is say The US through uh intelligence operations stole a foreign nuclear secret. Well, the US liked that foreign nuclear secret and wanted to make it their own. So, they transclassified it into a US protected nuclear capability. Um, and that&#x27;s what the Schumer amendment was trying to expouse. if you read in between the lines that uh the they&#x27;ve justified it through you know these nuclear secrecy provisions but yes certainly private companies were involved uh the specific ones I did provide uh the to the congressional committees and the inspector general down to uh specific facilities I am aware of you know down to the address right uh where where they exist and also I had the individuals that you know firsthand worked on the program um provide that uh disclosure and interview with the inspector general as well.</p>
<p>So it wasn&#x27;t just coming from me. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know what else to say other than what he&#x27;s already said. You know, there&#x27;s not much to really add there. But Ross Colart has also kind of got his hands and so is Annapoleina Luna on this discussion. And essentially what was also happened here was um well quite a lot of other stuff but um let&#x27;s have a little look at this.</p>
<p>So this is from Representative Luna. She responds to mic disclosure over on Twitter, other well now known as X, right? So the public service announcement, disinformation inside the UF community is real and dangerous. Uh Sam and Red Panda Koala are spreading false and defamatory claims that Lu Lzando ran a criminal enterprise that doxed David Grush&#x27;s medical records, forced him to go public, and hide Amy Escaridge&#x27;s death. Um, these accusations are malicious, contradictory, and legally actionable. Clear defamation per se, not free speech.</p>
<p>Their actions meet the threshold for cyber harassment and malicious defamation, including intentional infliction of reputational harm. Publication of fabricated false uh claims as fact, coordinated online abuse, targeting whistleblowers, online harassment, defamation by cyber bullying uh are not opinions. They are crimes that will be pursued to the fullest extent of the law, including civil action and criminal in uh enforcement. After being made aware, the source representative Analina Paulina Luna, sorry, uh retracted a retweet of the false narrative that clarified publicly that she has no knowledge of who doxed Mr. Grush, distancing herself from the disinformation network.</p>
<p>The UFO disclosure community must not be allowed to maliciously trolls uh to distort truth, endanger whistleblowers, or manipulate elected officials. Disinformation is being weaponized against real whistleblowers. The trolls behind it are now facing real legal consequences. Silence is not a weakness. It&#x27;s evidence that progress is being made behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Representative Luna is an example of that. Cyber harassment isn&#x27;t free speech. Every post, mention, and coordinated smear is being archive, traced, and preserved for as as legal evidence. Those engaged in targeted disinformation, stalking or organized trolling will face the full enforcement and of state and federal cy federal cyber crimes uh laws, including civil damages and criminal prosecution. All supporters of Sam and Josh and fake alternate accounts are subject to these actions.</p>
<p>Accountability is coming. The law will handle the rest. Anapolina Luna responded to this by stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what this is, but I was simply putting out my opinion referencing Grush being doxed.&quot; It should have never happened. To date, he has been very helpful and credible witness. He is a very brave man.</p>
<p>No one called me. No one made me aware of any source. I watched Tupac&#x27;s uh video, full video, and it was an important matter. I will always look at all opinions as facts before forming my own. I&#x27;m focusing on facts at hand and appreciate the work that many people have done.</p>
<p>Uh, however, it seems that I&#x27;m being pulled into an X fight and I&#x27;m not going to be drawn into that. So, I am simply clarifying here. So, that&#x27;s what Annapoleina Luna had to say with regards to that. Now, moving over to D uh sorry to Ross Kolhart. Now, of of course, Ross Kohar was the the reason that David Gres got kind of put into the the fold, got made quite a big deal if I&#x27;m perfectly honest within this.</p>
<p>Obviously, that initial um uh interview with David Grush was huge, monumental in fact. Um and he even states here that the Age of Disclosure, the documentary, could break the silence and David Grush&#x27;s TV interview. Ross reveals that David Grush has a TV interview coming up soon that has that David has been keen to get his viewpoint out there. Ross then goes on to discuss the age of disclosure and says that it might be the most important documentary in UAP history featuring Jay Stratton, Lu Alzando, Eric Davis, Hal Putoff, Chris Melon, Mark Rubio, David Fraver, and more. Right.</p>
<p>And this is where he talked about it on one of his latest episodes of the reality check. soon. Do you think it will move the needle for disclosure still after being delayed for a couple of years along with pretty high prices to buy on Amazon? Also, do you think that there&#x27;s a chance of David Crush&#x27;s oped ever coming out? Okay, there&#x27;s two questions there. Let me deal with the David Grush one first. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m giving anything away if I say I think there&#x27;s going to be a David Grush interview coming up soon, like a a TV interview.</p>
<p>Uh that&#x27;s to come. Let&#x27;s just wait and see what happens there. As for the op-ed, that&#x27;s up to the mainstream media organizations that appear to be doing their level best to try and suppress this story. Um, I certainly know David&#x27;s been very keen to get his viewpoint out there. Uh, hence the new interview.</p>
<p>um on the age of disclosure. Wow. My favorite quote from this is Jay Stratton, the former head of the UAP task force in the Pentagon. And he says, &quot;As a firstirhand witness,&quot; and it&#x27;s in the trailer. You would have seen it from the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>I have seen with my own eyes nonhuman craft and nonhuman beings. Doesn&#x27;t get any more definitive than that. For the life of me, I do not know why Congress hasn&#x27;t put Jay Stratton under oath in the public hearing or in a private hearing and deposed him to find out what he knows. I suspect he probably has given private evidence, but I&#x27;d love to see him in the public arena. Maybe the simple fact is that Congress is playing along with the attempts by the national security state to keep all this under wraps and a lot of what&#x27;s being done in Cong Congress is titled to try and amuse us pe people in the public arena to stop us from asking too many questions.</p>
<p>Um the age of disclosure is going to be a very very important documentary. It&#x27;s going to air both as a theatrical release but it&#x27;s also going to be aired I think on Netflix and that&#x27;s huge. It might be Amazon. Hang on. I&#x27;m not quite sure.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t quote me there. &gt;&gt; Amazon, &gt;&gt; but it&#x27;s Amazon. &gt;&gt; But it&#x27;s got Lzando, Jay Stratton, as I&#x27;ve just mentioned, Hal Putoff, Eric Davis. Now, Eric&#x27;s important because of course he&#x27;s the astrophysicist physicist who had the conversation with Admiral Tom Wilson, the former deputy DIA boss at the time, uh, who had basically uh had the problems trying to get access to the legacy program. and he set out allegedly in um detail to Dr.</p>
<p>Eric Davis what he knew about the legacy program and the retrieval program and the cover up and the attempts to reverse engineer. That&#x27;s that of course is a highly disputed memo. There&#x27;s another person by the way we could call call Dr. Davis and call Admiral Tom Wilson, put them under oath and see how they answer it. Marco Rubio is also appearing which is quite something.</p>
<p>I mean this is the right-hand man to the president. uh Marco Rubio, Secretary of State and also um national security director uh since the previous director left in ignity. Uh and he presumably has been briefed into the program, which is what I understand has happened relatively recently. There&#x27;s been a much broadening awareness amongst the Trump administration of just what it is that the Pentagon and intelligence community know about UAPs. The big issue now for all of us is what the Trump administration does with that.</p>
<p>Are they just going to roll over supinely and let the national security state tickle their tummy and say, &quot;Hey guys, we just need to keep this quiet because it&#x27;s our little secret and we&#x27;d be jeopardizing all manner of exciting and expensive projects that we have in defense that, you know, shouldn&#x27;t be revealed because the public doesn&#x27;t have a right to know about it. Or are we going to give the public their due and tell them what their money&#x27;s been being spent on for the last 60, 70 years?&quot; Um, one of the other people that&#x27;s featuring in the age of disclosure is James Clapper, the former DNI, director of national intelligence, and he says some pretty interesting things in the documentary. It&#x27;s quite significant to get a a former DNI speaking publicly. Chris Melon of course is appearing. Senator Mike RS is appearing.</p>
<p>Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. David Fraver the retired Navy pilot. Alex Dietrich as well. Ryan Graves. Admiral Tim Galedet.</p>
<p>Uh former CIA senior executive Jim Simmeran and Colonel retired Army Colonel Carl Nell. Um so this is a pretty heavyhitting documentary. Uh I&#x27;m excited. Uh I do think that um uh there are claims in this film that that haven&#x27;t been made before. I understand one of the claims is that Russia recovered an 80 foot long tic tac with bodies and directed energy weapons.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also claim of a Vatican cover up. Um there&#x27;s also expressed concerns about how Muchin the Treasury Secretary was um briefed on economic fallout and the claim is made that the CIA and the Department of Energy have run the crash retrieval program since 1947 post Roswell that the UAPs have indeed disabled nukes that there&#x27;s been technological risks weaponization and justify the the secrecy of the so-called but they demand the release of this information for the purposes of obtaining clean energy and u solving climate problems. Um I I do think it is disclosure on steroids. It&#x27;s potentially a hugely significant mainstream film that will reach an audience that to date has not yet engaged with this subject. And I commend Lou Alzando and Dan Farah who are the joint executive producers who have produced this film.</p>
<p>Um, it&#x27;s great to finally see it getting to air and I sincerely hope it has the effect that it should have. Sadly, I&#x27;m not holding my breath because you&#x27;re seeing already counter articles appearing in stool debunker newspapers like the the Wall Street Journal. Dear old Joel Shipman, cutting out the usual tired old lines and doing his level best to try and anticipate the release of this kind of film to try and play down in the public mind that there&#x27;s anything to this UAP subject. Why on earth do journalists allow themselves to be so produced and manipulated by the national security state? Our job is to poke a greasy finger in the eyes of power and cause as much mischief as possible to tease and question power, not to be supplicant lick spittles. Enough said.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It sounded like Boris Johnson trying to offend someone there. It was quite uh it was quite interesting. But obviously, you know, the key details in there talking about David Gush having a brand new uh interview coming out soon where he airs his side of the story and everything else that&#x27;s gone on. Of course, we&#x27;ve got everything else that he spoke about within uh the Age of Disclosure movie. Will it move the needle? That&#x27;s yet to be seen, but it will be very, very intriguing to see the way that things progress with regards to this.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you guys think? Obviously, there&#x27;s a lot of information there. Big info dump on David Grush especially. Um, but there&#x27;s a lot to cover and kind of unpack here. Let me know what you guys think about this down in the comments below. While you&#x27;re down there, jump scare the hell out of that like button and subscribe.</p>
<p>And until next time, I&#x27;ll speak to you later.</p>
