            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>okay so let&#x27;s talk about this Congressional meeting some of the the takeaways so one of the things uh that David grou claimed is the government is absolutely in possession of uaps he said he&#x27;s absolutely certain of this and uh he cites interviews he has conducted with 40 different Witnesses Over a four-year period uh he said that he led defense department uh efforts to analyze report U sightings and was informed of a multi-decade pentagon program that endeavored to collect and reconstruct crash uaps um when uh representative uh moscowitz asked him about this in terms of how it was funded he claims that it it was an effort above congressional oversight and bankroll by misappropriation of funds correct that&#x27;s how it all mosow was asked does this mean that there is money in the budget that is set to go to a program uh but it doesn&#x27;t and it goes to something else he said yes I have specific knowledge of that yep yes I mean course now remember a lot of what grush found was in part based on what we had been providing his superiors so I&#x27;ve been working with for example the lead investigators who who managed the black budget and the uh agencies the three-letter agencies for AR armed services and Intel for quite some time and So based on that information he was able to confirm in fact that&#x27;s true so think the audience needs to understand there&#x27;s a legal black budget in other words very few people are read into it in Congress and very few people at the presidential intelligence level would know and those were legal I&#x27;m talking about projects like he was referring to that is basically a misappropriation and often embezzlement of funds from the budget that go into unsanctioned and unapproved programs so that&#x27;s let&#x27;s call that the illegal black budget and the illegal black budget is the big one because that&#x27;s how you&#x27;re building these man-made uaps and uh you know if you look at it you know it&#x27;s a very simple I&#x27;ll give people an analogy and bring this down to earth let&#x27;s say that the the government we the people are being build $2 billion a copy for the B2 stealth bomber in reality it probably costs around 150 million a copy the other 1.8 or so billion goes through the back door onto unsanctioned and unapproved projects and so we have done a very careful analysis of this and there are many departments and agencies in the government that have in fact uh had money uh is frankly embezzlement without the knowledge and approval of the Congress or the White House to go into these illegal projects so one of the big problems that the Congress is not quite got its mind around is that all these operations dealing with uaps have been run uncon constitutionally and illegally since about 1957 to 1960</p>
