            <p>if you&#x27;re not ready for a mind then keep scrolling because it&#x27;s about to get a little bit out there there&#x27;s this theory in quantum physics that says we might all actually be immortal hear me out you know Schrodinger&#x27;s cat where there is a cat in the box with a vat of poison and until someone opens the box the cat is both alive and dead in a state of quantum superposition well in 1957 H Everett proposed the many worlds interpretation where in this case once you open the box there&#x27;s a timeline where the cat lives and a timeline where the cat dies but they don&#x27;t split until the Box is open this would mean there is an infinite amount of realities br in off every single day into a Multiverse and then there&#x27;s you have you ever walked down the street and felt like you almost got hit by a car well Quantum immortality says that there&#x27;s a good chance in one timeline you did but every time you get knocked off your Consciousness immediately travels into a timeline where you didn&#x27;t this continues on and on for Infinity with your conscious mind always finding a way into a timeline where you made it</p>
