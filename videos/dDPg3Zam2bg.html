            <p>Where do these things seem to show up? And beyond, you know, somebody seeing it, you know, on a farm or when they&#x27;re in the car, you know, there&#x27;s they show up apparently a lot around nuclear sites. Some of the most famous incidents, of course, are around our nuclear aircraft carriers. There are these famous incidents about them showing up over nuclear missile silos where they shut them all down in the US and they just say, &quot;Look at what we can do. We&#x27;re going to shut all your stuff down.&quot; or they show up in the the former Soviet Union and they turn the missiles on and start the countdown. That&#x27;s a famous very famous story there around that.</p>
<p>When you see these kinds of things, maybe the answer is, and this is what I call the angry monkey hypothesis, is that maybe they&#x27;re showing up and because they&#x27;re now worried what the angry monkeys can do because now the angry monkeys can make nuclear weapons and despite how powerful and futuristic they might be, they still can&#x27;t stop a nuclear bomb. So maybe if we are about to flower out into the local galactic arm sometime in the next thousand or 10,000 years, just again by conventional means, maybe the neighbors want to know what the angry monkeys are up to.</p>
