            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>The Central Intelligence Agency was born from failure. The ashes of Pearl Harbor created a new reality for the United States. The nation had been caught completely by surprise. Its intelligence capabilities were scattered and ineffective. President Harry S.</p>
<p>Truman saw a dangerous void. He knew America could no longer afford to be blind to the world&#x27;s threats. The old ways of gathering information were not enough for the new world that was emerging. A new kind of organization was needed, one that could operate in the shadows, beyond the view of America&#x27;s enemies. This was the seed from which the CIA would grow.</p>
<p>The National Security Act of 1947 was the formal instrument of its creation. This landmark piece of legislation reshaped the entire American national security apparatus. It created the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. And most critically, it established the Central Intelligence Agency. Its mandate was clear yet broad.</p>
<p>The CIA was to advise the president on intelligence matters. It was to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to national security. But a small, seemingly innocuous clause gave it another power. The agency was authorized to perform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security Council may from time to time direct. This was the secret door.</p>
<p>This vague and powerful clause became the legal foundation for covert action. It was the justification for secret wars and political interventions that would define the next 75 years of American foreign policy. The CIA was not just meant to be a group of analysts reading reports in Washington. It was designed to be a weapon, a tool the president could use to shape events around the globe without leaving American fingerprints. This mission required something more than just clever spies and analysts.</p>
<p>It required a steady, untraceable flow of money to fund its clandestine activities. A budget that existed outside the normal lines of public accountability and scrutiny was essential. From its very first days, the agency understood that secrecy was its most vital currency. To operate effectively in the shadows, its funding had to be equally shadowy. Public debate over specific operations was impossible.</p>
<p>Congressional oversight in the traditional sense would compromise every mission before it began. Therefore, the concept of a hidden or black budget was not an afterthought. It was a foundational requirement. The ability to spend money without public knowledge was woven into the very fabric of the CIA&#x27;s existence. The creation of the CIA&#x27;s black budget is a masterclass in bureaucratic camouflage.</p>
<p>The money does not appear out of thin air. It is formally appropriated by the United States Congress following all constitutional requirements. The trick is how it is hidden. The funding for the CIA and other intelligence agencies is tucked away inside the massive annual budget of the Department of Defense. This is not a recent development.</p>
<p>It has been the standard procedure since the AY&#x27;s inception. The Pentagon&#x27;s budget is a labyrinth of programs and accounts totaling hundreds of billions of dollars, making it the perfect place to hide a few billion more for secret intelligence activities. The process begins within the executive branch. The CIA and other agencies in the intelligence community developed their budget proposals in secret. These proposals detail the funding they need for everything from paying spies, building satellites, running covert operations.</p>
<p>This classified request, known as the National Intelligence Program, is then reviewed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the White House. Once approved by the president, it is inserted into the Department of Defense budget request that is sent to Capitol Hill. It is not listed as CIA funding. Instead, it is disguised within vague oversized line items like procurement, research, and development. Only a very small number of members of Congress are actually privy to the details.</p>
<p>The full House and Senate never see the classified budget. Instead, the real oversight happens behind the closed doors of the House Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee, Defense Appropriations Subcommittees. In these secure rooms, the director of national intelligence and the CIA director testify and defend their secret spending plans. These committee members are sworn to secrecy. They can question the spending and even attempt to cut or shift funds, but they cannot discuss what they have learned with their colleagues or the public.</p>
<p>This creates an exclusive circle of knowledge within Congress. Once the intelligence committees approve the secret budget, it becomes part of the larger defense appropriations bill. This massive piece of legislation is then voted on by the full Congress. Most members who cast their vote have no precise idea how much money they are allocating to the CIA or for what specific purposes. They are in effect voting for a budget within a budget, trusting that the small committees have done their due diligence.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Cold War, the CIA&#x27;s black budget was the lifeblood of America&#x27;s shadow struggle against the Soviet Union. The world was a canvas and secret money was the paint. One of the first major uses of these hidden funds was to influence the 1948 Italian general election. The United States feared a communist victory that would bring a key Western European nation into the Soviet sphere of influence. The CIA was given millions of dollars, a fortune at the time, to prevent this.</p>
<p>The money was secretly funneled to center-right Christian Democrat politicians. It was used to publish forged articles smearing communist leaders. It funded a massive public relations campaign to sway Italian voters. This operation established a template for future interventions. The CIA&#x27;s black budget became a political slush fund on a global scale.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the agency used its secret money to prop up friendly leaders and undermine those it deemed hostile to American interests. Funds were used to support labor unions. Funds were used to support student groups. Funds were used to support cultural organizations. For example, the CIA secretly funded the Congress for Cultural Freedom.</p>
<p>The organization sponsored intellectual magazines. It also sponsored art exhibitions to promote Western democratic ideals and counter Soviet propaganda among intellectuals and artists. Many of the participants had no idea where the money was truly coming from. The black budget also financed more direct and forceful interventions. In 1953, the CIA orchestrated a coup in Iran to overthrow the democratically elected prime minister, Muhammad Mossade.</p>
<p>Mosadic had nationalized the Britishowned Anglo-Iranian oil company, alarming Western powers. With a relatively small amount of black budget money estimated to be under $1 million, CIA operative Kermit Roosevelt Jr. funded anti-mosatic propaganda. He bribed politicians and military officers. He hired street mobs to create chaos.</p>
<p>The coup successfully removed Mossade and restored the sha to absolute power, securing western oil interests, but planting seeds of resentment that would blossom decades later. Just one year later, in 1954, the agency repeated its success in Guatemala. The democratically elected president Yakobo Arbans had initiated land reforms that threatened the interests of the powerful American-owned United Fruit Company. The CIA under the code name Operation PB Success used its hidden funds to arm and train a small rebel force led by a Guatemalan exile. It ran a sophisticated psychological warfare campaign.</p>
<p>This included a clandestine radio station that broadcast propaganda and fake news to turn the military and the public against Arbans. Facing what he believed was a massive invasion, Arbins resigned, installing a right-wing military dictatorship that would rule for decades. These early operations proved the power of the black budget as a tool of foreign policy, one of the most audacious and expensive operations ever funded by the CIA&#x27;s black budget was project Azorian. In 1968, a Soviet Gulf 2class submarine, the K129, sank in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, taking with it its crew, nuclear armed ballistic missiles, a wealth of cryptographic secrets. The Soviet Navy searched frantically, but just couldn&#x27;t find the wreckage.</p>
<p>The United States, however, using its advanced underwater acoustic surveillance network, located the submarine at a depth of nearly 3 mi. The CIA saw an unparalleled intelligence opportunity to physically raise a portion of the submarine from the ocean floor. The technical challenges were immense, kind of like raising a skyscraper from the bottom of the Grand Canyon in total darkness. The cost of such an undertaking was staggering, estimated at around $800 million in 1970s. Yeah, that&#x27;s billions today.</p>
<p>This was far too much to hide in a typical budget. So to finance it, the CIA turned to an unlikely partner, the eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes. The agency concocted an elaborate cover story. Hughes would announce that his company was building a massive ship, the Glowar Explorer, for the purpose of deep sea mining of manganese nodules on the ocean floor. This public-f facing commercial enterprise provided the perfect justification for constructing a vessel with a giant internal claw, a massive derek, and a moonpool large enough to secretly lift and conceal a section of a Soviet submarine.</p>
<p>The project was a marvel of engineering and deception. The Glomar Explorer was built in plain sight, with the entire operation hidden behind the corporate veil of Hughes&#x27;s empire. The ship was equipped with a heavy lift system and a massive grappling claw, officially called the capture vehicle, designed to grab the targeted section of the submarine. For 6 years, the CIA and its contractors worked in absolute secrecy to design, build, and deploy this incredible piece of technology. The mission was a highstakes gamble.</p>
<p>If the Soviets discovered the true purpose of the Glomar Explorer, it could have triggered a major international crisis. The black budget provided the financial insulation needed to take such a monumental risk. In the summer of 1974, the Glowar Explorer arrived at the recovery site. The operation to lift the submarine began. Partway through the lift, though, the giant claw suffered a mechanical failure, and a large portion of the submarine section broke off and fell back to the ocean floor.</p>
<p>The crew was able to recover a smaller forward section which contained the bodies of several Soviet sailors and two nuclear torpedoes, but not the coveted code books or missile systems. Before the CIA could attempt a second recovery mission, the story was leaked to the press in 1975. The agency famously responded to journalist inquiries with the phrase, &quot;We can neither confirm nor deny.&quot; Project Aorian was a partial success, but honestly a total masterpiece of black budget financing and clandestine cover. The largest and longest covert action in the CIA&#x27;s history was Operation Cyclone. It was the program to arm and finance the Afghan mujaheden.</p>
<p>It began in 1979 with a modest budget. It grew into a multi-billion dollar enterprise funded by the CIA&#x27;s black budget. President Jimmy Carter authorized the initial funding. Under Ronald Reagan, the program&#x27;s aims became far more ambitious. To bleed the Soviet Union dry, to give it its own Vietnam.</p>
<p>The black budget was the financial weapon that made this possible. Funding grew exponentially through the 1980s, starting with just tens of millions, swelling to over $600 million per year by the mid 1980s. The CIA did not act alone. Saudi Arabia matched American funding dollar for dollar. That effectively doubled the resources.</p>
<p>The money was funneled primarily through Pakistan&#x27;s ISI. The ISI then controlled distribution to Mujahedin factions. That choice had long-term consequences. The black budget paid for a vast arsenal. Initially, the CIA supplied mostly Soviet block weapons, aka 47 rifles, RPGs.</p>
<p>Many were bought on the international arms market to preserve plausible deniability. As the war escalated, the weapons became more sophisticated. In 1986, the CIA supplied hundreds of FIM92 Stinger missiles, shoulder fired heat-seeking missiles. They were a gamecher. They let Mujahedin challenge Soviet air superiority, shooting down helicopter gunships, shooting down transport planes, turning the tide of the war.</p>
<p>Operation Cyclone is widely credited with helping force the Soviet withdrawal in 1989. But the legacy is complex. The CIA via the ISI favored hardline Islamist factions. Among the foreign fighters was a wealthy Saudi named Osama bin Laden. The network of training camps, logistical routes, battleh hardened militants built with CIA black money did not vanish.</p>
<p>It metastasized. It helped spawn the Taliban and built infrastructure that would become al-Qaeda. The Iran Contra affair stands as the most infamous scandal in the history of the CIA&#x27;s black budget. A cautionary tale of what can happen when covert operations spiral out of control. In the mid 1980s, the Reagan administration was pursuing two contradictory and secret foreign policies.</p>
<p>The first was a public policy of not negotiating with terrorists or states that sponsored them. The second happening in the shadows was a secret effort to sell arms to Iran in the hopes of securing the release of American hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon. At the same time, Congress had passed the Boland Amendment, which explicitly prohibited the United States government from providing military support to the Contras. The Contras were a right-wing rebel group fighting the socialist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Determined to keep the Contras alive, figures within the Reagan administration decided to use the profits from the secret arm sales to Iran to illegally fund the Contras.</p>
<p>Most notably, NSC staffer Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North led that effort. This created an offthe-books black budget, a slush fund, secret from the public, and hidden from most of Congress, including the intelligence committees that were supposed to oversee covert action. The scheme was a labyrinth of shell corporations, foreign bank accounts, and shadowy arms dealers. The CIA helped facilitate the arms shipments to Iran. The money from these sales was then deposited into Swiss bank accounts controlled by the enterprise run by North.</p>
<p>From there, the funds were used to purchase weapons and supplies on the black market, which were then airdrop to the Contra forces in Central America. It was a self-sustaining covert operation, completely divorced from any form of legal appropriation or congressional oversight. It was the black budget gone rogue, operating in a fiscal and legal black hole. The entire affair unraveled in late 1986 when a plane carrying supplies to the Contras was shot down over Nicaragua. An American survivor confessed the operation source.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, a Lebanese magazine exposed the secret Arms for Hostages deal with Iran. The resulting scandal triggered a major constitutional crisis, leading to televised congressional hearings, multiple indictments, and a deep stain on the Reagan presidency. The Iran Contra affair starkly revealed the dangers of unchecked secrecy. Congress with overwhelming public support opened the floodgates, pouring tens of billions of new dollars into the black budget. This explosion in spending fueled a massive expansion of the CIA&#x27;s covert and paramilitary capabilities.</p>
<p>The agency went on a hiring spree for case officers and analysts. The budget for its counterterrorism center swelled to levels never before seen. The money funded a global network of secret prisons, black sites. Captured al-Qaeda suspects were detained and subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. Funding also drove a dramatic expansion of the CIA&#x27;s drone program.</p>
<p>Unmanned aerial vehicles were transformed from reconnaissance tools into lethal weapons for targeted killings Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and beyond. The scale of this new black budget remained a closely guarded secret for years. In 2013, documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden provided the first public glimpse. One disclosed document summarized the 2013 National Intelligence Program budget, a top line of 52.6 billion. The documents broke down spending by agency.</p>
<p>CIA 14.7 billion, NSA $10.8 billion, NRO $10.3 billion. For the first time, the American public saw an authoritative breakdown of secret intelligence spending. This post 911 era also brought a new wave of controversy. Warrantless surveillance by the NSA sparked fierce debates. The CIA&#x27;s interrogation and detention program did the same.</p>
<p>The drone program raised legal and ethical questions about extrajudicial killings and civilian casualties. Snowden&#x27;s revelations ignited a global firestorm over the reach of US intelligence. and critics warned of a profound lack of transparency and public accountability over massive secret spending. In the complex geopolitical landscape of the 21st century, the black budget remains as relevant as ever. While the war on terror has evolved, new and resurgent threats have emerged, ensuring a continued demand for secret funding, a more assertive China, a revantist Russia, persistent cyber warfare threats, nuclear proliferation in North Korea, nuclear proliferation in Iran.</p>
<p>These long-term strategic competitions are fought not only with diplomats and soldiers, but also with spies, satellites, and cyber weapons, all of which are financed through the black budget. The focus of secret spending has shifted. Counterterrorism remains a priority, but a significant portion now funds next generation technologies to counter nearpeer adversaries. Advanced reconnaissance satellites capable of peering through cloud cover. Hypersonic weapons research.</p>
<p>Offensive cyber capabilities, defensive cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence programs designed to analyze vast quantities of data. The black budget is the engine of innovation for the intelligence community, allowing the United States to pursue cuttingedge technologies for strategic advantage. Oversight of the black budget has tightened since the excesses of the early post 911 years and the scandals of the Cold War. The intelligence committees in Congress are more assertive. The office of the director of national intelligence created in 2004 provides a layer of management.</p>
<p>Since the Snowden leaks, the government has declassified the topline budget figure for the national intelligence program each year. However, the details of that spending, the specific programs, their costs, and their objectives remain shrouded in deep secrecy, accessible only to a handful of officials and legislators. Ultimately, the black budget embodies a core unresolved dilemma for American democracy. It is a tool deemed essential for protecting the nation in a dangerous world, allowing for the secrecy and agility required for effective intelligence work. Yet its very existence creates a sphere of government that operates beyond the reach of public knowledge and debate, challenging the fundamental principles of accountability.</p>
<p>As long as the United States faces foreign threats that must be countered in the shadows, the hidden billions of the black budget will continue to flow. The debate over its necessity, its morality, and its control will endure. [Music]</p>
