            <p>hello youtube uh so today we&#x27;re going to do a quick read-through of the dia&#x27;s foia electronic reading room this is basically where they release all of their different foia requests or they actually can do this kind of on their own fruition only every year they have a new process to release information that they think should be and um so this is again a tip the advanced aerospace threat identification program that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to be focusing in on today and this is to give a little breakdown of where i get a lot of my information just one of the many places that i go to and as you can see here here all the categories from venezuela to russia to north korea mexico iraq iran congress china you know we have a bunch of different categories here but as the universe would have it the first link is atip or the advanced aerospace threat identification program and you see a lot of these are dirts where people call these uh defense intelligence reference documents and a lot of these have some really interesting names we have the advanced nuclear propulsion for manned deep space travel advanced space propulsion based on vacuum space time metric engineering programmable matter an introduction to the statistical drake equation which is basically the equation that said um if there are aliens where are they a neutronic fusion propulsion we have human biological effects or field effects on human biological tissues this is the one that made a lot of headlines they got a lot of their information from mufon or a lot of people had problems that a lot of the information came from the national enquirer but that is an interesting one they actually talk about you know unexplained pregnancies and a lot of these other things like apparent time being missing that kind of stuff anti-gravity for aerospace applications it&#x27;s a lot of people this has to do with the um the uh why is the name escaping me at the moment the bob lazar story or area s4 around area 51 and they&#x27;re um looking into anti-gravity research and propulsion biosensors and biomims cockpits in the era of breakthrough flight cognitive limits on the simultaneous control of multiple unmanned spacecraft con cells for extracting energy from the quantum vacuum this has to do with the planck energy or as again the salvator paise talks about the the super force or the plank force uh basically it down at the plank scale kind of the the smallest voxel of the universe or volumetric pixel just as the screen has picture of pixels in the two-dimensional spectrum you can have three dimensional pixels where it has a volume and the smallest volume is the planck as at rather the planck scale so extracting energy from the quantum vacuum or quantum vacuum fluctuations or detection and high resolution tracking of vehicles at hypersonic velocities high frequency gravitational wave communications we know about gravitational waves we actually have a system here we have ligo or one of our ligo detection systems and this stands for laser or light interferometer gravitational wave observatory and basically these observe low frequency gravitational waves and that&#x27;s important and specific these are low frequency gravitational waves usually we see these from two colliding black holes as you can see here they make these waves as they&#x27;re orbiting each other at higher and higher and higher speeds once they collide to make this big rolling gravitational wave that we can sense with these sensors typically these are about two and a half miles long or here this one is four kilometers but there are many different ones there&#x27;s one at cal tech there&#x27;s one at um i think at harvard i believe but i could be wrong there there are a few of these and basically how it works is there&#x27;s a laser here the laser goes in hits this little beam splitter in the middle and it splits it into two equal beams 50 of the em energy goes this way 50 goes that way and these are extremely extremely precise these are exactly the same length and it goes down to the edge it hits this mirror and it bounces back and then it gets detected now these have to be so precise because the laser must on each side go down bounce off and come back and hit the sensor at the exact same time sorry about that at the exact same time so when we sense one of these gravitational waves being generated we can see the stretching and crunching of space and the stretching and crunching of space on each of these changing virtually the speed of light changing the length of time that it takes for the laser to go down hit the mirror and come back and based on the stretching and crunching of each of these arms we can identify the location of where these gravitational waves are coming from and how intense the event was that created these gravitational waves now this is important because these do not detect high frequency gravitational waves and that is important for uaps and what we&#x27;re talking about here because we could be swimming in a bath of high frequency gravitational waves and be none the wiser just so we&#x27;re swimming in high frequency rf energy all the time we&#x27;re coming from our all of our devices being generated from satellites and radios and all sorts of electronics around us even the wires in our walls have electric fields around them that really transforms the energy but nonetheless these are all things that we interact with or rather don&#x27;t interact with in any meaningful way but nonetheless they are all around us so this is ligo an example of something that can detect these low frequency waves see here they&#x27;re talking about high frequency gravitational waves and we&#x27;ll get into each and every one of these not each and every one we&#x27;ll break these down a little more in depth as we go along through this but let&#x27;s get down here we have warp drive dark energy and the manipulation of extra dimensions this to me is the most interesting but um let&#x27;s start at the top here so first we have a letter or rather a memorandum for the deputy secretary of defense subject being senator harry reid&#x27;s request to put the advance a tip under special access protection to which he was denied we later found out down here their earmark this is in july of 2008 10 million dollars he co-sponsored this with representative anyway from hawaii a supplemental to fund the dia&#x27;s effort to look into potential future aerospace weapons threats a 12 million dollar earmark has been allocated to support the program to the fiscal year of 2010. so this was given to bob bigelow who was interestingly the only individual to actually apply for this maybe he was the only one equipped maybe he had advanced knowledge but here it says quote the a tip that senator reid refers to is officially all sap it says right here the advanced aerospace aaitp which is not a tip necessarily with the aaitp that senator reid refers to is officially the advanced aerospace weapon system application program asap contract managed by the defense intelligence agency its primary purpose is to investigate revolutionary advances in future aerospace technologies with emphasis on research for unconventional and revolutionary technologies in the sole bid was to bigelow aerospace in las vegas but basically they were tasked with writing these dirts or these dirt reports going over one we have another letter written to secretary lin and this is the interesting part that i outlined since the a tip program and the study were first commissioned much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings so right here just says it in black and white since the beginning of this program there has been much progress with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings given the current rate of success the continued study of these subjects will lead will likely lead to technology advancements that in the immediate near term will require extraordinary protection due to the sensitivities of the information surrounding aspects of this program i require your assistance in establishing a restricted special access program with a bigoted access list for specific portions of the atip now it goes on to say some of a little bit more interesting things that we don&#x27;t have to get into now but i think anybody who wants to look into the stuff wants to dig in should definitely do so because the information is there if you&#x27;re willing to look for it here we have another document which is titled uh the another durd report on advanced nuclear propulsion for manned deep space missions and i highlighted one section here that i thought was interesting they&#x27;re talking about helium-3 and how it&#x27;s abundant in the atmosphere of jupiter and they can mine it from the atmosphere of jupiter also saying studies have been conducted on spacecraft propulsion with the matter anti-matter annihilation reaction however it is erroneous technical challenge to produce antimatter an appreciable quantities the idea of using nanogram amounts of antimatter for the ignition of fission fusion micro explosions appear to have credible potential but even their production and storage of nanogram quantities of antimatter post serious technical problems so i&#x27;m going to extrapolate here a bit this is just my opinion the antimatter thing probably isn&#x27;t where the big story is that but that&#x27;s just my personal opinion there another dirt report it&#x27;s important this is saying it&#x27;s kind of extrapolating out to 2050 the 2050 time frame but these are not extrapolations of current technology and remember this is a um unclassified report but it talks about lift propulsion control power generation spatial and temporal translation signature reduction optical infrared radio frequency or rf acoustic materials configuration structure armament and my two favorite human interface and human effects well not necessarily my favorite maybe my least favorite but what i think are the most interesting human interface and human effects now it goes on to detail a lot of the specifics around this report what went into this report other different method methodologies that they use to kind of get the information that they think they have and you can again you can go through this yourself and kind of read through these and see what you might find interesting or things may not be as interesting and this is slide 9. a lot of people may remember this infamous slide 9 they talk about psychotronic weapons cognitive human interface penetration of solid surfaces instantaneous sensor disassembly alteration manipulation of biological organisms anomalies in the space-time construct unique cognitive human interface experiences now this is interesting if you have the ability to interface with the human brain depending on how advanced that technology would be there would theoretically be limitless possibilities on what experiences you could beam into someone&#x27;s brain hypothetically speaking dod advantages the dod has been involved in similar experiments in the past and if you can say that they&#x27;ve been involved in experiments in the past and they considered these advantages they probably did those things in the present and will continue to in the future dod has relationships with renowned subject matter experts why continue these relationships if these were all in the past the dod controls several facilities where activities have been detected so the dod is controlling facilities where they&#x27;ve detected these psychotronic weapons cognitive human interfaces what have you and i find these extremely interesting moving on here let&#x27;s see if i can find where things get really interesting it&#x27;s a lot of mumbo jumbo you may not be able to understand but if you do you&#x27;re smarter than me let&#x27;s see oh merry-go-round that&#x27;s funny but i&#x27;m trying to find this very important here we go manifestation of negative masses now when it comes to this phenomenon i believe this is extremely important i think when it comes to negative masses maybe that&#x27;s really where all of this is headed not necessarily anti-gravity systems but i think this is really interesting when you look at the great pyramids and how they move those giant stones when you look at the experiments that the germans were doing around world war two a lot of it seemed to be around reducing mass we would see these these airships people talk about where these airships would have propellers on them or if you could have you know gravity propulsion why would you need a propeller some of these are moving really slow etcetera etcetera but maybe what we&#x27;re seeing is reducing the mass of an object and when you reduce the mass you reduce the effect that gravitons or the higgs boson would have on it it&#x27;s a interaction with the gravitational field maybe just by reducing the mass you&#x27;re reducing the amount of gravity acting on a thing and if you can make something have a negative mass then maybe you can have in theory anti-gravity but i think mass reduction is really where all of this is really going but let&#x27;s see what they&#x27;re saying here there&#x27;s no fundamental physical principle standing in the way which forbids the existence of negative masses if this is true the question is where are these negative masses the recent noticed large bubbles or voids observed in intergalactic space could possibly be explained by the repulsive force of negative masses assumed to occupy the voids but alternative less exotic explanations have been offered as well however there are at least one fundamental phenomena which strongly speaks for the existence of negative masses it is the spin of fermions like the spin of electrons fermions are described by the rock&#x27;s relativistic wave equation the equation has both positive and negative energy components and because of the mass energy relation it therefore must have negative mass components according to strong strodinger schrodinger sorry i got that wrong it is these negative mass components which leads to the phenomenon of the spin since the overall mass of the electron is positive the occurrence of negative masses in the dirac equation must mean that the electron is a mass pole which is super impulse and mass dipole now this is a lot of lingo a lot of words basically just saying there&#x27;s nothing in our current science not even needing to create a whole new physics there&#x27;s nothing in our current science breaking the ability to reduce mass or have negative mass maybe all this dark energy that we&#x27;re seeing is just negative mass objects with negative mass maybe these large bubbles or voids observed in intergalactic space could possibly be explained by repulsive forces or negative mass and maybe this could be what we&#x27;re really meaning by anti-gravity not necessarily reducing or you know reverse gravity but just your mass is gone you can take your mass and maybe move it into the future or move it into the past but these are a lot of um interesting things that i don&#x27;t know a lot about i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t i couldn&#x27;t read that for you even if i wanted to but these have some really interesting documents here i want to go to this one warp drive dark energy and the manipulation of extra dimensions now when we think of dimensions there&#x27;s a 2d line or the one dimensional line sorry there&#x27;s a two dimensional object or shape that could be this rectangle three dimensions where if i could reach out to my screen touch this rectangle and pull it outwards and then there are higher dimensions theoretically a lot of people don&#x27;t talk about the implications of higher dimensions let&#x27;s say there were people who lived on this page technically this b and this six from all the other aspects in its universe it is completely closed off it is in a locked room like a safe room for instance if you had access to the third dimension and you were let&#x27;s say this being this three you could just hop out the screen and plop back in and b6 and they&#x27;ll be how did you get in here it&#x27;s completely boxed off how did you find your way inside of this closed room how can you see inside this window if you&#x27;re existing in the two-dimensional plane but us three-dimensional creatures is pretty simple to take something here copy it paste it there or pick it up move it there what have you so let&#x27;s say you have access to the fourth spatial dimension well that would mean that no room that you lock yourself in could keep you safe someone could theoretically just kind of not necessarily walk through the wall they could walk around the wall in the fourth dimension but this is kind of the um the ability that uh these reports tainted seem to hint that some beings or some you know classified programs have access to the manipulation of extra spatial dimensions another thing when you keep going up in spatial dimensions it&#x27;s not as if you just have more access to more space it also affects time in a way so when you go up to the fourth spatial dimension you can see around all three dimensional objects so in just as in in 2d world you know if something&#x27;s here the the if you will couldn&#x27;t see through the cashmere to see the effect but us in 3d world we can see the cashmere effect all at once if you were in a 4d perspective you could see around all three-dimensional objects all at once and it&#x27;s so weird to try to imagine that in your brain where if you hold up a sheet of paper in front of you it blocks out the world behind it but in this necessary in this um kind of in this um perspective no three-dimensional object could block another three-dimensional object behind it and that&#x27;s interesting we keep going up it kind of changes your perspective even more you move up another layer into the fifth spatial dimension and you can start to see the relative timelines people call it metatron&#x27;s cube or the hypercube or different things like that people seem to explain experiencing this hypercube during psychedelic experiences or at least that is what we hear in reports and it&#x27;s interesting when you dig deeper and deeper into the connections that we may be finally coming up to and all these weird weird um kind of woo type of places we&#x27;re seeing maybe a lot of the stuff has been seeded into our um media over the years maybe you have access to this higher spatial dimension you can see the future and the past simultaneously maybe you can see all potential outcomes simultaneously and maybe you can see um the perspective of which we could only consider god like not saying that you would become a god when you enter the sixth spatial dimension but what i am saying is these abilities that these um extreme advanced physics gives us access to or gives classified programs and other beings access to um we&#x27;ll give them you know they say magic any advanced science is indistinguishable from magic so maybe we&#x27;re seeing this advanced science distinguishing itself with magic but um this is my thoughts here we could go into cockpits in the you know era of breakthrough flight there&#x27;s not a lot here again these are all unclassified so not a lot of these get into anything particularly interesting to pitch and y&#x27;all and all these good things this is interesting but um you know all things that are in this public report that anybody can look at i&#x27;m not to say that i have any information none of you guys have i definitely don&#x27;t all of the information that i have obtained has been through unclassified means um but there&#x27;s some a lot of interesting stuff in here you can just read through and skim through and look at the pictures if you will or you can stop and read through all of this interesting stuff the main difference between navigating with existing vehicles and breakthrough vehicles is that the breakthrough vehicles will have to navigate in deep space and around other astronomical bodies where gps systems and location beacons do not exist another major difference is that the physics of the propulsion methods might distort or block information that is traditionally used for navigation interesting in inertial guidance systems accelerometers and ring laser dry rolls accurately track the changes in the vehicle&#x27;s motion laterally and rotational accelerations these signals are integrated to keep track of positioning and evaluating changes in both velocity and acceleration in these cases of the double hole the double hole where the inertial effects might be different inside the craft these tools become more difficult to apply if we assume that the physics and technology for manipulating inertial fields or for warping space time can accurately track these effects and that knowledge may compensate to keep these tools viable design and future guiding systems must address this issue what they&#x27;re basically saying here is that normal tracking systems like gps that lets us know where we are relative to other things in our surroundings wouldn&#x27;t work we may have to use extremely advanced ways to track where we are in the universe having to navigate around stars and around debris and asteroids and things like that and then the propulsion system itself may limit our ability to perceive you know these signals that we could otherwise receive or sig in signals intelligence that being rf frequencies that are around us infrared light right infrared light electromagnetic radiation so being able to see well yes it would be infrared light because as you&#x27;re moving in this you know space time bubble you&#x27;re shifting the light coming at you so things with the perspective of the environment around you would appear different especially depending on the speeds at which you&#x27;re moving and it gets really really really really weird and interesting start moving at these high speeds space and time work a little different but six degrees of independent motion and orientation obviously good stuff three flight regimens near the surface of gravitating body where gravitational direction provides natural orientation orbits around the gravitational body where cues for entering orbit are required for the pilot deep space flight without obvious orientation cues or obvious sense of motion navigational information sources position velocity star tracker now this is interesting being able to track quasars specifically may be a good way to navigate around the universe but a star tracker or having a star map would be really interesting as well but again then again that always has to do with perspective so if we were to create a map of the universe usually we would start at earth because we&#x27;re from earth and from the perspective of earth we make that you know relative map from there velocity accelerations linear rotational these are all really really interesting reports that you can dig into and look at yourself and also into the foundation and the forming of a tip what happened around a tip but keep in mind here atip and all sap may not be as different as we were led to initially believe this is all really interesting stuff i hope that helped a little bit and um i ended the recording and forgot to hit this one the anomalous acute and sub-acute field effects on human biological tissue now mainly what this report talks about are the propulsion systems of hypothetical craft and how they may interact with human biological tissue now a lot of this was written by kit green or christopher greene who actually said he was the go-to person in the dia to talk about morbidity and mortality morbidity and mortality when it came to uaps or ufos but there are a lot of effects among the most important pathophysiological effects are heating and burn injuries ionizing and non-ionizing thermally induced neurological effects effects on the brain cognitive central nervous system neuromuscular central and automatic nervous system pro cognitive yeah basically talking about all of the both neurological effects and the dermal effects effects on the skin i&#x27;m just going to give my opinion here my belief in my opinion is that many of these effects are coming from the propulsion systems that create a field effect and then these are being experienced by people um let me see if i can find where it get ours headache temporal effects lasting three weeks dizziness vertigo cardiac palpitations at 48 and 72 hours malaise low-grade fever is kind of the the normal stuff but it gets interesting i&#x27;m trying to see if i can find this good stuff and this came from mufon in 1996. they&#x27;re talking about a lot of the the the human related physiological effects from the propulsion systems of these crafts and and it goes in order of frequency from lowest from highest frequency to lowest and to start here the lowest frequency of events that we are getting from mufon and maybe this has to do with people&#x27;s willingness to report something if they report something and they were had an induced feeling of calm and serenity they may not be willing to report that it was a cool experience they yeah no one needs to know about that it was fun if they have a loss of hearing a loss of taste itching stunned a perceived teleportation things like this you may be less likely to report to people a claimed implant genealogical problems urination problems breathing problems weight loss ringing in ears tastes nose bleeds claimed esp development and nightmares hair loss diarrhea death healing weightlessness levitation dizziness sexual encounters dehydration perceived time suspension insomnia appetite loss voice loss significant odors numbness apparent experience of telepathy interestingly at a parent experience amnesia weakness fatigue but the big one here apparent abductions at the most frequent 129. now maybe there was a bias in looking for these apparent abduction cases maybe people who were abducted felt that they needed to report that the most or maybe um people were experiencing that the most i think there&#x27;s a mixture of all of those in there probably or maybe a lot of these people had this experience along with a bunch of these other experiences that were tallied up as well but burns unconsciousness marks left on body light beam effects perceived time loss it&#x27;s interesting after eye injuries heat medical exam yada yada ground traces this is interesting they saw traces of the craft left on the ground these are all field effects that people were having in their bodies and this is from south africa australia italy france brazil pennsylvania arizona virginia new mexico texas ohio peru maryland brazil oregon sweden australia um all of these seem to be let&#x27;s see let&#x27;s read through the rest of these england illinois argentina minnesota nevada another brazil brazil brazil yeah a lot of these seem to be in areas that are either in or friendly with the west yeah i don&#x27;t see any from china or russia [Music] or maybe that has to do with a bias in reporting um maybe that has to do with the bias and the inputs of reports what reports they&#x27;re actually getting maybe that has to do with something else but these are from a lot of this from 1971 69 66 57 because i believe this report was between the years of 1873 and 1994.</p>
<p>so relatively wide time spent there but yeah again you can read these reports for yourself see all the data on what they collected here and a lot of people say well this can be thrown away because it was from mufon and i get it but this is the government looking at public sources of information which i think is important that were ufo induced and you take all of this stuff and you combine it all together i think you get a clear picture on what could be happening [Music] what might be happening what people could be experiencing or people think they could be experiencing what others may not want them to know that they&#x27;re experiencing one of them i think they&#x27;re experiencing something you know are there a lot of options here not a lot of answers hopefully some will come soon but again yeah you can go here to the just type in dia for your reading room it&#x27;s easy for you the very first link and you see all these cool documents now people don&#x27;t have time for this i get it maybe do a second video going more in depth but i just thought i&#x27;d start recording just show people where i get my information from and i&#x27;m hope this helps you in your research endeavors decentralized research is the way to go and it is how we win so yeah team unity for the win see you guys next time</p>
