            <p>so ingo swann and harold sherman another famous psychic uh and we we taped the tape the experiments remote viewed jupiter before the flyby uh swann said i wonder if i went to the wrong place i see some thin rings around jupiter maybe i went to saturn by mistake but no i couldn&#x27;t have done that because there&#x27;s the big red tornado thing and so he reported then rings and so right after that carl sagan happened to come by sri and so we showed him the data he said i&#x27;m not impressed first of all i see a bunch of stuff in here that you know you can get out of any encyclopedia and then i see stuff here that&#x27;s clearly wrong rings around jupiter no rings around jupiter so we actually published that in our book mind reach before the flyby got there when the flyby got there the big news was thin rings around jupiter and so based on that they also also did a remote viewing of mercury before a flyby and described a number of things that the astrophysicist cosmologist didn&#x27;t expect to see and it turned out he was right so they&#x27;re they&#x27;re in the public literature as far as a microscope activity we didn&#x27;t at least in our lab but there&#x27;s a very famous book out of early 1900s where uh lead beater and besant famous psychics of the day remote viewed elements in the periodic table and came up with detailed descriptions which included noting that there was deuterium and tritium which we didn&#x27;t know about at the time and models that some physicists feel match cork models so that&#x27;s also that&#x27;s published as the book so you can get that would it cost to data a remote viewer and how much access does the private sector have there are many of the ex intelligence people have retired and they teach remote viewing courses and so i mean you can go on the web find out courses take the courses from them and then be your own remote viewer as far as hiring remote viewers i i don&#x27;t know i don&#x27;t keep up with you know what they might do okay i know it&#x27;s getting late so i think we probably have to why one last question no we didn&#x27;t how do we choose our remote viewers since we probably didn&#x27;t go to the yellow pages psychic yellow pages well originally uh well you saw how we got swann geller was recommended so we took him in he got 90 percent of publicity even though he&#x27;s like one percent of our work but in the army they found that some remote viewers the way they selected some of their remote viewers were that there were certain people that the troops would follow out into the fields of vietnam because they would never get blown up by land mines and so the army chose some of those people and sent them our way but then we also found out that by having volunteers that many of them who never thought about having psychic functioning like hella hammond happened to be at sri for some other experiments never thought of herself as a psychic she turned out to be absolutely wonderful so eventually we did a massive profiling system and it&#x27;s used by the cia and uh have a 256 cubbyhole 16x16 of 256 separate kinds of personalities and there were two cubbyholes in there that sort of uh were our best remote viewers came from so but by and large i would say you don&#x27;t have to go that that far essentially everybody has the ability our view is that it&#x27;s normally distributed just like musical ability you&#x27;ve got virtuosos that went into the scale you&#x27;ve got tone deaf people at the other end and you&#x27;ve got a bell curve and most people are somewhere in the bell curve can learn some music and can learn to do remote viewing so i think that that&#x27;s all you need to know about finding room of yours thanks thank you all again for coming if you didn&#x27;t mail address and you want to be notified about our next lectures please make sure that you drop your email up address okay</p>
