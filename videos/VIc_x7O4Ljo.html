            <p>all right how is everyone doing today welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel we uh look at a lot of great theories of everything from the past ancient and modern try to do deep dives into them so that you can determine how to use them uh to best help you with your Paradigm shifting you&#x27;re Awakening to 5D Consciousness and uh your formation of a holistic worldview today is our 510th um it&#x27;s perhaps our 511th uh video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larsson Mr Larson was an American engineer and he lived from 1898 until 1990 um in 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how the universe operated uh the first postulate states that uh the universe is composed entirely of one component motion not matter not energy but motion the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discreet units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and uh he basically took that first postulate plugged it into the second postulate uh which is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian plug that first postulate into the second posate to arrive deductively at a theoretical Universe what larsson&#x27;s Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then he compared his theoretical Universe with the measured empirical Universe of modern science that they had um assembled in their uh laboratory experiments and compiled in their table scientific tables he does that in this book that we&#x27;re looking at here today called basic properties of matter uh which is primarily on chemistry so look at um many of the basic properties of matter that Larson arrives at equations for like the melting point or the compressibility and then he plugs in all of the atoms and many compounds into his equations and then Compares them with the scientific tables in many cases Larson is able to actually just recreate the scientific tables more or less um from Theory only uh no need for billion doll grants to do experiments and um armies of scientists to conduct them uh just one guy in his living room um with an actual you know valid Theory uh who&#x27;s able to make these determinations okay now we are in the middle of chapter 21 here uh which is on electromagnetism uh we will uh start here in the middle and hopefully finish this today this chapter the lack of oh uh sorry but if you want to go any any deeper into larsson&#x27;s uh fundamental postulates and how he develops them what they what the ramifications are what they really mean um you want to watch one of my first 474 videos on this subject uh where I go into it uh quite a bit deeper uh for today&#x27;s purposes I&#x27;m going to assume that you have a working knowledge of the reciprocal system of theory or else that you are an in intrepret Explorer into the unknown and um you know because we&#x27;re just trying to uh read this into the record and um you know make some Headway okay um chapter 21 electromagnetism we&#x27;re right here in the middle the lack of any Theory or even a model that would explain how either a Magnet magnetostatic or electromagnetic effect is produced has left magnetism in a confused state where contradictions and inconsistencies are so plentiful that none of them is taken very seriously a somewhat similar situation was encountered in our examination of electrical phenomena particularly in the case of those issues affected by the lack of Distinction between electric charge and electric quantity but a much larger number of errors and omissions have converged uh to produce a rather chaotic condition in the conceptual aspects of magnetic Theory it is in a way somewhat surprising that the investigators in this field have made so much progress in the face of these obstacles as noted earlier many of the physical quantities involved in electromagnetism are the same as those that enter into magnetostatic phenomena these are quantities applicable to two-dimensional scalar relations irrespective of the particular nature of the phenomena in which they participate the electromagnetic units applicable to these quantities are therefore the same uh ones defined for magnetostatic phenomena in chapter 20 some of the relations between these quantities are also those of two-dimensional motions in general rather than being peculiar to either magnetostatics or electromagnetism more commonly however the relations involved in electromagnetism are analogous to those encountered in current electricity as electromagnetism is a phenomenon of current flow rather than of magnetic charges one example is the force between currents there is no electromagnetic relation analogous to the kulum equation the theorists commonly use current elements for purpose of analysis for purposes of analysis but such units obviously cannot be isolated a simple interaction between two units analogous to to the interaction between two charges therefore it does not exist instead the simplest electromagnetic interaction the one that is used in defining the unit of current the Ampere is the interaction between the magnetic forces of parallel wires carrying currents making use of the field concept the advantage of which is quite evident in dealing with currents we first find the magnetic field of one current in terms of the flux density B the quantity B has been found to be equal to um uh still don&#x27;t remember what that Greek letter is um and um oi uh you um I think that is the permeability times the current um over 2 pi s uh the space time dimensions of this expression are t to the T ^2 over s to the 4th the correct dimensions of the flux density the force exerted by this field on a length um L of the parallel current carrying wire is then uh B iil the dimensions um t^2 S 4 * s/ T * s = t / s^ 2 the Expressions representing the two steps of this evaluation of the force can be Consolidated with the result that the force on y or B due to the current in y a is permeability zero uh I um a i bi I over 2 pi s if the currents are equal this becomes um permeability 0 I 2 I over 2 pi s there is some resemblance between this and an expression of the kolom type but it actually represents a different kind of a relation it is a magnetic that is two-dimensional relation analogous to the electric equation v = i in this electric relation the force is equal to the resistance time the current in the magnetic relation the force on a unit length is equal to the permeability the magnetic equivalent of resistance times the square of the current the energy relations in electromagnetism have given the theorist considerable difficulty a central issue is the question as to what takes place what takes the place of the mass that has an essential role in the analogous mechanical relations the perplexity with which present day scientists view the situation is illustrated by a comment from a current physics textbook the author points out that the energy of the magnetic field varies as the second power of the current and um that the similarity of the variation of kinetic energy with the second power of the Velocity suggests that the field Energy may be the kinetic energy of the current this kinetic energy of a current magnetic field he says suggests um uh I lost track of who he is but um this kinetic energy of a current magnetic field he says suggests that it has something like Mass uh the trouble with this suggestion is that the investigators have not been able to identify any electric or magnetic property that is something like Mass indeed the most striking characteristic of the electric current is its immaterial character the answer to the problem is provided by our finding that the electric current is a movement of units of space through matter and that the effective mass of that matter has the same role in current flow as in the motion of matter through space in the current flow we are not dealing with something like Mass we are dealing with mass as brought out in chapter um nine electrical resistance are is mass per unit time T ^2 / s 3r the product of resistance and time RT that enters into the energy relations of current flow is therefore mass under another name since current I is speed the electric energy equation W equal RT i² is identical with the equation for kinetic energy W = 1 12 mv^ 2 the magnetic analog of resistance is permeability with Dimensions T cubed over S 4 because of the additional t/ s term that enters into this two-dimensional quality quantity the permeability is the mass per unit space a conclusion that is supported by observation as expressed by Norman feather the mass quote involves the product of the permeability of the medium and a config U configurational Factor having the dimensions of a length end quote in some applications the function of this Mass term Dimensions T cubed over s cubed is clear enough to have led to its recognition under the name of inductance the basic key equations employed in dealing with inductance are identical with the equations dealing with the motion of matter through space we already we have already seen that the inductive Force equation F equal L uh inductance uh times the change in current over time is identical with the general Force equation FAL um mass times the change in uh space over time or FAL ma similarly magnetic flux which is dimensionally equivalent to momentum is the product of inductance and current Li just as momentum is the product of mass and velocity MV it is not always possible to relate the more complex electromagnetic magnetic formulas directly to corresponding mechanical phenomena in this manner but they can all be reduced to space-time terms and verified dimensionally the theory of the universe of motion thus provides the complete and consistent framework for electric and magnetic relationships that has her to been lacking the finding that the one-dimensional motion of the electric current acting in opposition to the threedimensional gravitational motion leaves a two-dimensional residue natur um naturally leads to the conclusion that a two-dimensional magnetic motion similarly applied in opposition to gravitation will leave a onedimensional residue an electric current if a conductor is appropriately located relative to the magnetic motion um sorry to the magnetic motion this is the observed phenomena known as electromagnetic induction while they share the same name this induct induction process has no relation to the induction of electric charges the induction of charges results from the equ equivalence of a scalar motion AB with a similar motion ba which leads to the establishment of an equilibrium between the two motions as indicated above electromagnetic induction is a result of the partial n neutralization of gravitational motion by oppositely directed scalar Motion in two dimensions this induction process is another of the aspects of electricity and magnetism that is unexplained in conventional science as one textbook puts it quote Faraday discovered that whenever the current in the primary circuit um uh I guess that is an L or circuit one primary circuit one is caused to change there is a current induced in circuit 2 while that change is occurring this remarkable result is not in general derivable from any of the previous previously discussed properties of electromagnetism end quote here again the advantage of having at our disposal a general physical Theory one that is applicable to all subdivisions of physical activity is demonstrated once the nature of electromagnetism is understood it is Apparent from the theoretical relation between electricity and magnetism that the existence of electromagnetic induction necessarily follows since there is no freely moving magnetic particle corresponding to the electron there is no magnetic current but magnetic motion can be produced in a number of ways Each of which is a method of inducing electric currents or voltage differences for example the magnetic motion May originate mechanically if a wire that forms part of an electric circuit is moved in a magnetic field in such a way that the magnetic flux Through the Wire changes uh equivalent to a magnetic motion an electric current is induced in the circuit a similar effect is produced if the magnetic field is varied as for instance if it is generated by means of an alternating current the force aspect of the one-dimensional electric residual motion left by the magnetic Motion in the electromagnetic induction process can of course be represented as an electric field but because of the manner in which it is produced this field is not at all like the fields of electric charges as Arthur Kip points out there is an extreme contrast between these two kinds of electric Fields he explains quote an induced EMF implies an electric field since it it produces a force on a static charge but this electric field produced by a changing magnetic flux has some properties which are quite different from those of an electrostatic field produced by fixed charges the special property of this new sort of electric field is that its curl or its line integral around a closed path is not zero in general the electric field at any point in space can be broken into two parts the part we have called electrostatic whose curl is zero and for which electrostatic potential differences can be defined and a part which has a nonzero curl for which a potential function is not applicable in the usual way while a substantial that&#x27;s the end of the quote while a substantial difference uh with while the substantial differences between the two kinds of electric fields are recognized in current physical thought as indicated by this quotation the reason for the existence of these differences has remained unidentified our finding is that the obstacle in the way of locating the answer to this problem has been the assumption that both fields are due to electric charges static charges in the one case moving charges in the other actually the differences between the two kinds of electric fields are easily accounted for when it is recognized that the processes by which these fields have been produced are entirely different only one involves electric charges the treatment of this situation by different authors varies widely some some textbook authors ignore the discrepancies between accepted Theory and the observations others mention certain points of conflict but do not follow them up however one of the of those quoted earlier in this volume Professor WJ duffen at of the University of Hull takes a more critical look at some of these conflicts and arrives at a number of conclusions which so far as they go parallel the conclusions of this work quite closely although of course he does not take the final step of recognizing that these conflicts invalidate the foundations of conventional theory of the electric current like Arthur Kip Duffin emphasizes that the electric field produced by electromagnetic induction is quite different from the Electro static field but he goes a step further and recognizes that the agency responsible for the existence of the field which he identifies as the electromotive force EMF must also differ from the electrostatic force he then raises the issue as to what cont what what contributes to this EMF Electro quote electric static electrostatic Fields cannot do so he says thus the [Music] description that he gives um I guess that&#x27;s the end of the quote there he says th thus the description that he gives of the electric current produced by electromagnetic induction is completely nonelectrostatic an EMF of nonelectrostatic origin raises a current eye to flow causes a current I to flow through a resistance R electric charges play no part in this process quote no charge accumulates at any point and no potential difference can be meaningfully said to exist between any two points Duffin evidently accepts the prevailing view of the current as a movement of charged electrons but as indicated in a previous prly quoted statement he realizes that the nonelectrostatic force EMF must act on the carriers of the charges rather than on the charges this makes the charges Superfluous thus the essence of the his findings from observation is that the electric currents produced by electromagnetic induction are nonelectrostatic phenomena in which Electric charges play no part these are the currents of our ordinary experience those that flow through the wires of our vast electrical networks in the course of the discussion of electricity and magnetism in the preceding Pages we have identified a number of conflicts between the results of observation and the conventional moving charge theory of the electric current the theory presented in all of the textbooks including duffins these conflicts are serious enough to show that the current cannot be a flow of electric charges now we see that the ordinary electric currents with which the theory of current electricity deals are definitely nonelectrostatic that is electric charges play no part in them the case against the conventional theory of current is thus conclusive even without the new information made available by the development required uh reported in this work all right that is the end of chapter 22 or chapter 21 um on electromagnetism and uh again this kind of goes into larsson&#x27;s General um ideas here with electric current being you know in Laren system everything is a kind of motion and for him uh an electron is a rotating unit of space electric current is a rotating unit of space moving through matter matter is primarily made out of time the relationship between space and time is motion and so a unit of space can move through matter uh because matter is time and an electron is space so an electron moving through matter is electric current and it is kind of the mutual movement of a matter itself moving through space matter is made out of time it moves through space electrons are made out of space it moves through matter and that is electric current and uh a charge is something completely different this is the uncharged electron that is involved in electric current and an electric charge is when an electron takes a charge and like everything else in Larson system a charge is a type of motion a charge is a rotational vibration which is kind of like that and a rotational vibration which is a charge can be taken by an electron and that uh changes an uncharged electron to a Charged electron and it changes electric current to static electricity so static electricity is a charged phenomena whereas electric current is uncharged and um that also then plays into this whole idea with electromagnetism uh the electromagnetism is merely the residue of um uh an electric charge moving through a gravitational field so-called an as if gravitational field so uh gravitation is three dimensions the electric current is one dimension and then so you have a residue of two Dimensions which is the electromagnetism okay um now just another comment here before I uh let you go um obviously you can leave anytime you want but um is that you know we&#x27;re not not hyperfocused on um all this stuff here for the purposes of you really understanding everything about chemistry here in the basic properties of matter that&#x27;s great if you do um but we&#x27;re we&#x27;re looking at this book because Larson is presenting us with a generalized Theory of Everything and so in order to kind of understand Larson&#x27;s approach we have to look at how he applies his theory in many different contexts so we&#x27;ve looked at his derivation of the theory we&#x27;ve looked at how he applies his theory to metaphysical situations philosophical situations religious situations um also having to do with atomic physics we&#x27;ve looked a little bit into its astronomical Theory we&#x27;re going to be looking at his economic theory and we&#x27;re also looking here at his uh we looked at some of his biological um interpretations and also into his um chemical interpretations so after this we&#x27;re going to be looking at um a little bit of his economic work um he&#x27;s got a book that&#x27;s called uh the road to permanent prosperity and uh then we&#x27;ll also look at some some of uh the work of some of Larson&#x27;s Associates uh rs2 the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system done primarily by the late Dr Bruce pet and uh Dr kvk Neu and um you know some of their interpretations uh uh which include somewhat of an overhaul of Larson&#x27;s ideas having to do with electricity um and to some extent magnetism so uh you know uh this all should be taken with a grain of salt and um if not more than that um but it is to kind of you know get you familiar with the approach how Larson takes his postulates and applies them um because uh that is what is going to be at stake here with the reciprocal system is that that it can be applied to any subject so far it has only been applied to a handful of subjects um and so there are Myriad subjects out there waiting for the reciprocal system to um lend its wisdom to them so um hopefully you know by seeing how he does it um you can learn how to apply it to your favorite subject okay uh we&#x27;re going to leave leave it there thanks for tuning in today</p>
