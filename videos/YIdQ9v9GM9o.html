            <p>[Music] well hey there everyone Hi and welcome back to my YouTube channel thanks a lot for visiting with me today I want to tell you about some very exciting developments in the area of cold fusion and so-called loner lenr low energy nuclear rea action as it&#x27;s called or low energy nuclear technology different names for it this proc these processes have been making the news they&#x27;ve been developing over the past couple years if you haven&#x27;t seen my videos about cold fusion and lonard the the links are right up here but basically as I talked about in my previous videos we had learned that cold fusion really worked the folks at Ena in Italy have been working on it and we&#x27;ve been getting some very promising results from Andreas rossy&#x27;s ecat energy catalyzer which we&#x27;re told is going to be commercialized and possibly for sale at the end of this year 2015 but what we haven&#x27;t had so far is a theory about why it works well that&#x27;s all changed quite dramatically in the past few weeks there&#x27;s a marvelous site that I go to all the time it&#x27;s one of my favorite sites it&#x27;s called ecat world and ecat world is a site that talks about the ecat cold fusion lener and all these related Technologies and I check this site out all the time because it&#x27;s always talking about the latest developments as we&#x27;ve learned a professor in Moscow Park Hof has uh reproduced the Rossy ecat effect with his own very informal setup in his own uh apartment I believe and we&#x27;ve had some replications in California over the past couple days and a few days ago I saw this paper that explained the theory of why all of this works and it has implications for a whole range of subjects that we talk about here on my YouTube channel that I think you&#x27;ll be interested in basically this paper is called plasmonics with a Twist taming Optical tornadoes on a nanoscale by a uh researcher at in the mechanical engineering department at MIT uhet Lana v boriskina she presents a very interesting idea that is called vortex Nano Gear transmission and this is why it matters we know that in cold fusion and loner we have these different materials that resonate in a way to produce apparently a fusion reaction at an atomic level and it produces a lot of heat and a lot of energy ideally overunity meaning it produces more energy out than in which would lower all of our energy costs and create a sustainable non-polluting energy source but how does it work work well in this paper she presents a number of ideas that show how energy can move from a micro scale to a macro scale or vice versa from a macro scale to a small scale using very simple principles from hydrodynamics now these ideas go back quite a ways and let&#x27;s just review it just briefly for a second you know about over a 100 years ago or so in the late 1800s there was all these ideas is about how do electromagnetic waves and light propagate through the universe how does it move if it is a vacuum and there was this notion that there was something called The Ether you know this kind of weightless uh hard to detect fluid that filled outer space well the Michaelson and Morley experiment showed that there was no ether and this helped Einstein and many others to create theories of general relativity and so forth however because the work in Quant to mechanics and physics went the direction of electromagnetics electromechanics there was very little emphasis put on alternative theories of how energy moves and resonates and this is another way to look at it essentially you&#x27;re all familiar with the idea of seeing a waterf lots of energy moving in a river and downstream you see these vortexes whirl pools and Eddies in a river Downstream from a water fall and things like that so basically we have a turbulent process that creates a coherent so-called laminer flow in a fluid well this apparently is exactly how we&#x27;re learning that the ecat and lener and cold fusion possibly work imagine something like the dust particles that you vacuum up from your floor you&#x27;ve noticed that the dust particles create dust bunnies and they create larger and larger bundles of dust and when you vacuum your floor from time to time you see large dust bunnies and small dust dust bunnies and and tiny little pieces of dust and you know very small that you can barely see well this idea of Vortex Nano Gear transmission suggests the idea that on an atomic scale if you have something like leoner which you have a nickel powder and a hydrogen lattice that these nickel particles self-organized into different sized particles some are very big with lots of iron atoms all hooked together and some are very small and if you have enough density of these specially shaped particles they will self organized into a chain like gears and if you have energy coming in at one side let&#x27;s say we have electromagnetic energy at a very large scale the biggest of these particles will react to that electromagnetic energy and then they&#x27;ll connect to another smaller particle and smaller part particle all the way down the chain of different sized nickel particles until it&#x27;s at the smallest sized Little Nickel particle which interacts at the atomic scale where you have the hydrogen atoms and this puts energy into the hydrogen atoms and they start to move which generates the fusion process so we now have a mechanism if you were able to follow that we now have a mechanism that explains how do you go from the large scale of light and microwaves and energy waves radio waves where the physics are well established and we have Concepts like super Radiance coherently acting atoms in a gas and so forth how do we go from that macro scale all the way down to the atomic scale where the fusion happens from this theory of optical tornadoes which you can imagine light creating vortexes of energy we now have this what you would think of as a mechanical process from the largest scale all all the way down to the smallest scale to where the atoms work so rather than being in a state where there&#x27;s no theory that explains it like the critics and the Skeptics and the scoffers has been suggesting for all these years there&#x27;s no Theory to explain how this works boom we now have a very reasonable understandable theory of how the energy process could work how it could be sustained and they also go so far or Aina also go so far in this paper to explain another effect which I think will find very interesting in the previous video I did about Dr Victorio violante at Ena in Italy he told us about C Fusion he told us that the reason that all the other labs didn&#x27;t get it to work including MIT ironically enough and many other labs and why the patent office said there was no C Fusion they were using the wrong types of materials what Dr violante found was that there have to be enough defects in the Palladium to get it to interact with the dierum to get the fusion reaction going and he he was unequivocal about it he said we got the cold fusion reaction going I believe at least a couple days he showed us the chart of the of the heat that was emanating that goes well beyond any chemical process that we know about and so you can&#x27;t have a per a material that&#x27;s too perfect you need a material with defects you need imperfections to get the energy going don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s kind of cool well in this paper about Optical tornadoes and plasmonics which are basically just waveforms that happen on the surface of metals they explain why this is true again if we go back to the analogy of the waterfall and edes and and Swirls and whirlpools that you&#x27;ve all seen in the ocean at times and in ponds sometimes and anywhere where water&#x27;s moving water&#x27;s draining you need the defects because the defects pin down the vortex to a localized place it localized IES the energy and this is why if you had nothing in the river you wouldn&#x27;t get any of these Vortex you need some rocks there some imperfections so basically we found out that the imperfections you need to get the cold fusion process working are necessary so that the vortices localize and act to affect all the other little gears all the way down the chain to the atomic level so this particular piece of information explains a lot about how cold fusion and loner might work but it doesn&#x27;t end there because if you&#x27;ve been following my work for any amount of time you&#x27;ll know that I&#x27;m interested in crop circles I&#x27;m interested in why crop circles affect our cameras and batteries like we found over many years of going over to England and going into many many crop circles and if you just go to this link above I have a page that just shows videos I&#x27;ve taken of people&#x27;s batteries and cameras failing when I just happened to be there just when someone said hey my camera just stopped working as soon as they came into a crop circle or my batteries just died or something weird is happening to my electronic device I&#x27;ve seen this happen many times but what I&#x27;ve been wondering is how does the process work well this might explain the same sort of effect because if you think about it the crop circle we found that what makes the crop circle seem electromagnetically active is if they&#x27;re built in a certain shape certain spiral shape and have a ratio of smaller spirals to mediumsized Spirals to larger ones all nested with in each other in a fractal like way within the field this suggests that the energy could move from the level of light because the wheat uh operates through a process like any plant does of taking in light and converting it to energy photosynthesis perhaps the opposite of the lener reaction but still very similar it takes a very small scale reaction like light and moves it through the wheat through some sort of process of motion through the wheat stems through the field as a whole and ends up generating a higher frequency uh type of energy on the electromagnetic scale moving from light to some sort of electromagnetic level where it actually interacts with our batteries our cameras and so forth so I think this idea of uh Vortex nanog Gear transmission plasmonic Optical tornadoes could go a long way to explaining a lot of these very weird phenomena we&#x27;ve seen particularly having to do with crop circles in this case perhaps with cold fusion too and it really all comes down to a very simple concept again resonance the idea that energy can move up and down the scale of matter and now that we have some sort of idea of how this works the author of this paper suggests it could happen in many different types of systems maybe this is what we&#x27;re seeing in these resonant effects that previously have been attributed to Paranormal causes really have a solid scientific explanation it&#x27;s just an explanation that we haven&#x27;t really thought very much before because we&#x27;ve been so focused on the electromagnetic side of things rather than on the model that looks more like things as waves hydrodynamics and mechanical motion so another process that this Optical tornado Theory might explain is even something like remote viewing resonant viewing because if you think about it we found that RV works at any scale you remember the test they did back with Ingo Swan at SRI they had him and his colleague Hela Hamid and others view micro dots these are tiny little dots that can&#x27;t be seen with the naked eye but that have a picture in them you know it&#x27;s a way to move information around without most people being able to see it and Ingo was able to view we told view these micro dots just as well as he could view large siiz objects how is that possible you could view something on the smallest scale just as well as something on the huge scale well perhaps we&#x27;re dealing with a scale-free process similar to this where things can move up the scale of energy down the scale of energy through this type of nanog gear transmission something like that and the Energy Information move up and down and get Scaled up or down just like that so perhaps this Theory also explains other processes that involve resonance like RV so you know one of the interesting implications of This research that I&#x27;m always uh thinking about I think is pretty cool is that the idea that systems that have imperfections and defects working better than systems that are perfect is really counterintuitive it goes against a lot of what you and I learned in school it&#x27;s basically that systems some systems work a lot better I mean orders of magnitude better when they have imperfections and defects in them than if they&#x27;re smooth and work exactly the way you think they should work so just think about that for a second is that the things that are linear don&#x27;t work as well as things that are bumpy and have lots of defects in them it&#x27;s a really counterintuitive idea but one of the implications of this type of work any guys it&#x27;s very exciting uh the developments in cold fusion and lener are happening on a weekly basis now and who knows by the end of the year we may have another type of technology to generate our energy and perhaps this is why it works so any case I thought you&#x27;d find that interesting uh any questions feel free to contact me thanks again for listening and we&#x27;ll see you next time take care for now and bye okay that&#x27;s good</p>
