            <p>Transcriber: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Fourth and nineteen, folks, they&#x27;ve gotta have a play as time&#x27;s ticking away because they&#x27;ve got to stay in this ball game, they&#x27;ve got to win. They come out lined up in the empty set, three receivers to the right, two to the left. Defense looks like they&#x27;re gonna to man up with no safety. This is the exact offensive match-up that they want: the best receiver lined up against the linebacker.</p>
<p>Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun. He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot, he&#x27;s looking for an opening. There&#x27;s a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush. He&#x27;s looking down field. He&#x27;s got the inside receiver making a cut.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s got a step on the linebacker. Quarterback has a beat on it. He lets the ball go, it&#x27;s in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender. He&#x27;s got it beat! He&#x27;s out in front, racing for the ball! It&#x27;s coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen! He&#x27;s at the ten, five! Touchdown! Unbelievable play! Now, wait a minute. Of course, it&#x27;s believable, it&#x27;s physics, specifically the differences between scalars and vectors.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s just see that replay. &quot;Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun.&quot; Stop. See, measurements are defined as two different quantities. Scalars are measurements with only numbers, and vectors are measurements with direction. For example, when that quarterback takes the snap, he&#x27;s five yards away, but from where? Back from the line of scrimmage, so the five yards by itself is a scalar quantity.</p>
<p>When you add a direction, like five yards deep, it becomes a vector quantity. Five yards - scalar, five yards deep - vector. OK, go ahead. &quot;He takes a snap, drops three steps. He plants his back foot, he&#x27;s looking for an opening.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush.&quot; Whoa! Here&#x27;s a difference between distance and displacement. Distance is a measurement without identifying where you moved. It&#x27;s a scalar quantity. When the quarterback makes a three-step drop, he moves about three yards back. When he moves about another three yards forward, when he steps up into the pocket, so that quarterback moves a total distance of six yards.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a distance, that&#x27;s a scalar. Now, displacement is a vector quantity, describing about how far out of place the object is. So the quarterback dropped back three yards and then moved back forward three yards, he&#x27;s in the exact same place where he started. So, his displacement is zero yards. Distance - six yards, displacement - zero yards.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s look at what happened next. &quot;Quarterback has a beat on it, he let&#x27;s the ball go! It&#x27;s in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender.&quot; Stop. So, here&#x27;s speed and velocity, but let&#x27;s just do one thing at a time. So, speed is measurement without direction, it&#x27;s a scalar quantity. Velocity is a vector quantity.</p>
<p>It is that object&#x27;s speed, but with a direction of motion. So the receiver accelerates away, gaining both speed and distance. This takes the receiver 5 seconds to run those 50 yards. So his average speed, in any given time, is 10 yards/second. The linebacker tries to keep up, but his overall speed is slower, he only goes 35 yards in those 5 seconds, so his average speed is only 7 yards/second.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re both traveling in a forward direction, so their velocity is also positive. You can&#x27;t go from resting to your peak speed immediately. You&#x27;ve got to build up to it. This is acceleration. At first the linebacker can keep up with that receiver, but eventually the faster receiver pulls away.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s acceleration, the change in speed over time. Acceleration is a vector quantity. It describes a rate at which an object changes velocity. Like velocity, acceleration is a vector. It happens in a direction.</p>
<p>So let&#x27;s just look at that play just one more time. &quot;Quarterback steps back to receive the ball, five yards deep in the gun.&quot; Vector! &quot;He takes a snap, drops three steps, he plants his back foot. He&#x27;s looking for an opening. There&#x27;s a blitz coming off the edge! He steps up to avoid the rush.&quot; Displacement! &quot;He&#x27;s got the inside receiver making a cut. He&#x27;s got a step on the linebacker.</p>
<p>The quarterback has a beat on it. He let&#x27;s the ball go! It&#x27;s in the air! Receiver is out in front of the defender!&quot; Velocity! &quot;He&#x27;s got it beat! He&#x27;s out in front, racing for the ball! It&#x27;s coming down! He cradles it at the fifteen, he&#x27;s at the ten, five!&quot; Acceleration! &quot;Touchdown! Unbelievable play! That was a great play as time expired, resulting in the touchdown and ultimately the win and pure effort.&quot; And pure science.</p>
