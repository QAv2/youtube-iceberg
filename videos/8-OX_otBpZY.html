            <p>the double slit experiment is the classic experiment that shows this superposed Behavior if we send a single elron from a cathode through a double slit one at a time the individual electrons will resolve on the far fluorescent screen seemingly randomly but if you send many electrons through the slits over and over again you&#x27;ll begin to see a pattern a wave interference pattern this pattern is similar to that observed when waves interfere with each other after they go through two slits with single Quantum objects like electrons this can only happen if the electron goes through both slits at the same time and interferes with itself what&#x27;s remarkable and proves the superposition argument is that if we measure which slit the electron goes through the interference pattern disappears so this shows that something happens to the electron when a measurement or interaction takes place</p>
