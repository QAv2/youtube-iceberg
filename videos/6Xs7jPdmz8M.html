holds a phd in general engineering from kennedy western university m.a in physics from suny at buffalo a bs in physics and bs and electrical engineering from suny at buffalo and he is a licensed professional engineer with the state of new york so tom welcome sir let me let me unmute you and then i will hand it right over to you okay and yeah tom you&#x27;re still muted sir oh sorry uh tom thank you now we got it sorry yeah i was unmuted before and somebody no that was me i&#x27;m my apologies sir um i&#x27;m also interested in recording just my session but you have to give me permission apparently uh yes um so i&#x27;ll wait just a second for the host to take control allow to record multi there there we go okay i&#x27;ll do it again great well i&#x27;m tom vallone from integrity research institute and i&#x27;m happy to share this updated um slideshow on electrogravidix electrokinetics and basically propellant was propulsion this is actually a slideshow given at the aia conference and i think i should share my screen that would probably be a nice thing for everybody and so let&#x27;s see if i can actually do that as well yeah there we go okay and you can see the title slide and i even have a little cursor too and pointed stuff so this slideshow was given at the aia proceedings in 2008 and also the university of maryland 2012. and and also it was basically presented in written form in a few different journals as well so um without further ado let&#x27;s see if i can forward this using my arrows there we go so the publication into 2012 is on sciencedirect.com in case you&#x27;re interested that&#x27;s open access um proceedings excuse me and it was done for a specif the space propulsion energy sciences international forum and have to give credit to glenn robertson who really did an excellent job for years in hosting that competition to safe which uh certainly was and the fact that we got into an el severe publication afterwards uh i thought was very impressive so um kudos to glenn roberson who&#x27;s also with us today and then in 2015 i was able to produce a review of the uh updated electro genetics electro kinetics which you&#x27;ll see today and the journal of geosciences was doing a special one in gravity so i felt compelled to participate and actually it was amazing that this article has had the largest downloads and views that the journal has ever had so i get about once a month the interest and invitation to come back and give them some more good stuff which hopefully someday i will so yeah as you can see it&#x27;s uh scirp.org um is the open access paper as well for this topic and then also it was interesting that um takashi amusha from japan and pinero basically invited me to be part of their nova publishers hardcover and this was a very interesting collection of papers i did the intro and also one further down on gravity and electrolytics as well and it&#x27;s a hardcover book nicely bound certainly a collector&#x27;s item so in starting with the history of electrovitix we have to give credit for the 1918 professor neifer in electrical experimenter first describing this possibility of electricity having an effect on propulsion so electrogravidix is hard to define because we&#x27;re not showing uh or demonstrating a clear in interference or effect on the gravitational field per se so in general most of the slideshow and most of the patents by thomas and brown basically deal with electrokinetics and i have an interesting story to tell you about electro kinetics the actual phrase that he uses so in the 1920s townsend brown finds that a coolidge tube exhibits a thrust when uh turned on and this would be basically the effect that was an impetus for tons of brown to be involved in further experiments so in 1928 he got his first patent the british 300 311 and uh this is still an interesting uh first attempt at talking about gravitators so the whole pattern is very fascinating i reproduced the entire thing um in the first volume which you see at the bottom here on the left electrode systems this is redone um a few years back when uh paula violet pulled the b-52 article and put it in his book which i&#x27;ll show you in a second but it still contains lots of great historical stuff including the two aviation studies reports which really form the basis for this phrase electropolitics because that&#x27;s what they used in the title of the report but in between here we see this very intriguing article in science and invention how i control gravitation and that&#x27;s reproduced in the second volume electricity ii because basically i feel that we finally figured out how towns and brown control gravity even though he didn&#x27;t know at the time and kept expressing that problem that he had in understanding the effects that he was measuring so i invite you to visit the website thomastownsbrown.com um it&#x27;s an amazing collection first of all of all his patents which is exciting and um and basically lots of other good stuff that you can also see from historical information so to show you just a couple pages worth of what electrogrammatic systems entailed in 1956 this was obtained through an interlibrary loan um it&#x27;s been a few years now um when when i worked on the project which was retyping typesetting the original report that i found in a very obscure source paula violet actually i think found this one from wright-patterson air force base through interlibrary loan so this was also interesting because it also had i think it was on the left side here the title page the word confidential um for many years and the title here basically is electromagnetic systems examination of electrostatic motion dynamic counterberry which is a great tongue twister and very central control so this aviation studies limited is still in existence and in business in london we&#x27;ve contacted them found that they were no longer interested in this topic but they acknowledged the fact that they had published it so it&#x27;s not something obscure or disavowed and just one little segment of the intro from the report gives you a flavor for what this um i would say excitement was all about back in the 50s 1956 and there were two reports one in the spring one in the fall and what we see here is that towns of brown sought to improve upon various proposals for electrostatic motors which you see in one of his patents the rigs they&#x27;re talking about are these carousels merry-go-rounds that you worked on you&#x27;ll see in the picture in a second and the rotating around the central tower uh input down the arms basically that&#x27;s it but the massive k or dielectric constant was essentially talked about a lot in in 1952 or 56 there basically was a problem in obtaining anything that had sufficient 5000 or higher dielectric constant so what you see is the proposal later on in the report of a saucer having this supersonic ability and that was their goal and all the aeronautics companies at that time it wasn&#x27;t aerospace to just aeronautics companies uh lockheed and uh new year and so forth they were all in into this project they all have their own uh r d uh feet in the fire to to compete with each other to see who could maximize the effects but in the meantime in a few years from there in 1960 we see brown and bonson having their own lab and and developing a dozen patents or more on what they called electrokinetics and this patent 2 958 790 shows you how complex some of the services three different domes lots of information intriguing on board high voltage generators and so forth and some of these reports that were not able to be put in the book but were collected into other reports is first of all the color booklet that&#x27;s available on amazon t-towns of brown&#x27;s research which has some of the latest photos thanks and credit to all of bilat from obtaining them from france and also some of the thomson brown lab video stills as well as quite a few other things that are worth looking at and this this sells very well in fact the project monk montgolfier is probably the source of the interest in that but i also call your attention to this interesting report by the military in 1952 and this is exactly what they call it a special inquiry um dealing with towns of brown the electro gravity device of townsend brown and that&#x27;s also available on amazon well quoting from that report um what we find is i find it humorous i&#x27;m sorry but to see the military get upset and angry or unscrewed i think is exciting so okay here&#x27;s the quote um basically on our office of naval research called it an electro gravity device and that&#x27;s where the title comes from this is the device they&#x27;re talking about one that he uh eventually did patent but in the meantime uh talking to admiral arthur radford who later became joint chiefs of staff of president eidenhauer and general petraeus basically the um admiral was frightened that a flying saucer test were being done by a private group in 1952 so yes we got to take it out of their hands and put it in the safe deposit box at low an hour and now we move on to the present day and essentially the work here basically is credited to paula violet again and this i found very intriguing and even to this day it seems still valid and viable has does the b2 have classified technology well interestingly enough even people that have worked on the don&#x27;t know about the classified high voltage propulsion possibilities even though they acknowledge all the different components that are involved so what you see in the 1994 photo of the b2 was the visible layer of uranium oxide dielectric which had the high diabolical constant that was desirable back in the 50s and paul drew this very interesting diagram of the charge flowing from the flame jet generator out the back and the high voltage from the front well the modern day photo doesn&#x27;t show any color difference between leading edge high voltage and the rest of the craft tom i&#x27;m sorry if i could jump in real quick um your voice is a little faint is there a way that you could get a little closer to your mic oh of course and i&#x27;m terribly sorry for interrupting okay yeah i&#x27;m using the camera mike um so is that any better if i&#x27;m a little bit closer there yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a little bit better thank you sir sure um so what i wanted to share with you is a little anecdote that happened to me since i knew a couple people at the department of energy well essentially the question was is this high voltage design that you see up here from one of brown&#x27;s patents uh and enhanced by paul to explain where the negative charges come from the question is does this preposition system even have any evidence well i had a friend that actually lives out in the eastern country area east of washington dc and he works for doe so he&#x27;d keep in touch with anything of interest in the new energy area well one night he was outside and he saw a b2 fly overhead toward one of the air force bases nearby and he said since it was at night he could actually see the blue glow on the leading edge of the wings so i said yep there we go leading edge ionizer and what we find as we move along here is that there&#x27;s two explanations for it one is that this charge flow does obey townsend brown&#x27;s discovery that this would produce an ion effect of calcium and and also there&#x27;s an effect on laminating the airflow as well so this is a two twofold benefit but it was great to get an eyewitness and that we reproduced that story in one of the electrolytics books so here we see the diagrams that paul developed and are now reprinted in his book secrets of anti-gravity propulsion i highly recommend this book it&#x27;s a very great compilation of some of the most intriguing and classified some of the classified information especially when you deal with ufo propulsion various multi-layer artifacts that seem to have electrolytic capability all of that is in the book and and of course some of these diagrams deal with the b2 as well so it&#x27;s a great source of information and research now in this slide what we see is that the air force research lab which is i find a very intriguing laboratory because basically they tend to have classified and unclassified research projects the fact is that they probably developed this electrovitix years before but the unclassified part of the lab didn&#x27;t know about it didn&#x27;t have need to know and so here they are in 2003 reinventing the high voltage laminar flow discovery which is kind of ironic but it was nice to see that at least it&#x27;s in the public domain so you can visibly see the difference with zero voltage you can visibly see the turbulence from probably a little bit of smoke that they&#x27;re introducing to make it visible on a wing uh simulator in a wind tunnel tunnel and then at 17 000 volts what we see is a very laminar flow of air over the wing so it reduces drags uh creates laminar flow and that as i say is one of the benefits of having a high voltage applied to the um to the craft so here we try to separate in some degree the electrokinetics from electrophoretics but they sort of overlap and basically uh i think electrokinetics is a more generalized phrase to be using when we&#x27;re talking about this type of phenomenon so bifeld is the university professor who really helped thomson brown along with his experiments and then project winter haven was the focus of attention by the military in 1952 and also the aviation studies report and then we see 60-65 lots of brown patents being developed and bouncing got involved as well and then by 2004 even nasa got involved as well and we&#x27;ll show you some of those patent covers as well me the discoveries basically can be summarized in i would say a few different parts uh part one might be the early 1957 filing of electro kinetic apparatus that brown developed and here you see the positive charge on the leading edge and the laminar flow going out the back the basic idea that he developed was to have a wire suspended by an insulator as as the leading edge part of it and larry davenport actually developed and built one of these carousels and married around so it worked pretty well there&#x27;s a youtube video that shows him demonstrating it and i was fortunate enough to buy one of his small tabletop devices from him so the greatest force is on the capacitor if the small electrode is positive the effect occurs in a dielectric medium which is air and can be used for vehicle propulsion or even to pump a dielectric fluid and here we see the part two i would say would be the electrokinetic transducer and this is a patent 3018394 and it basically has the same images as the first one that we described and the important part is that we&#x27;re also discovering that the dielectric medium is moved relative to the pairs of electrodes and and this external mechanical force is the intriguing part of the scientific investigation and a variation on the potential uh results in a variation of the force so that&#x27;s a good confirmation that there are two the two are correlated the third part here i would say would be the further patent the 187 206 and this is where he starts shaping the leading edge to propel the device through the surroundings and essentially provide the electrostatic filled field gradient which in this case would be more non-linear and and then there&#x27;s lots of considerations for permittivity and permeability and well here the office of naval research provides a tremendous insight into the work that they have done in experimenting with the voltage versus propulsion propulsion is on a this is a log law graph and we&#x27;re looking at propulsion efficiency and percentage on the left side coordinate and the kilovolts in the x-axis on the right side here and then disk speed is also graphed on the right so it&#x27;s a three-prong attack on the different information that would that they&#x27;re providing well the important part i thought was the disk speed which is lower b and the voltage which it turns out they&#x27;ve measured a fifth power dependence so that&#x27;s pretty incredible that um a fifth power would would actually be um related to the velocity so as we increase the voltage a little bit we&#x27;re getting a lot more bang for our buck apparently and the efficiency goes up as well as we obviously that graph is also going upwards too so what i found recently was that the army research lab had also done some work and i was able to obtain the force on an asymmetric capacitor that bathroom fasci produced from the air force research lab which was here in college park actually in maryland and their discernment and the various analysis which you&#x27;ll see coming up here is that ion mobility was basically the source of the force uh the townsend brown developed and they&#x27;re talking about one pound per kilowatt or five newtons per kilowatt uh reduced chip and here are some of the flyers that they started with and you&#x27;ll recognize them probably from tim ventura&#x27;s original investigations and videos that he used to provide they don&#x27;t like the triangular one that the tim&#x27;s famous for calling it the not a vigorous flyer but for this relatively the same voltage their square device actually seemed to hover very vigorously so their reports are reproduced in the second volume of electrolubetics the second book and the further wing-shaped asymmetric capacitor which is sort of a flat surface design actually they claim was best even though the current was quite high got a half an amp here but the force on the capacitor greatly exceeded its weight and that&#x27;s of course what they&#x27;re excited about but imagining the the 38 gauge wire they have to deal with is pretty unusual too but that&#x27;s the apparently the ratio that seems to relate to the best force that they can produce so so here&#x27;s the analysis that the air force research lab went through to try to figure out what&#x27;s causing the force uh the proposed explanation for it initially was iron ionic wind and you see that in various assessments of towns and brown oh it&#x27;s just dying wind you know and yet it works in a vacuum so that&#x27;s the surprise that we found thousand brown was able to provide so the first step is uh what do we find from analyzing the ion wind hypothesis well taking kinetic energy relating it to the force on a charge basically then the force is exerted on the capacitor through the current flowing through a capacitor gap through the ions obviously and then solving the first equation using two to get the upper limit on the force basically then we&#x27;re looking at the mass f equals mg moon&#x27;s law and then the mass of the iron wind basically uh lifting uh how much could it lift if the ion wind is due just to electrons and you get very small almost micrograms of force less than a microgram and if the ion willing is due to copper ions coming off from the wire then we&#x27;ve at least got milligrams but still you can&#x27;t even lift the three to five grams that the flyer consists of so they move on to part b and part b we&#x27;re looking at electron drift as a possible one and so their analysis is that the wire is 2500 times um the electric field in other words is 2500 times larger than the rounded electrode and you guys probably know the fact that as you go to a point you can concentrate an electric field tremendously and that&#x27;s the basis for this analysis so the smaller we make the radius of the wire the more intense the field can be from the wire and then the foil electrode radius is used we&#x27;re looking at the electric field ratio which is around ten to the seventh volts per meter and there&#x27;s also a footnote here dealing with the other net force on asymmetric capacitors and drift transport that people can research if they&#x27;re interested so for a vacuum capacitor the net force is the sum of the surface integrals over each electrode and we&#x27;re looking at the electron mobility uh this is a fixed constant and if it&#x27;s nitrogen ions or oxygen ions it&#x27;s around 2.5 instead of 670. obviously because it&#x27;s a little bit heavier quite a bit heavier and so the net force due to electron mobility is still in the millinewton range um and if it&#x27;s lift due to drift of electrons we&#x27;re still in the small milligram range so this ion mobility idea didn&#x27;t seem to carry a lot of weight and in fact this was electron drift that we&#x27;re talking about so and tom again i&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re fading out a little bit so again if you could just try and speak up a little bit more you&#x27;re getting faint okay but my apologies yeah i&#x27;m trying my best so um the negative uh ion drift with ion mobility is the final stage of their analysis and what&#x27;s interesting about this is now we get into a force due to nitrogen ions or oxygen ions in the air and we&#x27;re already at a tenth of a newton and then the mass lift due to mobility of nitrogen ions which is basically the correct order of magnitude um about 16 grams so their conclusion is that ion mobility is the appropriate quantity for derivation of the static special ground not for kinetic force and the force scales inversely with ion mobility so this is also important because electrons apparently are not contributing to the force as much as negative ions and here we have a famous image which you&#x27;ve seen from years ago um where the timber ensure skyhook lifter is taking off american gravity was the source of inspiration worldwide for it and i believe we have a video too that we can show you with this thing actually flying around there it goes off to mars i i can jump in i guess because that&#x27;s my video tom stepped away so that&#x27;s a uh that&#x27;s a three foot lifter actually that was back when i lived in seattle uh it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s any interior cells on that but there may be uh that was on my back porch um the three foot one lifted very well a lot of it was kind of related to how much the power supply could output um the the largest the the largest that i built was nine feet the largest that flew well was four feet so you had a four foot lifter as well was that this one yeah yeah that that was the four foot lifter i actually built uh two or three different versions of that they all pretty much looked identical i don&#x27;t know if you could tell them apart by looking um yeah so what i was using was um i was using a 50 kilovolt i don&#x27;t remember what the um i don&#x27;t remember what the output was but it was a 50 kilovolt power supply from information unlimited and i bypassed the output voltage regulator on it what that did was it let the voltage flow the lifter itself is basically a resistor and so it let the lifter determine its own voltage we did a bunch of measurements on it i think it preferred or something around 30 kilovolts um but i found that it did vary a little bit depending on you know temperature humidity air pressure all that kind of stuff so again that&#x27;s that&#x27;s another three foot ones but i&#x27;m sorry i didn&#x27;t mean to interrupt you tom yeah no that&#x27;s great i i wanted a soundtrack for it as well so um but in general there&#x27;s a wire somewhere suspended above it two wires yeah so actually um basically what you can&#x27;t see in those especially with that resolution that was for for that time that was high res for digital video but um so there are three pieces of sewing thread just regular black sewing thread that i would tie it down with typically i would make those four to six feet um and i would tie them around the post the corners and then just run them down to pieces of tape on the deck um i ended up using duct tape actually one that when the lifter comes up comes up with enough force that it can break the thread or break the wires so sometimes yeah i would use fishing line but so we would tie it down a lot of people back then right when we were doing headlines and stuff a lot of people would accuse us of lifting it up which i always thought was funny because we weren&#x27;t tying it up we were tying it down right and and the reason was you can see in that one there were a couple of wires there that was just copper magnet wire from radio shack so nothing special it leaked like crazy it did have a coating on it but it did leak like crazy um i would suspend those from the side and let them drape so the if if you put them above the lifter it can cause problems it can hit your corona wire and stuff like that so kind of suspending them from the side and letting them drape and then you give them enough slack that it can go up you know typically i would run these things four to six feet off the ground i think the highest i ever had one go was eight or nine feet and and after that you run into issues just lots of issues just maintaining stability with it um then i think the other thing that it might be worth noting is um we we played with lots of different corona wire bob iannini gave me 50 gauge stainless steel corona wire and we found that that worked better than anything else partly because of the very fine gauge that helped i also noticed that when you&#x27;re using copper corona wire it has some kind of a chemical reaction with the air and it&#x27;s noisy as heck and it gives off more of a glow and there&#x27;s all sorts of issues with it so the stainless steel wire seemed like the ions would come right off that the charge the charge flow was really smooth we didn&#x27;t have any any real issues interesting and plus it wouldn&#x27;t corrode which is also a very nice benefit as well no oxidation to reduce the connectivity that&#x27;s great thanks tim oh sure thing so as we move on to the recent developments we see serrano woodward and campbell campbell&#x27;s from nasa contributing to this science more substantially and campbell&#x27;s patent here is the 775-123 that we&#x27;re referring to having the same design as townsend brown but four with the positive charge plate rather than a wire so that&#x27;s a slight difference and serrano seemed to like the idea of multi-stages uh whether or not that functioned very well i haven&#x27;t seen a report on serrano&#x27;s work to verify that but we see from woodward&#x27;s work his results were very small and also has a very unusual piezoelectric device that&#x27;s involved as well so here we see john lee and maudan&#x27;s attempt to replicate campbell&#x27;s patent with a surface electrode a flat surface electrode and then the negatively charged base and you can see the little gif up in the corner and what we see in the graph here which i just inserted recently to give you some of the data that he produced is the linear speed goes upwards on the y-axis and the time basically is on the x-axis so apparently the device seems to increase over a period of 8 000 seconds until it finally levels off in its speed so it&#x27;s basically providing a pretty interesting acceleration a constant acceleration up to a point and so this is available at his website uh jlnlabs.org and i got to give that a lot of credit every single device we&#x27;ve ever heard of or even wonder if it works he&#x27;ll go ahead and build it and test it and publish it so his website is very good for information like this and here we see another the patent that i referring to as well 317 310 having the same design for the different patent that was awarded same structure in other words and this from 2001. hollow cylinder or a solid cylinder basically is what he&#x27;s describing so nasa must have felt that this had some useful and viable applications in their work and particularly for space which also gives more credibility to brown&#x27;s discovery that works in a vacuum now woodward is a professor at california state university i&#x27;ve talked to him personally he basically is funded to do this work and yet the production and the results seem to be very minuscule uh micro newtons in other words is what he&#x27;s producing even a substantial voltage and high high frequency as well so the voltage is up to around 600 volts basically he&#x27;s expanding contracting the distances between the masses positively negatively charged so there&#x27;s a lot of questions about whether or not he&#x27;s influencing inertia and that&#x27;s his basic claim is that he can modify inertia by this action well one of the interesting developments in producing the second volume of electrogravidix was essentially to look at all the unresolved uh electrogravitic experiments that i had witnessed for decades prior to this um really we&#x27;re talking about the two volumes of turk that i put together the two volumes of work basically were the electromedics one and two electrolytics one came out in 1994 and electro vedic&#x27;s two i&#x27;m looking at it right now 2004. so they&#x27;re about 10 years apart and what i found in 2004 was i really wanted to provide an introduction that would summarize the work of these scientists including rudolph sensor rudolph sensor produced this very unusual uh arrangement of two electrodes in water that essentially were put on a balance beam which i&#x27;ll show you in a second here and he produced six newtons per watt not per kilowatt like the afl was doing but uh six newtons per watt and at the time i was very intrigued because even the inertial propulsion devices like michael campbell&#x27;s going to talk about um are better than what the dc-9 jet at the time was producing which i was able to find the numbers for uh the dc-9 airplane is essentially producing milli newtons per watt 16 millimeters per watt so it&#x27;s amazing that that all of these devices uh surpass what commercially is available at even perhaps even today so here we go the zinser device uses a patented sawtooth pulse generator i saw him in 1980 in germany and he also presented at the non-conventional energy technology conference in 1981 in toronto and these are quarter wavelength electric codes at 100 kilohertz and even george hathaway became involved in the work this report&#x27;s available on amazon it&#x27;s basically a book and eventually might be published as a book right now it&#x27;s a staple report and what we see is insert sawtooth generator here these are photographs supplied by him i was one of his best fans so he sent me all these color images and data and information on what he did and here&#x27;s the balance beam there&#x27;s the transducer and when he turns it on it basically unbalances everything and you can see a vertical force from this and the whole basis of this was that it was unexplained uh it&#x27;s almost like william shatner&#x27;s show on the unexplained it disqualified for that and and it had this very interesting characteristic just like thomas brown reports and how he control gravitation then when he turns it on the force increases when he turns it off it slowly decreases so there wasn&#x27;t much of a storage effect and and and here he&#x27;s talking about micronewton&#x27;s that he measured but the wattage that went in is very small so what i&#x27;m getting to is the fact that um i was perplexed by all of these experiments towns and browns finding that the best forest was when he turned it on and also densers having a similar effect well i looked up on the shelf and saw jeff menkel&#x27;s book causality electromagnetic induction gravitation i thought well maybe jeff menkel&#x27;s got something he&#x27;s a professor west virginia university i was fortunate enough to get his electrostatic motors book from him to reproduce before he passed away so we&#x27;re happy to keep that in print he was a genius really and he also explored atmospheric electricity better than anybody else i would say so the important part here though is jeff amenko&#x27;s understanding of what he called the electrokinetic equation and so i even wrote to him when i found this book and started reading it i said did you know that townsend brown also use the same phrase and has a phenomenon that seems to have the same mirrored effect that your equation&#x27;s describing he said no i never heard of him so here&#x27;s two parallel geniuses developing the same thing calling it the same thing and yet basically they never met never knew each other never corresponded so what we find here is the big insight i&#x27;m talking about parallel plates um you&#x27;ve got x distance and w for the width of the plates dc power and here&#x27;s jeff menkel&#x27;s equation for that x over w and d i dt now the important part is this is a reverse electric field will produce a backward force and it&#x27;s relying upon the idt so the important part here is the faster the current surges into those plates the more force you&#x27;re going to get he likes to use the electro electro-kinetic field but you essentially can look at it in terms of the force and the change in momentum the equation up at the top and the right also helps explain in terms of vector potential and then there&#x27;s various forms of integration as well so this was the insight that i found i was very excited about it i still am today and i basically give him all the credit to discovering and explaining theoretically with lots of examples in the book of how this uh electrokinetic effect can actually rely upon a surging pulse current and to me this is the biggest insight fully explains zlinzer&#x27;s effect even the polarity of it the force on those parallel plates that we saw in water uh essentially is going in the opposite direction of the electric field that&#x27;s being induced and so i&#x27;m summarizing the effect that jeff menkel discovered right here a fast pulse current with short rise time will produce the largest force on any length element uh dl there are and it&#x27;s basically a minus sign so here&#x27;s the book the cover it&#x27;s still in print um the company actually i think it&#x27;s on amazon as well we also sell it integrity research has it on our website since we&#x27;re able to get it from the publisher and essentially it is um a spin-off from his textbook on electromagnetic fields he taught e m for years at the university but he then extrapolated to the electrokinetic effect in this book and also paul murad loves his co-gravitational effect that&#x27;s also in the second half of the book so this diagram kind of summarizes you&#x27;ve got two for the price of one in this book you&#x27;ve got gravitational stuff and this amazing electro kinetic information so one of the suggestions i make is that even the schleicher patent um with the pulsed rise times here might be the type of force waveform that would optimize the electrokinetic results and now let&#x27;s go back to townsend brown who is our hero and the main focus of our investigation and what we see in his report how i control gravity 1929 which is as they say reproduce in the second volume we see brown reporting the fact that he&#x27;s looking at the 120 volts that he&#x27;s supplying to 44 pound suspended weights with a glass rod insulator in between and essentially we&#x27;re looking at the direction of movement of the entire system toward the positive however the voltage that he&#x27;s supplying and the current would be going the opposite direction and what he reports also with this torsion balance as well is that you&#x27;ve got current going in one direction and the movement going in the opposite direction current going backwards force going forward towards the positive and what brown reports in print in this article reprieve repeatedly is that i kept the voltage on i expected it to stay suspended in the direction that it was going but it didn&#x27;t it only moved when i turned the thing on and he basically is at a conundrum expresses his frustration that he can&#x27;t figure out why the electro-kinetic force is is so momentary well now we know from jeff manco&#x27;s discovery that this is to be expected as the surge of current goes into the electrodes that&#x27;s the only time the force is uh observed and i think we might actually have an insight into the serial effect essentially what you see in these levitating craft is the little he basically had levers all the way around but only turned on i would say a third of them approximately a third were opened to create a break in the voltage and you have to imagine if if serial was possibly credible in producing high voltage from the center to the outer edge that by interrupting the voltage distribution at one side only he basically could create this separation of charge that essentially would obey the townsend brown effect the the field ground effect of electro kinetics where one side will be more positive than the other and so maybe the soil effect is also to be contributed and and credited back to the towns of brown uh discovery and the jeff mecco discovered that well one more report that we see from takaki musha from the honda corporation is his experiment and derivation of another coupling he claims between electricity and gravity which he called obviously electrolytics as well and the i would say the 1929 paper talks about the fact that closer capacitor plates are important higher capacitance of dielectric is important the area the voltage and mass between the plates all these contribute to dealing for good horitic effect well musha does a little derivation here and then shows you his experiments and we basically are looking at a generalized lorentz force which he adds the electromagnetic and what we call this magneto-prophetic effect which may relate to what dr nina lee was also proposing and when he basically then adds them uh talks about a static atom being force-free like a superconductor inside the charged particle with an external electric field and then do introducing electrophobic potential which is this p sub g he then goes through his boundary conditions and displacement of charge to come up with what he describes as a displacement of the atom itself this is i i find an unusual analysis but intriguing in some regards so his diagrams which are also reproduced show the displacement of electrons around the nucleus becoming slightly displaced in the presence of high voltage which is feasible and understandable and probably realistic so to further his derivation he comes up with the electrogrammatic force from displaced electrons around the nucleus uh simplified with an r0 approximation for electron radius and i&#x27;m assuming that the electron radius is bigger than the displacement which i find a big assumption who knows whether it is or not we basically come down to the domain length where the new electrolytic force generated is in 10 to the minus 22 meters which is basically smaller than the electron radius and then we&#x27;re substituting to find a force that has the area of capacitor being s and then dependent directly on it and also the mass density of the dielectric and also has atomic number dependence so he&#x27;s got an interesting equation times voltage over time and it may or may not be applicable in most experiments that we come across but here we go with the experimental results that he&#x27;s got and he&#x27;s using an insulator oil as the insulator with a plastic disc on top metal vessel high voltage generator electric balance he&#x27;s got thin copper as the conductor and he&#x27;s got some parameters about the weight and diameters he&#x27;s using almost 20 000 volts and he tries to see if there&#x27;s any difference between the positive or negative voltage and to be honest i&#x27;m not sure if i see a great difference here between the two of them positive voltage data is on the top with eight different trials and the negative voltage on the bottom uh with eight different trials and we&#x27;re basically talking about a fraction of a gram on the y-axis so the weight loss is very small and possibly debatable but we basically give them credit for all this work you put it in and then essentially he&#x27;s come up with about the measured and theoretical to be very close and perhaps within the same ballpark since the ratio is near one and the coefficient can be expressed coefficient of the dielectric can be expressed with weight loss over weight of capacitor so that&#x27;s a new insight that i haven&#x27;t seen before perhaps that might be useful for further investigations and so we have a summary of the results that he&#x27;s reporting and which is talking about for a mass of 100 gram kilograms dialectical constant of only five that he&#x27;s claiming he&#x27;s got a force of 100 newtons or 22 pounds that&#x27;s pretty incredible and of course the electric field is pretty high as well 700 mega volts per meter so he&#x27;s explaining that water could be used as well which has a little bit higher dielectric than what he was using before that and he cites and references um some work by another japanese contributor which was a safe presentation on some field proposal methods from general relativity so that may be worth looking into as well so moving on to another contribution and viewpoint of electronics i was at a national space and society local chapter meeting years ago in 2006 and i was on a panel discussion with bob zubrin who you might know from nasa i was sitting right next to him so it was kind of nice i felt um interested in what he had to say i&#x27;ve always been intrigued by his mars direct approach he&#x27;s got a book out on you know going to mars and living off the land that was that was his original contribution to the trip to mars and even today i think he&#x27;s influenced the mars philosophy and plans so far so what i experienced though was a kind of a ironic situation the night before i talked to a military contractor and to this day i could pick myself for not getting his name and phone number and information so forth but he had enough budget to play around with um electro kinetics and high voltage levitation and he explained what he had done he basically and oh i didn&#x27;t tell you the whole story here okay i&#x27;m sitting at the panel discussion and bob zubrin objected to my talking about electrogrammatics i just started describing some of the experiments that now we&#x27;ve covered and then he didn&#x27;t think it was scientific enough to be included in the panel discussion so what i did was i asked joe i could call him the military contractor um joe could you stand up and tell me what you told me last night and and he stands up and he says i levitated a hockey puck and suberin went completely silent i mean this is on video i actually got the video afterwards i was so pleased um because literally he had used the same um design of townsend brown applied the kilovolts of voltage and levitated this thing called the hockey puck proved that it worked he even blew one up he said because he applied too much voltage to it and um and and then here zubrin had no information no idea of this at all but he was prejudiced and biased against it so when when this military contractor spoke um basically quieted up pretty quickly and noticed once again pulse current was used and there was an asymmetric electrode placement as well so i was pleased to have eyewitness accounts for some of these unusual findings and surprises now one other insight that i&#x27;ve obtained from the jeff menkel equation is the pipeline of capacitor array the reports are basically obtainable i believe still online these are the references for them the o2o9051 and the 0108005 they&#x27;re in the archives.org abstract physics so basically the important part i found was by cladding um who&#x27;s a professor describing the fact that as he has a glowing discharge with sparks and emanating from the superconducting uh cathode toward the anode it basically propagates beyond it in a collimated beam and so i found that i could apply the electro kinetic equation to that where the current direction seemed to be the opposite of the force that was generated as i point out here and therefore at least explain how pogba knock is obtaining this and of course he&#x27;s using half a mega volt which is pretty impressive in terms of voltage as well so maybe punk legnoff&#x27;s impulse gravity generator may have some promise even though it&#x27;s been very controversial till now and the development here in general i would say in case anyone&#x27;s doing some research theory so far is the graham and laos in nature magazine that talks about the fact that electromagnetic momentum is basically carried by the vacuum and their experiments with rotating capacitors seem to actually verify that so grain molasses is pretty famous for this discovery einstein lab also deal with magnetic dielectrics i was able to obtain their articles and then get it translated from the german and that&#x27;s in the homophobia handbook both of their articles in 1908 and also the sponsor of patent uh talking about force from the high electron current and then ning lee also did a little bit of work and publications on uh electrolytics which he calls gravitoelectric ingredient magnetic forces and we already mentioned woodward&#x27;s negative mass fluctuations so the recommendations i would make in summarizing this research is that asymmetric capacitors with pulse current deserve more attention and they really seem to have the most potential for satellite maneuvering perhaps in addition to maybe inertial potion and also the woodward experiments um if they told him directly if he angled them at 45 degrees from the vertical to get the v cross b florence force effect and also combining that with the divt electric kinetic force you might improve the results of this experiment but overall it is a complex experiment and debatable whether moving masses backward and forward uh is actually a very viable way to move big things in space and of course my standard approach and viewpoint is that we really should be lobbying the military for declassification of energy and propulsion technology that would happen faster than the average 50 years when i worked at the patent office i found that it&#x27;s called fas.org the federation of american scientists um at fas.org report every single year the 5 000 patents that are in the vault and they&#x27;ve been classified by at least one military agency that somehow makes their decision and i used to see the forums across my desk where they just simply check off their interest and then all of a sudden if they decide to withhold it then essentially i would lose that pattern to go across the street to the place where people have top secret clearances to examine these things and then once the patent was fully examined it would go in the bulb the inventor never received any compensation whatsoever and when it declassified 50 years later many of them had already passed on so this is a real problem for the past 70 years ever since 1950 we&#x27;ve seen classification of advanced energy and propulsion which essentially explains why we&#x27;re still driving around in world war ii cars there&#x27;s a story that boeing actually told me through the department of energy rep that i mentioned previously who lives in the area and he described to me one story that he had when he was working with boeing directly and they had developed a new laminar flow which may have been similar to the high voltage effect that we saw with the air force research lab later on but essentially their their development was classified and even when they applied to the air force which was their customer for permission to use it on civilian aircraft it was denied go figure you know who would ever apply to your customer for permission to use the invention you just invented but that&#x27;s what happens with the military uh where they&#x27;re controlling all the first strings so um overall the first volume electrobitic systems is still in print selling really well even 25 27 years later and the aviation studies reports the bouncing patterns the asymmetric capacitors even some of his diary is included in that uh second volume includes afl report the honda lab report biographies and the mccandless report which i&#x27;m just going to finish up in the conclusion right now with and this is the camera&#x27;s contribution to the second volume martin kamlish is a great aerospace illustrator he drew this entire diagram you&#x27;re looking at from eyewitness accounts and this was uh which is to be levitating at norton air force base in 1988 and it seems to obey the pulsed electrokinetic effect on parallel platforms and these are ultimately fired with high voltage in a triangular i would say a triad now there&#x27;s three of those plates sections are fired they move on to the next one circularly firing those three with high voltage and going around the circle so there&#x27;s a constant force downward and this obeys the same electro kinetic equation that i described earlier with false operation and what was interesting is that it was seen by a fellow named brad sorensen who was a personal friend of mark mccammish and also congressman in a hangar behind basically a closed draped area and they essentially saw three of these crafts levitating with 1950s rivets he said as some of this artwork shows you and uh and yet it still had plenty of force to to levitate it so when i contacted tail put off who had also done some due diligence on this story help and private email described to me in 2006 he says i was able to independently interview the source of the story verify indeed he did tell the story to an individual passed it on to me and number two independently interview yet another source who had heard the similar story but he always then never able to verify the story itself was true only that there were two individuals who said it was true so that put out a very cagey uh conclusion was the story remains in my gray basket is only possibly true so there you have it essentially that&#x27;s the end of the electrolytic story it&#x27;s possibly true so thank you for your attention and if you have any questions i guess we still have time to answer today well tom thank you thank you very much so let me do this first thing i want to put this on gallery view let me let me stop your screen chair okay and let me see perfect and everybody please put your hands together thank you thank you</p>
