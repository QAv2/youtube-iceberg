            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>what&#x27;s up guys my name is max i did over 13 years in the navy and i have uh quite an interest in the ufo uap stuff that&#x27;s been going on ever since david fravor came out from the nimitz saying that they spotted the tic tac ufo while training off the coast of california i&#x27;ve even seen my own uap ufo whatever you want to call it and i&#x27;ll put a link to that video right up here you guys can go check it out and let me know what you think about my own personal experience and today i&#x27;m rocking my space for shirt which you guys can pick up at skuttlebuttshow.com and you can rep for the space force and the aliens out there too so today was a congressional hearing about the uap program a tip in congress where mr moultrie and mr bray from pentagon answered questions about the uap the unmanned aerial phenomenon reports that have come out detailing over 400 reports or encounters with unknown objects in the sky many of them from the military i&#x27;m going to play you a video and react to what i think were the key takeaways from today&#x27;s congressional hearing which for the most part was eh it didn&#x27;t have too much of the politics thrown into it which i kind of like and i&#x27;m gonna leave all that stuff out of it too so if you see a politician here that you like or don&#x27;t like for today we&#x27;re gonna leave all that off the table before we jump into it make sure you guys hit that subscribe button if you&#x27;re interested at all with what&#x27;s going on with the military in general that&#x27;s what this channel is all about and i hope you stick around for more videos all right let&#x27;s get into it all right so the first thing that they do here is they have some opening statements where they establish what the point of this entire congressional hearing is and i want you guys to hear that so you know what the point of this entire thing was more than 50 years ago the u.s government ended project blue book an effort to catalog and understand sightings of objects in the air that could not otherwise be explained for more than 20 years that project had treated unidentified anomalies in our airspace as a national security threat to be monitored and investigated in 2017 we learned for the first time that the department of defense had quietly restarted a similar organization tracking what we now call unidentified aerial phenomena or uaps last year congress rewrote the charter for that organization now called the airborne object identification and management synchronization group or aim sog for short today we will bring that organization out of the shadows this hearing and oversight work has a simple idea at its core unidentified aerial phenomena are a potential national security threat and they need to be treated that way so they did say that aim sog is a name that&#x27;s probably going to change it does sound cool when they say bring it out of the shadows but when they change the name that&#x27;s one way to keep us internet sleuths off the cases to constantly change the name of the program this next topic that we&#x27;re going to address here is how many of these sightings have been made by military aircraft military ships and it makes you wonder what the purpose of that is who would have a vested interest in spying on our military just put that in the back your minds we know that our service members have encountered unidentified aerial phenomena and because uaps pose potential flight safety and general security risk we are committed to a focused effort to determine their origin it is weird that most of these sightings that we&#x27;re going to be talking about or that are getting addressed are made by military it does beg the question are these aircraft are these uaps adversarial or are they even partner force or are they some kind of darpa program that just nobody knows because it&#x27;s too top secret and they kind of hover around uh american warships and american military bases like if you already went and watched my uap encounter video you would see ours was when we were doing training on a military base but if you haven&#x27;t seen that already as soon as this video is over go check it out it&#x27;s linked in the description but whatever you guys think i&#x27;d love to hear in the comments this next one they&#x27;re going to show us one of the examples of footage that they have from one of the encounters that they cannot explain so let&#x27;s take a look at this and see what we think for example let me share with you the first video that we have here today which shows an observation in real time there it was that&#x27;s in many cases that&#x27;s all that a report may include and in many other cases we have far less than this all right so like i said here is that still frame capture is what they&#x27;re trying to show you it&#x27;s basically on on the screen for about three frames which you would you know blink and you missed it it flies across the screen you can go back and rewatch it maybe now you&#x27;ve seen this you&#x27;ll catch it when it flies by but this is in there and this is one of the things that they say they don&#x27;t know what it is they don&#x27;t know what it was doing up there but it was there people did observe it and they&#x27;re not sure what the answer is and this is the one that i believe i saw this is actually the one that i think was following us at the base that i was training out in california and you guys can go watch my video again like i said you can see what i was talking about but i don&#x27;t know what do you guys think what does this look like to you but we&#x27;re about to see here is uh representative adam schiff who actually i think a lot of people hate him and probably for good reason but he had some really good lines of questioning at this uh at this event here and one of the best parts of this whole thing and i kind of mean that you know tongue-in-cheek because it is a little embarrassing too is watching these guys try to freeze frame that and i&#x27;m gonna show you that here remember these guys are in charge of our national defense for my potential aliens mr break can you rerun that first image it looked like it was outside of a plane um and if you wouldn&#x27;t mind going up to the screen and tell us what we&#x27;re what we&#x27;re seeing and are we looking outside of a civilian aircraft window is that what we&#x27;re looking at u.s navy f-18 is that it right there can you point to the screen again what we&#x27;re supposed to be looking at okay if you could stop that frame um the laptop we&#x27;re working with uh is not as easy for us stopping that video in the right button so that&#x27;s a little bit embarrassing but hey we&#x27;ll give them it&#x27;s not their normal laptop hey you gotta give them some credit all right guys this next one you might have seen it it&#x27;s the triangle uap this is what was observed through a pair of night vision goggles and then recorded onto a electronic camera or dslr and this one they claimed that they can explain as a swarm of drones operating in the sky and then when viewed through night vision goggles and then through a digital camera created this triangle shape and they said they had been able to recreate this in laboratory type settings so you tell me do you buy that we&#x27;ve also made progress in resolving the character of a limited number of uap encounters for example let me show you a couple of another video and image taken years apart in different areas in this video u.s navy personnel recorded what appears to be triangles some flashing recorded several years ago off the coast of the united states this was recorded while the u.s navy ship observed a number of small unmanned aerial systems in the area importantly the video was taken through night vision goggles with a single lens reflex camera these remained unresolved for several years other us navy assets also observed unmanned aerial systems nearby and we&#x27;re now reasonably confident that these triangles correlate to unmanned aerial systems in the area okay i could buy that that could be an explanation for that one it is interesting because there are some secret aircraft out there that have been spotted you know people have taken photos of them or even acknowledged by the government that are triangle shaped so these could be you know u.s aircraft spy planes something like that that have been photographed through night vision goggles which you would definitely see light differently when it&#x27;s miles away through a pair of night vision goggles than you would if you could get a high resolution up close image of it it messes with your depth it messes with your focus all that okay i could buy that one for them for the majority of uh incidents that we had in the last year&#x27;s report the majority had multi-sensor data so multi-sensor data what they mean is a person witnessed it the aircraft sensor or camera witnessed it as well as radar systems witnessed it and they said that in a closed-door session that was supposed to immediately follow this they would go more into what these multi-sensor systems are that were capturing it but they did confirm in other words these are real physical objects flying through our or flying through airspace that you could reach out and touch but we just don&#x27;t know what they are one of the most interesting things from this entire thing was when they talked about how these aircraft move without any discernible means of propulsion which is a quote from here that we&#x27;re about to see and then the question was raised do we have any of these have we ever shot them down do we have any wreckage have they ever crashed have we ever observed them landing and their answers are interesting uh reportedly appear to exhibit unusual flight characteristics appear to demonstrate advanced technology and some of them appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft move against the wind maneuver abruptly or move at considerable speed without discernible means of propulsion um that&#x27;s pretty intriguing are we aware of any uh foreign adversary capable of moving objects uh without any discernible means of propulsion i think i would without discernible means of propulsion i would say that uh we&#x27;re not aware of any adversary that can move an object without discernible means of propulsion uh the question then becomes in many of these cases where we don&#x27;t have a discernible mean of propulsion in the data that we have in some cases there is likely sensor artifacts that that may be hiding some of that there&#x27;s certainly some degree of of something that looks like signature management that we have seen from some of these uh uap uh but i would i would caution i would simply say that there are a number of uh of events in which we do not have an explanation in which there are a small handful in which there are flight characteristics or signature management um that we can&#x27;t explain with the data that we have to me that&#x27;s the jackpot moment this entire hearing the discernible means of propulsion so you don&#x27;t see any exhaust you don&#x27;t see any heat coming off the thing you don&#x27;t see any props or propellers it&#x27;s just moving at very high rates of speed very acrobatically but they&#x27;re not sure how it&#x27;s going that is quite interesting and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re acknowledging here that&#x27;s what adam schiff was asking i think that out of everything that we talked about in this entire video and in this entire hearing because i&#x27;ve chopped out most of it because i didn&#x27;t think it was very interesting or it didn&#x27;t have any big revelations that acknowledgement i know this is not the first time we&#x27;ve heard it is the one that really gets my brain going like what could this be one thing that he said was observing possible signature management so what you have there is you could have the paint on the aircraft the design of the exhaust the way that it emits rf energy all these things could be mitigated so it appears propulsionless it appears not to admit any rf energy it appears to not be detectable by radar but that could all be advanced deceptive techniques that are built into these aircraft is that what it is is some country some group so advanced that are our radars which are so sophisticated you wouldn&#x27;t believe it they&#x27;re so good at tracking and picking up on things you wouldn&#x27;t believe it if they are getting defeated so frequently and easily by these aircraft well that&#x27;s quite alarming sure uh when i say uh we can&#x27;t explain i i mean exactly as you described there that there is a lot of information uh like the video that we showed in which there&#x27;s simply too little data to to create a reasonable explanation there are a small handful of cases in which we have more data that our analysis simply hasn&#x27;t been able to uh to fully pull together a picture of what happened um the um and those are the cases where we talk about where we see some indications of flight characteristics or signature management that are not what we had expected uh when it comes to material that we have we have no material we have detected no emanations uh within the uap task force that that is uh that would suggest it&#x27;s anything non-terrestrial uh in origin what are you saying there the question that you didn&#x27;t hear that he&#x27;s answering is effectively i can summarize like this they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s aliens what they&#x27;re saying is it&#x27;s not aliens it appears to be of this earth not of another planet or another dimension or anything like that we&#x27;ll see we&#x27;ll see about that um how about wreckage have we come across any wreckage of any kind of object that has now been examined by you the uap task force doesn&#x27;t have any wreckage that isn&#x27;t uh explainable that isn&#x27;t consistent with being a terrestrial origin well it&#x27;s hard for me to believe that this many aircraft of this high technological level including they cited 11 near misses air-to-air collisions with uh military aircraft and none of those have ever crashed or been you know there have been no bid air collisions or there have been no higher resolution videos or photos taken to them the whole thing is a little bit suspicious and fishy if you ask me so that leads me to the finale here of what do you guys think what do you think about ufos uaps aliens adversaries a whole bunch of nothing burgers let me know what you guys think in the comments down below i&#x27;m really curious to hear it and like i said you can pick up this space for shirt at scuttlebutt show or scuttlebuttclothing.com linked in the description down below i appreciate you guys watching this video and i would love to hear about your uap experience in the comments as well i look forward to talking to you guys very soon for now that&#x27;s the skeleton what&#x27;s up guys thanks for watching that video i hope you
