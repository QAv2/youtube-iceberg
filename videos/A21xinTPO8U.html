            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone uh welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel and uh we are here to uh present uh the the best uh theories of everything that I&#x27;ve run across in all my research um things that you can use to uh help form your worldview and uh that you can apply to any uh situation or subject in your life and today is the 311th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and the reciprocal system of theory was originally devised by dwey B Larson back in the 20th century and uh he came out with his uh two fundamental postulates back in the late 1950s and um the first of those postulates is the most important um and it basically says that we live in a universe made entirely of motion not matter not energy but motion and for Larson motion was the relationship between space and time time that sets up a reciprocal relationship between space and time space and time are um two aspects of the two aspects of motion and uh motion can basically be conceived of as a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator with um time or space both are the same except that they are inverses of one another or reciprocals and um they have the same basic qualities the first one of which is that they are coordinate meaning that they have three dimensions or possibly four uh XYZ coordinates um possibly tetrahedral coordinat but uh you know we generally think of space as having three dimensions X Y and Z uh time not so much but in Larson&#x27;s uh first postulate he proclaims that time also has three dimensions space and time also have what Larson calls their clock aspects um the clock is a scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but it has no direction or no specific Direction um time is always getting later and later and later and later but not in any specific Direction and um that&#x27;s something that we are accustomed to thinking about but not so much in terms of space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no specific Direction which you can Envision using a balloon with dots on it blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific direction that is what lson calls clock space and then clock space was also observed by the Hubble telescope all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each each other is what the Hubble telescope said way back in the 1920s and uh so we&#x27;ve got coordinate space and coordinate time we&#x27;ve got clock space and clock time and then we also have what lson calls the discrete unit postulate um and the quanti quantization of space and time space and time are both quantized they have a minimum unit um below which you don&#x27;t have that uh entity so you need to have a full unit of space before you have space and that unit is approximately 4.56 * 10us 8 m um so that&#x27;s uh microscopic in size and um time also uh is quantized there is a minimum unit of time and if you don&#x27;t have that full unit then you do not have time and that minimum unit of time is the uh inconceivably short 1.52 * 10-6 seconds and uh if you don&#x27;t have that full unit then uh you don&#x27;t have time and basically within both those units um there is a kind of a special region which Larson refers to as the time region and the space region if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you only have time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time then you only have space and so that&#x27;s why Larson calls those the time region and the space region they are across the boundary of a unit of space and in a unit of time also if we have one unit of exactly one unit of space in one unit of time we have the speed of light speed of light is 1 over one equals 1 and for that reason lison calls it unit speed so um we have this unit speed a boundary um which in the reciprocal system is basically the reference point or the midpoint the null point the uh state of rest um the origin of this universe so in a universe of motion the origin is itself motion the speed of light the reference point is itself motion the speed of light um unlike the Legacy scientists who measure their quantities from zero motion Larsson measures his quantities from the speed of light and um half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light um which is uh goes against what Einstein&#x27;s victim says about the the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe uh in LaRon system the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and that there&#x27;s an entire half of the universe moving faster that Larson calls the cosmic sector then we have also the material sector which is the sector that Legacy scientists know about which is the sector of the universe where um everything is moving slower than the speed of light and in this sector lar uh Einstein&#x27;s dictum holds where the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe so Einstein&#x27;s really only referring to one of the two sectors of the universe and these two sectors are identical except that they are um that you have to invert the roles of space and time and so in the material sector the sector moving slower than the speed of light you have coordinate space and you have clock time in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and you have clock space and um you know to get from one to the other you have to cross that speed of light boundary so this basically sets up a universe with three different boundaries you have the unit space boundary you have the unit speed bound boundary and you have the unit time boundary and uh Larson came up with that um along with the second postulate basically says that the Universe conforms to the relationships of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian and uh he took that those two and he derived a whole theoretical Universe from those postulates you through a process of deduction well if this is true well then that&#x27;s true if that&#x27;s true then this is true and um I go through his process there in about 15 videos that I did um months and months ago uh that is called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so you can go back in the archives and look for that um if you want to want to hear larsson&#x27;s thinking it&#x27;s basically 165 steps that he goes to get from um the postulates to a theoretical Universe then he took that theoretical universe and he wrote some books on chemistry and physics and astronomy especially also economics and philosophy and religion and psychology um metaphysics um and uh also developed somewhat of a following small but dedicated and um some of those people have written um stuff worth reading and uh one of those folks is Dr kbk Neu and Dr Neu uh started following the reciprocal system back in the 70s I believe and um he along with Dr Bruce paret uh after Larsson died in 19 1990 they came out with what they called rs2 the reciprocal system 2 or the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system where they uh you know help to try to kind of shore up a few of the weaknesses of Larson system and uh to then extend the system into other subjects um a lot of metaphysical subjects uh but also uh things like archaeology archo archology archaeoastronomy um and uh crypto history and um uh comparative religion and um a lot of esoteric philosophy now what we&#x27;re doing today is we are going going through um neu&#x27;s paper that is called U multi-dimensional SpaceTime and uh I believe today is the fourth episode that we&#x27;ve done on this uh paper and um I hope that we can finish this today um but if you want to start the uh paper from the beginning you want to go back about three videos uh to get the whole to get the whole paper we&#x27;re going to start today with uh a section that is called motion Consciousness Continuum referring to the fundamental basis of the whole universe ancient teachings assert quote its one absolute attribute which is itself Eternal ceaseless motion is called in esoteric parlament the great breath which which is the perpetual motion of the universe explaining the semantic traps that come in the way of recognizing the identity of Eternal motion and Consciousness we observed uh quote a potent source of error is the misunderstanding of the nature of space and the inappropriate use of the meaning of Dimension normally in sense perception we COG iiz three dimensions of space in the sense of three mutually perpendicular directions the higher dimensions are referred to as being further directions in space uh orthogonal at right angles to the previous three but this description misses the point of the occult teachings regarding the nature of space the difficulty is that space is being referred to with two different meanings for instance the Two Chief attributes taken to be characteristic of space are the volumen and the outness we must realize that in this sense space is relative to objects filling space and the volume of space is tenable only in the case of this relative space we cannot associate volume with objectless space as such the metrical characteristic is only one aspect of space and we should not narrow down the concept of space just to physical extensiveness perhaps this interpretation arises out of the mistranslation of the Sanskrit word Akasha uh into English on the other hand the physical emotional thought inst intuitional aspects Etc of living are to be taken as the various dimensions of space viewing space in this way we know it not merely as metrical this is only one aspect of it but as space ious Continuum perceptual space is threedimensional the fourth or higher Dimensions cannot be taken as further extensions orthogonal to those three dimensions in the percept in the perceptual sense as remarked they are dimensions of Consciousness uh dimensions of Consciousness space continuum not of the Perpetual space the whole of which is only one dimension of the former however there may well be correlates of these dimensions of the Consciousness space continuum in physical space such that each dimension of Consciousness may involve may involve a projection in the metric field therefore space in the sense of physical extension giving rise to further directions orthogonal to the three dimensions we cognize in sense perception in this way in general we have to understand space not as mere void or volumeless this is only its metrical aspect but as Consciousness that is why it is referred to as plenum by the Sears and reishis uh plenum if I&#x27;m pronouncing that correctly p l n u m is basically um kind of like the opposite of a void a void is like a vacuum uh an empty Spa a space that&#x27;s empty but a plenum is basically a space that is completely full uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s got every everything everything in it okay uh we have pointed out in the previous section the existence in nature of a graded hierarchy of levels of organization of living structures we can now see that this implies on the one hand hierarchy of spatial structures like organ tissue cells organel compounds Etc and on the other hand hierarchy of temporal structures which appear to us as patterns of dynamic processes in the living systems the teachings of ancient wisdom inform us that the field of human evolution spans five tatas or dimensions of Consciousness one the sense perceptual two the emotional three the mental four the intuitional and five the universal or n nirvanic these of course form a graded hierarchy of consciousnesses holes within holes the higher transcending and containing the lower Akin akin to autop pois in living structures the dimensionality n of the motion um relevant to these tatvas turns out respectively to be 3 4 five 6 and seven to be sure the teachings mention two more tatvas the Paran nervonic and the Maya or the Maha Paran neuronic that pertain to superhuman stages of evolution of Consciousness okay that is the end of Dr ne&#x27;s paper there [Music] um and uh you know I would just uh go over it slowly if you need to if you feel like you didn&#x27;t get it um kind of the information&#x27;s there but it&#x27;s pretty dense and neru kind of uh lays it out there without a lot of explanation sometimes and so um you know it&#x27;s a little bit difficult to get into now um he has an appendix here and I think this appendix may clear up a few a few of the finer points um appendix one Evolution and time and uh I believe he&#x27;s answering a question um although I don&#x27;t see the question um in this message I tried to discuss some points ra uh raised in Dan&#x27;s message firstly he hints um that the ethical unit could itself be an evolution here we encounter impass according to Larson the ethical sector is beyond space and time uh on the other hand um and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s from larsson&#x27;s book beyond space and time um he identifies U you know first you have the material and then you have the cosmic but when you have the material coming together with the cosmic at the right proportions in the right uh phase then you get the life unit um and the life unit is then um given another level of control at a certain level of intelligence and that is what he calls ethics the ethical sector and this is what uh he calls level three and it&#x27;s influenced by what he calls sector 3 so there&#x27;s a sector you know the first sector is the material and the second sector is the Cosmic but this third sector is itself uh basically his name for God and the third sector is beyond space and time and so um you know uh nuu is kind of disagreeing with this person saying that this ethical unit could itself be an evolution and neru is saying that the E ethical sector is beyond space and time according to Larson on the other hand Evolution unfolds in time we therefore cannot talk of any change since change implies time in a domain transcending time to be sure there are transformations that do not imply time like those in mathematics but these cannot be talked of as evolving there are other possibilities which are presently totally beyond the Ken of anthropomorphic consciousness the subjective experience of our consciousness of time is that of a on directional getting later however we have documentation of the possibility of higher States Of Consciousness through yogic research wherein two and threedimensional time is experienced for such a Consciousness the future present and past of our Consciousness can all change without the knowledge and consideration of some of these possibilities our and Larson surmises about the nature of sector 3 existence might be far short of the truth the third item I want to comment on is about the observations mentioned by Dan concerning the learning by the birds of the milk snatching technique without transmission through physical structures like genes from the scientific findings of the sear and rishes we come to know that animals and plants too have what we may call group mind uh or what they term group Soul which is associated with a large collection of individual bodies or organisms of the same species this is the repository of the acquired traits and explains their transmission to new Offspring um the constitute um this kind of contrast with what he calls individualization which depicts the process of the creation of the human self that is the individual mind from the previously existing group mind of the domesticated animal the original Source references for any SL okay so that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s about it on that uh that appendix there he has another appendix here about yantas and um uh chakras um and um this one goes on for quite a while all right and uh so that is uh the end of that section or that article from nou now tomorrow I think we&#x27;re going to go back and read some articles from Dewey B Larson um and what I&#x27;d like to do with these articles is to look at kind of the nuts and bolts of the theory like you know I&#x27;ve stated many times you know what what this is about the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time and so on and so on but what does it look like nuts and bolts wise once you get down to the D uh derivations of you know the deductions and to the theoretical Universe you end up with certain structures like I said you got the three boundaries you&#x27;ve got the the unit space boundary you have the unit speed boundary and you have the unit time boundary so that sets up really four different areas of the universe uh two sectors and within each sector you have uh two separate regions you have the time region the time space region the SpaceTime region and the space region and uh but uh Larson also gets into some discussion on Dimensions uh he gets into some discussions about the nature of time the nature of space the nature of speed uh he gets into some uh other kind of um maybe idiosyncratic aspects of the reciprocal system like the inter Regional ratio uh the inter Regional ratio is is a a ratio that you is is very very common in the reciprocal system you use it all the time and you use it for important calculations and it&#x27;s basically just a translation Factor how much is getting lost in the translation when you&#x27;re crossing boundaries of the universe you can&#x27;t see everything uh that is uh on one side of a boundary you only are able to see a certain percentage of it and so he goes over you know the inter Regional ratio among other among other different um also the states of matter uh solid liquid vapor and gas how are those characteriz eyes these are are very fundamental aspects of the reciprocal system but if you don&#x27;t they seem very quirky but if but he applies them uniformly in all situations and so you know it seems like he&#x27;s just pulling it out of his hat uh if you only see it once but then when you kind of read broadly in the reciprocal system you see that he&#x27;s using the same thing um over and over again and so we&#x27;re going to try to get to look at like how how these things are derived and what they really mean and how you derive them how you apply them in your own like the inter Regional ratio there&#x27;s about six or seven of them depending on whether you&#x27;re dealing with atoms or subatomic particles uh charged particles uh you know it there&#x27;s um there&#x27;s a different um inter Regional ratio for each one of them and so you have to be able to apply the correct one uh that&#x27;s also another aspect so we&#x27;re going to get into uh a few articles from Larson uh here in the next week or two and eventually we&#x27;re going to get back into some of his books um and eventually we&#x27;re going to get into some other subjects entirely so hang on and stay tuned and thanks for tuning in have a great</p>
