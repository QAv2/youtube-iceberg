            <p>if I do 90 degrees minus 14 degrees and I would do some borrowing there I get 76 degrees making the complement of 14.76. if something is a supplement that means it adds to 180 degrees so I would need to do 180 degrees minus 14. doing again a little bit of borrowing that would give me a hundred and sixty six degrees the reciprocal we got to be a little bit careful with because most students are used to hearing the words opposite reciprocal meaning that that has to do with perpendicular slopes so just a straight up reciprocal of 14. the reciprocal of that is 1 over 14. so 1 over 14.</p>
<p>and again you just flip that fraction again opposite reciprocal comes in with perpendicular slopes that is something else and then the positive integer factors of 14 are 1 and 14. and 2 and 7</p>
