            <p>hello welcome to the channel it looks like all of the email records of Dr James latsky the program lead for the dod&#x27;s assap program the advanced Aerospace weapon system application program had been deleted seems very suspect to me the same thing actually happened to Lou elzando the dod deleted his emails so that his tenure at atip the advanced AOS space threat identification program could also be deleted question is who&#x27;s doing this and why thanks for being here let&#x27;s get to the show Chris L welcome to L files this is an expost from John Greenwall Jr the email records of Dr James latsky the program lead for the asep atip program at DIA have been destroyed confirmed waiting on word for what records retention schedule authorized it and whether or not it was truly authorized sadly it likely was more soon as we see here in the response I reviewed your request for appeal and remanded your request to the review team for an additional search upon remand and review Dia Personnel verified the search procedures and conduct Ed a second search no responsive records were located as a result of this search the records you requested were properly destroyed prior to your request pursuant to records disposition schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Administration and further the DIA Freedom of Information Act office can confirm that a search was conducted for emails using the cited name James latky and no records were located all all of them appear to be destroyed John greenr wrote back can you please confirm then that by this response all of James lat&#x27;s emails were destroyed they came back greetings your question was understood and the response is the same there are no email records for James latsky as a result of records retention schedules records retention schedules this just seems amazing to me you know James latsky was the program lead he&#x27;s the author for two books inside the US government covert UFO program initial Revelations that just came out last October 2023 and skim walkers at the Pentagon an Insider account of the secret government UFO program he wrote that with c kellerer and George knp in those books he relays how he was actually program lead for a highly top secret program looking into specifically events at Skinwalker Ranch they end up releasing 38 deliverables and the follow-on program looks like was kona blue that&#x27;s an interesting read through you can check that out in my previous video on kona blue reverse engineering program seems like the the reverse engineering program that I would want to have in place actually if this was all credible and legitimate so the fact they deleted all of the email records for a program lead of a very top secret sensitive program just seems miraculous to me I can&#x27;t believe they would have deleted that and if you look at recent events Dr Kirkpatrick&#x27;s signal his signal messages with Christopher melon those are somehow releasable and saved but actual government emails are not saved seems very suspicious to me also chances are is there&#x27;s no actual record held by Dr latsky even emails that are at the unclassified level are still for official use only you&#x27;re not supposed to have for official use only information on your home computers so it looks like none of his emails could probably be saved unless he was doing it in a non-secure manner which I I highly doubt so while it is unclassified it&#x27;s still for official use only meaning you probably shouldn&#x27;t download and keep records of this on your home computer unless it&#x27;s as said for official use only it&#x27;s also interesting it&#x27;s the same thing happened to Lou Alando this is from an expost from Lou Alando although John and I don&#x27;t always see ey to eye this is extremely relevant not only did the Pentagon do this to me in an attempt to erase my history with atip the advanced Aerospace threat identification program they have now done it to my friend Jim and who knows how many countless others when will people wake up and realize truth can be deleted deleted with a simple click and the bigger question who is doing this and why kudos to you John at the blackvault.com if you remember back Lou alzando had serious issues with the dod and he filed claims against many senior members in the military one of the main disagreements they had is the dod would not acknowledge that Lou alzando ever worked on any program related to atip or assap and like he says here in this post the same thing happened to him his emails and previous records were also deleted John greenball has been able to get foed emails for many years back many records have been kept it just seems miraculous and amazing to me that they would delete all of the records for Dr latsky and happen to delete the emails from Lou alzando on these secret programs that the dod does not want information released on it just seems highly suspect and as L Alando says there when will people realize that the truth can be deleted with a simple click so it doesn&#x27;t matter how many times we foer Freedom of Information Act request these records if the records have simply been deleted then nothing to see here so unfortunately it looks like we won&#x27;t get any more insight into the program lead director of ASAP his emails and correspondents who did he talk to what is in those emails unfortunately it&#x27;s all been deleted and authorized deletion and while official emails are getting deleted look at this post from Lu zandu responding to Christopher melon I wonder when did DOD authorize Kirk Patrick to use the signal app for official US business and correspondence you and I would have been crucified for doing that while we were in government and when did they allow personal identifiable info of US citizens to be released contrary to Privacy Act of 1974 I guess it&#x27;s more of the same regarding rules that apply to thee but not to me so it seems like yet again the dod gets to play by their own rules getting to delete official emails and at the same time releasing unofficial signal messages with Privacy Act information in it personal identifiable information against David grush the only hope is we can continue to watch get clear information see when this stuff is happening and bring it up to Congress because it looks like the dod and the ER office is not on the side of the people and truth and transparency it seems like they just continue to want to defend the government and play by their own rules if you want to
