            <p>head of the defense Ministries lichem at the time obtained a copy of a promised disc that&#x27;s the software through Earl Bryan in the early 1980s now you gotta stick with us everybody if you&#x27;re listening this gets a little complicated but this is important history is riddled with unexplained events you can turn back now or learn the stuff they don&#x27;t want you to know [Music] yeah foreign active I&#x27;m a relatively young conspiracy realist and I live in America my conspiracy expertise is mostly relegated to the history of various intelligence communities across the globe while there&#x27;s thousands of topics and stories I&#x27;d love to discuss with y&#x27;all I&#x27;ll do my best to be concise I was listening to your quote what was the octopus episode and got to the part where you all started talking about inslaw&#x27;s promise software well let me just say yeah right remember that one guys well let me just say I have some details you guys might have left out or or omitted and would find quite intriguing if you don&#x27;t know about it already carefully I read your emails we we have your actual name haha uh Anonymous continues Rafi Eton head of the defense Ministries like him at the time obtained a copy of a promise disk that&#x27;s the software through Earl Brian in the early 1980s now you got to stick with us everybody if you&#x27;re listening this gets a little complicated but this is important so we&#x27;ve got Earl Brian uh this guy Earl Brian gave a disc to Rafi Eton Brian was livid with the justice department for using a version of The Promise software to successfully track Mafia money laundering so Mafia money and having been left out of the prophets from promise that that would be upsetting right when Brian traveled to Tel Aviv in the early 1980s he stayed at eton&#x27;s residence while staying there Brian was moved by atan&#x27;s stories of the growing threat of the intifada Revolution Brian felt promise could help he also wanted to make money so Brian and Eton hatched a plan to modify promise with a trap door and Market it around the world after receiving the disc Eton then recruited a small team of lichem programmers to reverse engineer the promise disk lichem by the way is he translates in English the Bureau of scientific relations it was around this time it was an Israeli intelligence agency that collected scientific and Technical intelligence uh most notably for the nuclear program in Israel which I believe uh I&#x27;m required to say has not been officially confirmed oh man it it factors into this too it&#x27;s crazy it&#x27;s crazy how many of the conspiracies we&#x27;ve talked about on the show end up getting wrapped up in this story being told to us by Anonymous right now uh so let&#x27;s continue down the rabbit hole here so it&#x27;s on uh recruited that small team from of programmers from that thing you just discussed lakhem to reverse engineer the promise disc and then itan had a Massad official hire an israeli-american engineer out of North Carolina to design an undetectable microchip that acted as the quote trapador or back door it was not the doj the Department of Justice that had the back door microchip designed for use in the promise software it was Mossad specifically spymaster Rafi itan that&#x27;s intense okay that&#x27;s that&#x27;s intense this this concept uh because it&#x27;s kind of we&#x27;re tracing the the pattern here if you go back in and actually listen to that episode that&#x27;s being referenced by Anonymous what was the octopus when it deals with like why was this promise software that was meant to just track court cases originally why was it being used around the globe and why was it being sold by specific groups to other specific groups the email continues here&#x27;s where it gets good though Earl Bryan first tried to sell the bugged promise to Iraq and Jordan&#x27;s intelligence Services through his company hadron or hadron etan was unsatisfied and wanted to find someone more effective at marketing and selling the software so etan recruited a contact of his it&#x27;s very special contact you guys guy named Robert Maxwell [Music] ring any bells for you guys Robert Maxwell uh no like the Maxwell coffee Dynasty the Father the father of Elaine uh also oh yeah that one also uh also super embed uh with some Israeli uh intelligence outfits but if you&#x27;re super in bed with Israeli intelligence outfits just for the record you&#x27;re probably kind of in bed uh with some five eyes stuff as well oh yeah he was also the owner of several mass media Outlets so etan got this guy Robert Maxwell to Market and sell the new Mossad promise spyware around the globe using Maxwell&#x27;s Tel aviv-based digim computers limited uh or dig em I I don&#x27;t know how to pronounce that d-e-g-e-m it was one of several Israeli companies that Maxwell bought in the early 1980s very few of these Israeli companies were not mossad&#x27;s service providers the game itself was used to provide cover to Mossad assassins in South and Central America as well as Africa these are huge allegations being put out here and uh you guys I don&#x27;t have confirmation for these at this moment we have some reporting on it but I don&#x27;t have full confirmation on these allegations just want to put that up there I have nothing I can air oh of course all right good good good uh should we continue guys this is a pretty long email does anyone want to round robin part of this I&#x27;m your huckleberry Matt I&#x27;ll play your reindeer games Anon by 1989 500 million dollars U.S of problems have been sold to intelligence services in the following countries and on list Britain Australia South Korea Canada Jordan Iraq Poland Russia Chile Argentina Guatemala and more the worst and juiciest sale Maxwell made though is not the one he made through digim but rather an American company he bought in 1982 through the permagon group true story known as quote information on demand end quote Maxwell met with Henry Kissinger who pointed him to the head of the armed services committee at the time Senator John tower Tower that arranged for Maxwell to visit numerous Labs at the Los Alamos complex including Sandia National Laboratories to Market promise there ellipses Tower did all that for the low low price of two hundred thousand dollars U.S I always laugh at spy money two hundred thousand dollars U.S of massage money Maxwell&#x27;s success Maxwell successfully sold promise software uh two Sandia National Laboratories and others you know the Sandia National Laboratories that basically houses U.S nuclear programs and r d secrets yeah Mossad got into that through promise and Maxwell true story uncannily the sale of promise to Sandia and other labs happened in the same period of 1984 where itan had one of Israel&#x27;s top experts in nuclear targeting take over the supervising duties of Jonathan Pollard&#x27;s U.S nuclear Espionage on behalf of Israel I&#x27;m hitting my desk here that&#x27;s me uh in parentheses none says I&#x27;m gonna assume you all know about Jonathan Pollard yes dude dude oh my God ah all right all right one there&#x27;s another paragraph now for the last big twist about pergamon the CIA the NSA the FBI and Sandia uh read the link below to find out because I can&#x27;t summarize all of this in detail plus there&#x27;s important documents to back things up but in short I&#x27;m pretty sure Israel was more or less supposed to get our nuclear secrets that was the goal of uh itan&#x27;s Lecom agency while the promise conspiracy was going down there was obvious undocumented collusion between the U.S doj and the Mossad Maxwell&#x27;s pergamon International had a history with the cia&#x27;s open source intelligence gathering methods before the promise days and when the FBI got involved in an investigation into pergamon thanks to Sandia and the NSA alerted the FBI to bergamon&#x27;s connections with Russia the FBI swiftly reclassified a slew of documents specifically anything with Maxwell&#x27;s name on it and shut down the investigation under the guise of pergamon&#x27;s business relationship with Russia being a non-issue probably because it was a non-issue since the real issue was Mossad having a back door into our foremost nuclear laboratory breath yeah but but not just that not just the foremost nuclear laboratory they were able to put tentacles if you will into all of these other countries intelligence Services think about that guys if there ever were an octopus that&#x27;s it if there is a reason that a certain journalist found himself dead in a bathtub uh when he was going to go meet a confidential Source I think that could be it uh something that may have put uh put our boy Castle arrow in a casket that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying and I think it&#x27;s time we uh dig even deeper into that story guys I think this might be a whole you know episode maybe a whole TV series wink wow anyway uh this is really great thank you so much Anon for sending this to us that was a ton to unpack like it&#x27;s too much even for me to unpack in this moment while we&#x27;re sitting here talking about it but basically it&#x27;s TR it&#x27;s tracking what happened with that promise software uh to the full extent with with proper names and uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s even more than I understood like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a bigger story than even I understood I think at least up to this point [Music]</p>
