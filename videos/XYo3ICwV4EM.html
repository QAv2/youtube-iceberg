            <p>Nicola Tesla, often called the god of electricity, but dude was seriously a weirdo. He was in love with lightning. Seriously, he even wrote in his diary, &quot;The thunder is my friend.&quot; Also, he fell in love with a pigeon. One specific pigeon. He literally said, &quot;When she died, a part of me died, too.&quot; He had to wash his hands three times a day using exactly 18 napkins.</p>
<p>OCD level, final boss. He only slept two hours a day. The rest of his time making insane inventions. He was building free energy for the world, but investors were like, &quot;Can&#x27;t profit from that.&quot; And bailed. Conclusion: Nicola Tesla was such a weirdo, he basically lived in the future.</p>
