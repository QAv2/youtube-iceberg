            <p>hi fan John from Oregon John from Oregon what&#x27;s on your mind a lot of pressure you heard about well have you heard about the alien Sam no Oh Oh you mean the uh the hearings yes the 20 July 26th hearing yeah I mean yeah we I think we briefly touched on it yeah okay what&#x27;s your stance on that do you think it&#x27;s real do you think there&#x27;s any there there um no I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t I mean I I I&#x27;m not I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s I like it has it changed my mind from where I was before no well so David Rush he would go to jail for wearing an oath in front of Congress and lying who was the last person who went to jail for uh lying in front of Congress I don&#x27;t know Steve yeah I don&#x27;t know but I know a lot of people there&#x27;s a couple people on the Supreme Court um there&#x27;s um uh I mean this happens with some regular uh Bobby Kennedy uh we showed uh some of the lies as far as I&#x27;m concerned that he uh he did under oath in front of Congress um I mean uh I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t understand why we have whistlebro blower protections I don&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t want to deal with that but the guy seems pretty adamant about this why didn&#x27;t he release the classified information that he has is that that&#x27;s illegal right well it&#x27;s not if he follows but not if he follows anything there but not if he follows but not if he follows uh whistleblower protocols I mean it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s illegal and you could get uh in trouble for it I just I you you know for this to change my mind then I need to see you know the the fact that he&#x27;s part of the agencies that I&#x27;ve never heard of before now um that I believe he&#x27;s part of uh you know and that he has access to people in agencies that I&#x27;ve never heard of before now that do what I guess he purports to do even though Congress didn&#x27;t seem to know about it I mean none of that seems to me to be completely implausible but it&#x27;s just there&#x27;s no hard evidence and let me be clear here too though the guy is a bit of a crank he said in the past and he thinks that UFOs could come from another dimension that the Vatican is in on a cover-up for for UFOs I believe that there&#x27;s certain guys talking about Havana syndrome now too like I think he&#x27;s so rich I I&#x27;m on the same boat as both of you I mean I understand both sides of it uh I think AOC asked some great questions yes she asked about these special access programs totally and it&#x27;s just a fascinating hearing and I don&#x27;t know if anyone&#x27;s interested in this topic I suggest watching I I did watch aoc&#x27;s Instagram on it I don&#x27;t know where where you know and I I am like there&#x27;s definitely possibly like something going on here if there are programs that are hidden from Congress um you know it could end up being that the that the alien stuff is really more of a limited hangout and what we&#x27;re seeing is like you know sort of um Works programs that contractors are engaged in like I I&#x27;m not saying that we shouldn&#x27;t investigate this more I&#x27;m just not convinced that this is necessarily we&#x27;re hiding non-human uh life form uh or that we have you know uh flying vehicles from a from a different um from uh from a different place I&#x27;m not I I find it hard to believe that we&#x27;re the only life yes in the universe uh but I also um I&#x27;m gonna need more evidence before I take this but I think I&#x27;m all in favor of more investigations great let&#x27;s get to the bottom of this color you heard the uh thanks for taking my call I got one question for you actually if you want to hang out are you still there yeah um what did you what was it because like I I I one thing that did stick out to me and I had I&#x27;m embarrassed to say the exact same direction is Tim Poole when they said they recovered non-human biologics and I&#x27;m like oh so the Russians put a dog in one of these things like like did you have to say what did you think of with the non-human biologics thing because to me that seemed like oh this is not alien but we want to make it sound like alien well and this is just just to be perfectly Frank with you Matt like I&#x27;ve watched the news Nation interview and he said there were alien bugs so hmm I said non-human bodies right did he say the non-human he said non-human biologics so like I mean in the hearing yeah yeah and I I just I&#x27;m not impressed by that no I know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s weird thanks thanks for talking about it though appreciate the call is caller 40 slots are available but 39 are literally tied up by majority report staff members what we got the Mr team slamming the phones right now I mean impressed me anybody else could see the phone the list of phones why would that impress anybody I believe there&#x27;s life on other planets I do believe that I just don&#x27;t think the evidence that&#x27;s been presented of UFOs that they&#x27;ve come here is compelling whatsoever it&#x27;s just there&#x27;s a lot of other things you have to rule out um before you start saying like Grays are because to me it&#x27;s just clearly like the 90s stuff like again like I feel like Fox Maldives a big X-Files fan um but it was like clearly like in the 90s oh we had a new type of stealth bomber and stuff and maybe like type of drone Technologies when you look at lights like oh look at this light hovering over the city we don&#x27;t know what can do that well now we do yeah I mean they&#x27;re it&#x27;s probably weapons testing and they don&#x27;t and it&#x27;s much more useful for people to be thinking about UFOs and not like what are we doing with our weapons industry or our surveillance yeah and like industrial complex yeah and I think you need to approach those things with skepticism especially because I think leftists in general have a very good healthy skepticism of the National Security State uh but for some reason just because this is exciting to people from a science fiction perspective they abandon that I&#x27;d be totally psyched about it believe me I&#x27;d be psyched but think I need more these are not reliable narrators to to put it mildly yes that&#x27;s true too</p>
