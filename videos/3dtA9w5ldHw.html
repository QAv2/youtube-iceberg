            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>program to retrieve and reverse engineer a UFOs. Has the government conducted secret UAP crash retrieval programs? Yes or no? Yes.</p>
<p>Use nation was the first to bring you this story. We have spacecraft from another species. We do? Yeah.</p>
<p>And now, for the first time anywhere, a military veteran comes forward to say he was part of that program with video to prove it. My work has included</p>
<p>the recovery of downed UAP of non-human origin. Revealing how he retrieved alien craft. What did you see? I saw an egg. How it&#x27;s changed his life</p>
<p>forever. What we call a CI on a component to the research and development of the UAP program. And how he plans to do it again</p>
<p>for the world to see. The skies are not classified. Your conscience can&#x27;t be redacted. His account,</p>
<p>corroborated by his colleagues and his injuries sustained during these operations, confirmed by a Stanford professor. My personal experience is that there&#x27;s something here.</p>
<p>Will the truth set him free? Or will it get him killed? People have been murdered. That seems to be the case. News nation presents hunting UFOs. The crash retrieval</p>
<p>whistleblower. In October 2024, an unknown man stepped out of the shadows, arriving in our nation&#x27;s capital to deliver an important message about what the public calls UFOs and the government calls unidentified anomalous phenomena</p>
<p>or UAP. I&#x27;m here in D.C. this week to meet with members of Congress. His name is Jacob Barber,</p>
<p>and he says that for the past 30 years, he&#x27;s worked in both an official and unofficial capacity for the United States government and its partners in the intelligence community. What he knows</p>
<p>and what he&#x27;s here to tell Congress could change the world as we know it. We&#x27;re in this rare opportunity in human history where it&#x27;s very clear that we know that there are things</p>
<p>flying in the sky that, are unexplained and understood. And that&#x27;s another one of the things that, I&#x27;m uniquely providing information on.</p>
<p>So what makes this guy special? Well, to date, everyone who&#x27;s come forward has either described their own UAP encounter, like this famed 2015 incident recorded by F-16 aviators on the USS Roosevelt. I have experienced advanced</p>
<p>UAP firsthand, and I&#x27;m here to voice your concerns of more than 30 commercial aircrew and military veterans who have confided their similar encounters with me. Others have alleged</p>
<p>that there&#x27;s a secret government UAP program that&#x27;s been going on for decades. People like David Grush and Lou Elizondo. They say</p>
<p>they&#x27;ve been told about it. They believe it exists, but they weren&#x27;t a part of it themselves. We&#x27;ve been recovering spacecraft, alien spacecraft.</p>
<p>The United States has been involved in the recovery of objects, vehicles of unknown origin that are neither from our country or any other foreign country that we&#x27;re aware of.</p>
<p>But Mr. Barbour is different. He says that for years he was part of that covert program working with alien spacecraft.</p>
<p>These days we call them high non-human intelligence. And this guy is prepared to testify that he was involved directly, firsthand in the retrieval of these craft.</p>
<p>How long have you known this secret about unidentified anomalous phenomena being of non-human origin? For more than ten years. Of course. We checked Baba&#x27;s records, and we&#x27;ve confirmed that he was</p>
<p>an airman in the US Air Force working as an aerospace mechanic in the late 90s. But as these documents show, he was also recruited into Air Force special operations known as combat control.</p>
<p>He says he ended up working in a non-official capacity for the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. What were you? What was I. Ross I was a highly</p>
<p>talented airplane mechanic who got to deploy on a number of presidential support missions. But Jake was no ordinary mechanic. Being recruited into the Air</p>
<p>Force&#x27;s elite combat control unit meant he had a resumé that reads like something out of an action thriller. Helicopter pilot, freefall parachutist, expert marksman, and the recipient of a NATO top secret security clearance.</p>
<p>A legacy of his service in Bosnia, where he won an award for an act of heroism. In addition to reviewing his official documentation, News Nation spoke with three former special operations soldiers who corroborate Barber&#x27;s</p>
<p>credentials and claims. I know in special operations, you&#x27;re often in some tough situations. You have to rely on each other. Is Jake Barber</p>
<p>a person who you would trust? Oh, yes. He&#x27;s a person I would and have trusted with my life. Do you think Jake Barber is a patriot? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely. There&#x27;s a thing. I know. There&#x27;s a lot of special operators talk about that.</p>
<p>You know, there are certain types of men who you would want watching your back in a tight spot. Is he one of those guys? Absolutely. Trustworthiness</p>
<p>is one of the top things that we&#x27;re looking for. And one of his most fervent supporters is Colonel John Glitch, a Renaissance warrior who holds a doctorate in psychology. Was a Delta Force sniper and is one of the few men</p>
<p>to hold doomsday in his hands, commanding a nuclear weapons battalion. So you believe Jake Barber is telling you absolutely. There has been</p>
<p>a cover up lasting 80 years? Absolutely. We&#x27;ve recovered craft. Absolutely. So let&#x27;s roll back.</p>
<p>You say you were an enlisted man, and then you ended up working for the intelligence community as a contractor? Tell me that story. How did that happen? Everything changed for me right around 911, and, I left the Air Force</p>
<p>and was sent out to California at that time to begin stablish. And my cover basis for an independent as an independent contractor, so that I could serve what was coming down the line next for me. And that is the path</p>
<p>which led to the UAP subject. Baba says he was contracted as a helicopter pilot and was part of a team assigned to retrieve crashed aircraft at an undisclosed testing facility in the desert.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;re not only talking about conventional airplanes or drones. A lot of the work we did on was on what I call the range, where, the U.S. government and its private partners used to test</p>
<p>all kinds of things, weapon systems, and resilience to weapon systems of certain craft. And so you see a lot of exciting things. So you start seeing</p>
<p>at the range. Yeah. Interesting objects. Well, yeah, it&#x27;s always interesting out there.</p>
<p>Things come in and out of sight. Things disappear for a moment and reappear. Things to seem. Things seem to move</p>
<p>very quickly. Things change color. They change shape. We did recover things, that were that were exotic in nature, in the sky.</p>
<p>And we know they were classified craft. And we recovered them and took them back to where they go. The majority of what we see and do is explainable</p>
<p>and is ordinary, and is known by many people and is not, not classified. But there is a certain percentage which is extremely sensitive. And that extremely sensitive does include what we know is our own</p>
<p>manmade advanced technology. So, you know what Lou Elizondo has described as the five observables. So you were seeing objects that complied with those weird observables? Yes.</p>
<p>So, one of those that did that would raise your eyebrows more of the trans medium characteristics because things would come from the ground, like from the earth, from a ridge, from a mountain, or could pass through.</p>
<p>So they&#x27;d come out of a ridge. Out of a ridge? Yeah. Aircraft that can disappear, change color, change shape. How much the US military</p>
<p>have developed or required such technology? Jake says he saw for himself close up. And the rare occasion, or, let&#x27;s say, the hypothetical occasion, something of a non-human origin or, source, were to interface</p>
<p>with the ground. You would deploy that same team. And that is the segue and how we got involved with this particular subject. Next,</p>
<p>Jake Boba&#x27;s first encounter with non-human intelligence. How close did you get? I got within 150ft of this object. And later News Nation has acquired video evidence of Jake&#x27;s claims.</p>
<p>It has to be seen to be believed. We are not alone. We are not alone. There&#x27;s no doubt Jake Baba is an accomplished</p>
<p>helicopter pilot. This is the kind of work Baba says he did after he left the air Force as a private contractor working for the defense industry and the US government at a secret location</p>
<p>he calls the range. That&#x27;s where Baba and his team were asked to retrieve downed craft, the likes of which he says were not just advancnce. Take the public has never seen.</p>
<p>They were built by non-human intelligence. So tell me about the moment when you realized that you were involved in a retrieval of non-human technology,</p>
<p>alien tech. So it became very clear the first time our communication process and procedure, was modified. And then just visually looking</p>
<p>at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous. It was. It was not human. How close did you get? Well, I was a helicopter pilot,</p>
<p>and I operate with, 150ft to 200ft long line. So I got within 150ft of this object. What did you see? I saw an egg, a white. Egg.</p>
<p>Was there any visible propulsion system on it? No, not what we know. There&#x27;s no engine. There was no thermal, signate. I was operating at night when</p>
<p>I finally came in to pick it up. Some working under night vision goggles at the time. And it was quite clear. I flipped him</p>
<p>up, flipped him down, and looked at it a couple of different ways. How large was the object? I would say approximately 20ft, plus or minus a little bit about the size of a large SUV.</p>
<p>Did it have any seams? No. And it was pure pure white. It was like pearly white. Like, metallic pearly white. Best I could, I could assess.</p>
<p>How did you know that that egg shaped object was non-human in origin? Well, visually, after seeing all kinds of things in my past, it was clearly something that was ridiculously looking. It&#x27;s inconsistent with anything</p>
<p>I&#x27;d ever seen before. I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something, extraordinary. And at no stage</p>
<p>were you ever subsequently told that the craft was of non-human origin. I will tell you that during this process over the last couple of years, it&#x27;s been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP Task Force that what we were working with</p>
<p>that night was, in fact, at high, and it was not a unique experience. What do you think that object was? I don&#x27;t know. Again,</p>
<p>I&#x27;m security and transportation. I moved it, loaded it on a truck than it went to. Where would it go? Where would where would it be taken? It would be taken to a secure</p>
<p>facility. But, again, my my roll stops once I deliver it. Yes. It sounds like the stuff</p>
<p>of madness. Tall tales, delusions. And anyway, where was the proof for any of this news nation has independently obtained previously unseen video obtained from a secret UAP craft</p>
<p>retrieval program. This extraordinary footage clearly shows an egg shaped object dangling in a sling below the belly of a helicopter. Let&#x27;s slow</p>
<p>this down to take a closer look. That&#x27;s an egg shaped UAP suspended from a 150ft long line. We&#x27;re told the craft is about 20ft long.</p>
<p>The egg suspended in a cradle. And look how careful the pilot is as they bring their precious cargo into land. Let&#x27;s freeze frame here</p>
<p>to look at one of the clearest images of a UAP ever taken. This is no blurry light on a distant sky. The source of the footage putting themselves at incredible risk to record this</p>
<p>UAP retrieval. Look at how perfectly smooth the craft is. No markings at all and no visible means of propulsion</p>
<p>or way to see inside. Watch how it rolls. Almost graceful as it hits the ground, despite being wrapped in the ropes and canvas from the cradle as it&#x27;s dropped for pickup.</p>
<p>The UAP Final Destination still unknown. So there. There was another object. There&#x27;s two objects</p>
<p>that I&#x27;m here to talk about. One was the egg. The other is what we called an acorn. The acorn was a, essentially</p>
<p>a flying disc with what looked like eight, delineated sections when looking down. And I can tellou what it looked like from looking down, because that&#x27;s primarily how I saw it,</p>
<p>because I&#x27;m a helicopter pilot. We did recoveries with the eight guns. There was more than one that was that made its way to the ground</p>
<p>on this particular operation. Simply seeing a non-human craft up close would be an intense experience in itself. But, Baba says, as he prepared</p>
<p>to transfer forward that so-called eight gon from the pickup site to the drop site, something even more intense happened to him that would change his life forever. This is one of the most profound experiences I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m about to share it with you. So bear with me. So as I get closer to this site, I start feeling odd. I start</p>
<p>feeling extremely emotional. And the closer I get, the more the emotion starts to overwhelm me. I feel this intense hybrid of sadness and happiness and beauty. And song.</p>
<p>And it was very disruptive to me because I had a very practical responsibility at the time to operate a helicopter in the mountains at night. And I began wondering what was wrong with me.</p>
<p>It was late at night, and then I just stressed. Am I tired? And I don&#x27;t know. But as I came over this object for the pit, it was this overwhelming</p>
<p>sense of emotion. Is it your feeling? Are you suddenly having a mental breakdown on the job? No. I felt like something connected with me.</p>
<p>I felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was, And it was so overwhelming that I began to cry. And then I&#x27;m confused as to why</p>
<p>I&#x27;m crying at the same time. And then I&#x27;m do I abort the mission? Do I? And so I just did my best to focus on my particular cues whenoing this type of work.</p>
<p>And I got the load hooked up and I began flying away and once it was just me and that object in between the pick and the drop site was about 20 miles in between. I felt like something</p>
<p>was inside of me. I felt like I was possessed by the most. Beautiful spirit I had ever been possessed by and.</p>
<p>Was it loving? It was loving. But there was a sense of sadness at the same time. And, had you ever had an experience like this before? No, no, it was a very feminine</p>
<p>energy, I&#x27;ll tell you that. It felt like felt like the Spirit of God, but not in any masculine sense. And it wasn&#x27;t like a soul. It was like a frequency</p>
<p>that I was connected with. And whatever that force was, since that night, it has stayed with me. And as crazy as this sounds, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s guiding me now.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s what&#x27;s providing protection for me. It&#x27;s changed your life. It&#x27;s changed my life. Wait a second.</p>
<p>Humans bonding psychically and emotionally with non-human intelligence. Yes, Jake Baba says that&#x27;s exactly what happened to him. And he&#x27;s not the only one.</p>
<p>And he says the government knows all about it. There is an psychic component to the research and development of the UAP program.</p>
<p>Do psychics walk among us? Stay with us. Jake Baba says that when he retrieved a so-called eight gong shaped UAP, he had an intense emotional reaction which convinced him he&#x27;d connected telepathically with a non-human intelligence.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re talking UFOs, flying saucers, and you&#x27;re. That&#x27;s. That&#x27;s probably one of the hardest conversations.</p>
<p>That object or whatever was controlling that object was also connecting to me through the mind, through my mind. And so how did the object come to land? I think it was invited to land by the Psyonix team.</p>
<p>Jake says his mission that night came from no accidental crash. The UAP was summoned by a separate team. A special team</p>
<p>with special abilities. They&#x27;re called psionics. What is a psionic? A psionic, person is someone with the predisposition for, astral. Temporal.</p>
<p>You could say abilities and sensitivities. Extra temporal abilities. Also known as psychic powers. What did you discover with</p>
<p>the psionics were being used for in the program? In the program, there was certainly a desire to explore the idea that perhaps UAP could be summoned, could be communicated with, could be controlled, and could be persuaded to land, all by deploying people with, psionic abilities.</p>
<p>And did you see that happen? Yes, I did. When a sonic operator engages with technology, how do they do it? Using their mind? Something like meditation.</p>
<p>They genuinely are people who can actually make a mental, spiritual connection to a technology. Yes, 100%. It all seems so far fetched.</p>
<p>Psychically gifted humans linking with possibly alien ships. Summoning them and even piloting them. But it isn&#x27;t just Jake saying</p>
<p>this. Don&#x27;t pull. Another decorated special forces operator and colleague of Jake&#x27;s says he&#x27;s also seen what psionics can do.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of meeting multiple sonic assets. I&#x27;ve seen them function. I know that they&#x27;re capable of doing what they&#x27;re doing.</p>
<p>You can definitively say that you believe there is a capacity in the human mind to somehow psychically telepath connect. Yes. And I don&#x27;t know</p>
<p>if it&#x27;s a byproduct, if it&#x27;s something that they were born with. But there is certain people who are quantifiably verifiably capable of this. It&#x27;s an established fact</p>
<p>that the Pentagon has had an interest in psychic abilities, what it calls remote viewing for military purposes. The famed Project Stargate spent years studying the subject, and despite the CIA&#x27;s</p>
<p>official position that such studies yielded nothing. Former Pentagon UAP investigator Lou Elizondo told me last year that psychic abilities are very real, and perhaps not very rare.</p>
<p>So this is an ontological shock. I think so many people are watching this because we&#x27;re all being told, firstly, there&#x27;s no such thing as aliens visiting this planet. And secondly,</p>
<p>there&#x27;s no such thing as telepathy or psychic abilities. It&#x27;s rubbish. Yeah. You know, I don&#x27;t think there is going</p>
<p>to be an ontological shock. I think it&#x27;s going to be an ontological relief, because I think everyone deep down knows that, that there is more to life than what wewe are bei told and experiencing.</p>
<p>Like, not only is it not shocking, but it should be welcome. It all seems so innocent, so benign, even sacred. But hold on.</p>
<p>Jake says that through his work, he and his team have suffered serious. Injuries after this particular mission. Me and everyone on my team</p>
<p>got extremely sick. Sick like, physically ill in the hospital. And one of the world&#x27;s leading medical experts agrees.</p>
<p>My personal experience, both with people and the things that I&#x27;ve seen, is that there&#x27;s something here. UAP is bad for your health. Coming up next.</p>
<p>What do you think? I want the UN High. I feel the NHC are guiding us. Jake Barber describes his encounters with UAP as transcendent, quasi religious moments.</p>
<p>From what you&#x27;re saying, that&#x27;s a beautiful experience. Yeah. It was the most beautiful experience I&#x27;ve had in my life.</p>
<p>But he also says these encounters could come with a staggering cost. UAP may have changed his life for the better. They may also have shortened it.</p>
<p>So what happened to you? We&#x27;re not quite sure. We were transporting a large, sealed container. Jake says nobody on his team was told what was in that container.</p>
<p>And we transported what we called mystery boxes all the time. I have no idea. It could have been empty.</p>
<p>It probably wasn&#x27;t empty, but we don&#x27;t know what was inside the boxes. And what were you told if somebody tried to seize that box? What were your orders? We we maintained the authority to use lethal force if anyone tried to seize those boxes.</p>
<p>So whatever that box was, it was extremely valuable. That&#x27;s great. That&#x27;s correct. And, after this particular</p>
<p>mission, me and everyone on my team got extremely sick. Like, physically ill in the hospital. Within, you know, weeks after this,</p>
<p>I lost every hair on my body. And I also lost the skin on my arms. So the skin&#x27;s actually falling off your body? Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, not just falling on, like it. It was lopping off within a couple of days, like a severe sunburn. I ended up developing, a severe heart murmur</p>
<p>that I never had before. Last year, I introduced Jake to Stanford immunology professor Gary Nolan. He&#x27;s been studying anomalous injuries among US military personnel for years</p>
<p>at the behest of the CIA. Nolan agreed to review decades of Jake&#x27;s medical records. The report reads like a bit of a horror show, to be quite honest to me.</p>
<p>What? The first thing that came to mind was you were exposed to some kind of radiation. And especially, as I understand it, a number of his coworkers in the deployments that he was in, had similar problems.</p>
<p>So you&#x27;re not dealing with a one off who went home and somehow, came in contact with something in the house, but you have, 4 or 5 individuals all at once coming down with the same thing. Within a week</p>
<p>or so after deployment. Guess that&#x27;s more than a coincidence. My fear is that there is something permanently broken there.</p>
<p>Might show up in the form of cancer or God knows what later in life. And we&#x27;re going to be way behind in trying to figure out how to deal with it. Assuming Jake and his team</p>
<p>were exposed to radiation emanating from that box, could it have come from one of the many radioactive materials used regularly by the military? Certain munitions, components of nuclear vessels, or nuclear weapons themselves? Jake doesn&#x27;t think so.</p>
<p>If the Air Force, let&#x27;s say, knew that what we were working with that night had any type of radiological signature, there&#x27;s a whole set of process that we are we&#x27;re trained in on how to deal with that from a hazmat perspective,</p>
<p>in a containment perspective. And the fact thanone of that was was apparent that night tells me they didn&#x27;t know what was in the box. And it got turned on</p>
<p>or turned off. Which leads me to believe, in hindsight all these years, that it may have been something of non-human origin specululati. Absolutely wild speculation? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>When you consider other documented cases of military personnel who claim they were similarly injured by UAP, take the famous case of Airman John Burrows. The Veterans Administration granted him full</p>
<p>medical disability for injuries to his heart and eyes. He claims he suffered during the famous 1980 UAP incident in Rendlesham Forest, England, but that only happened after Senator John McCain intervened to get his medical</p>
<p>records declassified. They were classified. They just weren&#x27;t withheld. They were classified. Why would you feel that</p>
<p>the issue was so important as to not allow for that person&#x27;s medical records to be released? What are you hiding? The issue came up in last year&#x27;s congressional UAP hearings. How can the government deny we have recovered craft if they&#x27;re paying people because they&#x27;ve been injured</p>
<p>by a recovered craft? Man, that&#x27;s a great question. That&#x27;s why I think we&#x27;re here again, because I&#x27;ve seen the documentation by the U.S government for several of these individuals who have sustained</p>
<p>sustained injuries as a result of a UAP incident. What did happen, is sound is either unethical or an administrative oversight, that needs investigation by Congress because we shouldn&#x27;t be putting, people like this in under such circumstances.</p>
<p>The good news is that now, under Doctor Nolan&#x27;s care, Jake is getting proper evaluation and treatment. The bad news is, Jake believes there&#x27;s another, more imminent threat to his health.</p>
<p>His former employer. People have been murdered. That seems to be the case. Stay with us. It wasn&#x27;t just the United States government interested</p>
<p>in using Jake&#x27;s expertise. Working with UAPs and psionics. His skills were also needed by private companies involved in the top secret program, and his assignments soon took a turn from recovering UAPs</p>
<p>to something more sinister. What happened? Well, we were deployed on a particular task to recover what we call treaties or high value targets. Those high value</p>
<p>targets were Panasonic tough books, the sensitive material that is on these Panasonic tough books, has to do with sensor data. Jake and his team suspect those Panasonic tough books contained data from the top</p>
<p>secret UAP retrieval operations worth millions to the right buyer. Jake says the private company contracting him was determined to recover them. We recovered our first two,</p>
<p>tough books. They were, they were in the High Sierras. We got back to our our base location and then went through them and took photographs, discovered that the hard drives</p>
<p>were missing. Jake says his team arrived too late. The hard drives containing the data had already been taken, and it became clear to Jake</p>
<p>that not all was what it seemed. As his team set out to recover the missing data. The next piece of intelligence that came through led us to, a lake and high altitude lake.</p>
<p>And we found, the hard drives in a sealed steel container 25ft underwater. Wow. Yeah. So someone&#x27;s</p>
<p>going through a lot of effort in order to hide these things hidden. But by whom? What began as a straightforward recovery mission proved to be anything but simple.</p>
<p>And Jake says things soon took a nefarious turn at any stage. Did you find yourself under threat. The very next time we went out,</p>
<p>things got strange. For me and my spidey senses, my intuition was on high alert because our Intel contact changed. The rhythm</p>
<p>and style of our Intel changed as we got closer to the day in which we were going to deploy. Intelligence kept changing. And so that that raised my concern.</p>
<p>We ended up going anyway. And when we got there, the TVs were gone and it was clear that shots had been fired, shots fired. Whatever was on</p>
<p>the computers was a secret. So important it was worth fighting for. The situation had changed, and soon, Jake says, he realized his team was caught in the middle and their lives</p>
<p>were on the line. You&#x27;re in significant. Danger. Yeah, and I was concerned that we were being set up.</p>
<p>We were being prepared for the one thing that we&#x27;ve always offered employers, and that is plausible deniability, and that we were perhaps going to be the hidden hand that gets severed. Don&#x27;t pull.</p>
<p>A Special Forces veteran was working on Jake&#x27;s team at the time. Were you involved in any of the retrieval attempts? Yes. Was there a concern</p>
<p>that you were being set up? Potentially. Yes. Set up is a mild term. The fact that people have lost their lives involved</p>
<p>in this type of activity and the links to which people have gone to supuppress politically uncomfortable truths, is such that there is a risk involved. Do you think that without naming them, the private aerospace company</p>
<p>that retained you decided to kill you? Somebody masquerading as a representative of that company surely may have had that intention. Jake was convinced his former employer, or someone posing as them,</p>
<p>was determined to kill him. But who exactly was calling the shots? Jake was determined to find out. Who were you working for? It was obvious to us at least, who the employer was.</p>
<p>But they were now in question in my mind as being part of the problem. Jake was on the hunt using his skills and vast network of contacts to determine just who was behind this shadow war, fought over</p>
<p>these missing hard drives, and he says the trail led him right to the top. This past spring, Jake and his team were in Washington, D.C., conducting surveillance and eventually confronting</p>
<p>one of their prime suspects. So I reached out to the Director of security for the particular organization and set up a meeting with them. Because there was</p>
<p>only two truths in my mind. Either they were complicit or they were compromised. What was his reaction was he knows.</p>
<p>Oh, he he was nervous. And so he told you to forget it. He said, you know, it&#x27;s in our best interest to move on. If he had any knowledge at all,</p>
<p>it was clear he&#x27;s trying to distance himself from it. Jake was no closer to finding out who exactly wanted him dead, but he knew that he was no longer doing the mission</p>
<p>he signed up for when he first enlisted, protecting Americans. To make it stop, he would need more than his hand-picked team. He would need Congress.</p>
<p>He would need funding. He would need to go public, and he would need us at News Nation to reveal our own startling UAP footage. That&#x27;s next.</p>
<p>Jake Baba says it&#x27;s now time. Time for the public to know. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s doing this interview. But he&#x27;s doing much</p>
<p>more than talking. And what you&#x27;re trying to do now is replicate in the private sphere what&#x27;s being suppressed in the public sphere? Yeah. You know, we we&#x27;re not looking back. We&#x27;re looking forward.</p>
<p>I am absolutely confident that we are capable of generating the type of high quality sensor data and photography and film evidence that everyone is wanting. So who exactly is we? Our organization</p>
<p>is called Skywatcher. We have been recruiting guys from within the program and women and are forming a new team in coordination with government agencies. And we also have the funding</p>
<p>through venture capipital. Can you name those agencies? Not at this time, but I hope to very soon. Jake&#x27;s Skywatcher team has already deployed on behalf of the US government to investigate last year&#x27;s drone</p>
<p>sightings on the East Coast, but before that, they were on the hunt for something even more elusive. In August of 2024, Jake and the skywatcher team conducted their own operation with a psionic asset to see if they could summon</p>
<p>a UAP themselves. Look. There&#x27;s two. Look at this, look at this look.</p>
<p>I hear this one going. Down and this one going up. This footage from another skywatcher operation showing the team&#x27;s protocols.</p>
<p>The team hoped to quietly gather evidence for skywatcher, but instead found themselves inanger once more. And Jake says a UAP dogfight erupted in the sky above them.</p>
<p>He believes the craft summoned by the team was warring with a rogue UAP piloted by an unknown entity attempting to intercept skywatchers operation. Tell me what happened.</p>
<p>So we set out to do this operation right away on the Titanic asset went into meditation. He is reporting that he is engaged and in fact, piloting a craft</p>
<p>and is bringing it in. So he&#x27;s actually telepathically controlling alien technology. Yes, yes, it&#x27;s crazy as that sounds. That&#x27;s</p>
<p>exactly what we set out to do. What he reported we would do. And then things got a little weird, right about, right about, I&#x27;d say 4 or 5 minutes into the operations,</p>
<p>he goes, something&#x27;s going on. Something&#x27;s wrong. Get me out of here. And right about that time, our overwatch friend looked up to the sky and saw a disk,</p>
<p>a classic lenticular shape disc. That was Fred Baker, special operations veteran, now part of the Sky watcher team. So he was flying the egg.</p>
<p>And then when we had to pull him out of this, that&#x27;s when the egg dropped. Wow. So at the very moment that he&#x27;s</p>
<p>essentially detaching his mind from the object, you see it fall, correct? Professor Gary Nolan was there that night, too. What I did see was an individual, who, in the midst of attempting to, call such an object,</p>
<p>it was clear that he was in distress at the moment of the, supposed interaction. And at that moment, something is seen when we reviewed what it was that the person on the roof had seen both by drawing and by video.</p>
<p>Ography. Something showed up. Can we see the egg? Yeah. So here&#x27;s frame one. It passed across</p>
<p>our entire 69 degree angle of view and 0.84 seconds on our sensor. It comes into frame here. So that one there does look like just in an upright oval egg oval egg.</p>
<p>And is that similar to what you&#x27;ve seen in the program. Oh yeah. This is exactly the same thing. Aside from releasing data</p>
<p>and footage like this to the public, we&#x27;re told that this video was among those sent to the all domain Anomaly Resolution office, or Arrow, the Pentagon organization responsible for monitoring UAP. The egg resembles</p>
<p>the UAP encountered by US Navy fighters off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these anomalous objects. But until now, it&#x27;s never been shown to the public, making Jake&#x27;s mission</p>
<p>even more critical. The skywatcher team feels it has to push the federal government to act. Witnesses at the congressional</p>
<p>UAP hearings have been saying the same thing. The Pentagon, the intelligence community, is treating us like children. It&#x27;s time for us to know the truth about this.</p>
<p>I think that we can handle it. Jake Barba has been to Capitol Hill two news nation has confirmed that this fall, he met with staffers for Florida Senator Marco Rubio, now president elect Trump&#x27;s pick</p>
<p>for secretary of state. I feel I was I was able to fill in gaps that have been there for a long time that no other whistleblower has been able to do. A lot of people</p>
<p>aren&#x27;t going to believe this. What do you say to those people? I&#x27;m not here to make anyone believe anything. It&#x27;s exhausted. Oh, paraphrase</p>
<p>the book of Matthew. You will know us by our fruits. Stay tuned in and watch what our new project is about to do and prepare to be dazzled.</p>
