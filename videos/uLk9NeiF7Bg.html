            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>This briefing titled The Immaculate Constellation explores an alleged UFO legacy program and the crisis of intelligence oversight, touching on themes of secrecy and classified information. This slide reveals allegations of a covert intelligence program, Immaculate Constellation, operating under the executive branch without congressional oversight, focusing on managing UAP issues. In December 2017, the New York Times exposed the Pentagon&#x27;s secretive advanced aerospace threat identification program. In response, the DoD allegedly established the Immaculate Constellation USP, intensifying secrecy and shifting the UAP mission beyond congressional reach through heightened legal protections. The slide details the journey of a 12page whistleblower report on UAPs.</p>
<p>Initially authored by a US government official, it was presented in Congress by journalist Michael Shelonburgger, securing its formal submission into the congressional record and elevating its status for official investigation. Less than 1% of the Pentagon&#x27;s photographic and video evidence has been made public encompassing data from key intelligence disciplines like emitt mass and humant across various collection domains including low earth orbit and maritime environments. Case study 1 highlights an F-22 being outmaneuvered by metallic orbs, underscoring concerns over unidentified aerial capabilities. Meanwhile, case study 2 reveals a naval carrier&#x27;s defense systems failing as a sphere hovered just 100 to 200 yards above, posing significant strategic risks. The White House allegedly uses executive privilege to mask a program&#x27;s existence from Congress while the Department of Defense handles execution, exploiting a jurisdictional gap to bypass reporting requirements.</p>
<p>The slide contrasts the official denial of any unreported classified UAP programs with a whistleblower&#x27;s claim of enforced secrecy, highlighting a culture of intimidation and fear around disclosing information. The ARO designed to consolidate UAP reporting for transparency is hampered by restricted access to crucial data. This undermines a congressional mandate compromising efforts for greater transparency in UAP encounters. The slide highlights a serious constitutional breach where operating secretive intelligence programs without congressional notification undermines trust and violates executive duty. This lack of transparency not only disrupts power balance but fosters a culture of suppression against those attempting internal reports.</p>
<p>The slide highlights how excessive secrecy and compartmentalization hinder a complete understanding of UAP threats, risking national security by preventing comprehensive defense planning and potentially giving adversaries an advantage. To ensure accountability and transparency, we recommend establishing a bipartisan committee with access to all special access programs, amending reporting statutes to close jurisdictional loopholes, and enhancing whistleblower protections to securely transfer critical information to Congress. The real issue isn&#x27;t just the existence of UAPs, but the alleged secretive programs bypassing the law. Congress must address the oversight question. what is being withheld and why.</p>
<p>For those interested in deepening their understanding of unidentified anomalous phenomena, this slide references key congressional records, expert reports, and journalistic investigations from reputable sources like NewsNation and NPR. The Immaculate Constellation invites us to explore the intricate design of the universe, where every star holds its place in a vast cosmic tapestry.</p>
