            <p>JEFF: 15 YEARS AGO, THE CITY OF HOOD RIVER WAS ROCKED BY THE MURDER OF 41-YEAR-OLD ERIC TAMIYASU. IT&#x27;S STILL A MYSTERY PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE STRANGE EVENTS THAT HAPPENED BOTH BEFORE HE DIED, AND DURING THE INVESTIGATION AFTERWARDS. TIM BECKER HAS MORE IN TONIGHT&#x27;S 6 NEWS KOIN 6 UNSOLVED. IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS IN BED SLEEPING AND HE WAS SHOT. JEFF: ERIC WAS MURDERED IN HIS HOOD RIVER HOME IN JUNE OF 2001.</p>
<p>THERE WAS NO STRUGGLE. JEFF: ERIC WAS 31 YEARS OLD. THEY FOUND A THIRD BULLET. AND I SAID, THAT CANNOT BE SUICIDE. THEY HAVE GOT TO BE MURDER.</p>
<p>JEFF: DON DIXON FOUND HIS DECOMPOSING BODY IN THE UPSTAIRS BEDROOM OF THE HOUSE ERIC HAD RECENTLY BUILT NEXT TO HIS ORCHARD. AS I GOT TO HIS ROOM, THE STENCH WAS INCREDIBLE. AS I WAS STANDING THERE, I LOOKED TO MY LEFT AND I SAW HIM LAYING IN BED AND I YELLED, &quot;ERIC.&quot; DID YOU KNOW RIGHT THEN THAT HE WAS DEAD? JEFF: AT THE TIME, THE GUNSHOT WOUNDS TO HIS HEAD OR NOT EVIDENCE, THOUGH DIXON WAS SURE HIS FRIEND WAS DEAD. HE CALLED 911. INVESTIGATOR GERRY TIFFANY WAS ONE OF SEVERAL SHERIFF&#x27;S DEPUTIES TO INITIALLY SHOW UP.</p>
<p>70 CAME IN HERE FOR THE -- SOMEBODY CAME IN HERE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF KILLING ERIC. HE IS NOT SOMEBODY WHO HAD A LOT OF ENEMIES. HE APPARENTLY, HAD ONE. JEFF: PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR DARON COATES WAS HIRED BY ERIC&#x27;S FAMILY WHEN THE HOOD RIVER SHIFT DEPARTMENT WAS NOT FINDING ANSWERS. I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF THEY WOULD SAY THAT IT WAS BOTCHED.</p>
<p>I THINK THAT THEY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAY THAT SOME OF THIS WAS HANDLED. JEFF: THOSE QUESTIONS HELPED THE CASE DRAWN NATIONAL ATTENTION A YEAR AFTER THE MURDER. NETWORK TV&#x27;S &quot;UNSOLVED MYSTERIES&quot; DISSECTED THE INVESTIGATION, PONDERING POSSIBLE SUSPECTS, INCLUDING DIXON, AND THEN SHERIFF JOSEPH WAMPLER, WHOSE WIFE, ACCORDING TI -- ACCORDING TO DIXON, MIGHT HAVE HAD A CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM. AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED COLLECTING EVIDENCE, WAMPLER ASKED DIXON TO BURN THE SPOILED BETTING AND MATTRESS. ERIC WAS FOUND ON THAT MATTERS.</p>
<p>SHOULD THE MADRAS HAVE BEEN BURNED? I DON&#x27;T THINK SO. NO, I DON&#x27;T BELIEVE ANYTHING WAS LOST. JEFF: DIXON THOUGHT DIFFERENTLY JUST FOR BURNING THE BETTING. AND THE SHEET FALLS OPEN. THERE IS NOTHING CUT OUT OF IT.</p>
<p>THEY ARE ALL INTACT. NO SAMPLE TAKEN? THERE WERE NO SAMPLES TAKEN. JEFF: WAMPLER WOULD NOT TALK ON CAMERA, BUT TOLD ME OVER THE PHONE THAT THAT WAS NOT TRUE. ABOUT ONE WEEK BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED, ERIC WAS WITH A WOMAN NAMED DIANA AT HIS HOUSE WHEN. AGAIN, KNOCK AT THE DOOR.</p>
<p>JEFF: IT HAPPENED TWICE. EACH TIME, ERIC ANSWERED NOBODY WAS THERE. WAMPLER TELLS ME THEY LATER INVESTIGATED DIANA&#x27;S EX, THE FATHER OF HER CHILD, A MAN WAMPLER TELLS ME IS CAPABLE OF THE STALK ING-LIKE THE SAVIOR. THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE THAT IF I COULD, I WOULD HAVE THEM ARRESTED. ONE IS THE FATHER OF HER CHILD AND THE OTHER IS OUR EX-SHERIFF.</p>
<p>AS YOU HAVE POINTED OUT, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CRAZY CONSPIRACY THEORIES, A LOT OF INTERESTING IDEAS. SOME OF THEM ARE MAYBE, KIND OF SILLY, BUT THERE IS AT LEAST ONE OF THEM, THEY ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. JEFF: PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR COATES TELLS ME A HANDFUL OF NEW INFORMATIONAL LEADS HAVE COME TO HIM IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.</p>
