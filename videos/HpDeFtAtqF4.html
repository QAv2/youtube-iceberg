            <p>thought i would give a brief update on some of the continuing anti-gravity research epic conducting as this has been just fascinating i honestly don&#x27;t like the term anti-gravity but i don&#x27;t know what else to call it so anti-gravity it is this is now turned into multiple interim reports because the experiments only led to an extensive list of further research and experiments needing to be conducted with a continuing string of bizarre unexpected and fascinating findings while i had conducted some research into this phenomenon close to 20 years ago i had not really given much credence to these lifters built by people all over the world and probably researched the most by jean-louis nodan of france however recently i came across this research report by botter and fozzie from the army research laboratory they spent a great deal of time first explaining the bureaucracies of u.s military research in the different branches of the military how the left hand doesn&#x27;t know what the right hand is doing this was especially interesting because of a ufo uap report that was just released a few weeks ago of unidentified drones that were swarming us navy ships off the coast of california in 2019 multiple ships all reported the same thing now while the navy was open about it and the military as a whole is declassifying a lot of their ufo uap information after trump&#x27;s mandate to declassify as much of it as possible it&#x27;s interesting to follow through the events surrounding this particular ufo uap encounter the navy was openly talking about it until apparently someone asked the question hey wait a minute are these our drones in other words were these drones developed by say the us air force and then the navy not knowing anything about it was just inadvertently spilling the beans on these highly classified us technologies so they immediately classified all further memos and information on these drone encounters and of course just before he left office trump ordered the declassifying of everything the military knows about ufos and uaps and that report is due to be released to congress in june i believe so this is all tied together in this current research one of the things bader and fozzie emphasized and i thought was a good point was just in the u.s military branches there was probably a lot of reinventing of the wheel going on because of the bureaucracies where the air force has probably perfected this anti-gravity technology but the navy knows nothing about it the navy researchers may have an interest in this topic but they don&#x27;t know to go ask the air force so the navy then goes and does all the hard work and research that was already done by the air force so i want to take that principle and apply it to us unorganized individuals around the world who are probably doing these exact lines of research that i&#x27;m doing here at tech valley but we&#x27;re each reinventing the wheel at our own time and expense because because we are not effectively communicating our research results with each other so i decided to put together this video detailing my results thus far butter and fozzie&#x27;s paper was very encouraging to me as they conducted almost the exact same experiments i did back in i think it was 2017 and they even got some of the exact same results their research followed through to construct and fly some of these lifters as nodan calls them now 20 years ago i was much more interested in the inertial thrusters and building and experimenting with those as well as helping my buddies experiment with a device called the geet which was mounted on the exhaust and intake of a conventional gas or diesel engine the results we saw were very bizarre and to this day i can&#x27;t explain what we saw i can only tell you the results but that&#x27;s for another day i hadn&#x27;t given much attention to node ends lifters though because in those days people had already written it off i&#x27;ve written off this effect as simply ionic wind but as badr and fozzie point out in such detailed fashion ionic wind is completely insufficient to generate this measurable force the force generated by these lifters is at least five times more than ionic wind can produce they even went so far as to do the math using much heavier copper ions from the wire stretched across the top of the lifter and even using heavy ions the forces generated by these lifters were still at least three times larger than what was physically possible to generate with heavy ionic wind so obviously there&#x27;s something else mysterious going on here however though dozens of people in groups around the world have built and flown these lifters no one that i know of has published a methodical analysis where they seek to maximize this mysterious force being generated this is where i came into the picture i already had a strong interest in alleged anti-gravity technologies and i had already conducted some experimentation with the byfield brown effect 20 years ago and revisited about four years ago or so but after reading botter and fozzie&#x27;s paper i was greatly encouraged to revisit these lifters as there was clearly something else going on there they also showed me multiple things i did wrong in my previous experiments and revealed several misconceptions or misunderstandings i had of this whole anti-gravity phenomenon and i was pretty well read on the topic as with so many discoveries in science most of my discoveries were by chance for example i used enameled wire for my lifter experiments as it was just what i had handy everyone everyone else was using non-insulated wire by using an insulated wire still producing yet still producing a force i effectively ruled out copper ions in an ionic wind the copper wasn&#x27;t even exposed so i verified what bader and fozzie said but in a completely different fashion so let me walk through the experiments i conducted and their results this is very much preliminary as i have a very long list of experiments still to conduct but this is for those of you who are conducting anti-gravity research or research on lifters those who wish to repeat this research or those who are just interested in the topic also bear in mind my current goals which is to simply replicate and study this force discover how to control and maximize it as that is where i think the community has at least failed to document their research if there&#x27;s actually people out there who have even conducted any of these experiments that&#x27;s also where the most potential for commercialization can happen so here&#x27;s my messy lab with my test rig i&#x27;ve got two non-conductive nylon strings which go through straws on the first test piece these straws on a string guide and control the panel if it does start to fly i had a very sensitive weight scale underneath which i had originally bought to try and measure gravitational anomalies across the country it&#x27;s very sensitive able to measure one milligram the power supply i used for these experiments was a high voltage power pack i got from my electronic supplier and it&#x27;s basically a taser power supply just spark gapping it showed it was putting out about 80 kilovolts or so certainly enough for the experiments i wanted to do it should be noted that the output is pulsed dc now i didn&#x27;t scope it but it&#x27;s probably around 15 hertz or so i had a high voltage divider i used in some of the experiments so i could measure power consumption but measuring the power consumption has not been a priority just yet my first experiment was intended to be one panel from the lifters i would first of all see if there was any forces generated and then planned to modify the panel in various ways to maximize such forces you know change the distance and position of the wire relative to the flat panel change the dimensions of the flat panel change the voltage etc the wire was 28 gauge enameled wire spaced about three centimeters from the aluminum foil plate that i will call the collector plate i&#x27;ll call the wire the exciter wire the exciter wire was connected to positive and the collector plate connected to negative the high voltage immediately broke down the enamel and arced across the air gap just beefing up the insulation with some scotch tape on the top of the collector plate was sufficient to stop the arcing while batter and fozzie made a panel just like this theirs literally flew mine did not strangely my panel genuine generated a very small but measurable force downward it was generating a force towards the collector plate of about 0.6 grams considering that the entire panel only weighs 7 grams the force generated is somewhere around 1 8 the mass of the panel the force generated is in the opposite direction that was expected and causes huge problems for the iowa the ionic wind theories as you&#x27;ll see i generated an equal force in the opposite direction with other arrangements of the electrodes now i had forgotten that botter and fozzie had made an almost identical panel when i built this one and i had also forgotten that their panel had actually generated enough force towards the exciter wire that theirs flew and the orientation of the pen their panel did not matter the force was always in the direction of the exciter wire not understanding my results i went away and pondered it for a while remembering the discussion from years ago about the initial discovery by t townsend brown it was an asymmetric capacitor that is two plates separated by an insulator but one plate was smaller than the other a force was generated in the direction of the smaller plate i tried to repeat brown&#x27;s results you can see here i have two different sized copper discs separated and insulated by eva foam when charged with a high voltage it did produce about 10 milligrams of upward force towards the small disc when high voltage was applied the discs would physically be attracted to each other and with surprising vigor for example you can see the discs physically jumping in unison with the spark gap i made across the power supply leads so that the plates would get dramatic high voltage pulses this attractive force was especially noticeable when i cut the small disc down even smaller and with it being so light it was difficult to get it to lay flat on the eva foam yet the moment high voltage was applied you could see the disc sucking downwards towards the larger disc the two discs were strongly attracted to each other now this makes sense of course you&#x27;ve got opposite electrostatic charges on the discs so opposite charges attract but what if that attractive force is based on the surface area of the disc you&#x27;ve got a large disc charged with a high negative charge with a large amount of attractive force pulling it towards the smaller disc the smaller disc also is attracted to the large disc because of its opposite high voltage charge but because the surface area of the disk is smaller the attracting force is also smaller so what i envision is happening is you get the smaller force going in one direction canceling out only part of the larger force in the opposite direction you are left with an out of balance system where you have an excess of this force pulling in the direction of the smaller disc this would also explain why the polarity does not matter the force generated is always towards the smaller plate as outlandish as it seems i was able to physically measure this force so if it&#x27;s just electrostatic then what&#x27;s this electrostatic charge pulling against is the capacitor pulling against itself or how can you have a force pulling on something that isn&#x27;t there have we effectively generated a force field so cutting the disc down smaller increased this mystery force to about 15 milligrams an increase of about 150 percent the weight of the capacitor was reduced because i cut off a good chunk of heavy heavy copper from the small disc yet this mystery force was increased by simply reducing the diameter of the smaller disc we reduced the mass of the entire thruster cell while simultaneously increasing the strength of this force field we were that much closer to flying so if we speculate that perhaps forces were being generated perpendicular to the plates and we put say the larger plate perpendicular to the smaller plate what happens to that force generated by the larger plate this would seem to be verified by my single panel experiment the perpendicular force of the larger plate basically gets cancelled out by the guide strings as it force as its forces are all sideways down there is essentially no force canceling out the force generated by the small electrode so that force is now pushing in the direction of the larger electrode this would show up on my weigh scale as an increase in weight exactly what i saw so what happens if we roll the collector plate into a tube with the smaller disc above the tube this force generated by the collector plate would be pointing inwards or outwards but perpendicular to the surface so all this force generated would cancel itself out you would no longer have any sideward forces theoretically and this is exactly what nasa did in their patent entitled get this apparatus and method for generating thrust using a two-dimensional asymmetrical capacitor module patent number 6317310 the device had a tube as a collector plate and a flat smaller plate on top and this is where things start to get weird and i freely admit i&#x27;m flying in the dark here i&#x27;m just reporting their device which incidentally jail no it no dan built and verified that it works by experimentation produces a thrust in the direction of the smaller electrode now my thinking was that by putting the collector plate on its side and either rolling it into a tube or an assembly with other sides that the forces generated by the collector plates would cancel each other out so you would be left with the force generated by the exciter only such was the case with the lifters the individual cells were usually constructed in a polygram shape so with the collector plates generating forces sideways these forces cancel each other out against the cell frame and you&#x27;re only left with the force generated by the smaller electrode which is the exciter wire in this case so i then built a triangle cell to test this theory and got some good results i again used aluminum foil for the collector plates a balsa wood frame and a 40 gauge enameled wire for the exciter wire now notice that the balsa wood frame stands the whole cell off of the weigh scale by quite a bit now as i discovered later this would be significant with the exciter wire spaced off from the collector plates by about four centimeters a force was generated in the upward direction now while it still wasn&#x27;t flying the force was measurable at about 0.24 grams i should also mention that all of these cells produce a surprisingly loud hissing sound when when charged up even when there&#x27;s no corona discharge happening power on three two one pouring off batter and fozzie noted this as well so thus began the experiment to increase this force i started by moving the wire closer to the collector plates so remember that all this started is a capacitor with different size plates you can increase the capacitance of a capacitor by simply putting the plates closer together in this case we have a plate and a wire i moved the wire to three centimeter spacing and it generated a force of 0.42 grams almost doubling the generated force moving the wire to two centimeters the cell now generated a force of 0.7 grams i couldn&#x27;t move the wire closer without plasma discharge happening and the moment you had a discharge of any kind the force effectively dropped to zero you have to maintain a high voltage differential on the two electrodes but still this represented an increase in the force by about 2.9 times and the total force generated was about 1 7 the weight of the entire cell so i next asked the question about the size of the collector plates and its effect on the force generated i increased the size of the aluminum foil plates from four and a half centimeters vertical height to 12 and a half centimeters 2.7 times the original surface area and vertical height surprisingly this produced no change in the force generated this was completely counter-intuitive to me but hey that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re conducting these experiments the theory was that the difference in the size of the two plates or electrodes was what generated this force to begin with so one would think that by making the collector plates larger and thus a larger collector plate to exciter size ratio you would expect it to produce a larger force it did not now before we move on it was at this point that i reversed the polarity of the electrodes i put the hot positive high voltage connection on the collector panel and the negative high voltage connection on the exciter wire there was an almost negligible difference now this has been noted by multiple researchers studying this effect over the years having the exciter wire positive generated the most force but the force was always in the direction of the smaller electrode or plate regardless of electrical polarity in fact you could run the thruster cells on ac voltage and it would generate a force in the same direction except apparently in the case of my first experimental panel which decided to buck the system and generate a force in the opposite direction this also refutes the ionic wind idea as presumably the ionic wind the ionic wind would be controlled by the polarity of the cell so even with opposite polarity there was no change in the direction of the measured force so with the surprise discovery the larger collector plates did not produce more of this mystery forest i then ask the question what happens if we decrease the vertical height of the collector plates how much can we reduce it before we start to lose this force so i kept cutting off more and more of the collector plates energizing the cell after each cut and seeing no measurable drop in the force generated again to say this surprised me is an understatement in fact i cut the foil down to about as short as i physically could because at 0.75 centimeters in height the balsa frame underneath the foil was starting to interfere with the cutting but even with a collector plate height of 0.75 centimeters it generated just as much vertical force as when the collector plates were four and a half or even 12 and a half centimeters tall again this was a huge surprise to me but this is very important because jean-louis no den successfully stacked cells one on top of the other to add their generated forces together the collector plate is by far the largest determining factor in the cell height so if the collector plate can have a lower vertical profile then you can stack more cells vertically per meter on top of each other and thus you can generate more overall lift with modular cells being joined together to build this into a thruster for a flying craft every cell you can add adds that much more thrust to the unit it also means less weight because you removed a whole bunch of the metal so this is important for aircraft but as we&#x27;ll discuss in the next sit rep it is not necessarily so for anti-gravity drive aircraft it should be noted that the difference in size between the electrodes was still huge 40 gauge wire has a diameter of less than 0.08 millimeters so with a collector plate height of 7.5 millimeters the collector plate is still 94 times larger than the exciter electrode okay i&#x27;m going to end the first report there as it&#x27;s already exceedingly long and i will send out further updates and reports as i go along even at the time of this filming i&#x27;ve already conducted a pile more experiments with equally unexpected yet significant results some of which actually overturned some of the reporting i gave here but i felt it was very important to share a step-by-step review of what i&#x27;ve done so far and why as i quickly discovered even the littlest details can be quite revealing as we chase true anti-gravity so if you are conducting any experiments along these lines and don&#x27;t mind sharing your observations please include them in the comments below so we can all learn and perhaps avoid reinventing the wheel among ourselves or if you have any suggestions of experiments well i&#x27;ve got a pretty long list already but any suggestions for experiments or theories as to what is going on here again please share in the comments as you can hopefully see here even sharing your alleged failures is just as important as your successes sometimes i think that what didn&#x27;t work is just as important what did work as what did work so please share if you can</p>
