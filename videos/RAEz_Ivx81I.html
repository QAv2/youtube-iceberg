            <p>[Music] Well, Jacques, you just said something very interesting and it and it speaks to a question that was on my mind. Um, you&#x27;ve told me before that you think there&#x27;s a real stake for humanity in understanding how to respond to the phenomenon um in in that there&#x27;s something in stake in trying to understand it. Um and you just said something remarkable which is that you think that um this might have to do with human survival. Uh so so what did you mean by that? And and what do you really think the stakes are for human beings in in understanding the phenomena? &gt;&gt; We know from other work we&#x27;ve done and we&#x27;ve published we know that the phenomenon has been with us for a long time. maybe as long as humans have been on the earth.</p>
<p>And that you know that raises a question of why do we see this um concentration now? Well, now is the first time now we&#x27;re coming to a test and astronomers have have said, you know, for many years that in the evolution of a planet, in life evolving on a planet, we&#x27;ll get to a point of discontinuity where it it can it assembles technology to the point where It can destroy its own environment. And there are indications that maybe we haven&#x27;t destroyed it, but we have committed a number of faulty decisions in in our technical development and um in our economic development that threaten our own existence on the planet. So uh uh people including intellectuals I think make the mistake of saying you need to save the planet. Well, you know, let me reassure you. The best thing the that uh the the the only thing that would happen if we continue this way is that humans would disappear.</p>
<p>But the planet wouldn&#x27;t. I mean, the planet has seen many things, you know, where three billion years of development. It has developed many, many forms of life that have disappeared for one reason or another. and um and it will continue. So if if we exterminate ourselves by the stupid things we&#x27;re doing to the environment, that&#x27;s not a big problem for the earth.</p>
<p>I mean the the earth will be without this form of life for a few centuries and then something else will grow to replace us and hopefully it will be better at survival. The issue we have here today is our survival and that may be the reason of the increased intensity of a number of phenomena that are impinging on us now. You know certainly the the behavior of a phenomenon has it&#x27;s much more intense than it was in the 40s and 50s. Now part of it is we&#x27;re aware of it. Part of it is we have very good detection system that we didn&#x27;t have before.</p>
<p>Uh and and we now we go in space and we go everywhere fast. So we have more information. But I I I do think that the behavior is changing that the interaction is getting more intense and um I think we have to pay attention to that because it may lead us to a transition and I think more advanced races in the galaxy would would know that they would know that life there life is rare but there are so many opportunities unities for planets to develop that you know there must be life throughout the galaxy uh in different places. The question is does it succeed in growing beyond the stage where we are now in the in the 21st century where we can in fact destroy life. Okay.</p>
<p>uh before we couldn&#x27;t I mean we could we could kill lots of people and we have you know for all kinds of reasons but the uh we couldn&#x27;t eliminate advanced life you know rats were there millennia before humans developed and they are still doing the same thing that they did you know uh 10,000 years ago and and they probably will survive life because they&#x27;re underground and they&#x27;re, you know, able to adapt in incredible intelligence to to their environment. U they haven&#x27;t developed science, but under the right conditions, you know, who knows, &gt;&gt; Jacques, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a remarkable uh answer. And I, you know, it&#x27;s very unfortunate we don&#x27;t have more time because uh you just said a number of of profound things that that show us that the UAP problem is is related to other problems uh including one of a existential nature for us that have a lot to do with our our ethical and and social and and uh political development. So So thank you for closing with that. It&#x27;s appreciated and and and I have to say this is a remarkable interview because I think that uh in a very short span of time we were able to um uh glean a great deal of uh insight from your comments and and you you packed your wisdom into a a small span of time.</p>
<p>So &gt;&gt; thank you to all the the the people who uh that&#x27;s all who ask the questions. I think we&#x27;re in a field where the questions are more important than the answers right now. We have to come up with new questions. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I I couldn&#x27;t agree more. The questions are more important than the answers.</p>
<p>So So thank you, Jacques, and and thanks to the audience for being here. &gt;&gt; Thank you. [Music]</p>
