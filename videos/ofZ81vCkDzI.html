            <p>can you describe there is confusion about a tip all SAP bass turf different acronyms how that all you described your network of guys sure and how that interacted with the others so George understand him when we first came out I was only in charge of a tip at the time so it really wasn&#x27;t up to me to have a big lengthy discussion about all SAP before that advanced weapons a special application program but in the end I that information would eventually come out enough people are asking the right questions that it would come out and and I want it needs to come out but it can&#x27;t get him for me right because that really wasn&#x27;t that started before I came on board and therefore my knowledge of it is is a bit limited so in essence in 2007 the initial program was called AWS AP program and it was that name for about nine months and that program was later refined it was a bit of a shotgun approach to the to the phenomena so included a lot of stuff in this program on trying to figure out how these things fly and were they coming out of where are they going and things like that when I came into the program the name had just been changed to a 80 IP advanced aerospace threat identification program a tip not advanced aviation advanced aerospace I know people keep saying it&#x27;s advanced aviation it&#x27;s not and eventually that&#x27;ll come out too and people will realize that was that&#x27;s not the name it&#x27;s advanced aerospace threat identification program and so when I came in that name had a tip had already been been issued and that&#x27;s what it was being referred to us now whether or not a nickname or a formal name it was a formal name for us it was briefed as a tip but if people want to you know argue about semantics and they want to say was a nickname that&#x27;s fine but it wasn&#x27;t really a nickname at least not for me and the guys and the gals I were working with me so it was a tip and that&#x27;s how we briefed it but anyways that focus was really on the more of the nuts and bolts looking at what it is and and how does it work right and this as well as I&#x27;ve said before many times that was our focus and that was eight tips focus so we went from a broad kind of spotlight approach to more of a narrowly focused laser approach trying to figure out pieces of this because it was just too much too much of the elephant to eat in one bite frankly in my opinion anyways it could be wrong but looking at now hindsight being 20/20 the AWS AP program given the resources 22 million dollars would never be enough to really follow each and every down each and every rabbit hole to do this conclusively in my opinion anyways so it was refocused to a tip I took over in 2010 the programs continued to go as a tip 2012 that initial five-year funding dried up so we were issued more funding in 2013-2014 unfortunately the the verbage in the way it was written in the bill that when it finally came out another office in the Pentagon took our money that was intended for our office unfortunately and I won&#x27;t go into detail what office I was but the office took it and we were unable because nobody was right into the program to step up and say hey that money was intended for us so the program was indeed intended to be funded well beyond 2012 a interaction between you and your group and the all SAP Bigelow bass folks conversations back and forth you&#x27;ve gotta get to idea what they&#x27;re doing routinely of course yeah we didn&#x27;t we didn&#x27;t do anything without talking to each other</p>
