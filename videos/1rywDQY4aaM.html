            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What&#x27;s up, veters? Patrick here with Vetted. We may have just gotten disclosure. Let me explain. This is what today&#x27;s video is about. &gt;&gt; Barack Obama said that aliens are real.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Are aliens real? &gt;&gt; Uh, they&#x27;re real, but I haven&#x27;t seen them. &gt;&gt; Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to Earth? &gt;&gt; Well, he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that, you know. &gt;&gt; So, aliens are real. Well, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We are not alone in the universe. We are not alone on this planet. All right, betterers. Please hit that like button. That really helps out the videos and I deserve it on this one today.</p>
<p>And we are almost at 100,000 subscribers. Let&#x27;s go, y&#x27;all. All right, better. So, what&#x27;s today&#x27;s video about? Well, you just got a little teaser there, but there&#x27;s more to it than that. Okay, look.</p>
<p>Um, I actually I got up at 5:00 a.m. this morning because my phone was going off the rails. Okay, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a term or not. Um, and getting messages, right? It&#x27;s just just going crazy. I wake up, I&#x27;m what the hell&#x27;s going on, right? Trump&#x27;s saying all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>Puts out a statement, which we&#x27;re about to get into, videos coming out. I, you know, all kinds of stuff. So, I rushed to the studio um to make this video. Okay, I didn&#x27;t even fix my hair. I got, you know what I mean? It It&#x27;s one of those mornings, y&#x27;all.</p>
<p>But you get it because this is important. Let&#x27;s break this down. So earlier today or last night, however you want to look at it, wherever you are in the world, um earlier, okay, um Trump was aboard Air Force One and he was asked by Peter Dussy um of Fox News some questions and the stuff he revealed in it, everyone&#x27;s going crazy about. And then Trump released a statement on True Social, which we&#x27;ll get into in a moment. But take a look at this video aboard Air Force One of Peter Dussy asking uh President Trump about Barack Obama&#x27;s viral, you know, aliens are real comments.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Barack Obama said that aliens are real. Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to Earth? &gt;&gt; Well, he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that, you know. &gt;&gt; So, aliens are real. &gt;&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not.</p>
<p>I can tell you he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that. &gt;&gt; He made He made a big mistake. He took it out of class to write information. No, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an opinion on it.</p>
<p>I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, Peter? &gt;&gt; Well, the president can declassify anything that he wants to. So, &gt;&gt; I may get him out of trouble by declassifying.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. So, there&#x27;s a lot to break down there, right? So, um, the biggest thing that people are taking away from this video is that Trump is saying that that&#x27;s classified information. Why is Barack Obama saying aliens are real? That&#x27;s classified information. But then Peter Ducey asks, you know, well, so aliens are real. And he&#x27;s like, well, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not, but he&#x27;s he&#x27;s giving out classified information.</p>
<p>What what what does that mean? Right? What what what does that mean? is is you know what I mean? And then you know Trump kind of lingering there. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not. I don&#x27;t know. I I don&#x27;t really think about it. People do this that and the other.</p>
<p>And then he says he may have to declassify information to get Barack Obama out of trouble essentially. So what the heck is going on? Let&#x27;s take a look at Barack Obama&#x27;s comments. &gt;&gt; Are aliens real? &gt;&gt; Uh they&#x27;re real, but I haven&#x27;t seen them. and and and uh they&#x27;re not being kept in uh what is it? &gt;&gt; Area 51. &gt;&gt; Area 51.</p>
<p>Uh there there&#x27;s no underground uh facility unless there&#x27;s this enormous conspiracy and they they hid it from the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president? &gt;&gt; Uh where are the aliens? &gt;&gt; Where are the aliens? &gt;&gt; So there&#x27;s two parts to that video, right? That viral video that I covered and everyone covered, right? Barack Obama says aliens are real, but he hasn&#x27;t seen them. Okay. Um and then he says, you know, they&#x27;re not at Area 51, right? In an underground facility, um or they would be hiding it from him, right? So, it makes me think it&#x27;s the second part, the Area 51 and the underground facility, you know, uh there there is no underground facility. Maybe that part is what Trump is saying is classified information, right? I don&#x27;t know, right? It&#x27;s hard to tell what the hell hell is going on.</p>
<p>So, let me know down in the comments what you think, but let&#x27;s move on because President Trump released a statement that everyone is talking about and saying this is disclosure. You have to let me know what you think. Let me read the statement and then we&#x27;ll discuss it. Cue the dramatic patriotic music. Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War and other relevant departments and agencies to begin the process of identifying and releasing government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena and unidentified flying objects, and any and all other information connected to these highly complex but extremely interesting and important matters.</p>
<p>God bless America. So people saw that. Let me take off the glasses dramatically. People saw that and they were like, &quot;Holy cow.&quot; Right. There&#x27;s the president mentioning aliens, extraterrestrial life, UAP, UFOs, all in a tweet saying he&#x27;s going to, you know, do what he said aboard Air Force One cuz that came out after that interview.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. So, is this to get Barack Obama out of trouble? I doubt it. Right. Are people working behind the scenes to make this happen? I don&#x27;t know. I got some interesting DMs from people um saying that, you know, people worked hard to make this happen.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what that means, but you know, I this is interesting. I have to admit, right? And it makes you think, right? It makes you wonder like what does that mean, right? Let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let&#x27;s look look at the statement again real quick, right? So to begin the process of identifying and releasing government files. Disclosure doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean aliens are real. It just means the disclosure of what the government knows about it, which that&#x27;s up in the air, right? Depending on who you talk to. So, you could get all the answers you want and you could be sadly disappointed with what the government releases and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Well, wait.</p>
<p>Oh, man. It&#x27;s not what I wanted.&quot; I mean, disclosure is the truth. So, the truth may not be what you want, but it also may be what you want. And it may be a mixed bag. Maybe, as they say, the truth is somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>So, we might hear that some stories are true and others are right? So maybe not all the stories you&#x27;ve heard from the government or about the government hiding UFOs and aliens are true, but one is. All you need is one, right? We just need one to be true. So what does this mean? Could mean a lot. Is it a distraction uh from other things? I don&#x27;t know. U people are saying it it could be a distraction from the Epstein files and this and that.</p>
<p>I you know, I don&#x27;t know. But if people are working behind the scenes to make this happen, does it have anything to do with it? Are they correlated? Who knows? But at the end of the day, the fact that they&#x27;ll start releasing identifying and releasing some of these files, you know, one, again, we could be disappointed, right? Maybe they don&#x27;t identify all of them or release all of them or they&#x27;re redacted or some of that, but we also may get some answers, right? Which would be great. Um, I think this is good overall. Just optimistically speaking, this is good, right? We want some of this stuff to come out. It&#x27;s what people have wanted.</p>
<p>It may not be exactly what we want, but it also could be, again, it could be somewhere in the middle. So, I for one am excited about this, but cautious. Don&#x27;t want to I&#x27;m not going to celebrate crossing the finish line of, you know, aliens are real on Earth, right? Uh just yet, but this is definitely a step in the right direction, right? um is is people are saying Trump is, you know, jealous of Obama. He&#x27;s kind of taking his uh you know what I mean? Taking some of the the limelight away from him. I don&#x27;t know, right? Does it matter any of that stuff matter? No.</p>
<p>We want the truth. What the government knows about UFOs, aliens on Earth, not just in the universe, which is great, too. I would like to know that as well, but that&#x27;s really what people want to know, right? So, let&#x27;s go right now. Um, the guy that put out the, uh, famous viral clip of aliens, uh, talking with Obama, right, Brian Taylor Cohen, which by the way, let me clear something up. When I made that video, um, I I included a clip of Shawn Ryan.</p>
<p>Um, and he mentioned that Brian Taylor Cohen was a no-name podcaster. He never heard of him, this, and that. And then people in the comments were saying, &quot;I said that. I didn&#x27;t say that. All I said was I&#x27;d never heard of Brian Taylor, but I didn&#x27;t call him a no-name podcast or any of that.</p>
<p>That was what Shawn Ryan said when people were accusing me of Patrick, how do you, you know, why did you say he&#x27;s a no-name podcast? This guy&#x27;s got millions of stuff. I didn&#x27;t say it. So, either you&#x27;re not watching the videos or you&#x27;re just going off the comments, you know, someone, you know what I mean? Like, watch the videos. Y&#x27;all pay attention. I That&#x27;s not what I said at all.</p>
<p>So anyway, just wanted to clear that up. Um, you know, anyway, so Brian Taylor Cohen put out a tweet about Trump&#x27;s um, statement that again everyone is talking about and I thought it was kind of funny. Y&#x27;all bitched at me about a follow-up question, but now we&#x27;re going to get the truth about aliens and UFOs. You&#x27;re welcome. That&#x27;s pretty funny, right? So he&#x27;s it kind of was this domino effect, right, of him asking uh this question to Obama that blows up, right? And then it just cascaded into this, right? Um but I thought that was pretty funny.</p>
<p>So you know what? Uh because people were mad at Brian. Not I wasn&#x27;t mad, but I was like, &quot;Dude, you you missed a chance for a follow-up.&quot; And he readily admitted that he should have followed up and asked for clarification, which Obama did come out and clarify his statements, right? Um he said that uh you know he meant just statistically speaking in the universe we&#x27;re not alone right um but I just you know very funny so look there&#x27;s more let&#x27;s go to this clip on Fox News as well where they talked about all of this and gave a little more information of what people are saying about all of this. He surprised a lot of people by accusing former President Barack Obama of revealing classified information following his comments about the existence of extraterrestrial life. White House correspondent Aisha Hazny starts us off tonight live from the North Lawn. President is accusing former President Barack Obama of revealing classified information when he told a podcaster, &quot;Aliens are real.&quot; Here&#x27;s that Obama comment and then President Trump responding to Peter Dussy today.</p>
<p>Are aliens real? &gt;&gt; Uh, they&#x27;re real, but I haven&#x27;t seen them. And and and uh they&#x27;re not being kept in uh what is it? &gt;&gt; Area 51. &gt;&gt; Area 51. There there&#x27;s no underground uh facility unless there&#x27;s this enormous conspiracy and they they hid it from the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; Well, he gave classified information.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that. You know, &gt;&gt; the aliens are real. &gt;&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He made He made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information. No, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do.</p>
<p>A lot of people believe it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, Peter? &gt;&gt; I Well, the president can declassify anything that he wants to. So, &gt;&gt; trouble I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. &gt;&gt; That raised a lot of eyebrows today. What are you hearing? &gt;&gt; It has.</p>
<p>Absolutely, Brett. Um, so at least one Hill Republican tonight is telling me that he is reading this as the president all but confirming what Barack Obama said that aliens are indeed real. Uh, so we followed up with the White House here. We asked them several questions. We wanted to know what part of Barack Obama&#x27;s comments did they feel did the president feel were classified? Was it the part where he says that he believes in aliens or was it the part that they were not in Area 51? They were also asked if uh the DOJ was going to look into these comments uh perhaps uh because they were classified.</p>
<p>The White House told us there&#x27;s nothing to add to the president&#x27;s comments tonight. Brett, all of this comes as the president&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Laura Trump, told a podcast this week that the president has a speech prepared about extraterrestrial life that he will give at the right time. Listen, we&#x27;ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this. We all want to know about the UFOs or we all want to know what&#x27;s going on. And he played a little koi with us.</p>
<p>I have just heard kind of around that I think he&#x27;s actually said I think my father-in-law has actually said it that there is some speech that he has that I guess at at the right time and I don&#x27;t know when the right time is he&#x27;s going to break out and and talk about and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life. and Brett. The White House press secretary Caroline Levit, you&#x27;ll remember this week, um was asked about Lara Trump&#x27;s comments and she said a speech on aliens would be news to me, but we are expecting more reaction from The Hill in the coming hours and days. Brett, &gt;&gt; obviously, we&#x27;ve done a lot of stories on this. The Age of Disclosure, that documentary that came out, we talked about that with the producer.</p>
<p>A lot of people are interested in it. It definitely raised some eyebrows today. I should Thank you. &gt;&gt; All right. So, that&#x27;s very interesting, right? Um there&#x27;s a lot there.</p>
<p>Now, look, I made another video about Trump&#x27;s speech because there&#x27;s more details that have come out about that and that&#x27;ll release um later on this evening or whatever, you know, later on. Um so, expect that. I do have it on Patreon and for YouTube members only, you can watch it now. Um but it kind of, you know, goes into some of those details. Now, this is before Trump made the comments on Air Force One and um the statement that he put out, but it&#x27;s still relevant, I think.</p>
<p>Um so, make sure to check out that video. It&#x27;s a long deep dive um about this Trump UFO disclosure speech that may be coming. Um so, I don&#x27;t know. This is all very, very interesting. I have to admit I was so skeptical uh when this story came out about the Trump speech about, you know, UFO disclosure and aliens and and I have to admit I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve, you know, there&#x27;s a little part of me thinking maybe there&#x27;s something going to happen here.</p>
<p>Um you know, I&#x27;ve you know, I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of it&#x27;s just interesting, right? Um definitely has my ears perked up. I&#x27;m definitely paying attention. I&#x27;m sitting up, right? Um, I&#x27;ve got my my my smart glasses on, right? Um, so let&#x27;s see what happens. I&#x27;m very curious about this.</p>
<p>And it is interesting also that the White House didn&#x27;t comment on what part of Obama&#x27;s statements were classified, right? And if you pay attention, Trump said in that Air Force One, those comments, he said that he that Obama got that from classified information. So his comments came from classified information. So that&#x27;s interesting. So maybe just revealing there&#x27;s nothing at Area 51. He shouldn&#x27;t have said that, right? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>I I I don&#x27;t know. Right. This is all we&#x27;re kind of left in the dark and wondering what the heck is going on. But one thing for sure, we do know that the Trump administration is moving forward to identify and release information about UFOs, UAP, aliens, and extraterrestrial life. Right.</p>
<p>So, and it is kind of interesting they separated alien and extraterrestrial life. I don&#x27;t know, right? Who knows, right? What what are we going to find out? They&#x27;re interdimensional. They&#x27;re ultraterrestrial, cryptoaterrestrial, you know, who knows? Time travelers. I you know, this is all very interesting, y&#x27;all. Are we on the cusp of a h, you know, revolutionary humanity changing disclosure? It is possible.</p>
<p>Right. It is very possible. And I would say we&#x27;re closer than we&#x27;ve ever been. Right now, again, the truth may not be what we want, but at least it&#x27;ll be the truth. Hopefully, right? Can we trust even the stuff that comes out? Um is will it will it be heavily redacted? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>But John, I saw John Greenwall Jr. from the Black Vault um put out uh a statement like, &quot;Hey, if y&#x27;all need my help, I&#x27;m here.&quot; here and that got a lot of attention because Jon has been he&#x27;s the foyer request master, right? Um and he&#x27;s been doing work on this for decades. So hopefully they do enlist him to help. And again, literally everyone is talking about this. So um very excited to see where this goes.</p>
<p>Let me know your comments down below and um let&#x27;s see what happens. All right, betters. We&#x27;ll see you on the next one. Remember, every day is a gift, y&#x27;all. Peace.</p>
