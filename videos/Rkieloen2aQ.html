            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[music] If you walk [music] deep enough into the Owl Mountains along the misty border of Poland and the Czech Republic, you will find a place where the [music] forest feels wrong. The trees are twisted, the ground is cold, and hidden amidst the dense ancient vegetation of lower Salacia lies a strange mosscovered ruin. It stands silent in the mist. A massive circular concrete skeleton that looks like a forgotten temple to a dark god or perhaps a trap left behind by a giant. The locals call it the henge or the stone ring.</p>
<p>If you ask the official historians, they will tell you that this is merely the foundation for a cooling tower of a coal fired power plant that was never completed during the war. They will tell you it is nothing but concrete and steel. But those who survived the nearby forced labor camps tell a different, much darker story. They speak of things that official history tries to forget. They speak of armored SS convoys arriving in the dead of night, guarding cargo that was never listed on any manifest.</p>
<p>They speak of ghostly violet lights shooting straight into the sky, tearing through the darkness and illuminating the clouds from below with an unnatural glow. And most terrifying of all, they speak of a sound. A low throbbing hum like a swarm of angry bees trapped in a metal jar. A sound that vibrated through the ground, making chests ache and leaving the metallic taste of blood in one&#x27;s mouth. This was no power plant.</p>
<p>This was the epicenter of the Third Reich&#x27;s most insane ambition. &gt;&gt; It was a project not designed to create guns, tanks, or missiles, &gt;&gt; but a weapon intended to bend the very fabric of reality itself. &gt;&gt; Its code name was DLOA, the bell. Today, history declassified reopens the top secret files on the device rumored to possess the ability to manipulate gravity, alter time, and potentially open gateways to other dimensions. We will investigate the horrific cost of its creation, the madness of its inventors, and we must answer the most haunting question of all.</p>
<p>When the war ended and the smoke cleared, where did the machine and its [music] sinister creator vanished to? To [music] understand the mystery of the bell, we must first travel back to 1943. [music] The tide of the Second World War had begun to turn decisively against Germany. As Allied bombers reigned fire upon German cities, [music] devastating the industrial heartland and reducing factories to rubble, Adolf Hitler ordered his most critical military projects to be moved underground. He needed them safe from the eyes of reconnaissance planes and the destruction of heavy bombs. A massive subterranean complex was commissioned in the Sicia region under the code name project Greece or the giant.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of prisoners from the Gross Rosen concentration camp were worked to death to carve into the hardest granite in Europe. They hollowed out entire mountains, creating miles of tunnels, cavernous halls, and railway depots buried deep beneath the earth. It was an engineering marvel built on a foundation of human suffering. But what was the true purpose of Project Ree? Was it intended to be a final command center for the furer, a vault for stolen European art? Or was it a massive laboratory for something else entirely? At the Weslo mine, sitting directly above this labyrinth of tunnels lies that strange concrete structure known as the henge. Modern engineers who have examined this ruin have raised disturbing questions that debunk the cooling tower theory.</p>
<p>If it were merely a cooling tower, why is its foundation reinforced with high-grade steel thick enough to withstand the shock wave of a tactical nuclear explosion? Why were massive high voltage cables thick as a man&#x27;s thigh run directly from a dedicated power plant into the center of this ring? And most strangely, why are there heavyduty ceramic clips and anchor points embedded in the concrete? These anchors suggest they were not designed to hold something up, but to hold something down, something that was trying to push itself away from the earth with immense force. The answer and the legend of the bell comes primarily from the interrogation transcripts [music] of Yakob Sporinberg, a highranking SS general captured by the British and handed over to Polish authorities after the war. During his interrogation, Sporenberg revealed the existence of a project with a security clearance higher than the V2 rocket and even higher than the atomic bomb. It was a project completely separated from the regular military command, answering only to the SS. It was a physics experiment that defied all logic.</p>
<p>Sporenberg described a secret laboratory known as the fly trap located near the Wises loss mine. Here the SS was not building a weapon to destroy cities. They were building a machine to conquer the laws of physics. The location was chosen for the high uranium content in the soil and the dense rock that could shield the outside world from the radiation or perhaps to shield the world from what was being summoned inside. The secrecy was absolute.</p>
<p>The penalty for speaking about it was death. And the goal was nothing less than the mastery of space and time. Based on the [music] scattered fragments of intelligence, technical diagrams recovered from the era, and Sporenberg&#x27;s testimony, we can reconstruct the anatomy of this mechanical monster. DLA was described as a massive heavy metallic [music] object standing approximately 12 to 15 ft high and 9 ft wide. Its shape was identical to a large church bell, which gave the project its name.</p>
<p>It was cast from a hard, dark, and extremely heavy metal that looked like polished ceramic, but felt cold and dense to the touch. But the heart of this machine was what made it truly terrifying. Inside the thick ceramic shell were two massive cylinders positioned one inside the other. When activated, these cylinders rotated in opposite directions at extreme speeds, defying the mechanical limits of the era. But they didn&#x27;t just spin air.</p>
<p>To operate the machine, German scientists pumped in a mysterious violet gold metallic liquid called Xeram 525. This substance, Xeram 525, remains one of the great mysteries of the war. It was stored in lead lined flasks 3 cm thick to contain its intense radiation. Many researchers and historians believe Veron 525 was a highly radioactive isotope of mercury, possibly the legendary red mercury, a substance theoretically capable of releasing immense amounts of energy. Others suggest it was a thorium and burillium compound cooled to absolute zero to create a superconductor.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, it was volatile, dangerous, and incredibly powerful. When high voltage electricity was channeled into the device from the nearby power plant, the counterrotating cylinders created a vortex. But not just a vortex of air or liquid. They created an electromagnetic storm of unimaginable power. The Xeram 525 became ionized, glowing with a ghostly violet brilliance that shone through the casing, illuminating the dark mineshaft with the light of a dying star.</p>
<p>Theoretical physics papers recovered from Germany at the time mentioned concepts like vortex [music] compression and magnetic field separation. Essentially, the scientists were trying to create a torsion field. They were attempting to rip a hole in the fabric of space time. If their theories were correct, DLOA would generate an anti-gravity field, allowing it to fly without wings, propulsion, or noise. But more terrifyingly, some equations suggested that such a field could bend time itself, effectively separating the machine and anything inside it from the normal flow of chronology.</p>
<p>It was a technology centuries ahead of its time, being forged in the desperate fires of 1944. Science without ethics [music] often leads to horror. And the testing of Diglock was a descent [music] into a specific kind of madness. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re almost out of time. &gt;&gt; Every time the bell was activated, it could only run for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
<p>The energy consumption was so massive it caused blackouts in the nearby towns. But the duration was limited for another reason. It was killing everything near it. Its effective range was a radius of approximately 200 m. Within this death zone, a horrific phenomenon occurred that the German scientists coldly cataloged as cellular crystallization.</p>
<p>They placed rats, lizards, and [music] rabbits in cages around the bell to study the effects. When the machine hummed to life, creating that buzzing hive sound, and the violet light pulsed, these animals didn&#x27;t burn. They didn&#x27;t suffocate. Instead, something far worse happened. The water inside their bodies, the blood in their veins, began to separate into distinct chemical components.</p>
<p>The blood coagulated [music] and turned into a clear gel. The flesh and organs turned into a substance resembling rancid fat or candle wax. They died instantly, but their bodies remained intact, crystallized from the inside out. It wasn&#x27;t just animals. plants in the laboratory, ferns and mosses, would decompose into a black tarlike grease or crumble into gray ash instantly without any fire as if their molecular bonds had simply stopped existing.</p>
<p>This was destruction on quantum level. The machine was attacking the very glue that holds matter together. The creators themselves could not escape the curse of their creation. Despite wearing thick rubber protective suits, heavy helmets with red tinted visors, and observing from behind concrete barriers, the research team began to fall. &gt;&gt; Five of the original seven scientists in the inner circle died after the initial tests.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t die from trauma, but from the inside. They suffered from violent memory loss, loss of balance, vertigo, and a constant, sickening metallic taste in their mouths that wouldn&#x27;t go away. &gt;&gt; We don&#x27;t have much time. &gt;&gt; They called it &gt;&gt; the bell syndrome. &gt;&gt; They realized they were dealing with radiation that wasn&#x27;t on the normal spectrum.</p>
<p>It was something unknown. Yet, despite the looming death and the horrific cost, &gt;&gt; you hear me? The project was pushed forward with frantic, obsessive speed. The Third Reich was collapsing. The Allies were crossing the Rine. But the SS believed that if they could master this power, the war was not lost.</p>
<p>They believed they could rewrite the ending. To understand the fate of the bell, we must look at the man holding the leash. The conductor of this deadly orchestra was SS General Hans Campler. &gt;&gt; He was a doctor of engineering, a ruthless architect who had designed the layout of the concentration [music] camps to maximize efficiency. By the end of the war, Cameler had risen [music] to become the third most powerful man in the Third Reich, eclipsing even Himmler and Guring in terms of technological control.</p>
<p>the situation is. &gt;&gt; He held absolute authority over all top secret wonder weapon projects from the V2 rocket to the jet fighters and finally Dloa. April 1945 [music] &gt;&gt; we must pull back. &gt;&gt; The end was near. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s impossible.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The Red Army was smashing through the Eastern Front, closing in on the clandestine facilities in Casia. Berlin was drowning in flames. Cameler knew that time had run out. But unlike other generals who were planning their surrender or suicide, Cameler had a different plan. He possessed the most valuable bargaining chip in human history.</p>
<p>An emergency order was issued from his headquarters. All 60 core scientists and technicians of the Dloa project were summoned to a meeting point. They were told they were being evacuated to South America to continue their work. They believed they were the chosen ones, but there was no evacuation for them. Cameler knew that these men carried the secrets of the bell in their minds.</p>
<p>They were loose ends. In a brutal act of silence, Cameler ordered the mass execution of his own team. The most brilliant physicists, the engineers who built the machine were shot and buried in unmarked mass graves near the Wesl mine. The secret was sealed in blood. After that night, Hans came vanished and more importantly, the bell vanished.</p>
<p>When the allies arrived, they found the facility stripped bare. &gt;&gt; Who cut them? The massive cables were cut. The documents were burned. The containment chamber for the bell was empty. Hans Cameler remains the only highranking SS general whose body was never found and who never appeared at the Nuremberg trials.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t die in Berlin. He didn&#x27;t surrender. He simply evaporated. The Americans hunted for him. The Soviets hunted for him, but he was gone and he had taken the prize with him.</p>
<p>So where did the time machine go? There are two prevailing theories and both are equally chilling. The first theory suggests a deal with the devil. We know about operation paperclipip where the US smuggled Nazi scientists like Vera von Brown to America to build rockets. Some historians believe Cameler made a secret deal with the US military intelligence. In exchange for his life and freedom, he handed over the bell and the remaining stockpiles of Zerum 525.</p>
<p>This theory gains terrifying weight when we look at an event that happened 20 years later. On December 9th, 1965 in the small town of Kexsburg, Pennsylvania, a fireball streaked across the sky and crashed into the local woods. &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s go. Move out. &gt;&gt; The US Army swarmed the area within hours, sealing off the town and intimidating witness.</p>
<p>But those who saw the object before the military arrived described it clearly. A goldcoled metallic object shaped exactly like a giant bell about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. They reported seeing strange hieroglyphic-like symbols etched around the rim of the device. The description of the [music] Kexsburg UFO matches the description of DLOA to a chilling [music] degree. Was this a test flight of the captured Nazi technology that went wrong? Was the American military trying to replicate the experiments of the SS in the Pennsylvania woods? &gt;&gt; Cross reference the readings with the flight.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The second theory enters the realm of the impossible. Some believe that Cameler didn&#x27;t hand the device over. They believe he used it. If the equations regarding time distortion were correct, is it possible that in those final desperate hours of the war, Cameler activated the machine one last time? Did he use the bell not to escape to Argentina, but to escape to another time? To this day, the Weslo mine remains silent and cold. The flooded tunnels beneath the Owl Mountains have yet to be fully explored, guarding their secrets in the dark [music] water.</p>
<p>DLCA might have been an anti-gravity weapon. It might have been a portal. Or perhaps it is just a dark legend, a ghost story woven to hide the brutal reality of human experimentation. But one thing is certain. Science when it crosses the boundaries of ethics opens doors that humanity should never step through.</p>
<p>The bell represents the ultimate temptation, [bell] power without consequence. And there are some things once created that never truly disappear. They are just waiting in the shadows for someone to flip the switch again. Where is Hans Comler? And where is the bell? The clock is ticking. But for the bell, perhaps time doesn&#x27;t matter at all.</p>
