            <p>Throughout history, many revolutionary inventions have either disappeared or been deliberately suppressed. Some were so advanced that they could have disrupted the existing power balance. Take for example Stanley Meyers&#x27;s water powered car. In the 1990s, Meyer claimed to have developed a fuel cell that could run an engine using only water. This technology had the potential to completely transform the oil industry.</p>
<p>However, just as he was negotiating with investors, Meyer suddenly died. The official cause was listed as a brain aneurysm, but many believe he was poisoned. Similarly, Nicola Tesla&#x27;s wireless energy project could have provided limitless free electricity, but investors shut it down as free energy was not profitable for major corporations. In the 1970s, magnetic motors were developed with the potential to generate unlimited energy. Yet, these projects either failed to secure funding or had their patents purchased and shelved by large companies.</p>
<p>Could all these events suggest that our world is shaped more by economic interests than technological progress? If these inventions had been fully realized, what kind of world would we be living in today? What if?</p>
