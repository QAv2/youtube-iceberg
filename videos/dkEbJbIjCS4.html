            <p>hello welcome to my channel this is for educational purposes and on this channel we look at uh usually different uh kinds of theories of everything different varieties and um so far uh the main coverage has been the ancient Egyptian Tree of Life and now we&#x27;re looking at the reciprocal system of theory which was originally derived by Dewey B Larson and uh we&#x27;ve gone I think today is video number 222 on the reciprocal system and we&#x27;ve gone over a few of his books and uh uh talk he gave and um now we are looking at um an article that kind of sums up generally his uh his book called Universe of motion which is his book on astronomy uh this is the third book in his uh three volume set called the structure of the physical Universe we went over the full book uh nothing but motion which is on Atomic physics the second book in that series is called basic properties of matter it&#x27;s primary primarily on chemistry and we will be covering that book uh in a little bit more detail later on uh in this third book uh Universe of motion on astronomy which he put down in about 1984. is a very difficult book to go through um and um we might go through some of it at some point but right now I&#x27;m reading an article that I wrote um that sums up a lot of his findings from the universe of motion just to get give you a feel for it um and uh I guess without further Ado we will just start right where it is uh we started this article yesterday so if you want to get from the very start all you have to do is go back one video uh but uh we are going to proceed forward from where we left off yesterday according to the reciprocal system scalar motion at the speed of light in all directions from all locations is the most fundamental thing Larson calls it the space-time progression or just the progression Einstein declared that the speed of light about 10 million times the highway speed limit was the speed of a limit of the universe but Larson agreed disagreed by deducing that the speed of light was actually the midpoint not the maximum speed of the universe in the reciprocal system half of the Universe moves slower than the speed of light this is the universe we are familiar with the material sector the other half of the Universe moves faster than the speed of light the cosmic sector the material sector and the cosmic sector are are identical only the roles of space and time are reversed Einstein was right in a certain sense when he said that nothing can go faster than the speed of light but he only considered the acceleration of matter through the addition of energy an indirect edition of fractional units of motion according to the reciprocal system however when you consider the acceleration of matter through the direct edition of units of motion in massive explosions you can exceed the speed of light the only bodies capable of such massive explosions are massive Aggregates stars and galaxies Cosmic stars and Cosmic galaxies the only things that can go into the cosmic sector from the material sector and vice versa are stars and galaxies they represent the bridge from one sector to the other in a grand cycle of the universe okay uh this is our third visualization two different motions one in space one in time combine to form a grand cycle in space new matter comes into the material sector as Cosmic atoms from cosmic explosions and then the cosmic atoms are converted into subatomic particles and then into material atoms the atoms aggregate into molecules molecules into dust particles dust particles into clouds and clouds ultimately into Stars into clusters of stars star clusters into galaxies and galaxies into clusters of galaxies all of these Transformations occur continuously and simultaneously time wise all of these entities are also going through their individual life cycles getting older and older the larger the entity in Space the longer the life cycle in time young matter at the bottom of the periodic table evolves into older matter young Stars evolve into older and older stars the oldest stars then explode into the cosmic sector as material atoms as part material atoms and particles these material particles are quickly converted into subatomic particles than Cosmic atoms which aggregate into Cosmic stars and galaxies which evolve into older and older Cosmic Stars the oldest explode into the material sector and are converted into material atoms the cycle goes on the Cycles go on and on and uh a note here is that c Cosmic Galactic explosions from the cosmic sector appear to us us as gamma ray bursts and the the General matter coming into the cosmic sector coming in from the cosmic sector we see that as uh as Masons or anti-matter cosmic rays theoretically matter becomes heavier and heavier meaning higher and higher numbers on the periodic table as time goes on but the region of Intergalactic space is almost empty of matter and what little it has is mostly new matter along with some stray fragments left over from prior explosions heavy elements are formed by a process of capture of neutrinos while they are passing through atoms this happens rarely and significant change takes almost forever but eventually all of the elements up to the so far undiscovered element number 117 are formed mostly in minute quantities at the same time that these elements are getting heavier because of the capture process they&#x27;re also aggregating together to form molecules and dust particles through the contact process approaching each other within one unit of space uh and then uh we&#x27;ve got another visualization discrete units Larson&#x27;s Universe of motion is a quantized universe meaning that quantities only occur in discrete units integers although these units are so small that we see these phenomena as smooth continuous and statistical they are not there there are only discrete individual entities there cannot be two and one-sixth of a unit of space or time for example it is either two or three nothing less than one unit of space or time can exist the individual unit of space the smallest increment of space in a quantized universe equals 4.56 times 10 to the minus 8 meters about one 500 000 of an inch inside this the time region um because you have less than one unit of space you only there for have time and then so Larson calls this the time region where the rules change and all measurements are in terms of time the rules change again because of the reciprocal relationship between space and time there is also an inversion of the primary forces the progression and gravitation those are the two primary forces the progression could also be known as anti-gravity within the time region the progression moves inward towards zero known as atomic cohesion while gravitation moves outward toward Unity the natural unit of space toward the surface of a sphere of one unit radius atoms inside the time region balance the progression and gravitation at what is called the inter-atomic distance this distance is measured in space but is really an extension in time the inter-atomic distance is much less than that than a unit of space so that so they cohere sorry so they cohere with other atoms to form molecules and dust particles inside the time region a dust particle is a cut off point because it is the largest aggregate that can take advantage of the rules of the time region astronomers are confused as to why they have observed a cutoff point right around this natural unit of space limit and also there is a space region inside a natural unit of time Which is less than one six quadrillionth of a second the time region is where Atomic molecular and dust particles attract each other as the dust particles grow larger however they exceed the time region motion and we revert to the normal rules of the time space region uh of the material sector wherein dust particles move away from each other because they are outside each other&#x27;s gravitational limits in the time space region the progression moves particles out toward Infinity while gravitation moves inward toward the natural unit of space once again the Dynamics of the universe of motion are determined by the competition between the force of the progression continuous motion out at the speed of light in all directions from every location and the force of gravitation uh and too bad the establishment astronomers are only aware of the latter and then we have another visualization about the gravitational limit dust particles move away from each other but massive Aggregates are able to build up a spherical gravitational field which nullifies the progression Larson calls this the gravitational limit the capture process makes atoms heavier the contact process makes Aggregates larger combine that with A continuous influx of new matter from the cosmic sector and dust is built up into a cloud building until the mass and the density of the dust cloud are high enough to form a gravitational field only massive bodies like the Earth have enough Mass to extend their gravitational fields far beyond their surfaces really massive bodies such as stars and galaxies have enough mass for their gravitational limits to extend for light years within the gravitational limit gravitation is more powerful than the progression beyond the gravitational limit the force of the progression is more powerful than the force of gravity uh now we&#x27;ve also got what we call the solar gravitational limit the gravitation gravitational limit is way way out in very large Aggregates for example the sun&#x27;s gravitational limit is 3.61 Light Years or about 250 000 times the distance from the Sun to the Earth and 6 000 times the average distance from the Sun to Pluto okay so if we&#x27;re looking at the solar system we go all the way out to Pluto and you have to go 6 000 times that far to get out to the sun&#x27;s gravitational limit now to me that doesn&#x27;t make sense um and paret was pointing this out I was talking about this yesterday with the findings of uh the astronomer Byron katari who uh is suggesting and peret is agreeing that our measurements are way out of whack as far as the distances are concerned and that um you know Larson finds it uh Larson the one of the weaknesses of his approach is that he uses the scientific data uh kind of as a check or reference on his theoretical data his theoretical data come out uh in some cases without the uh the numbers attached to them and then he looks at the numbers that have already been produced by the Legacy scientists through their observations and measurements and so then he kind of uh shoehorns his findings into the already found data and in this case I just it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense that you know uh that whole region of outer space where there where there isn&#x27;t anything really there are no planets um they&#x27;re what you call exoplanets and maybe some comets and stuff but that really when you&#x27;re talking about the gravitational limit the gravitational limit is the territory of the Sun that is that whole territory is within the sun&#x27;s gravitational limit so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it that means that it is not within the limit of any other stars gravitational limit and that the closest star to us is is uh 4.3 light years away um that just leaves an incredible amount of empty space out there just being useless I I just can&#x27;t see that uh you know you go all the way out to Pluto and that the sun&#x27;s gravitational limit is 6 000 times that far so um in in categorize view the universe the the measurements are are much much much smaller um whereby there are a lot of stars and even some galaxies that are as close as less than a one light year away from us um that does make more sense to me uh I know I don&#x27;t know I mean you know there are many other theories about the shape and size of the Universe um that I think are worth looking at um I am an agnostic on this matter but uh I just have to point out that Larson&#x27;s findings here just don&#x27;t ring true to me um uh it it just seems as if this is uh kind of contrary to Occam&#x27;s razor and that it you know what what is the sun doing with all that territory that&#x27;s out Beyond Pluto okay back to back to the paper Stars reverse uh Reserve these immense volumes of space for themselves they cannot approach other stars any closer than the larger star is gravitational limit the gravitational limits play a major role in the Dynamics of um of astronomy the tug of war between the progression and gravitation evidenced by the globular clusters okay I guess uh we&#x27;re moving into part two here um trying to uh see you know uh maybe we can get into a paragraph here part two Stellar formation and Stellar burning globular clusters are transitions between stars and galaxies they are the zones of star formation and they are the key participants in Galactic formation a globular cluster is a large spherical aggregate with many smaller Aggregates which are dust-filled protostars with practically empty space between them a giant spheroidal Galaxy may have as many as um a trillion Stars while a globular cluster has at most a million stars okay um I think we&#x27;ll pick it up there we&#x27;ll be starting with a visualization uh now I think this paper we should be able to get it done in like five or six days so um keep tuning in and thank you for tuning in today if you missed the yesterdays go back and start yesterday and then today and you&#x27;ll be all caught up with this paper uh thanks for tuning in and have a great day</p>
