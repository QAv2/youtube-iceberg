            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>This is something sacred here. This area is used to keep the evil on that side. Hey, Travis, I&#x27;m seeing the shadow of some other aircraft.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s nothing within  50 miles of the ranch. (static buzzing) -What happened? What the heck is that? -BRYANT: Some thing doesn&#x27;t want us to collect data from the triangle.</p>
<p>The Cessna flew 62 and a half miles -below the mesa. -What on earth?  NARRATOR:  There is a ranch  in Northern Utah.</p>
<p> It is considered the epicenter  of the strangest and most  disturbing phenomena on Earth:  animal mutilations,  bizarre UFO sightings  and unusual energies that have  proven harmful to humans.  For 20 years,  the federal government  tried to find answers</p>
<p> and failed.  Now a new team  of dedicated scientists,  researchers and experts  has taken over.  They are determined to solve</p>
<p> the mystery and reveal... ...The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch. Oh, here they are. Pull it right in here</p>
<p>somewhere, Dragon.  After last week&#x27;s Cessna  experiment at the triangle, our attempt to collect usable data of the anomaly once again left us with more questions than answers.</p>
<p>Guys, I appreciate y&#x27;all coming out.  So, to help us get a better  look at the triangle anomaly,  we invited Richard Tenney,  Chuck Hards and David Moulton from the Salt Lake Astronomical</p>
<p>Society out to the ranch.  They&#x27;re going to help us  with tonight&#x27;s experiment  at the triangle. So, I have to ask you what you know about the ranch.</p>
<p>What have you heard about this place? Uh, I&#x27;m a little familiar with the history of it, uh, just because, you know, being a Utah native and... and hearing the stories</p>
<p>over the years. DAVID: I have some family in the area, some friends, and they-they tell me stories of things they&#x27;ve seen on the road and-and -weird stuff. -Really? So, you know something</p>
<p>of the phenomenology that we&#x27;ve been studying here? Yes, a little bit. RICHARD: And I&#x27;m gonna be candid. This is all brand-new to me. I have no prior knowledge</p>
<p>of what&#x27;s going on. Better yet. So, guys, uh, we have an anomaly in the sky, uh, in that direction, almost due west from right here. It&#x27;s in an area we call &quot;the</p>
<p>triangle,&quot; and it&#x27;s above that. We&#x27;ve seen GPS anomalies and a radio signal actually coming from that area. What we would like to do is look through the anomaly at an astronomical object and see if they seem to look</p>
<p>the way they&#x27;re supposed to, or if they&#x27;re obscured, moved, or something along those lines. So, here&#x27;s the plan. You guys start getting set up, and what I would like to do is, so you can see the area that we&#x27;re talking about that has the anomaly in it, Dragon and I are gonna take</p>
<p>a rocket out there and set it up in-in this spot and launch it right underneath where we are. You guys try and capture it through the telescope. -That make sense?</p>
<p>-Yeah. -Yes, sir. -Okay. -All right, let&#x27;s go!  TRAVIS:  The plan  is to have Richard,</p>
<p> Chuck and Dave  focus their  high-powered telescopes  up at that mile-high area  above the triangle while  we launch more rockets  in an attempt  to stimulate UAP activity. That&#x27;s very impressive. How tall is that? -Ten feet?</p>
<p>-Yeah. It&#x27;s a hundred inches from the mirror down there up to the IPC here, actually.  TRAVIS:  This was a big experiment  with a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p>CHUCK: I&#x27;m up and running.  TRAVIS:  These guys have brought out  six different telescopes  that can capture</p>
<p> high-definition imagery all the way out to outer space.  Each one also features  a computerized database  of planets and constellations  so it can lock  onto a known object  in the sky above the triangle  and track that object&#x27;s  motion precisely.</p>
<p>Any change in the appearance of that object&#x27;s motion means that there&#x27;s a gravitational anomaly above the triangle, bending the starlight in a way it shouldn&#x27;t. -Hey, Kaleb.</p>
<p>-KALEB: Hey, Erik. You, uh, called us in? Yeah, so, I&#x27;ve got this tracking cam ready. -Okay. -This is the PTZ</p>
<p>that goes with the all-sky. So, this is the one that you&#x27;re gonna pair -with the sky-facing one? -Yeah, yeah. So, we&#x27;ve got that fish-eye camera&#x27;s looking</p>
<p>basically horizon to horizon. -It&#x27;s that one right there, right? -Right here.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Meanwhile, Erik had Thomas and Kaleb help install his new, all-sky UAP tracking camera system so we could have even more eyes on the anomalous area above the triangle. This is a smart system. It will hopefully help us to avoid missing anything</p>
<p>that comes in our airspace. Well, this is... this is amazing. If you&#x27;re ready to put that up, -I&#x27;ll work with you in here on it.</p>
<p>-THOMAS: Okay. -We&#x27;ll go get her done. -All right.  TRAVIS:  It&#x27;s at the triangle where we&#x27;ve repeatedly detected</p>
<p> dangerously high energy spikes  about 5,000 feet up... Look at the sky, y&#x27;all! -UAP right there! -KALEB: Yup, I see it.  TRAVIS:  ...and also launched rockets</p>
<p> that stimulated numerous UAPs  to suddenly appear. You&#x27;ve got to be (bleep) me. I&#x27;m really excited to have these. It&#x27;ll just be nice to be able</p>
<p>to actually zoom in on stuff and track it across the sky. Hey, Erik?  Uh, Tom&#x27;s about to put the camera up for you. Perfect. I&#x27;ve got him in view.</p>
<p> ERIK:  Adding to our surveillance program, we have set up an all-sky camera.  This is a fish-eye lens that  sees from horizon to horizon  and straight overhead,  taking in the entire canopy</p>
<p> of the sky.  We&#x27;re also adding  a directable telescopic camera  that is able to identify,  track and follow objects  that appear in the sky  over the ranch.</p>
<p>-Well, we just about got it, Kaleb. -Okay.  ERIK:  We&#x27;re looking at the skies</p>
<p> over the triangle  and at the ranch  in a lot of different ways. Hey, Erik, it&#x27;s Kaleb. We got the camera up. Can you see on the network?  I&#x27;ve got it, guys.</p>
<p>It looks good. We can see pretty much everything we need to see from that position. Awesome.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s one thing off the checklist.  TRAVIS:  This new all-sky  camera system is really vital  to our experiment.</p>
<p> The telescopes will be  locked onto the anomaly  above the triangle with  a very narrow field of view, so if UAP appear anywhere else on the ranch, we need to make sure we can capture them on video.</p>
<p>(cattle mooing)  The camera system  will also be able  to monitor the ranch cattle.  Because of how the cows  have acted in the past  when UAP appeared, they will  make the perfect biosensors  during the experiment.</p>
<p>All right. That&#x27;s all we got. TRAVIS: I guess we&#x27;ll just set it up in the center. BRYANT:</p>
<p>Yeah.  TRAVIS:  As we prepare for our  most advanced experiment yet,  Dragon and I went down  to the triangle to set up for the first rocket.</p>
<p>-BRYANT: Put it down so it&#x27;s... There we go. -Try to get it level. You think that&#x27;s far enough</p>
<p>away from the truck? Uh, well, that depends on who you&#x27;re asking. (laughs) -Whose truck is it? -(laughs) Since we only have an approximate zone of interest, this experiment</p>
<p>will have two goals. First, we want to record the best footage possible of any UAP that might appear. If you want to lock it about right there while we work on it,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s fine. -That&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;ll just lock it. -Oh, see if you can -get it about like that, Bryant. -Yup.</p>
<p>All right, we got the motor. And second, we want to pinpoint the exact spot that these things could be originating from. I&#x27;m thinking that right there -is a pretty-pretty good angle.</p>
<p>-Okay. -You locked in? All right. -Yup, we&#x27;re locked. I&#x27;m gonna turn the lights on and, uh, we&#x27;ll get ready to go.</p>
<p>Oh, and there&#x27;s... there&#x27;s a special light we put in the nose cone, too.  For this rocket, we have LED lights blinking all over the thing  so the astronomers out here  can find the thing in the sky.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s fine. All right. And then we&#x27;ll turn these on right before we go.  Once we were done,</p>
<p> all we needed was the dark and the telescopes ready to go. You can call &#x27;em and tell &#x27;em that we&#x27;re gonna be good to go whenever they are. BRYANT: Okay.</p>
<p>-JIM: Hey there, Tom and Kandus. -KANDUS: Hi, Jim. -Hello, neighbors. -Hello. -How you doing, kiddo?</p>
<p>-Hi. -Good to see you. -Good to see you. -Nice to see you.  -TRAVIS: While we waited  for the sun to go down,  Jim Morse, Tom Lewis and Kandus Linde were continuing  their effort to meet with</p>
<p> the members of the community who have their own stories about bizarre phenomenon. It&#x27;s nice to have Addy come up here and visit with us and compare notes as neighbors. -Yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks for having me over. -You&#x27;re our closest, closest neighbor. We run into you every once in a while.</p>
<p> TOM:  Addy is part of the Ute tribe,  and she has a few things she wants to share with us that may help us with the investigation here on the ranch. She just had witnessed something that I thought</p>
<p>would be pretty profound. Yeah, well, it was actually a couple nights ago. -Yeah. -Oh, so what happened</p>
<p>the other night? Well, me and a friend was bringing in groceries, and he called me out to look up at the sky. And there was a big old bright light.</p>
<p>-Hear anything? -It was so quiet. Yeah, and it was heading up north, and then it stops. But usually, when you see</p>
<p>an anomaly out here, they disappear because it&#x27;s like they know you see it. But this one didn&#x27;t do that. And then it started to go faster north.</p>
<p>And then it&#x27;s gone. Have you seen this type of thing before? Yeah, I&#x27;ve actually seen it before a few times. And my grandpa would talk about different anomalies</p>
<p>he would see and things that would happen around the farm. Like what, as an example? One night, he was out in the four-wheeler, and, uh, he noticed the cows were looking up at the sky, and there was a big old bright</p>
<p>ball very low to the ground. And it rose up, and then it just disappeared. Wow.  TOM:</p>
<p> Her story rings a bell because  we had this strange incident  with this cow  that just died all of sudden. Still don&#x27;t know why it happened. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>What in the world?  TOM:  There were some strange events  around the death of that cow. Is that black object the cow? ERIK: Yeah, the cow is right here. I&#x27;m gonna do this, uh,</p>
<p>very slowly, frame by frame. So here, I can&#x27;t help but also notice that there&#x27;s something happening here. -TRAVIS: Oh, whoa! Look at that!</p>
<p>-Yeah, there it is right there.  TOM:  I mean, having correlated  stories, very similar-- that was very interesting. So we have the lights</p>
<p>with the cow. Anything else come to mind? My grandpa&#x27;s seen some, uh, I guess you&#x27;d say it was a skinwalker. (sighs) I don&#x27;t know if I want to talk about this one, though.</p>
<p> JIM:  People out here  that have lived in the area-- they&#x27;ve grown up with these... this-this phenomenon called &quot;the skinwalker.&quot;  This is when the Navajo  and the Utes got</p>
<p> into more than a skirmish.  Back in the mid-1800s,  the Navajos ended up  cursing the Utes.  The skinwalker is  a shape-shifter.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s a fear associated with talking about these things. -It is scary to talk about. -Yeah. On the flip side, though,</p>
<p>what we&#x27;re trying to do is we&#x27;re trying to get as many stories as we can get. -Yeah. -You know, because it... it helps paint a picture</p>
<p>of what&#x27;s maybe going on in, you know, in this particular area on Skinwalker Ranch, -but the Uinta Basin in general. -Yeah. -Yeah. -KANDUS: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And the more people talk about that, the easier it gets -for other people to talk about it. -ADDY: Okay. Um, my grandpa went out in the field,</p>
<p>and he noticed a tall, dark, you know, figure watching him cut hay. And each time he would go around the... the field, it would get closer and closer.</p>
<p>-Mm-hmm. -And he said it looked like it had, like, a long cloak. And then, when he got closer to it, it just vanished.</p>
<p>Disappeared. I don&#x27;t know why. There is some scary things that have gone on -over the years on this ranch. -ADDY: Yeah.</p>
<p> BRANDON:  To have witness testimony to the reality of what we&#x27;re experiencing at the ranch is both thrilling, and it&#x27;s also terrifying.  I mean, what we&#x27;re</p>
<p> dealing with here is  something not  to be taken lightly. Well, thank you for coming up. You are our closest neighbor. -Yeah.</p>
<p>-You know? Really appreciate it. It&#x27;s always good to see you. -It&#x27;s good to see you guys. -Thanks for being so receptive. -I&#x27;m gonna walk Addy home.</p>
<p>-Thanks, Jim.  BRANDON:  What lies ahead?  I think we have before us  a great challenge to understand the origin and the agenda associated with the phenomena, with what we are</p>
<p>interacting with  on Skinwalker Ranch. ERIK: Hey, Bryant, go ahead.  BRYANT: We&#x27;re gonna say  another two-minute time frame starting  -here shortly.</p>
<p> -TRAVIS: As soon as it was  dark enough to see the stars,  it was time  to start the experiment. I want to fire rockets straight up from the inside of the triangle while the astronomers view and capture incredibly close images</p>
<p>of the anomaly. And hopefully, they can record something we can analyze later. And you&#x27;ve got a good view of their position? -Yeah, I think.</p>
<p>-Great. Whenever they&#x27;re ready. All right, so let&#x27;s lock it about-about right there. -Like that? Yeah.</p>
<p>-Yup, the wind&#x27;s picking up a little bit more. Hey, Bryant, Travis,  you guys ready for launch? We&#x27;re waiting on him. Yeah, we are, Erik. Anytime you&#x27;re ready, we can start the timer, go radio silence, and we will launch.</p>
<p>Please stand by. Give me a moment. I&#x27;m having trouble getting my, uh, computerized mount aligned. Hey, Bryant, please hold.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re not ready. -Holding the count. -No problem. We&#x27;ll hold. Just let us know.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t let me distract you, but if you can describe briefly, what is the function that you&#x27;re trying to do -that it&#x27;s not doing? -Uh, when we... When I first set up the mount, -I have to aim it</p>
<p>at a couple of stars. -Uh-huh. And that builds the model of the sky in the computer. It&#x27;s not letting me do that.</p>
<p> I&#x27;ve had this particular  telescope over ten years now, and I have never had a problem like this. (musical chime) -Okay, now it&#x27;s moving. -It&#x27;s not the light -that&#x27;s throwing it off, is it?</p>
<p>-No.  ERIK:  It becomes clear  that things are getting  really strange, really fast.  And we&#x27;re having difficulty</p>
<p> performing even the most basic  calibration exercises  with the telescopes in order to locate themselves in space. For some reason, this doesn&#x27;t surprise me. BRYANT:</p>
<p>Hey, we&#x27;re all set up here to launch this rocket whenever you guys are ready with your equipment.  ERIK:  We&#x27;re not ready.</p>
<p>The object I just slewed to a little while ago is now no longer in the database. This is junk right now. This is just thousands of</p>
<p>dollars&#x27; worth of junk. So, what do you mean that it&#x27;s not in there? This has thousands of objects in the database. -Stars, planets,</p>
<p>galaxies, everything. -Yeah. And if you enter it and hit it, it will slew to that object. I had it on one earlier, and that object is no longer</p>
<p>in the database. -They&#x27;re listed alphabetically. -The one that you started with? Right. It had to be in there for me to slew to it.</p>
<p>-Does this operate off GPS? -No, no. We&#x27;re doing it all manual so that we don&#x27;t have to rely on GPS. The one I&#x27;m looking for</p>
<p>is called &quot;Rasalgethi.&quot; The one we want is not there. -Has it ever done this before? -The one that&#x27;s right... No, but that&#x27;s the star that&#x27;s where the anomaly is.</p>
<p>So, the star above the anomaly is not showing up there? Not in the database. -And it was a little while ago. -(laughing) Are you hearing this, Erik? ERIK: I find it really mysterious that  as soon as we attempt</p>
<p> to lock on to stars  that are above the triangle, they are being deleted one at a time from the star catalog on the internal memory of his telescope computer. I don&#x27;t even know how that&#x27;s possible.</p>
<p> What is gaining access  to the memory of this system? It doesn&#x27;t want me to slew to the anomaly. See, that&#x27;s the one we want. -And that&#x27;s the one</p>
<p>not showing up? -It&#x27;s not there. Hey, Erik, we are ready  to roll  when you guys tell us to. Another star just disappeared</p>
<p>from the database. You have got to be kidding me. There&#x27;s nothing in the anomaly area that is in the database anymore. Now, you&#x27;re not connected</p>
<p>to network? You&#x27;re not pulling anything from the cloud, -or anything that would be updating? -Nothing. As soon as I try to point it</p>
<p>to the anomaly area, uh, any-any object... And that&#x27;s a big piece of sky. There are a lot of things in the catalog in that part of the sky, and I can find things all around the perimeter of it, but nothing in the middle.</p>
<p> THOMAS:  We&#x27;re dealing  with an issue over here.  As these stars are tracking  into the anomaly, they are disappearing off the menu</p>
<p>of the telescope.  We&#x27;re not even able  to train the telescope  on the stars because as the stars enter that area, they are disappearing off the menu of the telescope. That&#x27;s actually crazy.</p>
<p>So, let me get this straight. Ask them if they mean it&#x27;s disappearing from the menu  in the computer  from the telescopes  of potential stars  they can look at, or if they&#x27;re literally</p>
<p>disappearing? They are disappearing from the menu, disappearing from the internal catalog in the computer that&#x27;s running the scope. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>It was baffling that telescopes of this caliber, design and from different manufacturers  would all glitch like that. In fact, we&#x27;ve had so many sophisticated equipment failures take place during our experiments that it&#x27;s almost become a sign</p>
<p>that something strange is about to happen on the ranch. We really need to launch this rocket. Come on, Dragon. Let&#x27;s get this rocket ready.</p>
<p>Be advised, guys. We&#x27;re about to shoot the rocket and shoot it right through  -whatever this is! -No. Hurry up.</p>
<p>What if something happens? We need to launch this rocket now. We need to launch this rocket now. I want to go!  When the professional grade astronomical telescopes failed,</p>
<p>I knew this could be one of those times where ranch activity really starts to kick up. Tell them to get ready for a countdown. We&#x27;re gonna launch</p>
<p>in two minutes. Okay, we&#x27;re gonna launch this rocket in two minutes.  TRAVIS:  So I wanted to start</p>
<p> launching rockets  as fast as we could and see if we can get a response from the anomaly above the triangle. Five, four,  three, two, one. TRAVIS: See, that one shot up there.</p>
<p>There it is. KALEB: All right. Are you capturing stuff? -This scope is pretty dead. I mean...</p>
<p>-Dead? I aimed it manually in the, in the anomaly area, and then the camera wouldn&#x27;t work. I-I couldn&#x27;t get a, I couldn&#x27;t get a feed from the camera to the laptop.</p>
<p>RICHARD: And this camera is suddenly not working -when I&#x27;m pointing it over there. -CHUCK: Really? -Yeah. -Your camera&#x27;s not working? RICHARD:</p>
<p>This one&#x27;s not working on the... over... So, when you point this towards the triangle, -it&#x27;s not working?</p>
<p>-Nothing&#x27;s showing up on the camera.  RICHARD:  It&#x27;s hard to explain  why so many things go wrong anytime we tried</p>
<p>to swing the telescopes in the direction of the anomaly. You know, we were able to image fine outside of that, but the minute we get inside there, a number of mechanical problems, uh, seemed to occur,</p>
<p>which is i-inexplicable. All three of you have had glitches here that you don&#x27;t see other places? -Never had them before. -Yeah. ERIK:</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t get any of the cameras at the bait pen to come up. You&#x27;re not getting a response from any of our cameras out there? No. No. Everything&#x27;s dead out there.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t get through to anything. So, when he pointed that big telescope -towards the triangle... -Mm-hmm. ...the screen went black.</p>
<p>Now, that is really spooky. Makes you feel crazy. Hey, Travis, uh, we&#x27;re not even able to train the telescope  on the stars. So what&#x27;s going</p>
<p>into the computer and telling the computer and the telescope that the star isn&#x27;t there? I&#x27;ve never heard of such a thing.  Since the telescope computers wouldn&#x27;t align with the stars, the astronomers had to align them manually, but when they moved</p>
<p>the telescopes to look at the anomaly, the telescopes failed. Their cameras wouldn&#x27;t get an image through the triangle anomaly. Before it was the computers</p>
<p>that weren&#x27;t working, and now it&#x27;s the actual cameras connected to the telescopes. Hey, Bryant, Travis, do you copy?  BRYANT (over radio):  Oh, we got you.</p>
<p>Go ahead.  ERIK:  We can fixate on stars  elsewhere,  but not the ones  over the anomaly.</p>
<p>-No kidding?  -So, I think  it&#x27;d be a good idea  just to shine  the laser straight up to provide a reference that we can fixate on.</p>
<p>-That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re gonna do. -Okay. If you&#x27;re ready, we will shine it right now. Uh, go right...</p>
<p>Go right up to launch rail.  Since the telescope&#x27;s  computer wasn&#x27;t working, Erik got the idea to have Kaleb aim a military-grade laser pointer up through the triangle so that Chuck could</p>
<p>manually focus on it to see if anything strange could be identified in the anomalous zone. -There you go. -Okay. Kaleb is shining the laser straight up.</p>
<p> Can you see it? Have you got it in there now? -Yeah, that&#x27;s it. -Okay, good. Yes, we can see the green laser. Hey, Travis? What-- Yeah. Yeah, Kaleb? KALEB:</p>
<p>There&#x27;s points where it looks like the, the beam, like, disconnects from itself. What? Where you are now? KALEB: Yeah.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: What? KALEB: I-I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s just weird. Like, right there.</p>
<p>You see that? TRAVIS: Yeah, I did see that. It&#x27;s like it jumps. Yeah, right there. It did it again.</p>
<p>Ah, right there, looking like it suddenly got shorter. See, how-- looks like it&#x27;s cutting off? KALEB: Yeah, it&#x27;s like</p>
<p>there&#x27;s something there. TRAVIS: There&#x27;s something there.  When Kaleb pointed the laser  up through the triangle,  we expected it</p>
<p> to just go straight up.  But as he&#x27;s moving it around,  it looks like  it actually gets shorter,  like it&#x27;s being cut off  at a certain point  by an object or something  that we can&#x27;t see,  and it&#x27;s right there,</p>
<p> in the anomalous zone  above the triangle. Hey, guys. Y&#x27;all are not gonna believe this. Chances are we&#x27;re gonna believe</p>
<p>anything you say, Travis.  TRAVIS:  Kaleb is pointing the laser pointer up into the sky, and it&#x27;s like it hits something and it only goes a certain distance, and then</p>
<p>he moves it and it goes further. Uh, dude, did you see it bend?! Dude, did you see that?! Then the end of the laser bends. Did you see that? (laughs)  (over radio):  We&#x27;re hitting something,  and the laser beam  is literally bending.</p>
<p>What in the hell is that? -BRYANT: I can see it, like, bending. -Oh... I&#x27;m watching two beams. I am literally watching</p>
<p>two beams from right here. It makes a &quot;Y&quot; out of the beam. And then the laser  actually splits into a Y.  (over radio):</p>
<p> We can see two beams happening when it hits something up there. God, I wish I could see that from here. That&#x27;s insane, dude.  ERIK:</p>
<p> Travis. Any sense of how high up this object is?  TRAVIS:  Somewhere about 2,000 feet up. We really need to launch</p>
<p>this rocket through that. Come on. Dragon, let&#x27;s get this rocket ready. Let&#x27;s shoot it right through</p>
<p>where that is. All I could think was that maybe we finally pinpointed the anomaly above the triangle where the laser beam was splitting. So, it was definitely time</p>
<p>to fire a rocket up there and see what would happen. I want to go. Keep that laser beam up there, Kaleb.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m gonna try to point this rocket there. This is not going anything like what I would have expected. Well, I&#x27;ll tell you right now,</p>
<p>I got chills everywhere. I need to tilt it just a little. Probably right there. -All right, Kaleb. Yeah.</p>
<p>-Right there, Travis. Right there. TRAVIS: All right, that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m pointing.</p>
<p>-I&#x27;m pointing right at that. Yep. -Right there. Okay.</p>
<p>Everybody, clear back. We&#x27;ve seen a lot of weird stuff, and I&#x27;m hoping the rockets will go right through that spot and they can see if something weird happens to its trajectory through the telescopes while it&#x27;s going.</p>
<p>Five, four, three, two, one. When Kaleb pointed the laser up into the triangle,  the beam bent, split  and appeared to hit something.  -Which should be impossible.</p>
<p>-That looked like a beautiful flight. ERIK: That was straight up. So we decided</p>
<p>to quickly launch a rocket and see if we couldn&#x27;t hit whatever it was causing that. -ERIK: Oh. -THOMAS: There we go. Here.</p>
<p>ERIK: Yeah. KALEB: I&#x27;ll go grab that. All right,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tell you what, Kaleb. Just get it and just meet us back at the helipad. Dragon and I will break down... -Okay.</p>
<p>-...load everything up and head back. After our rocket launch up into the triangle, I was eager to go join the others at the helipad and see if we could get</p>
<p>a look through the telescopes at what might have caused the laser to bend and split like that. We&#x27;re gonna head back and then, uh,  just go back to basic astronomical observation. Copy that.</p>
<p>See you soon. All right, let&#x27;s do it. (cattle mooing) Uh... the cattle are acting very abnormal.</p>
<p> We&#x27;re sitting on the helipad, and the cows start to really act up.  They&#x27;re mooing a lot.  They&#x27;re making a lot of noise. (chuckles): Erik,</p>
<p>the cows have pushed in on us. Is it all of them or is it just a few? The whole herd is scattered through the entire field.  Something has definitely</p>
<p> scared them  and-and stirred them up. What the heck? They pushed all the way around the helipad. I&#x27;m getting something on the 1.6.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, so Thomas is out in the field.  TRAVIS:  We often talk about  these cows being biosensors.</p>
<p>And after what&#x27;s happened in the past with animals on this ranch, we always keep a keen eye on the cattle for any strange activity. Suddenly, they&#x27;re acting weird while we&#x27;re conducting</p>
<p>this experiment at the triangle,  and there&#x27;s also  massive equipment failures.  My first thought was,  &quot;We should be looking up.&quot; Everybody, scan the skies, scan the skies.</p>
<p>(mooing continues) Look at this one right here. I don&#x27;t know what that is. TRAVIS: What the hell is that in the sky? CHUCK:</p>
<p>To the south. TRAVIS: There it is! RICHARD: It&#x27;s moving real slow. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>Well, I&#x27;m looking at it. There&#x27;s no red or green or white lights on it. CHUCK: That thing is big and spherical.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Yes, it is. It&#x27;s got a black dot in the center of it. What in the crap? I am seeing a double peak</p>
<p>near 1.6 with some side bands. I noticed that the spectrum analyzer is giving us once again this mysterious 1.6 gigahertz signal.  The 1.6 is often seen in</p>
<p> conjunction with UAP activity. TRAVIS: There&#x27;s no red or green or white lights on it. THOMAS:</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s that far away, either.  Richard spots this object  up in the sky,  and it&#x27;s not blinking  like an aircraft.</p>
<p> It&#x27;s not like anything  I&#x27;ve ever seen before.  And it starts to track  towards the east  and then it started  to turn towards the north.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s definitely one of the more incredible sightings that I&#x27;ve seen here on Skinwalker Ranch. CHUCK: And it&#x27;s coming up</p>
<p>on Jupiter right now. TRAVIS: Yes, it is. It&#x27;s going right under Jupiter. CHUCK:</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s almost as big as Jupiter. TRAVIS: That is bright. That ain&#x27;t an airplane.</p>
<p> CHUCK:  Airplanes at night have  to have navigational lights,  red and green. And these lights will blink. And, uh, this object that I saw,  it didn&#x27;t have that deliberate</p>
<p>direction that an airplane has.  It-it seemed to be kind of  lazy and slow-moving,  taking its time.  It had no navigation lights,  no landing lights.</p>
<p> The entire object was glowing. I still see it, but it&#x27;s getting dim. It just disappeared. Wow.</p>
<p> DAVID:  It didn&#x27;t move like anything that I&#x27;ve seen before, and it-it certainly, when-when we zeroed in on it, it didn&#x27;t look like anything that I&#x27;ve seen before. And after all this, I-I&#x27;m gonna</p>
<p>have to just sit down and think -for a few minutes. -Yeah, I don&#x27;t know how to process this. Yeah. This is the kind of thing that makes us feel</p>
<p>like it&#x27;s targeted. You know. The fact that you can pick up a star anywhere, but once you go to the spot that we&#x27;re trying to observe, -it...</p>
<p>doesn&#x27;t work. -Yeah. How can something know that you are pointing that Dobsonian telescope in that direction? There&#x27;s no electronic</p>
<p>setting circles, no encoders. There&#x27;s nothing. No GP-- -There&#x27;s nothing on that. -CHUCK: Nope. You get away from the anomaly -and everything&#x27;s normal again.</p>
<p>-Wow.  TRAVIS:  We were all mentally exhausted  by whatever that was that appeared after our final rocket launch. It was the biggest UAP</p>
<p>we&#x27;ve seen so far, and it appeared to have come closer than any of the others as well. And with the cows reacting the way they did, it makes me think that we&#x27;re getting closer to answers</p>
<p>here on Skinwalker Ranch. When I first, uh, contacted you guys and I told you that there might be a weird anomaly in the sky, what-what was your thought then versus what you think now? I was really skeptical.</p>
<p>And now we&#x27;re just kind of freaked out. Oh, it&#x27;s beyond bizarre. I don&#x27;t know how to explain something like that.</p>
<p>I was hoping to see things I&#x27;d never seen before, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Until you come out here and experience this, you think it&#x27;s, like, all made-- you can&#x27;t-- It&#x27;s-it&#x27;s too crazy.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t make this up. I have no explanations for anything going on out here. All right, appreciate it, guys. This was good stuff.</p>
<p>-Crazy but good. -Crazy but good. Yes, crazy but good. ERIK: Come on in. I want</p>
<p>to get your eyes on this. Dude, I got to tell you what&#x27;s going on over at my trailer. I was sleeping pretty good, and it&#x27;s like something pounded into my trailer so hard,</p>
<p>the trailer actually moved. It wasn&#x27;t the sound itself that woke you up? -The sound woke me up. I mean, I... -(fingers snap) I, like, just stood--</p>
<p>I mean, straight up from-- &#x27;cause it was such a bang. It&#x27;s like, uh, something, like... It&#x27;s like I backed my Jeep into the-the trailer or something.</p>
<p>I mean, the trailer literally did that. What time did you say it was? It was right at 5:13 a.m. Well, you&#x27;re not gonna believe it, but that&#x27;s about</p>
<p>the same time I woke up. I had nightmares. -Really? -It was, like, chill bumps. Couldn&#x27;t go back to sleep,</p>
<p>so I&#x27;ve been looking around in the, in the sky-facing cameras, looking at-at the stars. And there&#x27;s something really interesting that I haven&#x27;t seen before -that I&#x27;d like to get your eyes on.</p>
<p>-Okay. -Um, it... -Well, I see you&#x27;re looking at Orion. -ERIK (chuckles): Yeah.</p>
<p>-Okay. -There, there. All right. -TRAVIS: Ho! -What was that? -Okay, that&#x27;s what</p>
<p>I&#x27;m trying to figure out. Yeah, look how bright-- that&#x27;s the brightest thing in the sky. So, if I go through frame by frame.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Wow. Look at-- I mean, that&#x27;s a greater magnitude than Jupiter.  The flash of light that Erik</p>
<p> captured above the ranch  on his new surveillance  camera system was not only  one of the most  incredible anomalies  that we&#x27;ve documented so far, but the time it appeared was at the exact moment in the morning when something hit my trailer.</p>
<p>What could be that bright and still just be setting in one spot in the sky? We don&#x27;t have spacecraft that can do an orbit like that. -ERIK: Mm-hmm. -Right? Where&#x27;s it coming from?  This phenomena was</p>
<p> even more intense  than the UAP we saw  just hours earlier  with the rest of the team. Could it really be connected to Erik&#x27;s nightmares or the force that shook me awake? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>But it made this night of experiments even more compelling, and is pretty convincing that when we poke this ranch, it responds. Travis, every time</p>
<p>we get something new like this, -I-I put it in front of Brandon, in front of everybody. -Oh... -We got to get everybody&#x27;s eyes on this.</p>
<p>-Yeah. (stammers) You know, we got to show Dragon and Tom. ERIK: This is a first of its kind.</p>
<p>All right, appreciate it, Erik. That&#x27;s amazing, Erik. That&#x27;s an amazing find right there. (helicopter whirring)  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Later that afternoon,  we asked Brandon  to drop everything,  come to the ranch  to see the data we collected. Welcome back. These were things that we knew he would want to see for himself</p>
<p>as soon as possible. BRANDON: Hey, guys. I understand that you have a few things to show me.</p>
<p>As always. (laughs) BRANDON: Uh, let&#x27;s dive in. TRAVIS: Uh, we invited, uh, some astronomers</p>
<p>in a, in the local Utah astronomy organization to bring some very high-tech telescopes -with camera platforms. -And these are big telescopes. We set up to launch some rockets up through the anomaly at the triangle,</p>
<p>and they would see this with these very calibrated and expensive, uh, telescopes. And something erased the information from a computer that&#x27;s not connected to any network.</p>
<p>Really? It appears that something is deliberately meddling with our systems, with the third-party experts and their systems, every time they&#x27;re brought on the damn ranch. And with all</p>
<p>the craziness going on, we caught on camera a UAP, but this is something that I saw with my own eyes, and it&#x27;s probably the most significant UAP that I have seen in my entire time on the ranch. -So, I&#x27;ve got it cued up.</p>
<p>-You&#x27;ve captured the footage? -It&#x27;s right here. -BRYANT: We have it. Great. Show me. BRANDON:</p>
<p>Wow. You have got to be kidding. THOMAS: It-it was so bright, and it looked so close.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: This is a spherical-shaped object with structure. -I-I can, I can zoom in on this if you&#x27;d like.</p>
<p>-Yeah, zoom in on it. TRAVIS: And look at-- there&#x27;s a dot in the middle of it that everybody could see with their own eyes.</p>
<p>-You see right there? -BRYANT: You see where... TRAVIS: You can definitely see that dot in the middle of it right there. If I had not seen it</p>
<p>with my own eyes, I might would be tempted to say, &quot;Okay, this is an optical phenomena in the camera lens that is out-- slightly out of focus or something.&quot; But it looked like that to your own naked eye. It was so bright,</p>
<p>it had subtense. Look at that. -THOMAS: Well, and... -That is extraordinary. THOMAS:</p>
<p>And caught on multiple cameras. I&#x27;m telling you, watching it with my eyes, standing there, not trying to hold a camera, the strange erratic movement i-is what really cemented to me that there is something extremely strange about this.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: I-I would tell you that I think there&#x27;s enough data in the video footage that-that this is more than a UAP, that this is a UFO. This is an unidentified</p>
<p>flying object. It&#x27;s not just some aerial phenomena. Wow. It continues</p>
<p>to shock me to this day that we saw, yet again, another UAP. And that&#x27;s not the only thing that happened. It gets better.</p>
<p>You know, the strangeness just continues. We have something to show you that I&#x27;ve personally never seen before. In fact, I didn&#x27;t even think something like this</p>
<p>was possible. So, this is a little complex, but, boy, is it a story. Yeah, so I&#x27;ll start from my perspective.</p>
<p>-Okay. -Uh, while I was asleep in my trailer, something immediately made me raise straight up out of bed, fight-or-flight reflex.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, as soon something-- anything like this ever happens to me, I always say, &quot;Hey, telephone, what time is it?&quot; And it tells me 5:13 a.m. ERIK:</p>
<p>At about ten minutes after 5:00 in the morning, I was asleep just outside of the main control room, and I startled awake from what you might consider a night terror. I decided I would go and, uh, look at</p>
<p>the surveillance cameras. As I was looking, something caught my eye, and it was a flash. TRAVIS: And he said, &quot;Let me show you what I saw in the cameras.&quot; ERIK:</p>
<p>I will show you the actual footage. I want to get your eyes on it. I&#x27;m going to frame-advance into this so you can see exactly what I saw.</p>
<p>BRANDON: Whoa. -Yeah, holy cow. -Oh, my gosh. It is such an intense burst that surpasses anything else</p>
<p>in the sky. -Can you play that again? -Yeah. It&#x27;s unexplainable, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s-it&#x27;s...</p>
<p>This is crazy. From everything you are saying, there is absolutely no conventional explanation for this. Uh, well, let me explain this. Uh, so, as part of the search for extraterrestrial</p>
<p>intelligence protocol, one of the first things you do if you think you&#x27;ve picked up a radio signal from the stars or an optical signal from the stars is you carefully track its motion. And we&#x27;ve got the video here</p>
<p>now tracking its motion at stellar motion. Meaning it&#x27;s following sidereal motion. That&#x27;s the motion of the stars. We cannot build a spacecraft</p>
<p>that can do that. We&#x27;ve been talking about the area over the triangle being some sort of anomaly, potentially a portal, uh, one end of a wormhole, something.</p>
<p>-What if that&#x27;s the, uh... -An interdimensional gateway. -It could be an-- Yeah. -What if-- Yeah. What if that&#x27;s</p>
<p>the other end of the wormhole?  There&#x27;s been so much lore  around the idea that a portal or a wormhole between deep space and Skinwalker Ranch is the gateway for all the strange phenomena that happens here.</p>
<p> Could this anomaly  that Erik captured  on his Skycam be evidence  that it&#x27;s true?  I don&#x27;t know, but I wonder  if we&#x27;re getting closer  to an answer. This escalates the importance</p>
<p>of what we&#x27;re doing and the need to bring in individuals that can help shine a light on this and at least pull in a more collaborative approach. Yeah, let me reach out</p>
<p>to some folks about some other instruments that might be useful. ERIK: We&#x27;ve got logistics to take care of.</p>
<p>-I think we need to get moving in that direction. -Yeah. I know you are on a schedule, so, uh, I think this is</p>
<p>a good place for us to end. -Yeah, let&#x27;s go. -Thanks. -TRAVIS: Was this compelling? -BRANDON: Yeah.</p>
<p>-(laughter) -Hell yes.  ERIK:  As mysterious events continue, I think it&#x27;s absolutely true that what we&#x27;ve discovered here  and what we&#x27;re</p>
<p> doing here ongoing could contribute to our understanding of the universe. TRAVIS: We&#x27;re seeing more strange phenomena over Skinwalker Ranch,  over the triangle,</p>
<p> and now we&#x27;re seeing  a strange flash of light  occurring over  the ranch to the south.  Are they connected?  It seems awfully likely  that they are. We&#x27;re gonna have</p>
<p>to find some answers and solve this mystery about what&#x27;s going on out here.  BRANDON:  All the adversity,  the equipment malfunctions  and the great difficulties,</p>
<p> we still captured on camera  stunning UFO activity,  with astronomers present,  witnessing it. Why are these things appearing?  What is the origin  and the agenda  associated with the phenomena that we are witnessing at Skinwalker Ranch?  I think we&#x27;ve just barely</p>
<p> scratched the surface  of exploring what secrets  the ranch holds. (wind whistling) THOMAS: If we were to come in and dig again, would we get any response? Where you dig</p>
<p>makes a difference. It died. BRYANT: We&#x27;re getting a spike in radiation.</p>
<p>There was a spike at 3,400. Everybody out of here now. Erik, are you doing something at 1.6? I&#x27;m not broadcasting. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a communication signal or something. This is out at the Carriage House. What the hell is that? You&#x27;ve captured a UAP on camera. CAPTIONING PROVIDED BY</p>
