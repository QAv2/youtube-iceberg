            <p>this is my drawing of the super fluid anti-gravity centrifuge engine which is used in all of the ATS crafted Area 51 it&#x27;s basically a hollow container sometimes they are just like a circular tub but the faster sport models use a hollow donut shape instead a Taurus the container is uh filled with a special kind of liquid it&#x27;s I know I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s exact composition because that was like out of my department but I can tell you that it was a dense viscous silvery fluid and when you looked at it it changed color from green to purple uh this green purple luminescent Optical property uh could only be seen in white light with uh like blue green Spectrum um so they had all the lights switched to sodium lamps um so that wouldn&#x27;t you couldn&#x27;t tell this um the container is uh hooked up to a refrigeration cycle uh which keeps the fluid inside super cooled below its Lambda Point um the fluid then becomes a super fluid which of course flows with zero resistance um the fluid is also a ferrofluid uh although I&#x27;m not sure if the fluid itself is ferromagnetic or whether it has ferromagnetic particles suspended in the fluid like tiny magnets or something but these are the only two really important properties of the fluid that you need to be concerned with is that that it&#x27;s a super fluid and a ferof fluid um the magnetic coiling is uh on the outside which will produce a magnetic field to propel the fluid around the inside of the container you need a magnetic fluid so you have magnets on the outside to make the fluid spin around the inside and because it&#x27;s a super fluid spinning it faster and faster it won&#x27;t ever it won&#x27;t ever slow down because the superf fluid state has effectively removed all the friction so this thing can just get sped up super fast and uh the coil itself is wound uh in the um sport models with the toal shaped container the coil is wound to a specific Vortex geometry um there&#x27;s a mathematician named Marco Roden who created an identical coiling which he calls the Rodin coil uh but it&#x27;s the same exact coiling used in the sport model crafts with a toor toy roidal or dut shaped accelerator so if you use the right-and rule to trace all the magnetic field lines generated by this coiling you&#x27;ll find that they Max at Infinity in the center of the Taurus around like the ins side the very inside and they sort of swirl around in a Vortex pattern around that Infinity Max down at the very center of the container it&#x27;s sort of a spiral within a spiral like it&#x27;s a spiral that&#x27;s spinning around the circle which um this generates an extremely powerful magnetic field and that swirls the fluid around inside at incredibly high speed about 60,000 RPMs that&#x27;s basically a th000 revolutions every second um and this creates the anti-gravity effect and that&#x27;s how it works that&#x27;s how to build it that&#x27;s all the steps need just need the refrigeration unit the magnetic coiling and a super fluid and perfectly spherical container it would help to make the container out of something really strong because the forces that are generated by this will rip the container literally apart because you need you need a really strong container the um containers that they use are made of a specialized uh aluminum alloy it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s like nothing you&#x27;ve ever seen before but I&#x27;ll have more on that in another video later I just wanted to get the plans and everything up on the anti-gravity device and and the anti-gravity centri fuge engine so that people could see how these UFOs fly what sort of propulsion system they&#x27;re using and um you know of course the only way to debunk this is to make your own and see if it works I&#x27;m sure you could find some super fluid to use that would also have ferof fluid properties but of course you&#x27;re going to need cryogenics lab and a bunch of scientists um let me know if you need any help</p>
