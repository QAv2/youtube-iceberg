Mackenzie behind the glass and Billy is in Iceland and he&#x27;s joining and he&#x27;s wearing God damn he&#x27;s wearing a suit and tie again uh Billy&#x27;s really really taking this run seriously which I love kind of but um I got I got a story I want to tell you guys uh because it&#x27;s how I woke up yesterday yeah and uh I I was scared I was terrified yesterday morning I um basically survived a home invasion so I uh I woke up at about 8:00 in the morning um I heard a noise upstairs and I sleep on the second floor there&#x27;s a rooftop uh on my house I sleep on the second floor I thought I heard something coming from upstairs and uh Blake was on the bed with me and Blake also woke up and he was like what&#x27;s going on you could tell he was like high alert and then about 30 seconds later I heard a very loud noise no mistake about it coming from my roof something&#x27;s going on in my house Blake jumped up on the bed started barking hair stands up on his back he&#x27;s a very good guard dog and uh I was I was like ready to roll it&#x27;s like what&#x27;s going on I get my phone get ready to call the police I uh I have a legally registered taser because we were give we were given tasers in New York when they sponsored either Ma I think they sponsored Macos a long time ago I it was something cuz I wanted one and I did not get one and it looks like a handgun it&#x27;s it it like if you saw me carrying it on the street because there&#x27;s a holster on there right it looks like I&#x27;ve got a handgun um and I keep my Taser nearby for such just such An Occurrence I grab the taser Blake&#x27;s running around the room freaking out um I didn&#x27;t have time to put on clothes I&#x27;m just wearing my underwear and I open up the door to my bedroom Blake Sprints out he&#x27;s like let&#x27;s go he&#x27;s like looking at me where where am I going follow me around but he&#x27;s ready to roll and I&#x27;m ready to roll I go upstairs to the roof I go outside and I&#x27;m like walking real I&#x27;m basically John Wick at this point I&#x27;m like walking around looking around corners I turn around the corner and um there was just a giant trash can that had gotten blown over on my roof and that&#x27;s what made all the noise and so then I take a second to collect myself Blake looks at me like are we cool we cool and then I realized that my rooftop is clearly visible by all my neighbors and they can just see me out there in my under wear holding what appears to be a handgun like what the [ __ ] is this guy up to well what time was this at about 8:00 in the morning oh I was thinking middle of the night no it was about 8:00 a.m. I my thought was that somebody had broken into my neighbor&#x27;s house or gone up like their back fire escape and then gone over on my roof because the houses are very close together and so I thought somebody was trying to like break in from the roof which I don&#x27;t know if like that&#x27;s even something that happens but that&#x27;s what was going through my head and then uh I realized it was a trash can and then I realized it looked like a crazy person with a gun in my underwear on my roof and so I like run back inside before somebody calls the cops on me and uh go back down to the bedroom Blake comes back down to the bedroom he gets on the bed and he&#x27;s just looking I mean he&#x27;s got like this you know dogs smilees sometimes they&#x27;re like you can tell when a dog&#x27;s happy he&#x27;s just like looking at me like yeah that was awesome we were ready we were ready to [ __ ] [ __ ] up together I was like yeah Blake now I know Blake&#x27;s a ride or die like he he will [ __ ] something up with me if he sees me freaking out now say if it it was a raccoon cuz that&#x27;s what I thought it was going to be would Blake have just like attacked the raccoon he probably would become Bros with it he probably would have just been like let&#x27;s play they have some big ass raccoons in Chicago they do maybe the size of Blake so yeah I could see them being friends yeah they could be friends there&#x27;s some big rabbits in Chicago too uh but yeah I was I was freaked out a little bit yesterday morning but it&#x27;s good to know that I&#x27;ve got a dog that&#x27;s right or die mhm like we will we will [ __ ] some stuff up together we&#x27;re the B Bros dudee I did anti-aggression training so much with Whitey that it made him a terrible guard dog oh really he&#x27;s yeah he&#x27;s terrible like notoriously bad so if anyone wants to break into Billy&#x27;s house it&#x27;s safe oh but you have a guard you have a guard Hedgehog yeah I have a guard Hedgehog yeah my hedgehog when it broke out of its cage it attacked my dog oh my God but he&#x27;s got one eye now how crazy is to wake up in the middle of the night and have your dog huddled in the corner like and like you think something&#x27;s like actually in the house that&#x27;s scary enough to put him in the corner but it&#x27;s just your hedgehog that&#x27;s like hissing at it yeah that&#x27;s uh actually if I was an intruder I&#x27;d be more scared of a hedgehog attacking me than a dog yeah or I I&#x27;ll just throw the Hedgehog at you it&#x27;s like the best missile ever yeah yeah would it like stick you it would stick you and then it would bite you and then it would just go nuts on you um sorry I&#x27;m late I I was shooting a uh uh a campaign announcement in Iceland the original Long Island we&#x27;re make it the 51st state or do we already have no yeah it would be the 51st oh wait wait a second wait a second Billy uh Mad Dog and McKenzie both have their jaws on the ground right now oh my God what what&#x27;s what&#x27;s up you have you have to share this you guys are freaking out over there sorry sorry we can cut it if we need to what so did you guys see yesterday oh my God no did you guys see yesterday that the Conor Griffin Conor Griffin went to the Olivia Rodrigo concert yeah yeah yeah okay so we are close friends with Conor we were like joking with him because he he kept saying like oh it&#x27;s for Content like I have to take Caitlyn or random person that&#x27;s what Titus and Brandon told me and then Titus came over and was like I didn&#x27;t say that you could take whoever so then we were like kind of joshing with him like oh what the [ __ ] Conor you liar blah blah blah blah blah and I had a good idea I said well all of the girls in the office that wanted to go should have done the yak Gauntlet like and whoever got the fastest time got

like totally joking with Conor and it makes sense that he brought Caitlyn because like of the whole pucking situation he was for Content or whatever and like also her brother did buy half the ticket

Festival what is that um it&#x27;s the largest music festival in East Africa but when we were there we didn&#x27;t see a single person perform um we saw one and no one really went because there was a lot of terrorist threats out for the concert so the US Embassy was like do not go to this music festival did anything happen no nothing happened but like we were there during the day and the turnout was not great I think the all the terror threat that&#x27;s scared people away yeah that sucks a shame yeah all right so probably going to go to Tim mcra I&#x27;m going to go to riotfest this year I missed out on riotfest last year I deeply regret it Slayer is playing this year pretty pumped about that um yeah I got to get back in the live music scene nothing like it nothing like a good live

know if I&#x27;m at Liberty to say okay what I will say is that I believe our first concert we&#x27;re doing a summer tour this year and I I think I can say it&#x27;s sponsored by Pink Whitney so we&#x27;ve got like a significant budget for it we&#x27;re playing I think five shows over the course of the summer all across the United States it&#x27;s going to be awesome Caroline&#x27;s gonna be joining us uh we&#x27;ve got Nick that&#x27;s going to be joining us for the entire thing too and uh we&#x27;re going to be playing a show I believe our first show is in Chicago that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say oh I&#x27;ll be there and we&#x27;re going to have everyone from the office go to it and it&#x27;s going be a lot of fun in Chicago and I gotta what I have to do is figure out some some guests that can join us on stage from the bar Store Chicago office so I don&#x27;t know if anyone can sing I don&#x27;t know if we have any other musicians here I could I could perform a few of the songs I&#x27;ve made in the past yeah I have a Stella Blue Anthem but the concert&#x27;s not sponsored by Stella Blue so I don&#x27;t know we could still work something we could change the lyrics around yeah goose in my basket check out that one that was one of my first bangers back in the day how does Stella Blue Anthem go um we can play it on the Pod if you want but it&#x27;s on YouTube search Stella Blue Anthem uh filmed the uh maybe the first music video ever filmed at Everest Base Camp oh okay what&#x27;s a man got to do for a p didn&#x27;t you kind of write it like on the spot um or you had the beat or something um no I did not have the beat I I had to find someone to make the beat after I got back from Everest but I had like the first like five or eight lines figured out so I knew what I had to film that is very impressive you can just throw a clip in the Pod yeah yeah I&#x27;m going to listen to it later I think and see if we can Lear a l is Nick is he going to be playing an instrument sorry not not Nick Tanny Nick Hamilton oh yeah and and he plays guitar right he plays guitar and he plays keyboards he&#x27;s also doing a lot of multimedia stuff for us like setting up the visuals so it&#x27;s going to be a sick concert it&#x27;s gonna be we&#x27;re putting in time to actually like produce it okay nice and so it should be a lot of fun and and Pat is still your manager yeah yeah the be the the be is helping us book all these shows GNA be in a van or an RV for a little bit of it so uh yeah be on the lookout for that it&#x27;s honestly like the pup Punk concerts are probably the most fun thing most fun live event that that I get to do at bar stool like we don&#x27;t do any part of my take live shows we do some like meet and greets sometimes which are fun and it&#x27;s good to get out with the people and and say hi to everyone and take a bunch of pictures and and just chop it up but um the pup punk shows are just like a whole new level of energy and uh everyone has a good time so if you just want to have a good time and sing along to songs that you know the words to and hear a couple Originals sprinkled in and also ran is incredible r a great front man so uh come out and see us we&#x27;ll be announcing those dates shortly I&#x27;m sure uh all right so Billy you&#x27;re you&#x27;re in Iceland still how&#x27;s the volcano I tried to go get to it this morning and um it was it&#x27;s a long story I basically in Iceland you can get away with a lot of things um just like don&#x27;t have to pay for par cuz no one really polices any of the rules um the volcano is the only thing they take seriously so all the roads were blocked uh I was like I drove like an hour and a half trying to get there to get some cool stuff um try to see some magma and stuff roads were blocked I sort of like went around a couple you know did a little off-roading um you know the the ice Atlantics they&#x27;re pretty laidback but then once I started to get closer to the volcano I like got by like two boundaries using like parking lots and you know most of Iceland&#x27;s just flat volcanic ash dirt stuff so it&#x27;s easy to drive on they caught me and they they they were pissed they were pissed they&#x27;re like how the hell did you get past here and I was like oh I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a journalist um and then they they were P so the only footage I have of the volcano is from as close as I could get I was on the same road the magma had gone over but I couldn&#x27;t see the magma because it was over a hill um and it&#x27;s a pretty bad picture you can see the the stuff coming out of it the smoke but it was a pretty cloudy day is but they take their their volcanoes pretty seriously they take nothing else seriously was there like a way that you could have just legally seeing the volcano like if you bought a tour something like it&#x27;s like a if you sign up it&#x27;s a disaster it&#x27;s erupting it&#x27;s erupting right now so people in Iceland are freaking out yeah it&#x27;s not a not right now it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s actually dangerous to be in Iceland right now and Billy&#x27;s Billy&#x27;s got boots I had no idea okay um yeah no they evacuated this fishing Village uh that I sort of got through in a back way and it was pretty weird being the only one there um but that&#x27;s when they showed up and found me have you have you thought about how cool it would be though to die in a volcano I was thinking that if I died because of a volcano everyone would laugh so damn hard and I&#x27;d be found like one of those dudes in Pompei just doing something random before he died yeah just drinking an energy drink yeah just a Red Bull I was SL I mean just drinking whatever energy drink just slamming them running towards like those Storm Chasers like be a a volcano Chaser but that&#x27;s pretty easy because they don&#x27;t move but uh it was it was pretty wild yeah like I could see the smoke coming over the horizon and uh I was like oh man we&#x27;re going to the volcano and I was like this this is a rush this is a rush this like driving into a storm but different future societies find Billy and they&#x27;re like we found this man uh it was a frog right next to him that died at the same time crazy this frog has other frog was found in his crotch yeah blunt forced trauma to the back of the Frog&#x27;s skull I think this man was he was a frog Hunter of some sort and had a had some sort of tool that he used to bludgeon the Frog to death in its throat I got to see magma once in Hawaii and it was very cool um and you&#x27;re close but at one point the rubber on the bottom of my shoes started to melt because it was like heating up the Rocks I was on then you&#x27;re like [ __ ] we got to get out of here yeah that&#x27;s a good that&#x27;s a good signal to leave there was one summer like it was really more like two or three years in a row um when I was growing up where uh disaster movies were like the big thing it was Twister yeah it was uh two volcano movies came out at the same time that was crazy it was volcano and Dante&#x27;s PE yes and I I to this day I forget which one&#x27;s which one had Tommy Lee Jones in it I think and one had Pierce broen volcano took place like in Los Angeles I think and then Dante&#x27;s Peak took place in a more like rural setting with volcano hunters or something yeah I just remember a scene in Dante&#x27;s Peak when they&#x27;re swimming in a hot spring and then the magnet the magma breaks through into the hot spring and like makes the water boil and like I think like an old woman boils to death oh Jesus I don&#x27;t know if y&#x27;all heard this or not but as you were describing movies that came out in the 9s Billy interjected and was like yeah shark NATO oh yeah shark NATO classic 90s flick I thought you were talking about that summer where shark NATO came out and then like shark NATO 2 came out like right after in piranha piranha 4D something like yeah what uh oh you know what else I figured out so volcanoes right that&#x27;s why the that&#x27;s why Iceland has the strongest men in the world I I figured it out last night the volcano I connect yeah and hear me out this is why so I tried picking up those lifting Stones um that basically all the like you had to pick up uh this 400lb lifting Stone to get onto a boat to like be a fisherman and to like go raiding we talked about this last time so they have a bunch of them they exist in England Scotland um and Iceland and what I realized when checking out some glaciers was that there were these huge Boulders in the middle of fields now if you look at all agricultural societies they have some system of field clearing right they&#x27;ll pick up rocks and put them uh into walls on the side so like even in New England like that&#x27;s how once you clear land you put all the rocks in a rock wall at the edge of your uh you know plot of land and that&#x27;s how a lot of property lines are marked right so this so this process of rock clearing um exists all across northern Europe and agricultural Nations the thing is Iceland has the biggest rocks that got moved into Fields because what moves those rocks are glaciers and the thing is because Iceland is so newly formed Med because of volcano it&#x27;s a newly formed volcanic island like geologically it&#x27;s like young as hell like is only like 20 million years old as opposed to like 100 so there&#x27;s been more glacial movement over northern Europe pushing rocks and grinding them down and making them smaller there&#x27;s only been so much glacial movement movement on Iceland so all the big rocks that the glacier pushes they haven&#x27;t been knocked around and broken up as much so they just were bigger so you just had all these dudes trying to farm with the biggest rocks and now thousands of years later they&#x27;re the strongest men in the world and win all the uh strongman competitions and it&#x27;s not even because they&#x27;re the only ones juicing the most like these guys win out of everyone who&#x27;s juicing so so it&#x27;s actually wild so you think it&#x27;s because people in Iceland had to move bigger rocks to make their fences and the people that ended up having good fences that could keep them safe were the strongest ones and they were the ones that were safe and able to procreate at a higher rate more that the ones who could move the rocks out of their fields to farm could Farm the most food clear the most land were the ones who survived and thus we&#x27;re now at the point where they can lift up the most rocks like lifting these guys have been lifting rocks heavy rocks for thousands of years like it&#x27;s was built into their agricultural lifestyle and they would then became part of their Maritime lifestyle and now they&#x27;re the strongest men in the world so it&#x27;s not just they&#x27;re using the most juice because the like uh steroids is everywhere everyone&#x27;s using steroids there&#x27;s Russian dudes on steroids there&#x27;s but they&#x27;re beating all of them they&#x27;re beating the Scottish dudes who also did Rock lifting so what was different about their Rock liting they have the biggest Boulders because they have they&#x27;re younger and haven&#x27;t been broken down as much by glacial movement that broke down all the other rocks in the other parts of the other countries I like so like you I&#x27;m like looking I&#x27;m looking at these Landscapes that I&#x27;m driving past and I&#x27;m like what like what makes this different and you just see all these gigantic rocks in fields and I&#x27;m like holy [ __ ] if they were to survive they had to move the rocks to plant their fields and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s my hypothesis wow yeah so if you just look at these photos there&#x27;s just Giant hypthesis giant rocks it&#x27;s not a bad hypothesis it&#x27;s it&#x27;s better than one that I saw from uh Joe Rogan the other week Chris Long actually sent it over to me and he was like Hey I thought you&#x27;d appreciate this video and it&#x27;s Joe Rogan um talking to some guest I forget who it was about why men have beards and women don&#x27;t and the explanation was like beards provide you u a cushion against uh being attacked by things so like if you if you go to battle and you get hit in your face if you have a beard it lessens the the intensity of the contact and the like the pressure that&#x27;s put on your jaw and so the mightiest warriors were the ones that had beards back in the day because they could absorb fiercer blows to their face and that&#x27;s why women don&#x27;t have beards is because they didn&#x27;t they didn&#x27;t have to fight in Wars so that natural selection never happened um I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s why women don&#x27;t have facial hair no I don&#x27;t think so either but now I&#x27;m trying to but now I&#x27;m trying to think like what&#x27;s the real reason cuz like pretty solid does that happen with a lot of other animals like where the male species is hairier than the female lions oh yeah Lions have a main Lions Mains I think the main is like protect their neck from Rivals trying to kill them I thought the m is more to like attract a female like a large main you&#x27;ll attract more females um the Lion&#x27;s man has often been viewed as a shield that protects a male&#x27;s neck during fights against other males but Lions mostly attack each other on the back and hips instead the size and coloration of the main serves as a signal to other lons about the male&#x27;s Fitness similar to the shiness of the peacock&#x27;s tail okay big man equals good so having having a beard makes you more attractive is the beard just a sign of online it&#x27;s just like well the male sex hormone like causes beards to grow and the female sex hormone does not but that obviously that doesn&#x27;t explain it well also I mean it has to do with like probably protecting the face from uh the elements because a lot of uh culture a lot of uh peoples that don&#x27;t grow beards are from warmer places actually that&#x27;s totally wrong uh there are tons of bearded people in the Middle East in the desert good fact check so but but could be protecting them from sand um but like what are some people who can&#x27;t grow beards well me um a people a lot of Asian cultures don&#x27;t grow a ton of facial hair um Mexicans I mean like uh the Aztecs so the local Aztecs like they didn&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair and then like these crazy bearded guys show up and they&#x27;re like wow like they had never seen anyone with a beard that big when they showed up um and then there&#x27;s the weird thing where they found ruins of people with beards from the Aztec and it&#x27;s like well who the hell were these guys before yeah I I think it probably if we&#x27;re going to go The evolutionary route it probably has to do with the fact that there&#x27;s something that could be intimidating by a guy with a big beard that isn&#x27;t as intimidating as a guy with a a shaved face I mean mustaches too because like there are some parts of the world where even still today like every male if you if you want to be a man you got to have a mustache yeah I I was actually thinking about this the other day you know how when they like in the old old days like Mongols and stuff like they would Slaughter all the boys who had uh like if they had hairy armpits that was meant that they could be soldiers and killed them like that&#x27;s what separated them from children to adults I didn&#x27;t know that I never heard that yeah I think I think it&#x27;s that um but that probably has something in relation to beard so like there could have been dudes who got invaded so many times that just anyone with good like hair growing always got slaughtered so they just all kind of had shitty beards so they just either that or if you had a good beard they were like yeah we want to absorb you into our horde and you&#x27;ll be a member of our our fighting crew and then if you don&#x27;t have a beard we&#x27;re going to kill you h i it&#x27;s an interesting thing like are humans getting Haier or less Haier I think less haer yeah so it might be the maybe having a beard is a detriment I might be on the right side of evolution you never know it would be cool to do a macro just on different hairstyles throughout throughout history and like why they became so commonplace like yeah dude the you know why men have short hair because the Caesar&#x27;s pop Caesar the Julius Caesar the Caesar haircut the Roman legion haircut was because in battle like long hair was just so easy to grab and cut your head off like they were just they realized all these like Barbarian dudes like Viking type guys in like Gaul in like Europe that Rome was invading all had this long pretty hair like the the Kelts um so they would they would grab their hair and just slit their throats it was like an easy way there&#x27;s also a different answer for that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like uh NFL players wearing like the tightest uniforms possible so you can&#x27;t get tackled yeah it also exactly o says that shorter Men&#x27;s hairstyle started with World War I and the need to eliminate lice on troops oh the military haircut and the style was emulated by Hollywood is the new Norm so like in the Civil War where all those dudes rolling around with long hair yeah dude look up uh any one of those dudes they I&#x27;m seeing everything is associated with cropped hair is associated with traditional mil military Billy if that was true then what you just said wouldn&#x27;t be true no it&#x27;s absolutely true the Caesar hairstyle okay but then you just said look up any of the dudes from the Civil War and they have long hair I know but they didn&#x27;t like a lot of them had longer hair a lot of they be true so I think that explains why in Rome all the men had short hair yeah yeah because they all had to serve in the Roman army yeah and in Braveheart everybody had long hair barbarians and then all Chinese people used to have ponytails and then I think when the Mongols took over they made it illegal to have to have a ponytail and uh went around just chopping chopping it off damn that would suck we should do an episode on on different hairstyles and faci hairstyles actually in Tajikistan it&#x27;s pretty much against the law to have a beard uh because when they took over it it was a very Muslim country and they were like we&#x27;re going to make this more of a communist country than a Muslim country so like now when you see people rocking a beard they just assume oh that means he must be really Muslim and like I guess sometimes there&#x27;s vans that will just like pull up people will hop out shave off their beard hop back in the van and take off damn just like hold you down while they chop it off damn uh geez okay don&#x27;t they also like Steal Wives that&#x27;s Turkmenistan yeah that&#x27;s actually like the accepted practice of finding a wife you have to kidnap her are you serious yeah yeah dude there&#x27;s like there&#x27;s videos in Borat that&#x27;s what he tried to do to pamel Anderson yes he snuck up on her and put her in a so yeah so I mean borat&#x27;s from Kazakhstan they don&#x27;t kidnap wives there but in Turkmenistan I think um yeah like bride kidnapping is a thing has it become like a uh like a a cute thing where a guy and a girl love each other very much they know they want to get married and she&#x27;s like oh today&#x27;s the day where he&#x27;s going to come kidnap me and they have it like pre-arranged no no there&#x27;s it&#x27;s all your buddies in a car drive by all hop out grab them I saw a video it was absolutely terrifying it&#x27;s actually kistan I believe yeah oh yeah so it&#x27;s saying right here yeah it&#x27;s bride kidnapping is practiced in kistan um and uh some sources suggest that currently at least a third of kon&#x27;s brides are taken against their will holy [ __ ] it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like in the rural populations but it is shout out Kyan uh some of my best friends where boxers are from currently reside there but also maybe chill out on the wife kidnapping I think he fights he just beats up any wife kidnappers that he sees look nice he&#x27;s like Batman sure of that yes he&#x27;s like Liam niss for the entire country yeah he is but uh yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s wild literally I saw a video where there&#x27;s just this woman walking with like her friends and then just a Toyota Tundra no uh a Toyota pickup truck with a bunch of dudes in the back they all just hop out grab her throw her in the back and drive away and then everyone&#x27;s like oh and they&#x27;re like celebrating at the same time but she&#x27;s like ah and it&#x27;s like what the hell is happening how did the how did the most confusing wedding day how did Toyota become the official truck of just like problem squadrons overseas like Warlords always are pushing a to it&#x27;s the AK-47 of trucks yeah um I mean they&#x27;re very reliable trucks very durable and like maybe Japan is more willing to like sell to whoever wants their cars maybe the US won&#x27;t sell cars to certain countries to Warlords yeah yeah Toyota should make a commercial out of that but actually I think it just be might be Toyota Tundra last so long that like the terrorist groups buy them secondhand off other people and they can still use them yeah they&#x27;re always rocking like a white Toyota I don&#x27;t know what that is it&#x27;s pretty wild like I saw this one uh picture of a landscaping truck that just had a giant machine gun in the back and Isis had somehow gotten a hold of this guy&#x27;s truck that he sold back to the dealership and he was like what the [ __ ] they didn&#x27;t take the they didn&#x27;t take the decal off the side oh wait it was just like his Landscaping Company yeah yeah oh my God probably a good Lawns Rico bosos landscape no PFT you&#x27;re right though if Toyota had balls they would run commercials being like why are no other brands durable enough to be used by terrorists yeah yeah yeah when it absolutely must start this 2002 Tundra is still rolling around Afghanistan yeah and a a 2016 Ford is broken down on the side of I75 survived three suicide bombings and it still runs like a dream y honestly they could do they could do a simly uh themed commercial where they have a guy who&#x27;s get buys his first truck and then you know he&#x27;s working and everything then one day he like sells the truck and he becomes more and more successful buying new trucks and then he goes on a trip to a foreign country uh like Safari or something or you know he goes to Turkey and then he sees his old truck and he&#x27;s like oh my God it&#x27;s La it still runs this was my truck and that would be like an endearing story about how long the trucks lasted yeah but he has to steal it back back from the terrorist organization like they&#x27;ve taken my truck and they&#x27;re making it do unspeakable things I need to rescue my truck that&#x27;s a country song right there yeah that&#x27;d be a great movie too like Le trucks Dude where&#x27;s my truck I&#x27;m I&#x27;m beat off and has to do with automobiles okay we need to figure out why there aren&#x27;t more diesel engined cars in the United States I think there&#x27;s an active big Auto maybe Big Oil cooperation to keep diesel cars you know passenger vehicles off the road because diesel engines in these Passenger cars are sick and they&#x27;re pretty awesome and I think they&#x27;re actually cheaper uh per mile I correct me on that if I&#x27;m WR I don&#x27;t know the the reason but I do know that in like the 80s and 90s we made a concerted switch to move over off diesel I remember my grandmother had a diesel car where every time we&#x27; go to the gas station we&#x27;d make sure to have to to pull into the diesel gas pump but um at some point there was like definitely a a choice that we made as a country to get off diesel I don&#x27;t know what the answer to that is though I never looked into it is it worse for the environment like burning diesel as opposed to uh burning normal gas it might be um so longterm fuel savings uh okay okay actually has to do with the market um Americans can&#x27;t do the math and grasp the concept of long-term fuel savings over instant gratification in lower initial prices okay yeah that makes sense we&#x27;re just too stupid to know the reasons why diesel is more we&#x27;re too stupid to to f yeah we want we want it now it&#x27;s like would you rather have $5 now or $500 two years from now has the IQ of America gone down I don&#x27;t think so no it&#x27;s gone I think it&#x27;s gone up up tremendously so maybe you know if you&#x27;re doing a you&#x27;re gonna do some business moves bring back diesel maybe we&#x27;re finally ready what I heard was Billy hates Americans and thinks they&#x27;re dumb yeah particularly voters I heard that to well that might be good for I was reading I was reading what it said online yeah yeah uh that&#x27;s also just a great excuse anytime somebody catches you so I would just reading the internet yeah sorry for reading the internet so Billy are you a proponent of things that cause more pollution it doesn&#x27;t cause more pollution according to whom uh diesel engines produce less CO2 pollution oh that&#x27;s right and correct and more uh nitrogen pollution correct which isn&#x27;t which is in a greenhouse gas from what I remember but anyway I believe that&#x27;s why there are fewer diesel cars is they wanted get away more questions about my belief system if you&#x27;re interested in my policy points and uh Congressional run go to Bill cfor congress.com it should be live by now I might have announced by now so if you have any questions about any of my policy points please reference that website Bill Cotter for Congress that rolls off the tongue. comom is it f or for the number Carter for congress it&#x27;s not secure it tells me Google tells me this is not a secure website I&#x27;m I&#x27;m currently attending uh just real quick diesel engines produce more nitrogen oxide pollution whereas gasoline engines produce more CO2 pollution US Agencies targeted the former more than the latter and as a result had more stringent diesel restrictions and more lenient gasoline restrictions than most European Union countries okay so now I guess we just have to figure out which is worse nitrogen or or nitrogen&#x27;s fine Billy I nit I got a question about your Excursion here in Iceland um have you stopped by the penis museum yet I there&#x27;s tons of penises everywhere and I didn&#x27;t understand why and uh that makes a lot of penes around Iceland so I I mean you&#x27;re like in the how many penises have you seen I went to they do have a penis museum and there&#x27;s a lot of penises there but I wasn&#x27;t just seeing penises around Iceland sorry if I cut you guys off I can&#x27;t see you guys so I can&#x27;t tell when you&#x27;re starting to talk um no so like at the gift shop uh there&#x27;s just uh thank you what&#x27;s up guys sorry I thought it was the camera that that is my that is my fault no no worries no worries um no so I&#x27;m just like in the gift shop right and uh they have Viking figurines they have like cool things axes and then there&#x27;s just these little penis figurines and I&#x27;m just like all right I mean so by the way there&#x27;s still people in Iceland who worship uh the Nordic gods like I think it&#x27;s like a good 14% of the population um but it&#x27;s a magical place I mean when you show up and there&#x27;s just like steam coming out of the ground and like giant walls of ice moving actively uh like you&#x27;re seeing science in real time which probably makes you believe in anything but back to the penis I thought they I was worshiping the penises I mean I what they I thought they were worshiping the penises clipped have you worshiped any penis while you&#x27;re over there strong manock no I Tred to pick manock is actually the first guy that signed the uh the Declaration of Independence for Iceland strong man [ __ ] yeah strong man coock big signature big old [ __ ] he signed it with his dick no but it&#x27;s actually wild if they were picking up 400 pound stones I tried I I couldn&#x27;t do it right hand up back to back to the penises Billy where you&#x27;ve been seeing penises you&#x27;ve been seeing penises everywhere I&#x27;m just an overpowered Irishman not a viking so I I concede there also straight up Iceland is like 40% Irish by DNA amongst locals because they straight up like took a bunch of slaves from Ireland like there you know if if we&#x27;re looking talking reparations like Iceland owns Ireland reparations we go that yeah actually the Irish were the first slaves yeah well to to Iceland dude literally they would just go when they&#x27;re coming from Norway or most were from uh Norway they&#x27;d come pick up wives and slaves in Ireland and take them to Iceland and this place is just like it&#x27;s Ireland kind of with a little more magic okay so are you going to go to the penis museum I I I&#x27;ve ran out of time to be honest I think you should go to the penis museum I think people want to hear about the penis museum all those in favor Billy going to the penis museum raise your hand one I don&#x27;t time Big T says I don&#x27;t really care what he does with his penis it was one of the highlights of of of of my trip there they have all different types of penises a bunch of whale C there&#x27;s variety I thought it was a pretty homogeneous Nation no they have animals and stuff the penises of like aund 100 different animals it&#x27;s not like a human penis museum yeah that would be oh now I&#x27;m in yeah yeah like if we&#x27;re looking at other types of penises so you&#x27;re intrigued by looking at animal penises yeah science I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s excited by it yeah dude I mean Ducks bro you hear about duck penises like literally duck sex life is just an arms race and like d have you ever seen like whales they have they look the the inspir ation for like SE uh monsters was whale penises CU they move like an extra arm like they&#x27;re preh hensil just imagine in like 3 months there&#x27;s a republican Congressional debate on local cable access and someone else is talking about Billy&#x27;s love for whale penises duck penises are wild I&#x27;m talking science they have like a duck can launch its [ __ ] and the [ __ ] is like five times longer than its body yeah and then it has a Barb at the end and it needs to like the Barb needs to latch on to the woman yeah it is the female duck it&#x27;s like a cork screw yeah if you could upgrade what feature would you add that&#x27;s not just like I would not want a barbed 20 foot penis that I could like launch at people if you were to upgrade a penis like if a penis were to have like a like wings or something wings so it could fly no no no I mean there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a a correct answer to this he was saying if you could have one animal attribute I guess are you saying one animal attribute or if you could add one feature to your [ __ ] anything I mean the answer is like that it that it vibrates that it shakes vibrating [ __ ] that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the correct answer huh what about you Billy uh I haven&#x27;t really thought about it to be honest you just asked the question I know I asked it but I didn&#x27;t think about the like my answer I just threw it out there okay elephant Cox apparently uh can&#x27;t fit in the female elephant vagina so they just uh line up and then like squirt a gallon of jids all over the vagina but they don&#x27;t actually penetrate that&#x27;s very inefficient I&#x27;m I&#x27;m reading right now um 10 animals with the largest junk to body ratio ohre you guys know a shrew what number one is a shrew is it a type of dog it&#x27;s a bad answer it&#x27;s a bad answer but it&#x27;s a barnacle oh yeah a barnacle penis is eight times longer than its body so it&#x27;s just a penis the entire animal is a penis um squids the greater hooked squid has a 1:1 penis to body ratio 26 in for each one um the Argentine Lake duck also has a one to1 penis to body ratio ducks are just swinging hammers yep uh African elephants have a 1.3 to 1.4 so almost a 1: one that&#x27;s the craziest one to me is that an elephant&#x27;s penis is almost as long as its body and then blue whales have a two to two uh two to 2.5 what but a blue whale is can be like 100 feet long so does that mean like um okay so this might be 2 to 25 this might be yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an8 Foot eight foot [ __ ] for blue whales tapers have a one to four so pretty big pretty big hog on those Hogs uh sea turtles one to five pigs one to five cattle 3 to 20 U all right well that was fun humans are pretty high compared to other primates yeah yeah gorillas have tiny dicks right yeah chimps too malard Ducks though I I think they don&#x27;t have a penis at all they just have like a patch they they have a little patch and they rub their patch on the woman&#x27;s patch that&#x27;s kind of cute yeah yeah just Donnie what do you think would have happened if we flashed the gorillas with our [ __ ] like what I they would they been intimidated by you or I don&#x27;t think they would have cared as long as we weren&#x27;t making direct eye contact they just be like all right that&#x27;s [ __ ] weird Billy do you think they would have respected you as their leader yeah cuz like gorillas aren&#x27;t used to close so if they G ran into a group of humans walking naked in the jungle that would probably be just as normal to them as humans walking around wearing clothes what if you what if you shook your junk at them would they get mad intrigued I they would immediately surrender to you they would tell their kids about the story of this one gorilla this albino gorilla that came to the Jungle one day yeah that had a a dick three times the size of theirs and they like come and try to attack you they probably try to defend their their their women her they&#x27; probably rip it off troop oh yeah they&#x27;d be so intimidated by you that that&#x27;s hilarious yeah so Billy go to the go to the penis museum I will I want a full report Oh I thought you didn&#x27;t have enough time Billy I&#x27;m I think it might be open 247 it&#x27;s probably one of those places that it&#x27;s open 247 the pis Museum I don&#x27;t know if it is penis museum is I feel I feel like who&#x27;s going Waffle House but like who&#x27;s going in at like 9:00 a.m.</p>
<p>like they definitely have hours that like are like oh look penis museum we&#x27;re drunk they probably get more drunk people late at night right I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know the answer to that but I want you to find out I want you to find out all these answers for us we&#x27;ll discuss later uh so you were announcing your campaign I&#x27;m excited about that Billy when is the announcement is coming today it might I hopefully we I gotta do some editing okay all right we&#x27;re still we&#x27;re still full steam ahead on the campaign I need to I had I have to go through I&#x27;m not seeing your website yeah your website&#x27;s not up there it&#x27;s proba it&#x27;s probably not up yet while we&#x27;re recording this did you make your own website I hope not how Hands-On were you in the development of this website look man you know uh I saw an opportunity to serve this is an easy question how the constituency I I I saw the opportunity to serve uh the con your own country and I&#x27;m taking advantage of it as much as I can and I&#x27;m getting like I will in my uh service in Congress I will get who made the website Billy to help advise me to do the best things did you have did you help design your own website yes I helped design my own website okay all right good it&#x27;s fine if you didn&#x27;t like I&#x27;m sure Trump and Biden did not make their own websites I&#x27;m we&#x27;re looking at banners and stuff okay come on okay all right yeah Billy um I have a great group of guys the the best the best of the smartest people so it&#x27;s you or the group of guys dude it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a team effort and teamwork is what I&#x27;m trying to bring to Congress something that they probably haven&#x27;t experienced in a while how diverse is your cabinet good question extremely I haven&#x27;t put it I don&#x27;t have a cabinet uh okay I meant like your campaign team that very diverse just best people some have brown hair some have light brown hair one person has black hair anyway we&#x27;re are there any Italians in your in your group I I don&#x27;t see Italians I don&#x27;t see Italians I don&#x27;t see I don&#x27;t see whether people are Italian or not because the Italians there&#x27;s a lot of Italians on Long Island Billy you might want to you know make sure that you&#x27;re representing the demographic of your Island properly it&#x27;s not my Island why do why do uh why do Italians and Irish have big rivalry if you have any questions about my canas Cy please check out Bill Cotter for congress.com I&#x27;m I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m gonna buy will Cotter for Congress and I&#x27;m G to redirect it to the guy we found the other day that Billy&#x27;s running against who like served 20 years in the special forces and has five degrees from Harvard oh my God and I&#x27;m going to redirect it to his website and I&#x27;m going to tell everybody to go to will Cotter for congress.com will Cotter question mark will he um I have a dude of the week I have a macrodosing dude of the week do you guys want to hear about him yes I don&#x27;t know how to pronounce his name but it&#x27;s jacqu Lucan I think that&#x27;s right he was a french guy and he was born in 1924 and uh he he got blinded when he was in elementary school so he was seven years old and he became blind in an accient I don&#x27;t really know how he got blinded um but so he he learned how to adapt to being blind which by the way I would I would rather be born with sight and then become blind than be born blind so you can have just like a frame of reference of the world and what people are talking about but um he he got really interested in European politics at the time uh because Hitler was rising to power and he was in France and this guy was like from a French point of view he&#x27;s like this Hitler guy seems very dangerous and so he taught himself German so that he could listen to Hitler&#x27;s speeches growing up and he became fluent in German and uh once Germany invaded France this blind guy jacqu Lucan he became one of the leaders of the French Resistance even though he was blind and so he was like going around on trains passing out leaflets that got to be terrifying to be like a leader of the resistance and trying to avoid like actual Nazi like SS agents and trying to figure out who you can talk to and who you can&#x27;t if you&#x27;re blind and he was one of the most successful leaders of the French Resistance until he was captured in uh 1943 the gapo got him and uh they he got betrayed by one of his best friends named Elio that he worked with oh [ __ ] um The Iceman and was he killed no he was put into a prison camp and he survived he was one of the only people that survived in the buin wal concentration camp um as like a prisoner of war and then later as just a uh just a I don&#x27;t think they made any distinction between like a prisoner of war and anyone else that they wanted in there so he was in there for a while he didn&#x27;t have to do any of the manual labor because he was blind and they thought that they couldn&#x27;t use him so like played up him being blind be like oh I can&#x27;t do anything I can&#x27;t help and then he eventually uh was liberated and then he moved to the United States and T taught French lit and wrote books uh for the next like 30 years until he died but shout out to jacqu Lucan dud a blind guy Mac rosing dude of the week blind guy that helped lead the French Resistance yeah sounds like a a character in like a play mhm I&#x27;m I&#x27;m shocked there&#x27;s not a movie about him yeah they you there should be so apparently when they were going around like they were boarding all these trains and they were passing out these leaflets trying to get people to join the resistance they had tear gas pens that they would keep on them in case they were ever like apprehended they could squirt tear gas on the person and try to get away uh so yeah this this guy kind of rocked I was thinking like if more Europeans had just read mine comp they would have like known exactly what Hitler was going to do cuz he laid it all out in in that book yeah he was like my goal is to like capture most of Eastern Europe so Germans have more living space I want to kill all the Jews MH and like I can&#x27;t attack Eastern Europe before I neutralize France and England like he laid it all out but he still let that&#x27;s one of those books that you kind of can&#x27;t read you got to get the Kindle you got to get the Kindle version of it you can&#x27;t have it like on your book shelf or like carrying it with you on the subway yes like there&#x27;s probably some stuff that would be important to read in there to just for a further understanding the context of History like it&#x27;s a primary source and so you a lot of historians have to read it but you got to be very very very judicious about where you read that book yes like Billy if I saw you reading that book that I would be like nope that&#x27;s that&#x27;s an issue I I yeah that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve never read that book I I have not read the the whole book I&#x27;ve read the spark notes version that&#x27;s a big ask to ask all of Europe to read that book well no but that was yeah just the thing that I think like after Hitler like came to power and they were like who is this guy maybe they should have had their intelligence like read the book and be like oh [ __ ] this guy&#x27;s trouble well I mean the thing is what people don&#x27;t talk about we France loves to talk about the French Resistance but they don&#x27;t talk about the French like Embrace sing of the Germans who came in oh literally France yeah yeah vich France and like the guy who is a World War I war hero just being like yo these guys are dope like their their their ideas are awesome who like there was a lot of very sympathetic I think the majority of France was just kind of like yeah fine I don&#x27;t know if it was the majority or not but their their leader yeah he was a a World War II or world World War I hero and he like he led France in some of the biggest battles of all time and he was known as being like a national icon and then he ended up volunteering himself to be the president of France during German occupation and he was just like kissing the Germans ass and being like yeah I&#x27;ll do whatever you say Hitler no problem no problem and then after France was liberated they they caught the guy and they killed him yeah and I think maybe for a lot of the French it was just like they just didn&#x27;t want to be in battle again they&#x27;re like because like France was so scarred from World War I they&#x27;re like oh [ __ ] well we&#x27;ve already been overan we can just like try to fight it out but it&#x27;s just like I think they were just so Shell Shocked from World War I still they were like no we don&#x27;t want to repeat of this we&#x27;re just going to surrender yeah um I mean we were kind of that way for a long time too in World War II well that it&#x27;s not that we were Shell Shocked it was just like this is a European problem like why get involved like we didn&#x27;t even want to get involved in World War I and then like we finally came in at the very end yeah we were we&#x27;re giving a bunch of arms and and money to the British to help them fight the Nazis yeah and we&#x27;re just trying to stay out of it I think FDR even promised like it&#x27;s not our problem we&#x27;re going to stay out of it as much as we can but we&#x27;re going to support our allies and then then Pearl Harbor happens I highly recommend reading the book The Gathering storm which Churchill wrote after World War II and it&#x27;s all about the like how they got from World War I to World War II and the whole time as like Germany starts secretly rearming like Churchill&#x27;s trying to warn the British like hey we like we need to start to rearm too because like Germany&#x27;s actually building up their armed forces and stuff and no one will really listen to them like France and England were just dead set on peace and they were like no we need to dearm that&#x27;s the solution to like continued peace if we just like get rid of our arms like stop building airplanes and for like 10 years Churchill&#x27;s like I&#x27;m telling you guys in like five years this going to be a huge problem and then like he keeps on telling them again and again as Germany like makes moves like they first um what was their first move oh they moved back into the Ryland and then Czechoslovakia sudetenland and he&#x27;s like we need to stop them now because if we let this go on for another six years then at that point Germany&#x27;s already like they&#x27;re going to be rearmed and they&#x27;ll be a lot harder to fight yeah that&#x27;s when Chamberlain did the he the appeasement that was his strategy like just appease Hitler and he&#x27;ll stop yeah and then Hitler invades Poland and now it&#x27;s like okay well it&#x27;s on yeah so like the whole book is just Churchill calling a shot he&#x27;s like if we don&#x27;t do this now in 1935 then in 1941 we&#x27;re gonna have a huge war in our hands and like that&#x27;s exactly what happened yeah I mean when Russia moved into Crimea same Vibes yeah and now look where now they went into all of Ukraine y I mean we&#x27;re I scary to think about yeah and we got 25 years of Putin just got re-ups off of uh like like what&#x27;s the point of studying history if we&#x27;re not applying it to the world around us so you&#x27;re advocating for as a in your role in Congress you&#x27;re advocating for sending troops into Ukraine to stop the next Hitler no no just just got to recognize patterns patterns are important in what way um I mean who knows malova is maybe next so we should stop him is what you&#x27;re saying well Cat&#x27;s out of the bag um just go to Billy&#x27;s Website is Ryan is Ryan rillo is Ryan Russillo Icelandic I don&#x27;t know I think he&#x27;s probably Italian I know he&#x27;s Italian but the way he spells Ryan is weird and probably Icelandic you want me to ask him he just texted me yo you need Iceland tips and I was like oh ask him if he&#x27;s this guy ask him if he&#x27;s Icelandic yeah that could be why he benches so high I love that Billy&#x27;s just G to apply this knowledge to like everyone that he knows are you part of Icelandic you&#x27;re pretty strong uh all right I&#x27;m not strong anything else you want to jump into before we start talking about the uh suppression of free energy conspiracy Big T you teed off about anything this one goes deep uh no just Bly telling me I was wrong when I wasn&#x27;t I&#x27;ve been watching the the octopus conspiracy on Netflix which we&#x27;ll discuss next week wild story so I will Adit Big T was not wrong thank you okay progress have you tried any whale meat while in Iceland no but I did get some rain deer meat kind that&#x27;s not as cool how was it I know still just a hoofed creature yeah was it good it was was it rinder the fish here is the fish here is amaz it&#x27;s this place is pretty awesome oh have you seen any any puffins I no I tried some Puffin meat when I was there really yeah I got to eat puffing whale and then fermented shark which is that really gross [ __ ] have you oh yeah yeah I think like vibs brought some into the office once yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s similar to like ludifisk yes where they bury it underground or something and they let it rot for a while yep it&#x27;s basically a test to see if you can if you can eat it yeah just rotten shark that was the most disgusting thing I think vibs ever did to us that and the spicy gummy bear spicy gummy bear [ __ ] me up for about a full day afterwards did you have like spicy diarrhea uh no my I it wasn&#x27;t spicy diarrhea I just felt like I had to poop for about 24 hours couldn&#x27;t poop and then my stomach was hurting it [ __ ] up vibs dude those spicy challenges because it&#x27;s not over after the spice is gone no it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s like sweating overnight oh man yeah but Billy I need you to see a puffin Puffin I it might be one of my favorite Birds I saw a puffin a stuffed puff and they&#x27;re selling them here it&#x27;s a you can&#x27;t bring them back to the States though because of sites like a a stuffed actual Puffin do you want me to buy a stuffed Puffin for you I don&#x27;t know if I can get back to the country no I just want you to see a I want you to see a bird yeah okay go see that bird for me tell that I say hi at what age do people get get into bird watching or birding excuse me they call it birding it&#x27;s snuck up on me I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not quite there yet uh I know my mom has gone on a couple birding trips um I mean I don&#x27;t like I do enjoy seeing Birds but I&#x27;m never going to like plan out a day being like hey we can go to this park and go birding for these types of birds and then you see and then you just like check it off the list like saw that bird yeah maybe take a picture um it sounds like golf trips just for people that are into into like nature more where it&#x27;s like okay we&#x27;re going to plan a vacation we&#x27;re going to go see this bird today and then tomorrow we&#x27;re going to see this bird I mean I night yeah talk about the birds that we saw the birds we almost saw have you have you seen a real raven I have I don&#x27;t know maybe have we only been seeing fake ones yeah I&#x27;ve seen Ravens but now now I&#x27;m questioning that no dude these the Ravens here are huge huge Ravens the birds are pretty interesting because Iceland didn&#x27;t have uh Iceland only had one type of mammal living on it uh the arctic fox until humans arrived so the birds have just been running rampant here and there&#x27;s some pretty cool looking birds I love Ravens but the Ravens are huge they look like bigger than crows I want to I really want to get like a murder of crows to accept me as like one of their friends I&#x27;ve watched some videos feeding them yeah I&#x27;ve watched some videos on YouTube about how to how to get involved in a murder um sounds bad when you phrase it that way but like how to have a murder accept you and uh you got to start feeding them at like the same time every day but you can&#x27;t like directly approach them and eventually they&#x27;ll learn to trust you and crows are like sneaky one of the most intelligent animals on planet Earth like they&#x27;re really smart they have you know that crows have funerals wow yeah I did not know that they They Mourn if a member of their their murder dies and they&#x27;ll mourn for like a period of days or weeks and they have like rituals that they do they seem like the funeral Birds they yeah that fits them very somber yeah and they uh they will adopt you and they&#x27;ll protect you too and they&#x27;ll protect your things if you become like a friend of theirs so they&#x27;ll like fight off other species if they start to encroach on your territory I want to become a friend of the birds yeah right here it says crows and ravens number six in world&#x27;s smartest animals one uh guy like was posting about how he was he basically trained crows or Ravens I forgot which it was to bring him money and he was feeding them and they were like giving him money somehow he trained it might have been a fake story but I kind of see how it could happen well they could easily yeah they could go out and find coins and if someone left a dollar bill they might be able to swoop in and just like while someone&#x27;s paying come down and grab a few notes now could you be charged for theft yeah I think if you like encourage and train a a raven to steal cash from other people I think you probably be charged of that but what if you didn&#x27;t know how he was stealing it and he was giving you money you thought the crow was just paying you for Commerce you thought the crow had a job yeah that could be your defense yeah how how could you train a bird to give you money without like knowing that it was just going to take money from somewhere though I don&#x27;t know you could just train him to like pick up money around the house or around your property and then be like oh if crows were really smart then they could frame humans and they could just start getting they frame cats what they frame cats a crow will pick a fight will make two cats fight just by pretending the other cat&#x27;s attacking them and they&#x27;ll watch and they&#x27;ll cackle while they fight they they like stage fights and then they watch them just like we would watch a boxing match yeah but it&#x27;s more like when you pit two people against each other by like saying they did something like oh he&#x27;s you heard what he said about his M your mom and then they like start fighting and then you watch him yeah shout out shout out crows anything else we want to get into before free energy conspiracy Big T you teed off about anything oh no Donnie anything else I think I&#x27;m good for now anything on your mind all right um yeah all right any Tennessee minute updates I guess we can&#x27;t really do a Tennessee minute update until the game they they&#x27;ve practiced I believe yeah what is the practice situation with teams at the NCAA tourn like do they are they given access to the gym that they&#x27;re going to be playing in but it&#x27;s only like a certain amount of time yeah I think like the day before each team gets an hour or something they have to share the facilities with all the other teams that are there yeah yeah and then I&#x27;m sure they all go to like a local college or something to have other practice too yeah um I I don&#x27;t know if I want to say this on the Pod I&#x27;ll allude to it uh Rico may have helped me helped JMU with a gym Brooklyn love that so Rico came to me after he found out like when the team&#x27;s going to be practicing or when the team&#x27;s going to be playing and Rico pulls me aside and he&#x27;s like hey just so you know I got a great gym I got two great gyms it&#x27;s fantastic and uh and obviously that&#x27;s not his gym my initial Rea well his guy&#x27;s gym and no it&#x27;s Dana&#x27;s gym who Dana are you are we talking about the same gym yeah I that&#x27;s where we practiced for is it the gym where like opposing team teams that are playing the Knicks or the Nets where they practice Yeah okay well yeah well Rico said he had access to this thing and nor taking responsibility for Dana&#x27;s I don&#x27;t know but normally when Rico tells me something like that my my response will be to like smile nod politely thank you Rico but then he was like no I know that like sometimes I I [ __ ] you but like I&#x27;m dead serious about this and I was like okay and so I I ended up putting Rico in touch with like jmu&#x27;s director of basketball operations and I think they&#x27;re going to use Rico&#x27;s hookup oh practice the the doo that&#x27;s Rico&#x27;s favorite thing to say the doo yeah director of basketball operations yeah I don&#x27;t I can&#x27;t keep track I talked to the doo yesterday I can&#x27;t keep track of his [ __ ] acronyms um so re Rico&#x27;s passed off Dana&#x27;s guy is his guy that&#x27;s so funny well then big cat tried to claim that it was his guy that Rico was passing off it is it is his guy it&#x27;s Dana and big cat&#x27;s Scott okay well yeah at any rate I&#x27;ll take it one thing is very helpful of though but yeah that&#x27;s Rico he he did me a Sol thought he was more of an app stake guy or Marshall uh both actually Marshall Marshall mostly uh he does not respect Jamie basketball or football but that&#x27;s another story one uh small thing to add I know you guys talked about Haiti on the Pod maybe last week or something I guess Kenya is is they&#x27;re going to send in like a 1,000 person strong peacekeeping force really yeah like I&#x27;m not sure how that fell on Kenya but they&#x27;re I think they volunteered they&#x27;re like we can help and like they&#x27;re sending in like a thousand soldiers to to try to like keep the peace and control The Gangs wow yeah I don&#x27;t know how like how that would be beneficial for Kenya or if they&#x27;re just trying to help I I think they&#x27;re just trying to take more of like you know how the US has taken a role as where like the world&#x27;s Peacekeeper and stuff and we like to get involved because it helps like it also helps just expand us power I think they&#x27;re like okay we&#x27;re we&#x27;re like our country is stable enough now we want to exert some of our power and influence around the world interesting I&#x27;m going I&#x27;m going to a a Haitian wedding on Friday and so I&#x27;ve promised the guys that I&#x27;m going to come back with some facts about how they feel about the Clinton Foundation okay it&#x27;s hopefully not in Haiti right it&#x27;s not in Haiti okay no it&#x27;s in Brooklyn okay cool yeah um so that&#x27;s interesting because uh like you know Thailand everyone knows Thai food right yeah and uh Thailand&#x27;s government back in I want to say like the 60s or 70s they gave money to people to move to different parts of the world and start Thai restaurants to introduce people to Thai flavors and Thai style cooking as an effort to like expand their soft power across the world where now it&#x27;s like we think of Thailand most people in the United States are at least at least somewhat familiar with Thai food people like Thai food and so there&#x27;s like a favorable impression of Thailand in people&#x27;s brains whereas if you were to say like what do you think about La a lot of people are like I don&#x27;t really know that much about La so Pad Thai is a government op it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a thae government scop yeah interesting yeah stay woke Haitian food&#x27;s really good it is so good it&#x27;s got a little janess say p should to say pis where have you guys ever tried Asian food uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like Creole food oh yeah yeah yep so like Louisiana their their food is like a mix of French Southern and Creo yeah which makes it so good that makes sense and then Mexican food is um Aztec Spanish Fusion yeah if you think about it and you know what&#x27;s crazy about Spanish it&#x27;s like toas it&#x27;s kind it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s kind of like North African European Fusion which crazy to think about yeah it&#x27;s a funish it&#x27;s a fusion within itself if if you have to buy stock in one food I would say buy your stock in shakshuka I was I was just talking to TJ about this on the mostly Sports after show shakshuka the sky&#x27;s the limit for shakshuka here in the United States like once once the girls at brunch figure out about shakshuka it&#x27;s over it&#x27;s like poached eggs in uh in a tomato garlic onion sauce yes it is it is an elite breakfast food I&#x27;ve had it before do you like it not yeah but I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not a huge fan I don&#x27;t like need a bunch of tomato sauce for breakfast yeah yeah I think it&#x27;s just bad for heartburn but it it is very tasty though it&#x27;s extremely tasty but I agree with you like tomato sauce early in the morning yeah could be tough i&#x27; I&#x27;d invest in South African food nandos okay so I think there&#x27;s some in Chicago check it out they do it it&#x27;s very good um Nando yeah Perry Perry yes Perry Perry is that where the first nand was is that in South Africa it was really hilarious my friend had all these co-workers from the UK um coming to Chicago and he was like where should I take him out to eat and I was like you got to take him to Nando it&#x27;s like a great spot but like and he had no idea that it&#x27;s like a fast food chain in the UK so he went up to them and he was like you guys want to go to Nando crazy off the beaten path D experience yeah he thought it was some like unique Place in Chicago you could show them I love that and I also love their uh their version of jerky is so good Bill Tong oh yeah Bill Ton&#x27;s great if you guys were to buy stock in one food that hasn&#x27;t blown up yet in the United States what would it be Big T blown I don&#x27;t know like what hasn&#x27;t blown up here there&#x27;s a lot of stuff well have you been overseas yeah yeah went to London last summer oh that&#x27;s right yeah forget about that that was your big European experience was there anything over there that you were like you know what I could get used to this I&#x27;m not really it wasn&#x27;t that different yeah um I don&#x27;t know I feel like if you&#x27;ve heard about it then it&#x27;s by definition blown up to some extent yeah I&#x27;m not in the weeds like you with the shakshuka shakshuka yeah you got to you got to try shakshuka you like it I kind of just think like you know how there was a crazy cupcake craze and like I feel like on every block there was a spot with like 40 different types of cupcakes frozen yogurt too I like I want to try to launch a spot for like 20 different types of rangoons oh I like that yeah but it&#x27;d be a similar layout to a cupcake shop but it would just be rangoons would you have like a different toppings on the rangoons um some could be I think it&#x27;d be more just about what filling was inside them so you could have like a carbonara rangon um a spicy barbecue chicken rangon but then like and then a couple sweet dessert ones too you&#x27;re going to want to put you&#x27;re going to want to put like some sort of either topping or or dressing or uh like uh spice on the outside of them so they look different dipping sauce yeah so they look because you want to walk through that like a line and you&#x27;re looking in into the like the glass uh display case yes and you&#x27;re like oh that one right there that&#x27;s the um that&#x27;s the Carbonaro one because it&#x27;s got shaped parmesan on top of it that&#x27;s thing you could do that and then you can also use different color wanton wrappers because you can make like a a green wanton wrapper for like the spinach and archo grandon it&#x27;s all about making it good to take pictures of and post on Instagram doesn&#x27;t really matter how it tastes you can have a mystery box oh mystery goon a mystery Boons rang goons are similar to a cupcake like obviously you don&#x27;t want to just have rangoons as a meal like um but I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s they&#x27;re very rich they&#x27;re very they&#x27;re very tasty but like you know you probably only need to have like four of them even though I could sit down and eat 12 You&#x27; probably be good if you just have like you just buy a little box of four really good rangoons yeah rangoons to go goons to go I like that all right uh Mad Dog McKenzie you have any foods that you&#x27;re buying stock in underrated Foods that you love that you think will blow up I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m very basic when it comes to that sort of stuff so I wouldn&#x27;t even know something that hasn&#x27;t blown up yet um I&#x27;m trying to think oh I know I know one that you would approve of what perogi oh oh yeah I I also didn&#x27;t know that progis weren&#x27;t a thing everywhere until I moved out of Ohio yeah that was news for me wait this is what I was talking about today when I was getting lunch McKenzie do you guys know what munchos are nope nope no oh didn&#x27;t the best potato chip you will ever had look up what a muncho looks like they&#x27;re like porous potato chips they are so salty so crispy like melt in your mouth I take it back I have seen these on some occasion they are so good they are actually probably the worst thing you could probably like eat but it&#x27;s crispy salty crunchy potato chips I mean you&#x27;re describing a potato chip no but like extra to the nth degree and I could in college I would have munchos as like a hangover snack sometimes and I would just get like a family-sized bag and absolutely demolish the whole bag it was they are so good they&#x27;ve got a problem the problem is with their marketing what because I&#x27;ve seen this bag before right and the Bing the bag looks like something they would give you with a dried turkey sandwich in prison mhm it looks like they look like prison chips on or they look like a knockoff of like a different brand yeah it&#x27;s a bad bag they need a better bag do you know about the prison chips no so there&#x27;s a brand of chips and I forget the name but it&#x27;s supposed to be like it&#x27;s like every flavor in one and people who have been to prison like say it&#x27;s the best [ __ ] ever and like you can they try to get them like when they leave are you talking about all dressed the whole shebang no yes too yeah it&#x27;s that large the office and people who have been to jail swear they&#x27;re incredible wow that&#x27;s wild that they make something only for jail the I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s like a wholesale thing no check out the whole shebang is a brand of season snacks made by the Keef group a company that specializes in serving the prison population interesting the whole shebang has garnered a cult following among former inmates as well as those who have never been incarcerated due to positive word of leading the company to sell them to the general public I&#x27;m going to order some right now the flavor is often described as a hybrid between salt and vinegar and barbecue sold in MO um sold in more mainstream retail channels known in Canada as all dress oh it is all dressed so I I think it might be America&#x27;s version of Canada is all dressed yeah they also eat ketchup chips in Canada ketchup flavored chips uh but yeah all dress is pretty good oh Al dressed is a type like multiple uh Canadian places make Al dress it&#x27;s like a type of potato chip it&#x27;s not a brand um matteline these munchos is regular potato chips the only flavor they have I&#x27;ve never seen a muncho that was not okay that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;ve never seen a a variety of muncho besides they are so good I think they&#x27;re one of my favorite potato chips and I we got lunch catered today and they had potato chips and I was like oh these kind of remind me of munchos and everyone looked at me like I had three heads but oh they&#x27;re so good they&#x27;re just so light and salty and they make my lips chapped because there&#x27;s so much salt on them but that&#x27;s what I would like to bring to the mainstream oh and PF one more MH pelmenis what&#x27;s that oh pelmenis are great the one I told you about the little things that I Russian dumplings oh yep yep oh yeah those are so good I love I love also perogi type food yeah yep perogies are or Elite pelmeni is delicious and I highly recommend and dipping it in sour cream clemer won&#x27;t eat any food that&#x27;s uh he won&#x27;t eat any sort of stuffed food huh cuz he likes only be like being able to see what he&#x27;s eating he doesn&#x27;t like that like whatever&#x27;s inside is hidden so he won&#x27;t eat food that&#x27;s inside of another type of food he doesn&#x27;t stuff crust NOP what about tradu Secrets he doesn&#x27;t like Secrets he&#x27;s an honest man but like that is hands down my favorite type of food ravioli dumplings rangoons barrois empanadas as long as you know explicitly what&#x27;s in it right who cares burritos does he not eat burritos I don&#x27;t think he likes burritos burritos are more of an open book yeah modsticks some of the best foods are stuffed yeah now stuffed Donuts I won&#x27;t go near I won&#x27;t touch what like Boston no a donut has to have a hole in it when you start filling donuts with [ __ ] no thank you you don&#x27;t like any stuffed Donuts no not even like the uh the light Airy cream no I don&#x27;t want any cream in the donut raspberry jelly I always [ __ ] up it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s been a lifelong battle I&#x27;ve been fighting where when I get like a cream filled doughnut I always get the wrong type of doughnut I always get like the custard filling and never want the custard exactly secret I want the the what&#x27;s in here find out I want the white fluffy Creamy Feeling filling I don&#x27;t want the the yellowish heavy [ __ ] can somebody please tell me what the difference between those donuts is so I don&#x27;t make the same mistake again Boston cream is always going to be the yellow that&#x27;s the Boston cream yeah Boston cream is always the yellow stuff um should we move on to the conspiracy yeah let&#x27;s talk about it I&#x27;ve got four bags of munchos on the way nice love it love it that was quick okay the free energy suppression conspiracy theory I&#x27;m excited about this have you ever seen the movie chain reaction with Keana Reeves never heard of it okay so it&#x27;s about a scientist that discovers a way to turn water into pure energy and then the powers that be come after him at one point I think there&#x27;s a nuclear explosion that he outruns on a bike or a motorcycle love that yeah pretty cool pretty cool movie um so uh also Al shout out to Mike who&#x27;s done a great job of doing our research for the last uh what like two months three months if you&#x27;ve noticed us being more organized on the topics it&#x27;s all due to Mike who&#x27;s been fantastic um so according to the free energy suppression conspiracy uh viable alternative free energy sources that are environmentally friendly and cheap they&#x27;re suppressed by governments corporations and other powerful groups why would you do that uh well if you&#x27;re making a lot of money off selling oil if you&#x27;re making a lot of money off selling other types of energy you don&#x27;t want the people to have as much energy as they can for free so um there&#x27;s an economic status quo and fuel prices have only really gone up when was the last time gas prices went down like if you look at it year not necessarily like month by month because there&#x27;s fluctuations all the time and that those usually occur in election years for some reason the pandemic remember when they were paying people to take oil oh yeah yeah also Energy prices go up sometimes so that you can afford to fire your head football coach if you&#x27;re Texas A&amp;M University and you&#x27;re an Aggie and you just own a bunch of land that has that has oil on it and so if the price of oil per barrel goes up then you&#x27;re you&#x27;re able to afford a $90 million buyout and also uh have a suspicious deal with Qatar yeah so go on about that Big T I don&#x27;t remember all the specifics that story went away suspiciously quickly as well but they have a like a real deal like partnership with uh I like the government of Qatar I think so this blog he is as gracious as he is benevolent yep uh yeah so they&#x27;ve got like a a real thing going on I I don&#x27;t know all the specifics but it was a thing around the time Jimbo got fired yeah so the the uh theory that I had was that if oil I I said a price Target that oil has to hit like $90 a barrel for them to be able to afford Jimbo Fishers buyout and I think it got up to about 95 and then di back down I think when they ended up firing him it was like 70 bucks a barrel um but that like a bunch of people in East Texas just own a fuckload of land with a fuckload of oil on it and so they get so rich just when the price of oil goes up that they&#x27;re able they don&#x27;t have anything else to spend their money on so like we might as well I don&#x27;t like our football program let&#x27;s fire our coach that&#x27;s so that&#x27;s an awesome thing to have it&#x27;s just like no you have so much money that you just declare yourself to king of a football program it&#x27;s pretty awesome it is pretty cool so for thear Stuff uh this is uh Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s press release several websites and social media sources recently have published inaccuracies and erroneous assumptions about Texas ANM University and its Branch campus in guitar with the speed of which misinformation can travel today it&#x27;s important that you have access to Accurate uh information so basically uh they opened a campus in 2003 inq uh has been investing in Texas A&amp;M I I I mean giving I guess uh and they were concerned about uh qatar&#x27;s access to Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s nuclear reactor and any nuclear secrets that are uh researched at the A&amp;M Campus um but wasn&#x27;t that right around the time they needed the money to hire new coach but that would that&#x27; be what November October of this year well it was before okay so this this happened January 7th 2024 was when it came out okay so yeah I did I missed that one I&#x27;m gonna have to look into it uh they have a campus in Qatar yeah does since 2003 interesting I&#x27;m trying to find the Tweet about it and I can&#x27;t find it cuz I&#x27;m sure like once Qatar found all the oil in their country they were like we need to bring in some people from Texas is just like teach us how to extract it teach us how to be oil guys yeah teach us how to just like own it and take advantage of it yeah yeah qar has they&#x27;ve got that natural gas field that&#x27;s out in like the Persian Gulf yeah they own it I forget what percentage of the global amount of natural gas they own but they own this one part that they just they&#x27;re like this is ours this is how we make money now oh hey literally the other day uh A&amp;M is shutting down their qari campus oh no yeah what happened I don&#x27;t know the uh former president of the University says the Qatar decision needs more transparency and that the partnership was successful in every respect every respect except for the fact that they had to shut it down right uh yeah I&#x27;d say that it probably needs a level of transparency that is not possible when you&#x27;re dealing with the qari government I&#x27;m going to find the thing that was uh y&#x27;all y&#x27;all just go but I&#x27;m going to find the other thing I was talking about okay I think is it University of Utah that also has a nuclear reactor kind of wild kind of well that college campuses have yeah Power oh and remember that one woman was like someone threatened to to do something to nuclear reactor in Utah I think they lost the football game and and this drunk lady threatened to blow it up yeah yeah which respect I respect that there are currently 35 operating University Research reactors on 33 sites in 24 States that&#x27;s wild including Rhode Island nuclear Science Center Texas A&amp;M uh UC Davis um Ohio State uh Penn State Purdue there&#x27;s a lot what&#x27;s the one campus you really doesn&#x27;t have a nuclear reactor I for me University of Florida&#x27;s on here that&#x27;s oh that&#x27;s dangerous oh no that&#x27;s very D yeah we&#x27;re [ __ ] missou uh Penn State would be up there on that list pen state is on this list yeah state would be yeah NC State but how big are these because a a Boy Scout once made a nuclear reactor in his backyard they are different types of reactors like there are several different types of reactors that they have like one has an AGN a triga plate fuel critical facility I&#x27;m surprised does Tennessee have one no that&#x27;s that&#x27;s shocking to me it being in Knoxville like home of the uh the Oak Ridge yeah I guess I guess we have a facility close enough that UT doesn&#x27;t need one yeah you just have access to it probably I&#x27;m sure they do yeah yeah Tennessee would that would scare me too if like what if you guys had like a nuclear bomb like almost all the big 10 schools do probably for the best yeah cuz the Big 10 people won&#x27;t they won&#x27;t use it blow up the world if you know they go eight and four yeah or if there&#x27;s like an nil investigation like I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked to see Tennessee deploying that nuclear device to uh the head of the NCAA well you know the NCAA is uh no longer pursuing that after they got brought to their knees in federal court right I love that good for you yeah good for you you fought the law and you won they [ __ ] with the wrong ones um so there&#x27;s uh there are people that truly believe that free energy is being suppressed and some examples of free energy would be I guess solar although it&#x27;s not like 100% free you still have to install the panels um you still have to make the panels you have to make the panels it&#x27;s very expensive um water Hydro El electricity and uh I guess you can look at that in a couple different ways using water to power windmills and things like that or turbines or uh just being able to pour water into a gas tank and have that work um so MythBusters examined it and uh all the all the attempts failed so a TV show looked into it and they said no it can&#x27;t be done U there&#x27;s also something called a perpetual motion machine have you guys heard about those yeah hardest part&#x27;s hiding the motor that&#x27;s good you&#x27;ve never heard that no I haven&#x27;t heard that the hardest part of Perpetual motions hiding the motor there are people that drive themselves insane like that dedicate their entire lives trying to invent a perpetual motion machine and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re always so close but they can never figure it out I wonder why I wonder why um but yeah people I feel like it&#x27;s something that people don&#x27;t really do anymore but it was real big back in like the early 1900s mid 1900s uh so there&#x27;s geotherm geothermal energy production um and on MythBusters they said well the government hasn&#x27;t arrested anybody for researching solar cells windmills or geothermal U and they haven&#x27;t closed down research centers that are investigating such topics so the motives that free energy suppression conspiracy theorists ascribe to energy companies are flawed and misunderstand Market logic while some claim that is perfectly possible to produce a machine that that would provide the world with free energy except governments and corporations deny funding for the necessary research the conclusion flies in the face of observable developments you can look at the progression of solar power see that the energy business rather than trying to destroy any promising new technology will instead seek to own it and profit from it which I I would agree with that like all the biggest investors in solar technology um windmills things like that they tend to be the big fossil fuel companies that are like hey the the winds are blowing in this direction I would rather us not go out of business instead let&#x27;s try to Corner the market and make money off it yeah so it&#x27;s like if you have a shitload of money and you&#x27;re in the energy business you can then just bully your way into owning the next new wave of energy it is kind of CRA yeah with the cigarette companies they&#x27;re doing the same thing yeah oh with uh New Alternatives like Lucy and marijuana uh yeah like like uh the new dip stuff like Altria owns a ton of stock of some of those companies yeah and I mean if we ever crack the code on Fusion Energy like obviously that has the potential to be like extremely cheap Limitless energy but they&#x27;ll still the government will still control it and charge it just because of like all the money we&#x27;ve spent on researching it over the past 20 years yeah they own like all the all the patents for anything that you would use to extract the free energy yeah um because they have to make back the energy that like the amount of money that&#x27;s been invested in Fusion research which like there&#x27;s there&#x27;s like I&#x27;ll see a news article once a year where there&#x27;s like huge breakthrough with Fusion but in the Articles it&#x27;s still like well we&#x27;re still like decades away from being able to make this feasible mhm but that would be wild because apparently realistically we need a ton more nuclear reactors to if we dealing with the waste is gonna suck at one point but if we really want to go carbon neutral sorry for the way say new nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nulear yeah I mean nulear France has France gets 70% of their power from nuclear or at least they did it one point but then for some reason their nuclear capacity has been going down and it&#x27;s been horrible timing because that&#x27;s right when the Russia Ukraine war broke out everyone&#x27;s like oh we can just rely on France and get some of their nuclear power but then France is like oh our nuclear power stations aren&#x27;t actually doing too well right now oh um but yeah I mean nuclear power it&#x27;s it&#x27;s clean at like it&#x27;s clean at its best at its best and then yeah you eventually have to do something with the waste what if you shot the waste into space Oh Oh that could just turn into a giant nuclear bomb if it doesn&#x27;t get out falls back oh yeah you&#x27;re right if it just falls back to Earth fire into the Sun a SpaceX explosion it&#x27;s just literally like the biggest nuclear payload of all time and it&#x27;s just going up towards the the outer rims of the Galaxy and just comes back and just blows up the entire planet I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s unstable in the way that it would create explosion but it would definitely cause radiation like that&#x27;s the problem right is it&#x27;s toxic so if you fired it into the Sun the sun&#x27;s already emitting radiation and it&#x27;s the biggest nuclear reactor of all time or at least in our solar system so you just send it into the sun let it burn up you can&#x27;t throw in a volcano you can&#x27;t that would have been a good idea but you can&#x27;t do that uh there&#x27;s uh why can&#x27;t you I don&#x27;t know look at ask the people of Iceland I want you to look into that Billy Billy might have just cracked the code yeah ask the people of Iceland if the US can start putting their nuclear waste in their volcano Oh Billy I do have a campaign question for you so Donald Trump he did like a a a trial balloon where he threw out an idea of purchasing Greenland buying Greenland getting that for the United States and people laughed at the time I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that stupid we&#x27;ve done no with the our our country has expanded several times uh and like yeah Iceland own owns Greenland right no no no uh no no Denmark does oh Denmark does Iceland&#x27;s its own country Iceland doesn&#x27;t really like Americans oh um well ask them what they think about buying Greenland yeah I think great Americans that&#x27;s where the seed vault is right yeah the seed Vault could be there and just the way that global warming is going like this past winter in Chicago was great like was not that cold I think Chicago might be a solid place to be for global warming you&#x27;re not near the coast and we don&#x27;t mind having warmer winners but that means like Greenland 40 years down the line like that could be a very nice place to live yeah yeah let&#x27;s look into Greenland and Greenland has also benefited a lot from uh from big map from The Big craphy Industry because everyone thinks that Greenland is like twice the size of the United States because of how it&#x27;s projected on a map when you unroll it y uh apparently not that big no yeah it looks larger than Australia on like a lot of maps yeah but uh whatever it still looks cool I would still like to own Greenland one day yeah uh so there have been some theories that energy suppression has been going on since the 19th century in the 1930s Thomas Henry Mo an electrical engineer based in Utah claimed that he and his family had been threatened and shot at on several occasions and that his lab was ransacked to stop his claimed free energy research and public demonstration no evidence has been provided for any of these claims Mor has several times produced devices that he said were powered by a mysterious stone that he found while doing missionary work in Sweden in the 1910s so I don&#x27;t know if this guy is a scientist or if he&#x27;s just like an Explorer finding like a so he found like a a power Stone that&#x27;s how things happen in Mormonism yeah you find rocks and the rocks have powers like that&#x27;s how uh was it Joseph Smith yeah found found those rocks and then he used his hat to translate them yeah and then uh they were tablets they were tablets yeah those tablets provided the basis for Mormonism so yeah this guy found a found a cool rock that provided secret energy it might have just been cracked cocaine actually we should study mincy for how to get free energy that guy doesn&#x27;t stop just redirect miny&#x27;s energy into something positive uh another notable name connected to allegations of harassment or suppression of free energy technology is Nica Tesla free I got some fire conspiracy about this okay so free energy proponents hold that Tesla&#x27;s Warden Cliff Tower could generate unlimited energy for free however the tower was only intended to transmit energy for free energy would still be still need to be generated through conventional means Billy what have you learned about this so this this Theory involves Donald Trump Baron Trump time travel okay all sorts of things okay just you lost it&#x27;s crazy TR all right well look up The Adventures of Baron Trump just if you want to if you want see it sounds crazy but look up The Adventures of Baron Trump can you explain it to us I&#x27;ll explain so Nicola Tesla had all of these writings inventions and stuff including what may have been uh uh free energy device of some sort his Tower in his apartment that he sort of went crazy in before he died guess who is landlord was Fred Trump John G Trump his grandfather so his uncle okay so what happened with uh so basically the FBI asked him to seize uh all of the stuff that was in Tesla&#x27;s apartment and uh Trump was also uh he knew how to work on x-ray machines this is the uncle during World War II um and had a little technical la knowledge so he then was called in to analyze uh the Tesla artifacts okay actually you know what he was not the landlord he actually was working for the Federal Bureau of Investigations yeah so he oh yeah he was in landlord I&#x27;m sorry I got that wrong uh he went to analyze Tesla&#x27;s artifacts that were being held in government custody after the three-day investigation Trump&#x27;s report included there was nothing of which could constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands in Tesla&#x27;s uh of his belongings so fast forward Donald Trump who you know some would say Biff from Back to the Future was based off of um another movie about time travel um becomes famous rich and everything uh everything seems to go his way strangely up until recently um but you know everyone&#x27;s like oh wow how does this guy just keep winning enter The Adventures of Baron Trump a story about a time traveling German boy named Baron Trump that was written in the year and I&#x27;m going to get the exact year we&#x27;ve discussed this right 1889 1889 and and 1893 about a boy who goes by Baron Trump as he discovers a weird underground uh place where he goes uh yeah discovers a weird underground civilizations offends the natives sleeves from entanglements with local women and repeats the pattern until arriving back home at Castle Trump um and there&#x27;s also time travel in it um so yeah so Trump&#x27;s youngest son Baron Trump may be a time traveler what does that have to do with Tesla because they think that the Trump family found son of of Tesla&#x27;s works that may have been free energy to create a time machine because time travel is possible if you have unlimited energy apparently theoretically okay so they&#x27;re saying that the Trump family may have discovered time travel and that&#x27;s why Biff and Back to the Future is based off of Donald Trump because Donald Trump can TI travel has been just like what what period of time would be the funniest to send Donald Trump back to I don&#x27;t like imagine Donald Trump being like a medieval King I don&#x27;t think that would be too off base I think the future would be funnier what about like the Renaissance I could I could see him thriving in the Renaissance unfortunately he kind of like he plays in times where there was probably more trumps yeah yeah the whole yeah send back to like the Soviet Union during the Bolshevik Revolution I I he would probably be on the side of the royalists or he would be on the sar&#x27;s side well no he might be on he might be on the people side and then he rises to power and then he becomes Stalin ah yes yeah I could see him being a Stalin s character yeah like he yeah it would just be fun to like put him back in different periods of time send him to like like Samurai era Japan yeah um that would be that would be hilarious send to Scotland when they were uh when When Braveheart was being taped the gay uh all right so since free energy theorists are impossible under modern science those arguing that free Energy Technologies have been suppressed assert that the scientific Community has controlled and buried Research into alternative Avenues of energy production via the institutions of peer review so they&#x27;re saying that um the scientists who are working on it uh are being suppressed by their peers who uh take their studies and [ __ ] all over them um which is very hard I think that&#x27;d be hard to do to like get scientists to agree to like form a conspiracy again so I guess a lot of people do believe that that&#x27;s happening um other claim means of suppression include buying the patent of free energy device from the inventor suing the inventor and even murdering the inventors of free energy devices or Associated efficiency Technologies so perpetual motion machines the history of Perpetual Motion machines dates back to the Middle Ages the history since is full of scams I think Da Vinci tried to work on a perpetual motion machine too that sounds about right that one of his things that he was up to by the way did Da Vinci actually invent a helicopter is that true he put together like a a helicopter based off of those twirly toys that go up in the air um and he just invented a bigger one uh that was theoretical he never built it one of the conspiracies that I actually believe in is that other situation or other civilizations figured out how to fly things like are you telling me that we didn&#x27;t just figure out flight until a 100 years ago I mean flight&#x27;s tough but you can watch a bird and then you can be like oh this is how a bird goes to the there were a lot of really smart people that lived before us they didn&#x27;t have access to like jet engines or or the combustion engine obviously which is a problem but yeah hand gliding gliders in general we&#x27;ve talked about some of the civilizations in South America that have these toys that look like airplanes I just I&#x27;m not buying it I&#x27;m not buying that we just discovered flight hand gliders I can see people tribe that has like done GL hangliding yeah hangliding that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll never do I guess we&#x27;re too smart to jump off a cliff even if with a makeshift yeah so with perpetual motion machines the problem is the existence of such a machine goes against the first two laws of thermodynamics the first law states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed merely transferred the second is that the entropy of an isolated system does not decrease the laws of thermodynamics could be wrong and it could be that theyve simply not yet been disproven but people have been trying to disprove those laws and create a perpetual motion machine ever since they were first written about over 150 years ago Lisa Simpson did make one though um the Tesla free energy generator the energy myth that surrounds Tesla sprang from a claim that he once made that he had invented both a free energy machine and a method of transmitting that energy wirelessly he started working on a generator that in his words would not consume any fuel in the n in the 1890s in 1901 he was Grant granted a US patent for an apparatus for the utilization of radiant energy by 1931 he was ready to claim that he had invented a machine to harness the power of cosmic rays so there are such things as like you know solar winds if you could somehow figure out how to harness those it would be free energy it would be unlimited until the sun just quit on itself till it expanded so much that died or imploded upon itself um so there have been harnessing of the power of cosmic rays from the Sun for years solar power rather than using the sun&#x27;s direct rays in their heat Tesla&#x27;s idea was to link the positive changes in the atmosphere with the negative charges in the ground and produce an electric current it may be theoretically possible but most estimates suggest that the amount of energy generated would in practice be too small to be of any use so that sounds like one of those things that like it could work we just don&#x27;t have the technology yet yeah same with like creating energy from dividing water into oxygen and hydrogen yeah like it&#x27;s the marginal creation isn&#x27;t worth this like the juice isn&#x27;t worth the squeeze as they say not yet but what if it did I mean honestly yeah not yet what there&#x27;s this crazy Theory Graham Hancock style and honestly I know Donnie&#x27;s a fan but what if they do have a process that Tesla discovered uh that they&#x27;re hiding from us that allowed the pyramids to be built in you know in do things in past societies that just we&#x27;ve lost to time like what if there was a more advanced time period than we are even now that built you know amazing structures amazing Technologies it may still be here um flying around us just checking in uh from their home underneath the Antarctic Ice Graham Hancock&#x27;s theory was that like the ancient Egyptians used Sonic energy where like if if everyone could like sing at the exact same vibration it could like move huge rocks or if you could like create a sound that like vibrates at the same frequency as the blocks you could then manipulate them I guess that that&#x27;s probably true because you can sing at a pitch that breaks glass yeah and it is true that like every object like in this room has a certain vibration that like all of the molecules are moving at and like if you can match it I don&#x27;t know that was what he talked about in one of his books yeah and I think there&#x27;s like a start huming one of the drawings on the pyramid or nearby like shows people singing at like everyone&#x27;s singing at a block I think he found that somewhere I don&#x27;t know um yeah the the free energy might also just be slavery so the Egyptians that&#x27;s one of the theories right is that they use slaves to build the pyramids probably the most accepted one free energy is just exploiting the workforce yes that&#x27;s what it is I like what if um I was just saying like what if you took the sidewalks of Manhattan and you created something underneath them that can like use everybody&#x27;s footsteps to generate electricity because there&#x27;s like a lot of force being put on those sidewalks yeah so if you took that and then like repurposed the energy there to then power the buildings it&#x27;s like a bike could power a light bulb if you if you hooked it up to the light bulb yeah it spins a turbine which then creates Tech P Pelon should partner with like a major Energy company yeah and then just every pelaton bike in the country is generating power so every time you get on the pelaton you can lower your own electricity bill oh I like that and then so it motivates you to work out more too because you&#x27;re also saving money I like like that a lot it&#x27;s a gym membership that pays for itself yeah gyms there they just open up a gym yes and that&#x27;s a power plant now yeah the more you work out the lower you have to pay for your monthly rate yeah because I&#x27;m sure a gym could I think one like could one Gym Power one house at least I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know how that converts but I&#x27;m sure the technology is improving on it too so it would get yeah more and more efficient like an Icelandic gym Billy that could power all of Iceland power the whole island I&#x27;m pretty sure there is like a children&#x27;s playground that either pumps water from a well or it is that exact concept of producing energy are you talking about the uh the free energy water pumps that you&#x27;ve seen on Tik Tok no I don&#x27;t know what those are but is it uh oh oh it&#x27;s on the sheet yeah huh so um no it&#x27;s not that one it&#x27;s like kids and I think it&#x27;s pump water so um they show might be It wait yeah they show somebody sticking some pipes into water and then they shake them back and forth until all of a sudden they start spouting endless quantities of liquid it looks magical there&#x27;s no apparent power source but the water keeps flowing sometimes from an outdoor body of water sometimes from a container that the person keeps refilling it looks like these devices run on free energy or energy with no apparent origin there are two methods to move water that don&#x27;t require an external power source one I can tell you right off the bat is like siphoning that&#x27;s how you siphon gas if you like like put a tube into a gas tank and then you suck the tube until you get some liquid you&#x27;re the power of the uh liquid being transferred the weight of it makes it look like there&#x27;s a pump that&#x27;s putting it from one device into another do people still siphon gas yeah they do I&#x27;ve yeah I feel like I I don&#x27;t know I I think I&#x27;ve seen someone do it in the last few years like you people used to just steal gas from other cars yeah have you ever tried to do it I&#x27;ve never done it no yeah you the hard part is just not getting the gas in your mouth so you got to give it like a suck and then immediately take it out yeah you have to just get like a tiny amount of gas yeah hypothetically let&#x27;s say someone was driving a diesel car uh but accidentally put gasoline in it recently and had to siphon out the dies uh the gasoline in order to put diesel back in uh you know people still siphon gas all the time yeah some some of these people did this happen to you recently Billy look on my website cons my go to my website yes please go to my website uh but that I know everyone&#x27;s going to be asking me about the time they saw me on the side of the road siphoning gas I was not stealing someone&#x27;s gas was taking I was siphoning my own gas it was out of gas station and I realized just in time so so there rental there&#x27;s the siphon pump and then wait did you do this in Iceland um did you do this like yesterday the website that&#x27;s yes yeah yeah I just mentioned how I&#x27;m beat beat off about doing no diesel oh my God yeah because of uh because of our government your go our government made you siphon gas yesterday Billy because we just don&#x27;t deal with diesel that much yeah uh they do have like very noticeable signs on at gas stations telling you which one I actually it actually didn&#x27;t happen in Iceland it actually happened in Brazil but and I wasn&#x27;t filling up the pump wait you were in Brazil not recently are you in the CIA what&#x27;s happening uh check out his website deep I I don&#x27;t want to get wrapped up in this uh there&#x27;s also he&#x27;s seen my activity in the field there&#x27;s also the ram pump which is short for a hydraulic ram pump so the ram pump is a way to move water to a higher location without an existing energy source both the siphon and the ram pumps move water without any external energy but you don&#x27;t get more energy than you started with so you might get water where you want it and that&#x27;s the point of a pump but even if you had an impossibly efficient power generator that was powered by the falling water from the ram pump it still wouldn&#x27;t give you free energy since some of the water has to be ejected excuse me ejected at the lower end the Water Source would would eventually dry up that would mean that you would have to to use energy to lift more water to add to your source so you do have like it&#x27;s a finite Loop of it&#x27;s like a Clos Loop of what essentially would be free energy but you don&#x27;t get energy out of it since you&#x27;d have to put the water back to get the like uh non-stop source of free energy oh that reminds me um have you guys seen die hard yeah Die Hard with a Vengeance Die Hard 3 oh um yeah there&#x27;s a puzzle in it there&#x27;s a puzzle he in order to like follow some step to diffuse a bomb uh he has to solve a riddle so follow me on this one okay you have two jugs of water one jug of water has three gallons in it or excuse me one jug of water is a three gallon jug it&#x27;s empty the other G the other jug is a five gallon jug you have a pump of water how can you make one of those jugs contain exactly four gall G of water if you can make it have four gallons of water in it then you diffuse the bomb but if it&#x27;s plus or minus by like Point by 10% let&#x27;s say uh then the bomb blows up and kids die how do you do that I remember doing this at some point and I don&#x27;t remember because in the movie they skip one of the steps so if you&#x27;re just watching it you&#x27;re very confused you&#x27;re like what happened so what are you stting with again you have you have one jug that is a three gallon jug and it&#x27;s empty and one jug that&#x27;s a five gallon jug okay you take you fill the five gallon jug pour it into the three yep so now you have three and two empty the three so now there&#x27;s two gallons in the five gallon jug MH you pour that into the three fill the five up again dump it into the three to fill the three and that so that one gallon goes and now you have four in the five gallon jug there you go I think you did that right I mean um but you need got to four gallon jug what do you need the gallon in one of the jugs no you you just need exactly four gallons okay so then why don&#x27;t you just do the first step twice to the three gallon where you go uh three to where you get two gallons and do that twice well how do you how can you get two gallons if you only know that there&#x27;s a three gallon jug and there&#x27;s a five gallon jug so what Big T said is you fill the five gallon all the way to the top you pour that into the three that means that you have two gallons left in the five gallon jug you just do that twice you empty out the three Gall I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re Billy okay okay so there&#x27;s not a third recept in no so so so you pour the five gallon jug into the three gallon jug that means that you have two gallons left in the five gallon jug jug you empty out the three gallon jug mhm then you pour the two Gall from the 5 gon jug into the three gallon jug yes yep and fill the five up again fill the five up again and then pour that into the three till it&#x27;s full till it&#x27;s full now you have four now you have four gallons left in the five gallon jug yep yep congrats Big T that was fast you saved the kids I know that was good yeah nice work I&#x27;ve heard it before it was good that still still impressive uh there&#x27;s Gary McKinnon is that where that originated I there was probably a riddle before that had to but they used it in that movie so Gary M we should do a riddle segment okay B get rle that&#x27;s your assignment for for next Tuesday&#x27;s show we&#x27;re just gonna get riddles it&#x27;s just a show on riddles just tons of riddles everyone bring riddle give give me five riddles Billy okay we can do more than that okay but you have to bring five riddles okay all right uh did you see Josh pek go uh crazy no yeah apparently Josh pek he like shaved his head and he&#x27;s saying that he got abused by Nickelodeon no no Drake Bell yeah the other one Drake of Drake and Josh J Drake said he did yeah they&#x27;re saying it was whole documentary by by oh he said it was it was Brian peek is the man who abused Drake Bell not related to Josh P not related to Josh PE two packs okay two separate packs like Sydney Sweeney yep very true Punk and then Dan Schneider is the one who was the creator of all of those shows but Drake B he&#x27;s the one with the foot fetish right allegedly yes but Drake Bell was abused by Brian peek Josh pek is not involved in this who&#x27;s very sad story who&#x27;s the fat guy that they&#x27;re all accusing of like Dan Schneider is the fat guy that started like I Carly Josh and or Drake and Josh and all of those but Brian peek is the one who Drake Bell okay got abused by like directly is that like a Lou Pearlman situation I don&#x27;t know who L I think so he&#x27;s a guy that started in sync in the back street boys in oot toown yeah he&#x27;s a big fat guy that was like an abusive manager yeah basically I think so but Brian Brian peek was a dialect coach for those shows and sexually abused Drake Bell all I know is I saw a clip of Dan Schneider and he&#x27;s in a hot tub with like some of those kids and he&#x27;s fully clothed yeah he&#x27;s wearing like a button-up shirt or like it&#x27;s I mean obviously I know fat guys will wear like a t-shirt into the pool but he&#x27;s wearing like a suit business casual yeah a suit in the pool he&#x27;s wearing like business casual just hanging out in the hot tub that&#x27;s wild that&#x27;s probably the only way they&#x27;d let him get in there with the kids here I&#x27;ll send you guys the picture of it it&#x27;s really fun and he do right in but that&#x27;s like like Amanda binds was heavily involved in it um where did this come from by the way this is a no no no this whole conversation I don&#x27;t know that was Billy Billy just brought it up Billy brought it up with Josh peek yeah I just saw it was trending I was like wait this this seems juicy I&#x27;ve been on Iceland time so I can&#x27;t doot outdoor stuff it&#x27;s 7:30 p.m. what time does the Sun set now does it probably soon yeah no it&#x27;s only it&#x27;s only in the summer like oh okay July and August I&#x27;ll tell you I&#x27;ve been getting we&#x27;re getting some sunsets at like 7:15 now oh it&#x27;s been some good [ __ ] it&#x27;s really nice I like forget that it&#x27;s late like from and I&#x27;m like it could it could be like 7:30 and it&#x27;s still L out and I&#x27;m like what time the day isn&#x27;t even close to done not even close not even close it&#x27;s beautiful it&#x27;s so great I just bought some chairs for my deck this summer oh that&#x27;s big oh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s I&#x27;m I&#x27;m excited it&#x27;s still cold though are you a Grill Master Big T not really I I hope to become one in the next 15 to 20 years but not as of now you&#x27;ve got a full plate for the next 15 to 20 years you got some gos got a lot of stuff I need to do you want to go to Little League baseball games pull up a chair you that you make that sound no no I&#x27;m not you took that in a bad way no you said it in a bad way I want to have my own children who are good at sports and uh i&#x27; I&#x27;d like to like you know have a kid that&#x27;s like really good at high school football and just be like the ultimate High School football Dad yeah if your kid is bad at sports are you still going to love him of course less but okay how good do they have to be to get Big T&#x27;s full love like a starter in high school no no no not again not to get Be Be Loved just fully yeah fully love that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying so if they&#x27;re like a a a rotation player in high school benchwarmer player what how much less love will they receive not a lot what&#x27;s the difference how how far would you go to help them be a starter as much as they wanted so if they were like Hey Dad I wanted juice would you let them juice of course not that&#x27;s a dumb question but what if they&#x27;re like Dad you need to sign me up for this sports camp and it costs like $8,000 then I got to do like you got to hire me this private coach that&#x27;s another I mean if they were good then I would want to help them get really good okay now if it&#x27;s apparent they suck then you probably don&#x27;t dump a ton of money into it but if it&#x27;s like okay so if the the kid is really good at sports then like more ice cream for the kid it sounds like maybe ice cream with all the toppings on yeah maybe and if they&#x27;re you know benchwarmer then you&#x27;re like let&#x27;s just have dessert once a week special occasions only I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think that drastic just you know yeah let&#x27;s get you your favorite food if they&#x27;re if they score a touchdown yeah sure let&#x27;s say outstanding in high school little undersized for college ball and he&#x27;s like Dad can you help me get the juice can we can you no I&#x27;m not going to give my kids steroids I&#x27;m just just wondering where your line is they only get steroids if they&#x27;re good you shouldn&#x27;t do steroids kids don&#x27;t listen to Billy no U let&#x27;s talk about the rest of the uh the free energy stuff that was a quick um there was a guy named Gary McKinnon who was known online as solo and in late 2001 and early 2002 he carried out what would be describ by a us prosecutor as the biggest military computer hack of all time he breached 97 military and NASA computers to unlock classified Secrets this guy sounds like a hero McKinnon was arrested and he was facing 70 years in prison two million bucks in fines said that his reason for launching the hack was his obsessive search for evidence of UFOs and free energy suppression by the US government he didn&#x27;t find much about free energy but his findings relating to UFOs tanalised him as his fingers danced across the keyboard scrolling through images and documents deep in the labyrinths of classified military data McKinnon discovered a classified personnel roster he traced the words non-terrestrial officers the Excel spreadsheet contained the names and ranks of Air Force personnel not registered anywhere else it also included information about shipt ship transfers which solo had never seen elsewhere none of these were oceangoing ships it was astounding they&#x27;re not a Navy they&#x27;re not an army and not even an Air Force so as thinking they must be an off-planet space force or a space Fleet at least he said in an interview with wired McKinna explained what drove him to do the hack I knew that government suppressed Anti-Gravity UFO related Technologies or what they call Zero Point Energy this should not be kept hidden when pensioners can&#x27;t pay their fuel bills in 2012 following a 10-year battle over McKinnon being extradited to the United States for prosecution Teresa may blocked his extradition citing his Asperger syndrome and depression stating that there is such a high risk of him ending his own life that a decision to extradite would be incompatible with this human rights so he brings up a good point anti-gravity that I think there&#x27;s a lot of conspiracy theories around like that the US has found alien ships that and that&#x27;s what like those ships use as fuel that&#x27;s right yeah Bazar that&#x27;s how they travel and like they&#x27;ve been just working to reverse engineer those ships for the last 30 years and like may have made some huge breakthroughs but like they can&#x27;t just give it to the public because then they would also have to come out with the fact that like they figured it out using a UFO that we didn&#x27;t tell you about yeah yeah and then it would just open up Pandora&#x27;s box but I mean anti-gravity would be Limitless energy because it&#x27;s just like right now we can only we we I don&#x27;t know how to explain it but yeah gravity only pulls in One Direction but if you could like create an anti-gravity field that would just so then like a wheel would just have to keep on moving that could then power something pull in the opposite direction yeah yeah you could you could pull it up and then let it drop down and uh Power turbine yeah you turn it off and water yeah yeah um Billy you&#x27;ll like this the diesel inventor the death of Rudolph diesel has been said to be an event that has fueled further conspiracies about suppression of energy technology that&#x27;s awesome I didn&#x27;t know that diesel fuel was named after one guy yeah dude he was diesel dude he was diesel dies mean strong on September 29th 1913 Rudolph diesel the inventor of the engine that bears his name disappears from the steam ship Dresden while traveling from antor to England on October 10th a Belgian sailor aboard a North Sea steamer spotted a body floating in the water upon further investigation it was diesels there was and remains a great deal of mystery surrounding his death it was officially judged a suicide but many people believed that diesel was murdered at the time of his death he was on the way to attend the groundbreak of a new diesel engine plant and to meet with the British Navy about installing his engine on their subs conspiracy theories begin to fly almost immediately inventor thrown into the sea to stop sale of patents to British government read one headline another worried that diesel was Mur murdered by Agents from Big Oil trusts is likely that diesel did throw himself overboard as it turns out he was nearly broke but the mystery probably never will be solved so what what did he know he someone bought his engine like a funny company bought the diesel engine originally patent um I&#x27;m looking into it right now it was like some it was like a I almost want to say uh like a a food company bought the diesel engine patents in America it was wasn&#x27;t it Budweiser I don&#x27;t know wait Bud diesel it is interesting to think though if you just like look at it for what it is that uh all this energy that we have now is just us burning dinosaur bones like just their bodies we just get energy from a bunch of old bodies do you think well they&#x27;re not dinosaur bodies it&#x27;s it&#x27;s mostly plant vegetation but do you think in like I don&#x27;t know 400 million years people that like happen to build their houses on top of what used to be a cemetery are going to be burning like our bones for for fuel more more than likely it will be large deposits of carbon from uh like a forest and maybe we&#x27;ll be combined in it the yeah but we&#x27;re mostly water so like the Amazon Rain like rainforest like 400 million years if someone&#x27;s living on top of it he didn&#x27;t realize it used to be a rainforest yeah digs deep enough that would have all turned into oil so by byy land in Brazil and then just wait yeah I wonder if any if any people that owned cemeteries that were like I&#x27;m in this for the Long play yeah well I mean if we&#x27;re still I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re GNA be using fossil fuels in 400 million years probably not if we&#x27;re even still around probably not uh there was that movie what&#x27;s yeah what if you like that&#x27;d be a great way to do intergenerational wealth if you just started buying something that like will take 150 years to actually come to fruti and you just bought a [ __ ] ton now and then like spent all your money so that you don&#x27;t give any inheritance it&#x27;s just that yeah come to what it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s okay I mean like you you plant like redwood trees or Lumber and then you say here son here&#x27;s like this will probably be worth a ton of money in a hundred years when these redwoods get gigantic and you can sell them for lumber yeah but your son won&#x27;t be alive in a hundred years either so it would be like you can pass this on to yeah you could you could yeah you tell your son you can pass this on to his son but then he&#x27;s not going to be pumped about that I have to manage the scores now yeah it&#x27;s going to be tough to find a wife when I have absolutely nothing yeah just know that your grandchildren your grandchildren will be rich yeah once this comes to fruti um but some like that would work I don&#x27;t know you could buy a house that&#x27;s like 50 feet away from the ocean and be like son one day this is going to be waterfront property yeah um by the way glaciers in Iceland receding pretty fast oh yeah have you have you noticed a change since you&#x27;ve been in Iceland for a week no but I saw where it was the year before uh it&#x27;s pretty fast kind of gives a lot of perspective people out there fact finding I I was doing my own research it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s pretty bad Global but in 1300 there was an ice age that made them go really far and they haven&#x27;t gone past back to what it was before 1300 so okay but they&#x27;re melting fast is that concerning to you it&#x27;s like okay we&#x27;re there we&#x27;re we we might need to start making some changes so global warming is real climate change is real Bill caught it for congress I have zero faith in humans making enough changes yeah but are you guys a proponent of like Bill Gates was saying he&#x27;s like if we shoot these like micro I think was it gold or some sort of if we shoot this into the atmosphere it will reflect the Sun and eventually cool the Earth and some like and he actually wants to do this but everyone else is like we&#x27;re not going to trust some tech billionaire just shooting a bunch of [ __ ] into the atmosphere because what if it backfires what if one person is wrong and then everyone&#x27;s [ __ ] yeah this because it could also just send us deep into like an ice age this is the plot of the Simpsons Mr Burns is upset that people aren&#x27;t using as much energy as they used to so he built a giant thing that blocked out the sun oh yeah and then somebody shot him turns out it was Maggie oh Maggie&#x27;s always been sort of an sjw yeah what I mean the thing is I&#x27;m still trying to figure out what caused the ice age in 1300 in Iceland that caused it to freeze and kind Iceland was like way more uh M like than ice land before um and it then became that because of the Ice Age so like could that happen again they probably had a bunch of planes and [ __ ] that they were flying around all the time it was just an island filled with Taylor Swifts with their own Jets and they probably started the Ice Age there and then we have no proof that they had planes anymore because it all got wiped out in the Ice Age this volcano is put out a ton of CO2 like more than a very large amount I don&#x27;t know the exact figure but like like more than America does in a year you in a day Billy you should you should take just a a big ass steak out there and just cook your steak over the volcano that would be sick tried dude I tried to get as close I could I almost got arrested like literally the Icelandic police are all about like they&#x27;re not here to police you they&#x27;re here to help you but then like one time you get close to the volcano and they&#x27;re like arrest the American yeah they&#x27;re trying to I thought you were supposed to be helping me why won&#x27;t you let me get into this volcano yeah my taxes paid for this so Billy actually some people think the little ice age in the 1300 could have been caused by volcanic activity yeah because they were like a a lot of volcanoes during that time that were popping off what&#x27;s crazy is that those volcanoes were causing global warming and that caused the Ice Age yeah because they can also if it just straight up blocks out the sun like I guess if we get hit by another Ice Age that&#x27; be that&#x27;s good not good not good because think about it the glaciers would cover New York City like we&#x27;re worried about the Water Rising and and enveloping like coastal cities what if the glaciers come back and literally just run over cities and towns that would have to be like a full-fledged Ice Age if it was just a little ice age I don&#x27;t think the glaciers would come back to New York City but they would grow a little growth wouldn&#x27;t be too bad that growth and retraction will grind down all the rock and uh make the stones smaller and the men weaker who are working the fields yes um the movie Chain Reaction 1996 we talked about earlier K Reeves it was based on the permise that free energy suppression is real the movie revolves around a team from the University of Chicago discovering a renewable energy source by converting hydrogen to water to clean energy in the film&#x27;s plot a scientific process extracts the hydrogen from the water then burns the hydrogen to generate power and leaves only water as a residue essentially a chemical perpetual motion I think at one point he just like has the uh the glass of water and he just drinks it to show like this is the only um like runoff this is the only like that&#x27;s the only byproduct the only byproduct of it yeah the movie Never clarifies how the how the nen is extracted from the water nor how water is still left over the character Dr Shannon makes contradictory statements one time he says this is accomplished with a laser with millions of degrees another time he says frequency of sound and Son sonoluminescence sonol luminescence in one scene the movie shows a bubbling container reminiscent of cold fusion electroic cells and another reference sustained Fusion one character claims a glass of water could power Chicago for weeks but no clear explanations ever given as as to whether this is simply burning hydrogen released by highly efficient means or through nuclear processes um it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s an interesting move to like make a movie about um discovering free energy and then just never addressed that that&#x27;s a problem with the premise of the movie it&#x27;s like how do you yeah how do you explain it they should just been like we&#x27;re not going to tell you yeah I mean that&#x27;s a tough thing to explain Christopher Nolan he actually tried to explain what he was doing in um Interstellar yeah like he had a physicist that was on set and so he was like can you make sure that at least we&#x27;re like trying to explain this right um his notes for Interstellar are crazy too if you see his like timeline that he wrote out like a plot like it&#x27;s basically trace your way through the plot um which by the way I haven&#x27;t seen Interstellar that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a big miss you haven&#x27;t seen oh no no I did see no I was thinking about no I heard that&#x27;s very confusing too I saw that&#x27;s too confusing it&#x27;s not good it was so confusing that nobody liked it yeah it was just like I don&#x27;t this doesn&#x27;t make sense uh it was what was the one with DiCaprio Inception Inception I haven&#x27;t seen Inception that&#x27;s very confusing but it&#x27;s confusingly enjoyable okay I need to watch that one that it&#x27;s no desire to see tenant no that was I watched it on I rewatched it again recently and I it changed my whole Theory I had when I first watched it when I was like 11 and I think he&#x27;s in a dream at the end okay okay who the entire what you guys think at the end no spoilers it&#x27;s 10 years old yeah um I I like the fact that they leave it open-ended I&#x27;m not sure though I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s one right answer true all right well uh I think that does it for this week&#x27;s episode so what do we like are y&#x27;all do you think the government is suppressing this stuff I&#x27;m gonna wait I&#x27;m gonna read Billy&#x27;s Website before I answer that I think the premise uh makes sense because the government suppressing a lot of [ __ ] I just didn&#x27;t see a lot of evidence of what they&#x27;re suppressing yeah I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think the technolog is there it seems like the only people that have claimed to figure this out are like kind of Cs that do in their backyard yeah I think if they like if we did have a new form of energy they would just release it and then find a way to profit off of it but they wouldn&#x27;t just it hidden yes if there I think there are I think they are hiding technology that may have to do with energy just for military Secrets like there&#x27;s definitely some way more efficient uh type of maybe Battery Technology um that causes energy to be cheaper but they don&#x27;t want to release it on a mass scale because it would give other countryes edges that we don&#x27;t have that we don&#x27;t want to share yeah I think especially with Battery Technology um there&#x27;s some stuff going on with lithium batteries like you know how they all explode yeah so there&#x27;s new technologies that makes them way more efficient and safer uh so like you could have a drone a spy drone that just flies forever perpetually just from like a battery that well not forever but just like a supercharged battery um and then it&#x27;s just you can send it Behind Enemy Lines transporting back tons of info and because it lasts so long uh they can collect more information and just leave it and explode itself so I mean I there&#x27;s they&#x27;re definitely hiding technology but not perpetual energy technology yeah but probably pretty close energy yeah there&#x27;s definitely stuff that we don&#x27;t know about that they&#x27;re researching for like Future Weapons future airplanes future Subs I think they&#x27;re definitely like uh um what&#x27;s it propulsion they definitely have propulsion systems we don&#x27;t know about they definitely need to be looking into it if they&#x27;re not looking into it I would be upset it&#x27;s like you guys gotta be studying this stuff I think they are they&#x27;re at least trying to figure out fusion and if you say that you figured it out then you make Russia be like oh [ __ ] the US figured this out we got to spend a lot of money on this and even if you don&#x27;t have anything they&#x27;re going to waste a lot of time and money trying to catch up to what they think you have yeah psychological warfare all right we will see you guys uh next week Billy&#x27;s goingon to have riddles for us five riddles and his website will be up so consult Billy&#x27;s Website will Cotter for congress yeah that&#x27;s the one go to will cter for congress.com will cter bill bill bill did you actually almost get arrested I&#x27;m I&#x27;m calling [ __ ] on that I think you probably had one cop to say Sir could you turn around and you&#x27;re like oh my God I almost just got [ __ ] arrested in Iceland yeah story good and I was fcking diesel too he had a mouthful of diesel fuel yeah all right I had a mouth buet diesel the guy was like what&#x27;s going on that&#x27;s what got me arrested he&#x27;s probably like oh oh I&#x27;m I&#x27;m sorry sir could you please turn around and he was like yo relax bro Jesus all right well no the icelandics don&#x27;t like the Americans they haven&#x27;t since the 1940s interesting why like they&#x27;re pretty cold I think the tourism industry has expanded here and now they&#x27;re just sort of fed up with everybody and also like the American soldiers in their occupation in the 1940s there was a lot of uh un oh a lot of a lot of American illegitimate babies yeah and they&#x27;re just pissed about how they acted so all right but all right well we do your best to mend international relations Billy apologies to is uh bill cter for congress.com all right consult Billy&#x27;s Website all right oh my God see you guys next week love you guys [Music] oh</p>
