            <p>T that&#x27;s 10 9 8 7 6 5 all three engines up and burning 2 1 zero and lift off 1 2 3 4 you&#x27;re listening to the Twisted 10 bringing you original and unique post created top 10 list recorded live in world famous Coco Beach Florida with hosts Tac Van Sickle and Adam hoston all right welcome to the Twisted 10 my name is Adam I&#x27;m one of your hosts oh um I&#x27;m T I&#x27;m the I&#x27;m one of the other ones and joining us in studio again is Andrea hi there guys Hi how are you I&#x27;m good we got sound like a question we&#x27;ve got a tough week to compete against Joe paro&#x27;s podcast that we did last week when he hosted and did the top 10 Disney sexual references is going to be a tough one to beat that that had a lot of downloads already yeah he&#x27;s uh yeah he&#x27;s he did pretty good with that cool cool cool all right Tac we talked about this a little bit I don&#x27;t remember if so this week is my week um no guest host this week what my top 10 list is for this week is kind was kind of seated I think in a living pod curiously show what&#x27;s that that&#x27;s the other podcast that we host dodo you oh yeah that&#x27;s right it sounds like a really good show it does it&#x27;s a little bit more rough and raw than this show though what&#x27;s it about I like those kinds you know sex relationships men&#x27;s perspectives you know that kind of stuff oh that sounds neat I&#x27;ll go check it out today plug I like it um so we we kind of briefly mention something and that&#x27;s one of my top 10 tonight is this one particular item that that you talked about I I think it was you that talked about this it might have been somebody else who knows okay but uh this week is the top 10 yeah suppressed okay inventions meaning inventions that these inventors came up with yeah either patented or just did the blueprints and everything or made the prototypes for then either big companies government or somebody came in and kiboshed that invention oh we talked with the water car that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s that is one of them yeah yeah yeah in fact let me just go right to the water car since that&#x27;s our first one oh okay I think foreshadowing oh well no I didn&#x27;t actually have the water car I have something that&#x27;s similar to the water car okay it&#x27;s not the same it&#x27;s same but not the same all right any let&#x27;s just get right into this all right so number 10 I think you&#x27;re going to like number 10 right off the bat you two okay it&#x27;s biofuel but it&#x27;s made out of hemp oh hemp hemp biofuel so the article goes and this is from many different sources as always I I looked up the you know top 20 top 30 top 40 that I could find online and there was a lot of these types of inventions and I just handpicked the ones that I like the best so these are not all together from any One Source they&#x27;re from all over so hemp biofuel the father of our country George Washington who is rumored to have said I cannot tell a lie was a proud supporter of hemp of the hemp seed of course the only thing more surprising in this country than an honest politician is hemp which is often mistaken for marijuana and therefore unfairly maligned so a lot of people think that hemp oil or hemp the product hemp has something to do with marijuana right I always thought that I don&#x27;t really know what the difference is you would have to smoke a hemp joint the size of a telephone pole to even get a slight Buzz oh really have you tried now hemp can be used and the the funny thing about this and I&#x27;ll get more into this article in a second but hemp hemp can be used to make anything from paper to essential oils to fuel to shampoo soap clothing yeah anything I mean anything at all the number one Outlaw of hemp in the past has been the paper industry the lumber and Paper Industries cuz hemp the product when you cut up hemp or chop it down or do whatever the hell you&#x27;re supposed to do when you harvest it you can actually make paper products at a fr fraction of the cost that you can with Lumber so the lobbyists that originally attached marijuana to hemp back in the 30s or 20s whenever it was was the big lobbyists for the paper and the lumber and Mill industry so I see quite quite interesting that is interesting so the article goes on governmental roadblocks meanwhile prevent hemp from becoming the leader in extracting ethanol allowing environmental damaging sources like corn to take over the ethanol industry despite the fact it requires few chemicals less water and less processing to do the same job hemp has never caught on Experts also lay the blame on the feet of who Els presidential candidates who kiss up to the Iowa Corn Growers for votes so it&#x27;s all about politics what about the hemp Growers though I guess there&#x27;s not as many though they&#x27;re too busy you know tie dyeing shirts and and making ice cream Ben and jeering all right number nine number nine number nine is the original electric car the original yeah when do you guys think the original electric car was produced 1483 um I&#x27;m going to have to say no on that one uh I&#x27;m going to say 19 yes 43 no no 71 71 I I&#x27;ll give you a hint GM produced it and its name was the ev1 19 78 you guys are not even going to get 1980 no the original one was actually produced in 1999 that was my next guess it was relatively recent I was just to saying it too perhaps the most notorious suppressed invention is the General Motors ev1 subject of the 2006 documentary Who Killed the Electric Car ironically now that it&#x27;s 2016 electric cars are starting to come back but they were originally introduced back then Tesla uh the ev1 was the world&#x27;s first mass-produced electric car with 800 of them up for lease from GM in the late 90s GM ended the ev1 line in &#x27;99 so it was actually mid 90s to late &#x27;90s uh stating the consumers weren&#x27;t happy with a limited driving range of the car&#x27;s batteries making it unprofitable for GM to continue production many Skeptics however believe GM killed the ev1 under pressure from oil companies who stand to lose the most if high efficiency Vehicles conquer the market so yes they got squashed rumors suggest huh interesting Andrea wants a Prius mhm it&#x27;s fun to say Prius it is fun it&#x27;s more fun it&#x27;s more fun to say Tesla or Corvette or limousine Bugatti Bugatti is really fun to say bugatti is fun to say if Bugatti made an all electric could I get it sure yeah I&#x27;ll get you one it&#x27;s only 400,000 it&#x27;s cool no problem I&#x27;m sure the electric version would be a little bit more all right so tying into the car a little bit all right this isn&#x27;t your water car but tying into the car a little bit is a carburetor very simple product in a car T do you know what a carburetor physically does for an engine for an engine it makes it work sorry it lets air in and out pretty much yeah yeah so there was a a gentleman by the name of Tom Ogle who developed a new type of carburetor that pressurized gasoline into vapor and injected it in the fire Pistons it&#x27;s kind or firing Chambers kind of similar to how a fuel injector will work now but far more efficient and this was back in 1981 mind you after installing it in his Ford Galaxy the car was measured to get 113 m per gallon I think I heard about this guy I think he turned up missing too ironically after some licensing setbacks ogul died in 1981 and took the design of his carburetor with him to the grave now the theory there is or the the conspiracy there is is he didn&#x27;t die of necessarily natural causes right there are ways to induce brain aneurysms so yes he was perfectly healthy and then he&#x27;s dead 131 miles to the gallon 113 miles to to the gallon this is a 1981 with a Ford Galaxy yeah 35 years ago mhm yeah that&#x27;s before like emissions wasn&#x27;t it like state emissions when I was 16 I got like 5 miles to the gallon I drove my first car was a uh Mercury Grand Marquee LS station wagon it had the brown panels on the side like the fake the faux wood panels oh it was great 1984 bonnaville that&#x27;s back when engines could run dirty was hot I could hit anyone in the parking lot wouldn&#x27;t put a scratch in my car a big old boat huge every 16-year-old yeah that thing didn&#x27;t turn it floated didn&#x27;t it I don&#x27;t know I never tried it I was in the middle of the Oklahoma there&#x27;s no water my older step sisters have their their first car from Lane to Lane it floated I got it w all right number seven all right number seven is free energy let&#x27;s see Tac if you can get actually Andrew you might get this too who do you think is the inventor of free energy that would be the Lord Jesus Jesus no Nicola Tesla oh yeah was an Undisputed genius there&#x27;s no question in 1899 he figured out a way to bypass fossil fuel burning power plants and power lines proving that quote free energy could be harnessed using ionization in the upper atmosphere to produce electrical vibrations JP Morgan who had been funding Tesla&#x27;s re SE Arch had a bit of buyer remorse when he realized that the free energy for all wasn&#x27;t as profitable as actually charging people for every wat of energy use now Tesla and another famous inventor of the time were going head-to-head for their DC and AC type currents you remember who that was did a little light bulb pop on in your head T ah is it Edison Thomas Edison yes Nicola Tesla and Thomas Edison were direct competitors of each other while they did share you know studies and you know some privileges of this of the trade they were competitors of each other also definitely fun fact about Nicola Tesla is that uh they believed he had Asbergers as well yep as well as you know who else most likely had Asbergers as well he was actually a family two boys and a girl huge inventors two boys and a girl major Discovery Family I don&#x27;t know the R Brothers really and they had a sister too huh because none of them like had any relationships and never get they had zero interest in being in a relationship zero interest in getting married they just never did all they cared about was like their work and that was it interesting yep uh so JP Morgan then drove another nail into free Energy&#x27;s Coffin by chasing away other investors ensuring Tesla&#x27;s dream would die the ability to distribute power wirelessly on a global scale that was his his dream Tesla had dazzled crowds with demonstrations of short range Wireless power through the air using coils and to charge light bulbs as far as 100t away yeah there&#x27;s pictures of him doing that you ever seen a Tesla coil in action do you know what Tesla coil is it&#x27;s one of those beams with a big ball on top and then it mad scientist labs yeah well no no that&#x27;s that arcing thing is not a coil that&#x27;s yeah uh what is that God I can&#x27;t remember the name of that right now the Tesa coil is the ball spits out electricity General charging the air is what it&#x27;s doing M but the Maverick inventor claimed that he had a significant upgrade on the technique that allowed for electricity to be transmitted through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere using high altitude receiving stations he began constructing his prototype in 1901 but funding fell through and it was never completed some scientists have tried picking up those projects again but same Pro exact same problem now big companies want to make money off of it so there&#x27;s a little bit of a problem all right number six number number six really number six yeah all right have you ever heard of a rif beam before negative so this is a cancer curing microscopic uh excuse me this is a cancer curing microscope AKA a rif beam or a riff beam I think it&#x27;s rif yeah I said that right after successfully curing a number of cancer patients the Rockefeller owned American Medical Association later had this work Laid to Rest by closing down ri&#x27;s setups and SE his equipment essentially re refused to hand over the rights of his work to the AMA because he saw moneyed interests as hidden alterior motives that the cancer machine would not be allowed to uh to the World At Large because the AMA and medical pharmaceutical establishments didn&#x27;t want the patients cured if you cured the patients you lost return business in the cancer industry right that&#x27;s been the one of the biggest conspiracies now still today is that they could potentially have cures for different types of cancer but have them locked away way because those companies can&#x27;t make money if you cure your patients right uh after years of ensuing court cases with big boys of the cancer establishment having had a little money exiled to Mexico to avoid imprisonment in the USA R died of alcoholism H broke and battered battered was he fried too yeah well deep fried battered beer battered yeah all right so that&#x27;s 10 that&#x27;s uh 10 through five um the the little bit of a water car thing is coming up on in the next one okay so you&#x27;ll get that after the break so all right we&#x27;re going to take a break and we will be right back after this get the top five power to the people back once again the Renegade mastera damer power to the people back once again the Renegade Master hey this is Adam this week&#x27;s Twisted 10 is brought to you by just tacking myself we we don&#x27;t have a sponsor for this week&#x27;s show so T and I have been talking a lot about having sponsorships in our podcast weighing the pros and the cons you know we&#x27;re a big fan of having more content than advertising so as opposed to listening to a radio show where 40% of your time that you&#x27;re listening to the show is built around sponsorships T and I think that the content delivery is far more important while the delivery of content of a podcast is Paramount to the success of the show sometimes you got to have sponsors to help cover some of the bills while we do have two sponsors currently for both of our shows that&#x27;s the Twisted 10 which is this show and living pod cariously which is is another show that t and I produced a little bit more raw and rough we do have some opportunities that are coming up for other sponsors if you are interested in becoming a sponsor of the Twisted 10 or living pod curiously shoot us an email at show livp pod carly.com and we&#x27;ll get back with you with the contract details welcome back to the Twisted 10 uh this week&#x27;s Twisted 10 is the Twisted 10 suppressed inventions just a recap number 10 is hemp biofuel M number nine is the electric car say it number eight is the carburetor number seven is Nicola Tesla&#x27;s free energy pretty John brother number six is the cancer curing microscope AKA The rif Beam all right so let&#x27;s get on with the rest of this list mm number five number five say sister the unified theory cure for heart disease what there&#x27;s a cure for heart disease supposedly don&#x27;t smoke is what it is this guy sounds like a scientist by the way his first name is lonus so lonus Pauline had worked with MTH Mathias wrath and they came up with a unified approach to curing heart disease essentially they found that the heart disease is a result of a long-term vitamin C deficiency the solution is to treat patients with frequent high doses up to 6 g a day of vitamin C while using amino acids lysine and Proline to remove the oh boy here&#x27;s a big one atherosclerotic plaque lining close enough uh lining the inner walls of the blood vessels uh that cause narrowing of blocked uh narrowing or blocking of the Lumen or the space of the blood vessels okay that&#x27;s all boring however due to Greater interest in corporate profitability in perceived Financial threat this highly successful cheap alternative therapy has not been allowed that much attention so big farmy big Pharma came in and said oh hell no sounds vitamin C vitamin C and some of these Amino yeah it just sounds like a cocktail and like a plan six grams a day though direct injections not like pills not the vitamin C pills or you just can&#x27;t drink a bunch of OJ no cuz you&#x27;re vitamin C from a cocktail if well no I&#x27;m just it&#x27;s like a cocktail of vitamins to take if you take it through your digestive tract it&#x27;ll process most of it out so your body wouldn&#x27;t absorb that much direct injection of these amino acids and this uh high high dosages of vitamin C is what it took six grams a day that&#x27;s a ton if you know that&#x27;s a ton that&#x27;s like okay so you&#x27;re talking about that will prevent heart disease or cure heart disease cure gotcha so people who already have the conditions that will lead them to having heart disease it will cure H so big Pharma came in and said [ __ ] no not allowed not allowed yep can&#x27;t make doctors like not allowed to do that oh you can&#x27;t it&#x27;s not I mean that&#x27;s not illegal no I mean that&#x27;s leg that&#x27;s illegal for you to for a doctor prescribed vitamin C uh it&#x27;s uh H I guess it&#x27;s not illegal but it&#x27;s not I guess it&#x27;s not illegal for somebody to prescribe high doses of Vitamin C I guess probably not however what drives the doctor and see this is why it&#x27;s so corrupt is because everybody&#x27;s greedy yeah so it essentially it boils down to Greed so either government greed uh independent like lobbyists type greed who whoever pays the highest bill is what drives the nation so there&#x27;s another product in this list that I&#x27;ll tell you about that we&#x27;ll you&#x27;ll definitely understand all right number four number four anti-gravity what yep that&#x27;s not that&#x27;s on Willy Wonka the soda yeah you drink the soda the lifting pop and you burp and it lets you back down yes they won&#x27;t let him make that nope both the Germans during World War II and a scientist named Thomas Townsen Brown developed forms of anti-gravity discs the effects were so impressive that they were classified as top secret to be later developed more thoroughly and used on military personnel in the utmost secrecy uh used by military Personnel not on military personnel uh there is a present day rumor that the B2 stealth bomber is in fact using an electrogravity propulsion system in addition to the primary twin General Electric lowprofile engines during the war time back in World War II a number of eyewitness accounts in London New York and Prague reported Strang looking bell-shaped flying objects having mil German military cross insignias traveling at very high speeds yeah this was the uh the Nazi Flying Saucer mhm thing Theory things yep so all of that was either you know absorbed by the government or governments or it could be a hoax just saying that there&#x27;s no twist I don&#x27;t have hoaxes on you know out of these or fake ones gotcha these are all potential I&#x27;ve heard of something but I don&#x27;t know much about it I&#x27;ve heard of this but I don&#x27;t know much about it though I know that they they tried to do like flying saucer type vehicles that just didn&#x27;t well no no pun intent but they just didn&#x27;t take off so electrogravitic propulsion system that&#x27;s essentially essentially the system that they&#x27;re using all right moving on number three number have you ever heard of Father pelino Maria ernetti you ever heard of that guy before no he invented something called the pel No No he invented something called the chronovisor have you ever heard of this uh something to do with time yeah yeah pretty much all right so this father father ernetti an Italian priest claim claimed in the 1960s to have invented what he called the chronovisor something that allowed him to witness Christ&#x27;s crucifixion the device supposedly enabled viewers to watch any event in human history by tuning to the remnant vibrations that are caused by every action his team of researchers and Builders also included enrio fery who worked on the first atomic bomb um unsurprisingly conspiracy theorists say that the Vatican is now likely the owner of the original chronovisor and that sprung into what could have been a side top 10 list what what the the Vatican owns as copyright or patent ownership now for seizing for their you know their religious beliefs or for whatever Vatican owns has thousands and thousands of things in their safes D they got they got more secret [ __ ] than like I don&#x27;t know than what ever had that you think has a lot of secret [ __ ] Vatican like nuts man they have like their own like CIA they have their own like Men In Black have you ever see the movie what was the movie with Tom Hanks wasn&#x27;t it Tom Hanks dinin yeah the D Vinci c one that followed it up was What Angels and Demons or something one of them he went into the Vatican safe down underneath Vatican City what was you know Hollywood of course but he was supposed to portray what Vatican City safes would would possibly look like and some of the unbelievable things that they have in there everything from like the ark could be in there to yep like whole uh stories of the Bible chapters of the Bible that aren&#x27;t released and the notoriously famous alien stuff to all kinds of crazy the notoriously famous uh Jesus&#x27;s actual inscriptions yeah in the uh what movie was that where the Stigmata where the girl you know gets all the Stigmata and you know whatever sure K she was gorgeous in that movie here go ahead at the end of the movie they say that you know the the original writings of Jesus were discovered and the Catholic uh religion denounces them as being the original writings but ironically they keep them in the Vatican vaults right right there&#x27;s things like what said on it right yeah well essentially the rumor is that it said that churches to be had inside each man not inside structure and that&#x27;s the biggest problem always thought that well that&#x27;s the biggest problem with the Catholic Church to the Catholic Church you go body is the temple you go to the church that&#x27;s in the Bible they would lose their livelihood if that was actually to hang out with people who believe the same thing as you so you can all like have a party together so it&#x27;s like AA for God yes oh right the whole point of church is to be around like-minded people but for you to be religious is all on your own it&#x27;s personal so that&#x27;s the way I kind of see it anyway now the Catholics have different views though than a lot of traditional you know Christianity perspectives you can go to hell for getting a divorce damn right but Jesus still loves me and Jesus says you should do it in the butt what does that song go how does that song go have you heard this tack sounds familiar sounds like a thing for a different show it&#x27;s yeah that&#x27;s a good point maybe maybe I&#x27;ll strike that comment all right all right moving right along number two Miracle cancer cure so we&#x27;re back to cancer so far we&#x27;ve had cancer twice now we&#x27;ve had automobiles twice now yeah um so rightn this is in 2001 Nova scotian Rick Simpson discovered that a cancerous spot on his skin disappeared with a few days within a few days of applying an essential oil made from marijuana said going just the other direction since then Simpson and others have treated thousands of cancer patients with Incredible success researchers in Spain have confirmed that the THC an active compound in marijuana kills not not just helps but or reduces but kills brain tumor cells and human subjects and shows promise with breast pancreatic and liver tumors the US Food and Drug Administration however classifies marijuana as a schedule one drug meaning that it has no accepted medical use unlike scheduled Two drugs like cocaine and methanamine which may provide medical benefits well this is an ongoing debate in the you know Legalize It community that especially here in Florida medicinal marijuana is very obviously helping people and curing people of certain things my mother&#x27;s had skin cancer for years and years and if she could just use some topical solution to help get rid of a a skin cancer breakout Jesus that would be fantastic that would be amazing just smoke weed man smoke weed every day smoke weed every day smoke two joints in the morning very good get us another one so we got Snoop Dog no that wasn&#x27;t Snoop Dog that I did uh Dr Dre is Dre when I get high oh when I get high when I get high then I punch a girl in the face seen that video afan dumbass anyway go all right and number one number one we are wrapping up this top 10 list with your original reference the water car but it&#x27;s not really just a car number one is water engine engine that runs on water electrolysis that&#x27;s right uh I&#x27;m trying to find this guy&#x27;s full name I just have Meer maybe it&#x27;s in the article okay Meyer invented a car that ran on water instead of conventional fossil fuels or gasoline the car was able to travel from New York to Los Angeles on 22 gallons of water the engine system was fitted with a fuel cell that was able to split water into components hydrogen and oxygen they burnt hydrogen was the the burnt hydrogen was the fuel source used to generate the necessary energy to power the car with such energetic sustainability Meyer&#x27;s invention could have made a revolutionary contribution to our planet&#x27;s environment and economy if the full specifications of his work had been allowed to be published we&#x27;d all be using his technology today there&#x27;s that&#x27;s hands down Bar None no question and the exhaust is oxygen oxygen is the exhaust that&#x27;s right so you&#x27;re only helping the environment you&#x27;re not hurting it Meer turned down the offer for how much money for his invention how much do you think $1 Bob we damn it we got a dollar um uh 2 billion uh you actually Andrew&#x27;s closer $1 billion so my Meer turned down an offer of a billion dollars to hand over the rights to his patents for his refusal it had been said that he was murdered for his profit having died from uranium poison uh having died of uranium poison he was too much of a financial threat uh to the ruling Elites conventional oil industry and its uh prochemical derivatives so essentially big oil is conspiracy theor to have killed this guy uranium poisoning come on how do you even get did he take his invention with him um I it doesn&#x27;t the article didn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m trying to remember the story I thought like he was just about to sign a deal with the government and then he died and I forget what the deal was with the patent on it basically I think the guy who did this top 10 list would have looked that part up huh well I mean we just talked about this like last week and try remember the rest of it though but I don&#x27;t know what happened yeah you weren&#x27;t here so you know I didn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know if that was last week or not Andrew remember talking to me about something regarding inventions um last week or the week before two days ago or just two days ago it was this morning I remember in the fourth grade we all to come up with inventions in our class to share M and I got a pretty bad grade on mine cuz they thought mine was just too stupid and not needed and I wanted to invent a radio that had a screen on it that would tell you who sang what songs when the song came on it would tell you who sang it who didn&#x27;t and then you could push a button to go to the beginning of the song in case you turn on the radio was the middle of it and everyone thought it was so stupid my teacher did Stanley you should call her and say oh remember me yeah I me Shazam he was actually the wrestling coach so that&#x27;s why he didn&#x27;t like redheads oh [ __ ] but it was a racism thing I bet so this guy&#x27;s name by the way was Stanley Meyer so I&#x27;m looking up his uh his the Wiki page on him right now to find out where his patent sits probably in the na Vatican the na Vatican did you say the na Vatican the vaans moving to Nevada I don&#x27;t think he was Catholic so here&#x27;s the aftermath on his patents Myers patents have expired his inventions are now in the public domain available for all to use without restriction or royalty payment despite this no engine or Vehicle Manufacturer has incorporated Meyer&#x27;s work H looks like we have a project ahead where where&#x27;s Elon Musk is no [ __ ] well cool so those were the top inventions that I thought we&#x27;re interesting enough to bring up for our top 10 list what a great list I learned a lot that&#x27;s pretty cool yeah do you guys like it do you like it Andrea mhm did you yeah it was great all right it was great it was great um so you got next week unless we get a guest in but you got the next host driven one and I have you have a teaser I don&#x27;t know let me look at my notes real quick wait maybe uh I have something in here Andrea do you want to put another one together and host one again okay Yours by the way yours still holds the number one download for the most single day downloads of the Twisted 10 that&#x27;s cuz it was so great it was pretty good you&#x27;ve got some supporters and fans your friends really click the button a lot that&#x27;s cuz I love my friends and they love me okay I&#x27;m not maybe I&#x27;ll do this topic okay this teaser I&#x27;m going to give may change I may change the topic but let me just think of something here I took George Carlin&#x27;s uh Seven Deadly words into celebrity arrests so you have some pretty good flexibility on how far you can take your your topic okay it just going to have something to do don&#x27;t take any guesses this is pretty broad so think crystal ball crystal ball that&#x27;s it all right I told you not to guess not to take guesses uh before we get out of here T I wanted to just give a quick plug to the uh Orlando tragedy the pulse tragedy indeed there is a GoFundMe set up by a 501c3 nonprofit organization uh for the Florida for Florida it&#x27;s the state&#x27;s leading lgbtq civil rights organization uh the GoFundMe is gofundme.com pulse victims fund and uh it&#x27;s also the website for them is eqf .org so any money raised there goes to that organization and they help uh directly help the pulse tragedy families victims families etc etc so please help our our local community down here in Florida out by going to visit that site indeed all right thank you you want to get out of here uh yeah let&#x27;s get out of here all right so check us out at facebook.com thetwistedstory you can also hit us up on Twitter at the Twisted did you just
