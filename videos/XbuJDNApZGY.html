            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>our own Scott Schneider up   here  for the first time  on   Chicago.  live. Thank you  so much for coming  up.  I know  you&#x27;re  getting ready  for the 4 oclock. Um, but you  have  something maybe even   bigger  that  you are uh   getting ready to  release.</p>
<p>  So  there&#x27;s a documentary,   the age of  discovery.  that   so  many  people  I mean   when  you talk about   something that&#x27;s  much   anticipated,  so many people   have been talking about this   and you got to  talk  to  the  Mind  behind  it. Yeah, the  filmmaker.  um, first of all,  pleasure  to  be  with  you  for the first time  I&#x27;ve   been  looking forward to   this. Um, so  just  let me   give  you a little  bit of  a  backstory.</p>
<p> Um, I think we   all as  journalists have   passion Pursuits, long   before  I ever  knew  I was  going to  do  this, and  I&#x27;ve been doing it  for over   30  years.  Um, I was told  a  story by  my  grandparents,  my  grandparents   my grandmother  and my   great-grandmother,  lived  about a block apart uh, in   Northern  California. okay?  And they  told  me  a tale.  um, of a UFO  encounter,  and  what  was unique  about it,  Anita was the specifics, uh,   they  told  me  the story.   of  1 another I was very   curious about it  and I asked  for a specific details  of   each  of  them  and the story  they  told  me  was  remarkable  and what  they   saw was not uh, a swing  saucer  but a rectangle,  a  dark  rectangle,  in the   middle  of  the night that   made  no  sound.</p>
<p> Uh, it   made  absolutely. had no   thrust. It  was dead   silent. It  hovered above  them. a a small window   opened  up.</p>
<p>They  saw some   sort  of  beings  in the   window. and then  in  an   instant,  it  disappeared  before  Their Eyes. What   year  was this? This  was  probably  in  the,  in  the  80s.  Okay? okay, And they   both  saw the very  same.  they  saw the very  same   thing and I carried that   with  me  and I&#x27;ve, I&#x27;ve   carried it  with  me  through  the entirety of my  career   And I&#x27;ve been 1 of those   people  that  I&#x27;ve  always   wanted  to  know  the truth  because I&#x27;ve  always  felt   like  as  Americans uh  as   human beings.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve always   been  treated as  children   on  this  front.  That  the  governments not only  of   this  country but of   countries around  the world  have  been  keeping 1 of the   greatest  secrets of   humanity. uh  from  us  Did  they  know  more  than  what   they  know  more  than  what   they&#x27;re releasing.  So  here   we  come  with  the age of   disclosure  uh, I had an   opportunity to  speak to  Dan  Farah the filmmaker and he   unlike  movies  of  the past   documentaries of the  past,  um, he  the the the  weight of his guests. uh, of   the people  that  he  got to   speak to  him.</p>
<p> Um, the  Secretary of  State Marco  Rubio,  uh, Christine  Kristen gilleran  senator,   who is  on  um, the  intelligence  committee um,  uh  former  Naval aviator uh,  Air Force personnel.   Secretary of  Defense.  Um,  to  admit that  the  government  has not only,  been  hiding  the truth from   us. but offering  specific   details.  And a lot of  this   Anita comes from  what  you.</p>
<p>  And I and the media and other  journalists have  been   reporting for.  Several years  now,  And that  is  the  existence of  what  we  call   Uaps  this  unidentified. Um,  aerial  phenomenon  or   Anonymous phenomenal, uh,  phenomenon. And what  makes  these different from  the  UFOs  that  our mom and dads,  And our grandparents, uh,  these are not your  mom and  dad&#x27;s flying  saucers.  These  are um, objects first and  foremost, that  do  things   that  our technology  is   nowhere near  capable  of doing.</p>
<p>So, for example,   we  talked  about observables  Yeah. Um, Hypersonic   velocity our fastest. planes   known to  man can do  4,000  miles an hour.  These things   are doing 40,000  miles  an hour and I guess the  thought would be  It, it   doesn&#x27;t have to be. an   alien.</p>
<p> It  could be   surveillance  we  don&#x27;t know   we  don&#x27;t know  with  100%.  certainty what  it  is. That   said  there&#x27;s a caveat  there  but but let me  also  say  other things  that  they  can  do. instantaneous.   acceleration.</p>
<p>So, similar to   what  the story I told  you  about what  my  my   grandparents. uh  talked   about with  their own  encounter.  at  a standstill   and then  taking  off.  at   the blink of  an  eye.  We   don&#x27;t have  that  technology.</p>
<p> So  what  happened  was uh,  thanks  to  whistleblowers.  in  particular  A man named  Lou alzando Who is  prominent  in  this  documentary.  he   and others  became  part of a  task  force,  right?  And  what  they  did was they   started uh, looking taking  a  good  hard  look  at  a lot  of  the video that  was taken  from  very  credible  sources  again.  Navy  Pilots  who  have  long  said   that they have seen Things.  And they  were  afraid  to   speak out because there&#x27;s  long  been  a stigma, you  know, we  talked  about this   tinfoil hat.</p>
<p> Society.  Those  of us that  want  to  believe  but we&#x27;re afraid  we&#x27;re  going to  be  criticized  if   we  talk  about it  out loud.  I I&#x27;ve  encountered it  in   my  career  talking to   intelligent people  that   kind of roll their  eyes   saying  sure  Scott,   whatever  you say.  But the  the conversation  the  Narrative has really  changed  in  recent  years and what   they  found out these  individuals who are part of  who task  force,  is  that   since the 1940s there&#x27;s been   something in  our government   called  The Legacy  program.   this  is  at  the Crux   of this documentary.</p>
<p> This   is  why I urge  people   streaming right now.  Um,  it&#x27;s  also  in  Select   theaters  to  if  if  you  have  even  a passing  interest  in  what&#x27;s  going  on, with  this  possibility  that  we  are not alone  in the  universe, watch this   film  because it  is  not a  whole Congressional hearing  where,  you know, you&#x27;re   kind of like  and they   called these  whistleblowers   And they&#x27;ve talked  about the  fact  that  there is  within   the government. Um,  the shadow organization that   has been  actively, uh,  involved  in  a cold  war,   Anita right now.  with  China  with  Russia. and what   they&#x27;ve done  and it, it&#x27;s   absolutely  it  is   Sensational but there is   there is  evidence  with   regard  to  what  these  people  have  seen.</p>
<p>These are  people  who were  contracted   by  the US  government. to   conduct these investigations.  crashed.  Um, uh, crafts.  that  Have  then  been   collected.</p>
<p> these are exotic.  crafts, They&#x27;ve been   collected.  secretly. and  then  their technology  has  been  reversed. engineered.</p>
<p> Oh  okay. And again,  this   is  I know  it  sounds   crazy.  but the fact  that   it  is  being kept, top  secret, even  from  United   States, senators, from   congressman,  from   presidents, And the reason   is, so  they  have  plausible  deniability because people   has have  said  why wouldn&#x27;t   Donald  Trump because we  all  know  Donald  Trump is a is a  Straight  shooter.  Why  wouldn&#x27;t  he  come  out and  say yes?  there are aliens.  We  are not alone and I guess  the thought would be  if  1  person  is  saying  it, maybe  maybe it&#x27;s  crazy.</p>
<p> But  again,  you have  a list  of   people  who are all kind  of   corroborating.   know there&#x27;s something.  There&#x27;s something we  haven&#x27;t  been  told  again if  you can  actually  measurable  have  a  measurable  item. that  you  can have  in  hand  and then   kind of go  back  and work   it  as  to  how it  was in   the sky.  You can&#x27;t really   say it&#x27;s  crazy.</p>
<p> There&#x27;s  something to it If  we go  back  to  the war World War  II  and the Manhattan Project  that  was a race. Race  for  world domination. And we   were  fortunate that  the  United  States, We  won that   war.  We  were  the first to   develop a nuclear weapon  and  it  changed the course  of   mankind because we  dropped  the bomb  on  Japan.  they   surrendered.</p>
<p> Um, and it   gave  us  a leg up, of   course  Now we are  not the  only  nuclear power but  imagine imagine that  this   power this  technology  that   we  are seeing  play  out  this  ability,  um, not only   to  Create  speeds  also   these I need of these crafts.  they  can uh, create  speeds   underwater  that  we  don&#x27;t  have  the ability to, they   can go  from  space to   are to  underwater. this  is   documented. We  have  these  uh, images. on  film  that   have  been  examined  by  by   physicists  by  scientists.</p>
<p> Okay. But now imagine some of  the other things  that  they   have  been  documented   doing,  They  they  have   hovered over  Naval bases  over  installations that  Are  nuclear and what   they&#x27;ve done  is. in, in   1 case  in  Montana,   there were  20  or  so   nuclear.  missiles. They   disabled  they  were   hovering  over  them.</p>
<p>and,   and real  quick,  just  so   for me  personally, again,   going back  to  that  story.   I was told  a large  rectangular black object. was  hovering  over. a nuclear  facility. and it  disabled   20  nuclear warheads.</p>
<p> There was no, there was no   contact.  It  didn&#x27;t   actually  touch the ground.  It  did so  literally by   hovering  over  this  base.  So  now imagine it  it  it   just  follow along  with  me,  just  for a second. If  you  are the country.</p>
<p> that  can  harness that  technology,  whether it  be  by  speed,   by, uh, the ability to   disable.  somebody&#x27;s  nuclear  weapons.  you now are the  world,  dominating  power  going forward,  right?  Which  is  why it  makes perfect  sense.  that  this  is   happening.  in  secret  that   the US  doesn&#x27;t want  Russia   to  know  what  we&#x27;re doing.</p>
<p>  China doesn&#x27;t want  us  to   know  what  they&#x27;re doing and  it  is  a it  is  an  arms   race. Like  we&#x27;ve never seen   before. Well, even  if  you  take, um, the uh, the Or   there&#x27;s so much conversation   this  week  even  about  Ukraine and Russia, but if   you take  what  we  saw and  say,  World War II, the the  type  of  um, the the type of  interaction.  that  2  countries would have. in  war  versus  what  we&#x27;re seeing   now.</p>
<p> with  say,  you know,  there was a moment  when   Ukraine sent  in  drones  in,  Russia, didn&#x27;t  know  they   were  in  their airspace,  you know, boom, boom, boom,  boom, boom. All of  a sudden,  you know, they&#x27;re like, wait,  what&#x27;s  going on? So  this   is  like  on  a totally  different level.  but  something of  that  sort. It   it  is. It&#x27;s  the same.</p>
<p> conversation  but with  a  technology  that  we  are  just  not in  we  of  and to   your  earlier point about  whether or not  it  is.  in fact,  alien they  there  was a hearing they  brought  in  whistleblowers, who said   they  had observed, what   they  call. non-human.   biologics.  And what  they   are saying  is  they   witnessed um, other worldly  beings  and the bodies of  other worldly beings  that   they  are somewhere,  there,   uh, they&#x27;re in  a  non-disclosed area  but that   the US  has them  that   Russia  has them, that  China  has them, at  least that&#x27;s   what  we  know.</p>
<p>Uh, that&#x27;s   been  leaked  out by   whistleblowers. Thank  goodness  for the  whistleblowers  and another  thing too I I know  we  don&#x27;t  have  a lot of  time  left   but there is  something.   called  the UAP disclosure   Act.  and it  is  languishing  in  Congress  right now.  and  what  they  are.</p>
<p> All the the  the the Congress  people  who  are behind  it. including  Christian Gill  of  brand and  some  others  is  they are   all they  are asking, is   that  stop  treating. the  American  citizens, by the   way,  a recent  Pew,  survey   found that  2 and 3 Americans  believe that  we are  not  alone in the  universe.  Right,  right. Right.</p>
<p>And we   want  answers.  We  just   want  the truth.  Don&#x27;t lie  to  us. Um, this  act would  require the government  to   not keep  secret  what  they   know. about.</p>
<p> the  possibility.  That  what  we   are seeing. are not,  in   fact, Earthly made  Vehicles.  Yeah. And they, because the  defense contractors real   quick,  the defense  contractors,  who have  all  the money invested   especially  in  this  reverse  engineering.</p>
<p> right?  They   control the purse strings,   and Made  Lobby.  And  there are a handful of   congressmen.  who will  not  let this  bill  the UAP  disclosure  Act.  It  it  had  some  momentum  back  in   about 2022, but it has   since stalled.  Donald  Trump  has said  he  would sign  it   but it  we  needed  to get   to  his desk, okay? But it&#x27;s   not even  getting to  him,   it&#x27;s  not even  getting to   him.</p>
<p> Um, I talked  to  Dan  Farah about whether or not   he&#x27;s  convinced after putting  this  documentary together   and this  has been  a,   you know, a passion project  for years for him.  Um, there  are some  things  he  can&#x27;t  even  tell  us. um, but he   is  absolutely  And the whole  thing is  about making  sure.  Everyone  knows everything.  How is  he  saying?  Because some of its  classified  some  of   its classified.</p>
<p>Um, I have  I  have  a 20  minute   conversation  with  him,   it&#x27;s  going to be on  Fox  local.  we  just  need  to   edit  it  and I encourage  you to  watch it. uh, because  it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s  a fascinating  conversation. But,  um, he   is  convinced after,  uh,  everyone  that  he&#x27;s  spoken   to. that.</p>
<p>not only  are we   not alone.  there are  multiple  civilizations.   that  have  been  here. that   we  this  our universe  is  a  is  a is  a shared neighbor.   for,  for lack  of  a better   term.</p>
<p>And,  um, he&#x27;s   absolutely  convinced of  it   and 1, more thing he   believes  that  by  virtue of  this  film, the age of   disclosure, he  believes   that  at some point.  a  sitting president will  stand  at  a Podium  and tell  the  American  people. We  are not  alone in  the universe  and  does  he  say how long  he   thinks? will, before  we  get  to  that? That&#x27;s  the million  dollar  question? Yeah. So   he  has not said  that  but  he  believes  it  will   happen. sooner  rather  than   later.</p>
<p>  Okay. Very interesting  now  did having  the conversation   with  him.  change. Anything   for you for me  personally.  And I and I told  him this,  um, I,  again,  I go  back   to, you know, Kaplan  and I  my  Kaplan, uh, from  Good   Day Chicago.</p>
<p> We  would have   these great debates on  GDC,   on  you having  a debate   with  mike  gap?  He&#x27;s  Mr.  It&#x27;s  oh  it&#x27;s  it&#x27;s  it&#x27;s  a  trick of  the light.   know. You don&#x27;t know  what   you&#x27;re talking  about.   There&#x27;s no  aliens.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re  alone in  the universe  and  I&#x27;ve had  this  conversation.  with  so many people  even   learned it  individuals,  who  were  so  quick to  dismiss  me, and I would joke  with   people, I&#x27;m a card  carrying   member  of  the royal order  of  tinfoil hats, you know.  And,  and for me, I&#x27;m  watching  this  this  film   Anita,  and I&#x27;m thinking  to   myself, at at at  the very   least,  this  documentary  puts  to  rest  the notion   that  we are  crazy.  that   those of  us  who believe,   because I&#x27;ve  always  found  it, arrogant  to  think,  you  really  think that  with   trillions of  galaxies, that   we  are the only  ones  we   are the chosen. Yeah, right.</p>
<p>  And and and I get why it   would be  a secret  because  can you imagine the impact?  psychologically?  sociology?   Even  theologically if some  new for an  absolute fact  that  we  are not the sole   beings  in the  universe.  that  would Shake.  us  to   our core. Well  and I guess  that&#x27;s  a part  of  the  argument  in  terms,  I&#x27;m  sure  over  the years has  been  a part of the argument   not to  release like  how how  much  can the American   public  take  Right,   you know  uh, before  before   it  kind of you know, shifts   quite a bit,  right?  And and  going back  to  1947 when  they  created the CIA.  part   of  the reason  that  it  is   believed  by  some  that   they  did.</p>
<p> So, was because  you can&#x27;t they  part of,  um,  the Legacy  program is  under  the uh  guys  of the  CIA.   the department  of  energy.  Um, and defense contractors  part  of  the reason  that   they  didn&#x27;t  tell  the  public  then  was because  what  were  you going to   say,  Anita.  Yes,  we  found  aliens. Yes their technology   is  better  than  ours.</p>
<p> There&#x27;s nothing we  can do.  We&#x27;re helpless. Do  you  really  want  to  tell  the  American  public  That   there&#x27;s somebody  out there  that  could?  you know,  enslave us  at  any time,  Take  us  over  and there&#x27;s  nothing we  can do  well   and then  there&#x27;s another  aspect  of  it  that  that   goes  into  uh, National   Security. as  well. Um,  you know, in  terms of  how  much  you can say,   especially  if  it, if  it   ties  back  to  something  else.</p>
<p>Um, you know  what?  What  are the risks for  National  Security  That  may  prevent it  be  from  being  released  well  and think all  I can say is, if  you get a  chance  to  see the film  and  again it  is  streaming thank  goodness  for whistleblowers   if  we  didn&#x27;t  have   whistleblowers. we  would  have  not have  this  film.  We  would not have  the  information that  we  have,  and it  is  overwhelming. I  know  you and I we  are in  a  truth base, a fact-based   business. Um, and a lot of   this, you,  you could say,   Oh, it&#x27;s  circumstantial.</p>
<p>But  when  in  1 instance, uh, an   investigator  went  to  a  base  when  10 people are  interviewed,  and they  all  describe  the same  thing in   in  we  have to assume  that   that&#x27;s  pretty  credible.  Well,  Scott Schneider, thank you.  for sharing your  passion  with  us. Go  quite clearly.   your  passion.</p>
<p> uh  and and I  know  that  people  are going  to  go  see uh  this  film   but definitely  go  to  Fox  local.  So  you can check out  this  interview it&#x27;s  always   good  to  see like  the  makings of  a film, you know,  the Mind  behind  it. how the  science came  together. So   thank you so  much  for  coming  upstairs. Come  back   anytime.</p>
<p> All right,   we&#x27;ll see you at  4:00   everybody.  It&#x27;s  2:58. We&#x27;ll  be  right back. </p>
