            <p>rise and shine YouTubers because today we&#x27;ll be talking about half-life&#x27;s greatest tool in my opinion the gravity gun [Music] now the gravity gun is kind of simple and also complex in it that you get you have this device that can attract heavy objects to you as though they were light and then repel them very quickly the boys have black minks that do seem like they know what they&#x27;re doing and don&#x27;t want to tell anyone but I think we can figure out how it works on March 18th 1905 Thomas Thompson Brown was born he would later develop something known as electrogovidics through his patterns and project be an experimentation he found the capacitors which are electrical components consisted of two parallel plates usually there&#x27;s an insulated material known as a dielectric in between he found that when you apply high voltage to it they can produce a thrust it feels asymmetrical it can produce even more thrust now strangely enough he claimed that there was a connection between this thrust with gravity as everything by the name electrographytics there are Skeptics who claim otherwise saying it&#x27;s just ionic wind however there are three sources that provide evidence against that claim according to calculations the ionic winds that would theoretically come from that Thruster would be far too small to two thousand Brown claim that it was their vacuum and three that Thruster would produce even more thrust if the dielectric was heavier so what does this have to do with the gravity bar well let&#x27;s just say hypothetically that t Townsend Brown did discover this connection between electricity and gravity that&#x27;s using Chargers on certain masses in certain ways one could control the gravitational force upon it kind enough to make sense for the gravity gun because if we look closely at the at environment things it releases a high voltage part to create visual pulsive Force furthermore it reminds me of this report by a Russian guy whose name I can&#x27;t pronounce explain how using a high voltage spark and superconductivity one can produce an anti-gravity beam or repulsive gravitational beam let me guess if I were to make a hypothesis on how the gravity count would work in real life it would look like this diagram you would have this beam emitter that&#x27;s repulsive to fire the device but you also have these little nodes that can attract matter with a positively charged electrical antenna of sorts thank you all and I hope you have a good day</p>
