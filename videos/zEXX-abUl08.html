            <p>[Music] we live in a vast sea of energy everything every atom every subatomic particle is in constant motion spinning eternally even in the cold dark absolute vacuum of empty space there exists what new physics is calling the quantum vacuum flux it is the ether of the Ancients the life force energy of metaphysics are the random fluctuations of this vast field of potential in which space and time are embedded now theoretically and mathematically proven the question no longer is does this zero-point energy exist but rather can we tap this inexhaustible resource of free and unlimited energy and manifests new technologies which are both inexpensive and environmentally safe one thing is certain if we continue on the course of rapidly burning fossil fuels and relying on nuclear fission the future of our civilization is in grave jeopardy we&#x27;re at a critical juncture where the ravages of industrial pollution and radioactive waste have exceeded the carrying capacity of Mother Earth our finite reserves of oil and gas will be completely exhausted by the year 2025 at the present rate of consumption large corporate and governmental self-interest ignore this pending crisis and resist change to the status quo the question must be asked is this the kind of world we want to pass down to future generations [Music] emerging on the frontiers of science a pioneering breed of theoretical physicist and inspired inventors are challenging the way we think about harnessing the unseen forces of nature despite ridicule lack of funding and outright suppression they are confronting an outmoded classical worldview and ushering in a monumental Scientific Revolution in this program you will witness the groundbreaking work of tireless inventors and visionary scientists who may hold the keys to true energy independence for every person on earth from Nikola Tesla to the reality of cold fusion and beyond join us as we present free energy the race to zero point [Music] most people would agree you can&#x27;t get something for nothing there&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch and yet we get our oxygen free from the air we breathe we get sunlight free and water that used to be free until bottled drinking water came along but what about energy we&#x27;ve always had to pay for that whether it&#x27;s wood or coal oil or electricity it&#x27;s always been the rule that you can never get back more energy than what you put in in the first place that&#x27;s a fundamental law of nature physicist of the 19th century figured that out with the first law of thermodynamics the conservation of energy maybe so but science has come a long way since then and laws well there&#x27;s never been one that hasn&#x27;t been broken [Music] at the turn of the last century Nikola Tesla the great inventor who gave us alternating current and the Tesla coil stated electric power is everywhere present in unlimited quantities I can drive the world&#x27;s machinery without the need of coal oil gas or any other tools this new power for the driving to the world machinery will be derived from the energy which separates the world the cosmic energy with over 200 patents to his name Tesla was well on his way to transmitting electric power without wires when he ran into trouble with JP Morgan and a financial interest of 1901 his ambitious Wardenclyffe project to magnify and transmit power to ships at sea and eventually to provide free electricity for the whole world the scuttled by Morgan leaving Tesla pennants and disillusioned the wealthy industrialists of the time knew that their vast plans to wire the world with copper from the mines Lyon would be upset if they could no longer control the supply and means of delivery Tesla&#x27;s beliefs about developing technology and harmony with nature conflicted with the prevailing American attitude at the time that mankind is put on earth to subdue and dominate nature little by little Tesla was denounced as a crackpot and deleted from the historical record at the time of his death in 1943 Tesla&#x27;s truckloads of scientific papers were seized by US government agencies who knows what ideas of remarkable devices our world could have inherited if only his genius was recognized when JP Morgan prohibited Tesla from broadcasting electric power overseas with Wardenclyffe tower he said I can&#x27;t put a meter on it therefore I won&#x27;t finance it that literally changed the course of history and for the past almost 100 years we&#x27;ve been suffering under that profit motive of course one could say that mankind was hardly ready to handle the awesome force Tesla had glimpse the 20th century would bring world wars and technological innovations far more horrific than ever been witnessed by Western civilization even before Tesla the groundwork that would lead to free energy had been pioneered by great scientists like Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell in 1831 Faraday modeled his rotating magnet and dis generator after the earth whose rotation around a molten metal core keeps the planet spinning in a self-sustaining magnetic field his work later resulted in the development of the Dynamo also called a homopolar or unipolar generator the Faraday generator provides the basis for much of what is being done today in the electromagnetic approach to free energy such as with Bruce De Palma&#x27;s in machine and Paramahamsa Tiwari&#x27;s space power generator repeated experiments have detected anomalous electrical outputs greater than that used to rotate the disk the friction and voltage limitations have hampered efficiency and therefore widespread acceptance James Clerk Maxwell best known for his Maxwell&#x27;s equations is reputed to have set things straight with his theories of electrical properties in a way that eliminates zero-point energy but Maxwell&#x27;s more advanced work allowed for the existence a substance finer than air which since the time Plato had been considered a scientific fact well the prevailing belief of the time was that the vacuum was a thin material fluid the so called material ether which we know today is false the ether is there but it&#x27;s not the observable material fluid farad II had re-established this notion of lines of force but he thought the electromagnetic field or the electromagnetic disturbances in the ether so to speak was really twanging strings the strings were under tension and when you had a disturbance what you really did was pluck the strings now Maxwell states very clearly that he set about to actually capture exactly what Faraday was doing in his lines of force in the theory and that&#x27;s what he did Maxwell&#x27;s actual theory is 20 equations and 20 on unknowns in quaternions which is a higher topology algebra you can do things in that you can&#x27;t dream of in doing in tensors and you certainly can&#x27;t do in vectors and you certainly can&#x27;t do with the theory that started our universities all that remains to be rediscovered and uncovered the now-famous Mickelson Morley experiment at the turn of the century failed to detect a stationary ether so classical physics presumed once and for all that it did not exist the case was closed until quantum mechanics reopened the discussion allowing for a new interpretation of how matter interacts with a zero-point field most of our scientific community actually believes that empty space the nature of space itself is completely empty devoid of anything and historically it&#x27;s very interesting because in the 1800s and even earlier they believe there was an ether an all pervading substance filling up space and in 1905 when relativity theory became very popular they said well we don&#x27;t need this either it&#x27;s completely empty space is empty then 25 years or 20 years later in 1925 when quantum mechanics comes into play all of a sudden a new energy appears in equations of quantum mechanics and it has to be there to make the equations work and it has to it has to do with fluctuations of electro magnetic field energy at a very high frequency that interacts with everything and they called this two zero-point energy and it turns out that all the elementary particles interact with this energy and it becomes a potential energy source that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re discovering today well free energy is basically in another word for it as zero-point energy it&#x27;s an energy that is contained within the vacuum of space and which is virtually undetectable by any traditional means in fact the energy is homogeneous and isotropic the same everywhere are the same in all directions and because of that it&#x27;s trying to extract it or measure it it&#x27;s sort of like the problem of trying to weigh a beaker of water underneath the surface of the ocean what do you measure with respect to what and that&#x27;s been the physicists dilemma and we&#x27;ve gone down one very large cul-de-sac this century the cul de sac meaning that there is no such thing as consciousness there is no such thing as this zero-point field or this this place from which the energy can come and the answer now appears to be yes because theoretical physics and a number of experiments and quantum mechanics show very clearly the existence of this this all pervasive electromagnetic field called the zero-point field in fact although skeptics often point to Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity it was Einstein who in 1920 said there are 80 arguments to be adduced in favor of the ether hypothesis to deny the ether is ultimately to assumes that empty space has no physical qualities whatsoever the fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize Fitz&#x27;s view according to its a general theory of relativity space is endowed with physical qualities in this sense therefore there exists an ISA according to the general theory of relativity space without ether is unsinkable the term vacuum has been used in several totally different senses some engineers use it to me and you just pump out all the air and that&#x27;s called a vacuum and that&#x27;s vacuum technology that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about we&#x27;re talking about empty space time we know today for example the lamb shift in quantum mechanics showed that this exchange of energy between the vacuum and the charge particles is in fact real and generates real effects and you can measure it and he was given the Nobel Prize lambda laws for doing that kind of measurement and showing it in the physics literature so we know it&#x27;s real experimentally it&#x27;s detected the Casimir shell for example shows clearly that it&#x27;s there and it does generate energetic effects in your actual materials it turns out that in the modern view modern quantum mechanical view if you apply that knowledge that&#x27;s been gained there what you find is that the vacuum is fiercely active it&#x27;s a fierce energy flux and going all directions at all times the energy density of that as estimated by various physicists is extremely high for example in one cubic centimeter if you could take the raw energy in that cubic centimeter and condensed it into mass divided by C squared you would have more observable mass result from that then our largest telescope can see in the observable universe and all the stars and planets today and so the the energy that&#x27;s there is extremely dense and extremely fierce this drives everything that we call physical reality from the quantum level right on up to the observed level in the observed world that we live in everything is energetically driven by the vacuum [Music] the sea of energy in which the earth floats was a revolutionary book written by T Henry Moray an electrical engineer and Tesla enthusiast who in the early twenties began working on a device he claimed intercepted radiant energy from outer space his solid-state detector the Mori vow was designed with a complex series of semiconductors high-voltage capacitors and transformers hooked up to an antenna and a ground wire by stimulating the existing oscillations of space energy his radiant energy device ran for days putting out 50 kilowatts of electricity his public demonstrations attracted newspaper coverage in scientists from Bell Laboratories and the Department of Agriculture&#x27;s rural electrification administration although no one could find evidence of fraud neither could anyone explained how the radiant energy device worked during the 30s he developed semiconductors and transistors that were far ahead of their time unfortunately as all too many inventors have suffered when he refused to sell out to powerful interests Moray and his family were threatened shot at and the laboratory ransacked ignored by the US Patent Office more a quietly stopped public disclosure of the device after it was destroyed by his assistant Felix Pritchard a communist sympathizer was frustrated more a declined his repeated offers to take that technology to Russia today mores sons John and Richard continued to pursue their father&#x27;s dream in Europe viktor schauberger &#x27;he&#x27;s vortex experiments during the 1930s resulted in an advanced understanding of how the spiraling motions inherent in all natural systems reverse the effects of entropy by studying the properties of inwardly spiraling water he created an implosion generator that concentrated electrical charge viktor schauberger is one of my heroes who talked about a possible science based on the the inward motion rather than the let&#x27;s explode everything looking break it up and and study the atom by breaking it up into little pieces let&#x27;s study the atom by looking at how it wants to move naturally in a spiraling motion and the same with everywhere you look in nature Shaw burgers ideas became widely known before World War two when he was coerced to work for the Nazis an exotic disc that resembled flying saucers as well as his energy generator in 1958 he travelled to the United States where he was told he could manufacture his devices but it was duped into signing over all of his rights and none of his inventions were returning to Austria he died a bitter broken man visionary philosopher artists and scientists Walter Russell&#x27;s contributions to the understanding of energy are significant even though ignored by mainstream academia Russell&#x27;s revised periodical table of the elements based ona spiral predicted many unknown elements and isotopes like plutonium and deuterium his cosmological theories about the mystical nature of reality challenged physicists to think in terms of energy light and matter as one substance [Music] there&#x27;s electricity in the air it&#x27;s a common expression and one that&#x27;s true take a comb run it through your hair on a dry day and you can get a static shock sure it&#x27;s electricity all right but could it also be tapped to produce sufficient energy we could all you Benjamin Franklin is credited as being the inventor of the electrostatic motor back in the 1700s but its power output was modest the wim Hearst electrostatic generator is a high voltage mechanism developed in the 1800&#x27;s which can be hand ourselves started and will produce dramatic sparking while charging Leyden jars today it&#x27;s used in teaching about electricity but it&#x27;s practical applications are considered inconsequential a high tech variation of the Wimshurst device is the test attica our swiss ml converter developed by Paul Baumann of the maternity community in Switzerland during the seventies this free energy device is a marvel that has been an operation for more than 20 years supplying electricity to the small self-sufficient Christian community many technical experts have come away stumped by its excess output however because the community feels that the majority of mankind is not ready to be responsible for such unlimited energy they&#x27;re keeping the technology under wraps until such time the world is spiritually prepared other researchers like dr. oleg jeff amico continued to pursue real-world applications for harnessing the electrostatic motor his accomplishment I feel the best is that he used a specific type of electron which is a waxy substance which holds charge and it&#x27;s like a in many ways a magnet of electrical analogue of a magnet and he&#x27;s achieved a 0.1 horsepower motor which is a small device so and this runs continually on atmospheric electricity like the homopolar generator the electrostatic motor is based on the dynamics of our earth environment as with wind and solar power they offer real sustainable alternatives that with only modest gains and efficiency could contribute to the replacement of our current dependence on fossil fuels are we clever enough to learn from the clues our planet is providing upon the foundation of innovative thinkers and inventors like Tesla and Maury the modern age of free energy research begins 1950s as waves of flying saucer sightings occurred throughout the United States and while an infant space program was trying to catch up with the Russians launch of Sputnik a man named T Townsend Brown it was busy on experiments that defied conventional understanding about electricity gravitation and propulsion along with doctors Paul Fifield and Agnew Bahnson Brown took high voltage to the next extreme in this rare home movie the earliest experiments in electrogravitics are recorded [Music] by using high voltages over 20,000 and up to 200,000 volts Brown discovered that highly charged capacitors would exhibit a noticeable thrust in one direction although awarded a patent for his electro kinetic generator no one has ever reproduced his experiment until recently Larry Davenport shown here demonstrating his replication of Brown&#x27;s electro kinetic apparatus explains but when I first began to read Brown stuff I didn&#x27;t quite understand the difference between the ion wind devices which there&#x27;s a lot of them out there and some of them are very efficient as far as producing ion wind and his particular apparatus I finally decided to do Browns work in 1994 I looked at his device that I tried several different things and they hadn&#x27;t work and I thought well Brown is supposed to be the pioneer of this or so the people that make the claims in there that get the patents they always refer to his name so I thought I&#x27;d go back and I&#x27;ll try to do this getting it balanced was real important his method of propulsion specifically was using the charge separation high voltage charge separation on a vehicle he found that circular craft were better for that application than wing craft however recently we found through a dr. Palo violets research that the b-2 bomber actually seems to qualify as an electric orbiter craft the military has admitted that it electrically charges the forward leading edge of the wings there&#x27;s also a very high dielectric being used depleted uranium that&#x27;s used on the forward edge of the wings and whether or not there are other applications for that technology in that design we&#x27;re recognizing that because the exhaust gas is also negatively ini that all of a sudden we have the high voltage charge separation that&#x27;s necessary to provide an extra propulsive force especially at high velocities so electro gravity in that aspect has a very simple process but does provide a good amount of force for a very small amount of energy input as with many other promising inventions developed during the Cold War years the National Secrecy Act prevented scientists like T Townsend Brown from commercializing or even publicizing it any technology which could potentially be interpreted as having a military application the triumph of America&#x27;s space exploration program gave way to the era of limits in the late 70s the infamous energy crisis made us all aware of our dependence on finite resources many adventures promise dramatic results with devices they said would solve the crisis claims of over unity where power output exceeds input we routinely announce but when put to the test most of their crude prototypes perform poorly or not at all measuring methods were and still are extremely difficult to perform accurately the few that did achieve modest gains and output were dismissed by mainstream academia and denied patents and without patent protection investors have no financial incentive to lay out the millions of dollars it takes to mass-produce and market these devices no matter how promising the technology and after all classical Newtonian dynamics got us to the moon and Einstein&#x27;s e equals mc-squared explained that energy could neither be created nor destroyed anything else which seemed otherwise was labelled perpetual motion unworthy a scientific examination when I started out in 1980 if free energy was something that we didn&#x27;t talk about we talked about it under behind closed doors the conference&#x27;s often were visited by people we didn&#x27;t know and and the information was spread in various means so that all of a sudden unconventional energy which was a phrase we developed was appearing in military solicitations so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a controversial topic that at that time actually I had the connotation that there was something from nothing therefore it was unscientific and these are a bunch of lunatics for talking and sooner or later the scientists will educate them about what&#x27;s the various laws of physics that are being violated well most of the scientists equated any notion of a free energy or over-unity device as being a perpetual motion machine and therefore utter nonsense you see it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a play on words the scientists interpreted it one way the guy is trying to do it are looking at it as an open system now fortunately today we have a type of thermodynamics you know Nobel Prizes have been issued for it to prick a gene for example for systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium that do have their open systems and the energy does flow in from outside and through them those kinds of systems can produce over unity it&#x27;s all perfectly legitimate physics today most scientists are unaware of the literature that the zero-point energy even exists mainly because most scientists aren&#x27;t physicists now a few of them I went to school and I became a PhD finding a PhD in electrical engineering and systems engineering and not one professor ever heard of it and yet there was in the library it&#x27;s a part of it as most scientists are specialists in their own area and science today is very fragmented now for those that know that the zero-point energy exists they may argue well it&#x27;s random in its nature and therefore can&#x27;t be tapped as an energy source but very recent work in thermodynamics by ilya prigogine who won the Nobel Prize in 1978 shows how this energy could become self organized if the proper systems conditions could be fulfilled and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening in some of the experiments and some of the inventions that are tapping this amount this energy and producing anomalous energy another resistance is the physics community especially that really know about this energy realized if you could tap it everything would change the nature of physics would change the most important foundation of all physics would then be the quantum the quantum energy that&#x27;s in embedded in space and really we don&#x27;t understand and it&#x27;s extremely mathematically difficult to do computations in it and it turns out it&#x27;s probably going to be the basis of string theory in the future and therefore what seems to be nothing will actually be understood as a field effect as a tapping of energy that is already available that can&#x27;t be seen even the radio waves for example the television set is a good example if you show that to a primitive tribe it looks like a magical box but it&#x27;s littered converting invisible energy in the air to the signals and pictures the paddle wheel in the river that&#x27;s used a power Emil grand corn is a free energy device so is a windmill for example what we mean is we are taking the energy from an external source and using it so it&#x27;s an open system and the environment of the system is furnishing a full of energy into the system which the system is then collecting and using primary requirements it has to be an open system it has to have an external source of energy to furnish the energy that we&#x27;re going to use and therefore it&#x27;s no more mysterious than a windmill and now we&#x27;re coming full circle and realizing that physics and metaphysics that some of the notions of the 19th century such as the ether and the vortex are now being dusted off and those ideas are being melded with modern experiments plus quantum mechanics and so forth into this magnificent magnificent synthesis of what I call sacred science of a whole new science a whole new physics in which consciousness remains our reigns supreme and where we don&#x27;t have to follow any particular guru or a leader or anything like that that we have everything we need in the universe it&#x27;s ours to have right now and these are some of the basic essence principles that lie underneath the discovery of free energy [Music] the force of inertia is known in mechanic&#x27;s but until only recently it had been considered too weak and difficult to harness for propulsion according to some theorists like how put off inertia like gravity is what occurs we try to accelerate an object against the zero point fluctuations in the vacuum we run into resistance literally Canadian inventor Roy Thornton has developed an inertial impulse propulsion engine which overcomes that resistance using centrifugal force it pushes against nothing and emits no exhaust but it&#x27;s been calculated to be twenty times more efficient than a jet engine [Music] here the thorns and inertial propulsion dr powers of canoe in a swimming pool [Music] the motor which is housed in a balance never contacts the water our air in the pendulum test unidirectional force is being generated to keep the pendulum to one side whether or not we can demonstrate as I have with engineering analysis and and models that will climb an incline will pass us a pendulum test and over to stay in one side of the pendulum consistently and even power a canoe in a swimming pool commercialization of that device is still a very difficult road and we see that many inventions but what I like to emphasize is my F over P measurement of that is literally 20 times better than the jet engine a jet engine typically a commercial jet engine the dc9 I think is the one that I analyzed has about point oh one six Newton&#x27;s per watt and this is in the metric system now when we look at the thorn sand he&#x27;s able to achieve 0.3 0.3 to Newton&#x27;s per watt they&#x27;re really 20 times better than the jet engine ROI on Sun is developing refinements to his system to increase its performance unfortunately like many inventors even with a US patent in hand he&#x27;s yet to find sufficient investment capital to bring his motor to the marketplace [Music] we&#x27;ve all seen these little toy gizmos that demonstrate lightning in the bottle it&#x27;s the electric phenomenon called plasma discharge various inventors working independently are coming up with some exotic combinations of gases metals and processes to actually squeeze excess electrical energy out of this phenomenon of nature in 1996 paolo and alexandre Correa received the first patent for such a device called the pulsed abnormal glow discharge reactor the first of its kind to convert plasma discharge directly into electricity Utah inventor Paul Pantone has developed what he calls the geet fuel processor a plasma generator similar to a super carburetor that actually appears to run on 80% water and is entirely non polluting this device replaces the carburetor and exhaust and combines them as one unit whereas this end of it acts as a miniature refinery allowing the engine to run on everything from battery acid and water mix to crude oil right out of the ground this is Angola crude a 39.5 gravity the exhaust coming down goes around and comes out here at the far end the center chamber draws some of the heat from the exhaust Plus this tube takes some of the exhaust gases takes them up into the chamber and bubbles them down to the bottom the bubbles as it comes through the fuel are brought up to the top of the chamber picked up through a tube and fed up the center of the exhaust pipe while they&#x27;re being fed up the exhaust pipe they are in a vacuum and there is a heat exchange which occurs this process argued a few times to be either a plasma field an electro field we do know that it does have a slight radiation which is not alpha beta or gamma we do have x-rays to show that whatever is coming from the unit does get affected different from stainless steel than the regular steel when the temperature of the exhaust is the same as the air temperature going in from the airport up here normally one three percent more oxygen coming out of the tailpipe than there is in the air we&#x27;re breathing no carbon at all I wouldn&#x27;t say vanishes I would say transmuted into some other substance a lighter element because we have an abundance of lighter elements here that are not explained from down here but during the heat process there are molecular changes after running this engine from 1983 until now and many times we had a running eight at eight eight and a half hours a day we have never had to change sparkplug change the oil or clean up we have taken the head off three times to inspect the inside of it and it&#x27;s been spotless what we have here is the pantone gate device fitted to a board 2300 cc four-cylinder engine as you can see we had we have a see-through container here which holds the fuel as the engine is started air is drawn in by vacuum through the fuel and bubbles the fuel the vapors of which are drawn off here they travel down this hose into our reaction chamber they go up the reaction chamber and return back out here to be intake to be taken into the engine through this tube this is our air filter and this tube is connected to another valve which are controlled by this linkage operating the air intake and a fuel intake this is the valve that controls the return air going through this tube into the bubbler [Music] during the testing with the 2300 cc printer we have achieved efficiency up to and including 300 percent of normal if this engine normally got 20 miles to the gallon on the highway you&#x27;d now be looking at 60 hour load test and why not about not being completed but we feel very confident that there&#x27;s not going to be a power problem out there I witnessed the demonstration just by Paul Pantone and I was astonished by the claim of ability to use any fuel water including mixed with oil and so forth it&#x27;s similar to something that&#x27;s validated already by Gunderman that&#x27;s being used in the state of Nevada at the moment however this is an even more shocking claim because it appears that it is truly if it&#x27;s correct and if it can be validated he seems quite open it appears that this may be yet another process which of which does some kind of transmutation of elements he claims there&#x27;s no carbon coming out of the exhaust which would be unthinkable for putting a hydrocarbon fuel in even if it&#x27;s mixed with water you have to get carbon out and and he&#x27;s claiming that there are no CEO or co2 emissions from this and there appear to be none visually that has appeared to be no soot of particles coming out of the exhaust so I hold out some hopes for this so our demonstration units that will be going out to about 25,000 stations between now and the end of the year or early next year are being retrofit as we speak now to include our system in the exhaust pipe and our injector body here with standard equipment that normally is supplied from the factory so that we can get it out to the public as quickly as possible hopefully after being rejected by dozens of US manufacturers Pantone now has contracts for several major foreign countries recently several US companies have decided to take a second look [Music] and the period between these compliments in 1989 two physicists from the University of Utah dr. Stanley pons and dr. Martin Fleischmann created a media frenzy with their announcement of cold fusion in a bottle although several independent experiments reported similar test results the cry of fraud quickly went up at MIT and other prestigious universities the debunking Swift and merciless throughout the history of science anytime there is something that is very threatening to the established ideas such as Galileo&#x27;s revelations through the telescope and his idea probably on others that the earth goes around the Sun not vice-versa continental drift all sorts of claims that ultimately became validated the initial reaction of science is to say this is nonsense and to reject it and not even to look at the data and I would say that the cold fusion and free energy or new energy phenomena are so threatening to the undermining underpinnings of of modern physics and chemistry and all other sciences that you would get the you get the expected intensely negative reaction the real story about cold fusion is that it never died soon after the announcement in Utah on March 23rd 1989 hundreds thousands of people all over the world scientists Milan engineers began to try they began to try to replicate the pons and Fleischmann experiment and positive results kept coming in of all manner including the energy the excess energy far more out than in and could be possibly explained by any chemical reaction or any previously stored energy the unfortunate situation was that the US Department of Energy masterminded a bogus panel of so-called experts who many of whom were biased from the start against the subject they came up with the expected answer with only with it within three months and they ratified it within six months even as the evidence continued those physicists nuclear physicists that have been working with hot fusion that tokamaks this type of thing they have a monstrous amount of evidence that shows exactly what they expect to have happen with nuclear reactions in this hot gas plasma they believe and it&#x27;s a good good first guess that the nuclear reactions that would occur in a cold fusion cell should be the same well mother nature doesn&#x27;t always accept our predisposition to belief therefore mother nature says this is a different environment these are different reactions and hey guys start studying a little harder and find out what&#x27;s going on the problems that occur in evaluating a cold fusion device have not been so much does it work but does it work every time and many many scientists are of the opinion if it doesn&#x27;t work every time then there&#x27;s something wrong basically the problem has been in the preparation of the medal now this is particularly true in the heavy water experiments of pons and Fleischmann certain materials will just absolutely close off the effect of the cells other things they&#x27;re finding additions will promote the effect so there&#x27;s a lot of study going on in that area it&#x27;s over 200 laboratories and over 30 countries have replicated or advanced or / or had successes and various types of cold fusion devices the Patterson Power Cell of clean energy technologies of Dallas Texas is one of the most spectacular devices in the cold fusion field it also happens to be the first device that has a United States Patent which is also very important we got it almost by accident since there are hundreds of patent applications that the Patent Office is rejecting what this cell is is it&#x27;s very similar to put the pons and Fleischmann concept except it uses tiny little metal coated beads with either nickel palladium nickel or even sometimes just nickle and ordinary water not the heavy water which pons and Fleischmann&#x27;s started with and it does produce with a flowing stream of this liquid or electrolyte with just a little bit of lithium sulfate salt mixed in it it produces spectacular energy in in fact in one experiment they turn the power off completely and the cell continued to produce twenty watts of power unmistakable for at least 14 hours and my understanding is that could go on for a number of days longer the typical power ratios of this kind of a cell it&#x27;s very robust totally repeatable is anywhere from ten to a thousand to one okay when you have even a tiny bit of input power they&#x27;ve had a go over 1,000 watts with only a watt or so input electricity clearly these cells can be made to self-sustain that is continue by themselves dennis Cravens as an independent scientist who has done firsthand research studying the effects of the Paterson powers the important thing is notice over here total excess energy is usually in the mega joules range if you run through a chemical calculation of how much metal you have in there about twenty milligrams turn the crank how many moles is that how much you assume about a hundred kcal per mole for your chemist types of a typical energetic reaction if you can think of one we can&#x27;t think of one but if there was one you maybe get 32 kcals if you burned all the metal so we are three or fours magnitude more energy out of the system integrated energy out then if we were burning everything chemically if you do the calculations you&#x27;ll find that you can get there it&#x27;s more likely that a few percentage of them are in the millions electron volt region it&#x27;s been revealed recently that the Patterson cell will actually keep producing heat for at least 14 hours after it shut off this is a phenomenal discovery it has not been advertised or publicized very well but what that means is we&#x27;re actually dealing with a free energy source the inventors never use that phrase and for obvious purposes but the important thing is that it does need more understanding and also it has the keys to our type of device that we need the interesting thing about the Patterson cell too is that as a by-product it produces hydrogen and oxygen it&#x27;s actually using water any type of water and electrolyzing that water and then just exhausting the hydrogen and oxygen now we could see two views of that for example if we&#x27;re actually forced into a situation where we&#x27;re in an enclosed space and not able to spend too much time outdoors which we already spend 90% indoors anyways the supply of oxygen is very valuable whether or not we even use the hydrogen but it&#x27;s possible we can also store the hydrogen and therefore have hydrogen powered vehicles and use the oxygen indoors another area that has emerged as a result of cold fusion which is every bit as heretical and disastrous to the scientific enterprise as the overunity and the greater energy out than in is the transmutation of metals or that is heavy metals in ordinary coal fusion experiments they have now seen in the metal changes in elements for example the production of copper the production of other isotopes such as rhodium the change of palladium into other things this is confirmed there&#x27;s no doubt about it and it&#x27;s occurring with minimal energy input so what this leads to is an analogy with the old claims of the alchemists who were able historically they said and there&#x27;s some evidence that they were able to do it to do Low Energy processes that produce to gold from LED or mercury or other things this is now being done in laboratories and every instance I know of in the history of science where a small effect was seen initially to produce something was later scaled up so there&#x27;s it&#x27;s quite possible that our culture will enter an age of alchemy in which low energy processes can make precious metals as we look toward the future I believe we&#x27;ll be able to find ways in which we can create the kind of elements that we need by these low energy nuclear reactions I think we&#x27;ll be able to start adding to or picking apart or changing the nucleus of atoms to be able to get the kind of stable atoms that we need but more important I thoroughly believe that we will be able to take the radioactive materials add a proton or add some changes to it and make those radioactive materials non radioactive and that is going to be a great boon to our present right to are to clean up the mess that we&#x27;ve left behind from our atomic bombs from our nuclear power plants and of course from things like Chernobyl so in the future we have laid the groundwork with cold fusion by which we&#x27;ll be able to handle a whole array of nuclear changes that heretofore have been it have been outside of the current model of what can be done with nuclear reactions there are many power companies throughout the United States that are now on alert and they&#x27;re sending their representatives to cold fusion conferences we meet them all the time they give support they they really will be the vanguard of the new energy age I believe that any utility company that does not get into this now is doomed because frankly when we have generators of electricity and heat that can stay in a home or a building why would anyone want to be plugged into the grid the wire grid any longer this would make no sense people will argue against that but I think the grid will disappear a remarkable process for sure and one that offers exciting developments in the near future but does the test of extracting energy from our environment really require such exotic ultra advanced technology that potentially would still put it under the control of large profit-driven interest the rare metal palladium still have to be prospective mined and purified or are there simpler in design low maintenance technologies available that could be bought off the shelf and installed by anyone for an affordable one-time fee we&#x27;re going to look in depth at several individuals and companies who have been working for years perfecting devices that they claim will do just that [Music] [Music] no one person in the free energy field has been as determined and persistent as Mississippi inventor Joseph noone since the 70s newman has been denied US patents repeatedly on his energy machine even though numerous engineers scientists and even congressmen have testified on his life in 1968 I invented a bike that would get a wheelie and I used an 80 pound flywheel that I had built and took a positive Luntz out of a 30 horsepower motor put it above the axis of the back wheel a kid to get up on it build up inertia and that 80 pound flywheel get engaged that positive clutch immediately the front end jump up off the ground and leave like six on the pavement about that long and kids eyes but you know get the biggest Silver Dollar they were just a static over but I had heard the word that the gyroscope was a stabilizer so I went to the library got a book on gyroscopes and when I started reading the mechanical characteristics of a gyroscope the question that had dogged my mind for three years how did that current know which direction to go and why was why was it when you went parallel you&#x27;d get nothing I saw the laws of a gyroscope matched that exactly if you studied the laws of a gyroscope if you take this little gyroscope here if I can spin it up you can see that it does but I think every kid knows it&#x27;s true if you pivot that one direction it goes one way you pivot the other way it goes the other way if I turn it around 180 degrees now if I push it up it goes the opposite direction push it up to go the opposite direction if I go parallel it does not pivot long as I maintain a parallel position that&#x27;s exactly what happens when you move a conductor through a magnetic field you push down on it the current going one direction you push up and go it up the direction turn the magnet over 180 degrees everything will reverse you push down parallel to the lines of force with the copper wire and you get nothing it told me that the energy in a magnetic field was a gyroscopic particle now I didn&#x27;t care what the rest of the world was saying because they couldn&#x27;t answer my on this question it was obvious to me the energy and a magnetic field consists of gyroscopic particles it is mechanical essence of Einstein&#x27;s equation of equals in C square it moves forward at C and it spins at C Einstein&#x27;s equation of equals mc-squared it only occurs when you get atom alignment in material I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s conductor iron what it is when the atoms align the magnetic field will appear come outside the boundaries of the material and gives you an running river that you can tap into and what I&#x27;m going to show you is an energy technology that&#x27;s going to totally change your life that the status quo power brokers have been fighting and I&#x27;ll show you the history of it they didn&#x27;t want you to have it but you can see for yourself that this works and the part of this for you is to see it is to watch these meters because these meters are going to show you there&#x27;s more power in this system than flows from this battery the magnet runs down the shaft from one end to the other tech shape with six sided this blue represents a call running this way the red represent the call running at right angles to it the commentator shows did you break that circuit every 90 degrees so you&#x27;re firing to one Karl for in the next coil you notice this gets higher as it&#x27;s running because the batteries start getting chit charts now this one&#x27;s going from 200 up to 400 you see that there&#x27;s more current being produced by this system than those batteries are capable of delivering because batteries will not produce RF power so the RF power must be coming from the motor now RF far is true powering the way you know this this meter only works by converting the heat in the heat is converted into electricity because it runs through a resistor it&#x27;s a very accurate measuring device so you well over twice the current is flowing in this system then these batteries are capable delivering and the batteries cannot produce RF power now this is real power it has to be coming from the system it clearly shows that the energy output of the system is greater than the energy and put it into the system and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been saying that&#x27;s what&#x27;s more than 30 scientists who came to my home from around the world the mob came my way from England signed affidavits that the indention work the special master to the court mr.</p>
<p>Williams scholar who was a former Commissioner of patents he was electro engineer the federal judge chose him sent his credentials were superb he looked at those affidavits and gave the men the credit they would do he said the evidence was overwhelming the invention worked there was no contradictory factual evidence and the Patent Office had no no he&#x27;s not followed the formalities of patent law to us as an observer we see everything is motionless we see objects and they sit still and everything in this shop sitting still and so we think that&#x27;s to us again is to the observer we think the natural state of our planet is not motion but when really in reality you get down to the basic Bank up of the atoms of this material and you see that the natural state of the universe is motion the unnatural state is what I have concluded is the lack of motion to the observer because that&#x27;s when it can it forms into something and becomes a solid mess that will be interacted by other masses sitting close to it it causes it to sit steel and not be able to travel because of its attraction so we come along as the observer and we say the net state of the of the planets in the universe is like a motion just like we believe that so strongly just several hundred years ago we believed that the earth was the center of the universe and that we were everything and they even believed that the stars even back to Kepler times it was only a like a cake full with raisins three miles thick and the stars were little tiny raisins in it and that was our bias that not prejudice based on what we saw that everything sits centralized around us and I&#x27;m saying now we should open our eyes and our brain to see the magnitude of what lays in front of us space travel we&#x27;ve become a reality our children growing up will have an excitement and a universe to travel into but the values of the human race has to change with that while Joe Newman are still fighting for recognition and just compensation many entrepreneurs are racing to be the first into the marketplace with magnetic motors that are built with high-tech space-age materials and employed microbe processors to regulate pulsations and rpm David Porter of gal tech semiconductors demonstrates his recently patented permanent magnet motor called the carousel electric generator this is the latest version of the carousel motor generator it&#x27;s a rotary version rotary inside there&#x27;s 18 separate sections what we call a coil section in here 18 make up the outer diameter there are six coils here that we&#x27;re using to drive the motor and the top here we have an encoder which sends a pulse down to the electronics and basically lets the electronics know where the rotor the rotating part here is in relationship to the coils and tells the coils when to turn on and off now that&#x27;s done by a specific index point that the encoder has that sets the relationship between the two and the electronics down here in the box is basically a set of TTL logic counters it counts the number of pulses from the encoder and it turns the power on and off to different coils depending on where the rotor is at the time we have also hooked up to this system a connection to the computer over here what it gives us the opportunity to do is change the duty cycle on the system we can change it from a pulse rate of one pulse per cycle up to 40 pulses per cycle which would be a hundred percent duty cycle that is incorporated in and what we do is change the pulse rate on the computer it downloads the data to the electronics when the index pulse comes around which comes around once per revolution it updates the data in the counters and that&#x27;s what changes the pulse rate on the system we don&#x27;t have an automatic start on the system right now that&#x27;s something that the Intel chip will do we started it up in a pulse rate of approximately 13 pulses which gives us a 16 percent duty cycle it takes a while to spool up because like I say it works also as its own flywheel so we build up the power gradually the thing about this system is is that everything floats on the magnetic field in there you have very little internal friction once the system goes up to speed it stabilizes of the third rpm right now we&#x27;re learning at about a 30 percent duty cycle speed is still coming up a little bit [Music] calculate the speed off of the scope here and we&#x27;re learning about eighteen hundred and fifty rpm this white and the green shows the two channels on the motor little spikes there or the amount of time that each channel is on and a flat part at the bottom is the amount that it&#x27;s off so you can see how much is pulsating how much time it&#x27;s off and how much time it&#x27;s on one of the analogies we like to use is it&#x27;s like well if you pick someone up and take them across the street you use a lot of energy you put them in a tire once you get it started while you got to do is tap it a little bit and so you use a lot less energy to move the same load and that&#x27;s what we do we build it up to a high speed and then we just tap it with a little with a little juice as it goes around and we use the inertia built into the system to take it the rest of the rest away there so we&#x27;re using a high-speed pulse on the system what we&#x27;re doing is removing the energy from the magnet the magnet has a specific life they lose approximately one percent a year so we&#x27;re not actually trying to create energy from nothing the system will not run forever it&#x27;s not perpetual motion we use the amount of energy that is in the magnets once that energy is used up the magnets can be taken out they can be recharged all we&#x27;re doing is maximizing the efficiency of the electromagnetic flux density that&#x27;s there to the production of electrical output when we&#x27;ll be able to see free energy devices powering consumer products like this electric car well they&#x27;re already here and you may be able to purchase one by the time you see this program in Oklahoma where oil has been king for over a century inventor Troy Reed has been busy in his shop constructing rotating magnetic motors that he believes will soon revolutionize how we get around and it does work this is a new prototype of the magnetic motor and if I can explain a little bit about what you call a magnetic feel all magnets the big old wooden prototype has a system as the motor went over it had attention to jerk jerk over like that if you take this motor here and you take your finger and rotate it it doesn&#x27;t have that jerking in it so what I&#x27;ve done I got rid of the crank shaft I got rid of the crank shaft I&#x27;ve got rid of the injectors and the system in this motor here as you crank this motor up and like you do the other one the motor will start running and what I&#x27;ll do I&#x27;ll energize it on this motor here if you can see these amp gauges over here this will come when we get it up to about a hundred and fifty volts will unplug it and we&#x27;ll turn the light on if you turn this around where you can see this side here all the working parts is behind this system here operates from a little computer takes just five volts it&#x27;s a hundred and fifty volts what we&#x27;re going to do turn off all the switches make sure they ain&#x27;t nothing plugged into it there&#x27;s the plug there&#x27;s your 110 volts motor still running you can roll a rough rate this table plum around still got energy running nothing tied up in the back of it nothing on the floor rotate around still running up running electricity so we&#x27;re looking hoping hoping this time next year that you&#x27;ll be able to use it in your home so that&#x27;s another and what&#x27;s good about this you talk about electric automobiles this car this right here can set it in backup electric automobile and generate like Christian charged batteries up in a car in the bottom Oh bill you grab it anywhere you want to you don&#x27;t loot the air all the other electric automobiles that I&#x27;ve actually seen has been nothing but this standard transmission this is an automatic transmission car there&#x27;s not a whole lot of what&#x27;s called jump I would call under cars I&#x27;ve seen a lot of electric cars had a lot of stuff in it only thing that this has has a battery to run the radio the board we&#x27;ve got two safety switches over here that can be mounted into an enclosed system but we did this where you could see where people can see this color with the technology it&#x27;s a safety switch system this is a curve controller box and curtis control box it cuts the amperage down so with the amperage here&#x27;s what&#x27;s real good about electric automobiles all electric automobiles that has search technology with this in it they creed heat they&#x27;ve got to have a fan to blow this blow this this Kurdish controller off because it gets hot we don&#x27;t want that to get hot we want to say that coke because once it stays cold you save on all that all the computer chips that&#x27;s in this controller so that means you can go farther longer and you&#x27;ll have no problems this liquid automobile has got two gauges in front of this shifter on the automatic transmission is called the voltage and the amperage that&#x27;s what I was talking about earlier about amperage on automobiles let&#x27;s see if we can&#x27;t get the amperage to go down spit going up the voltage on this here should say somewhere around 120 volts when we start out there&#x27;s no amperage at all so the gages is down below here and we&#x27;re getting ready to take and go drive the car and you can see for yourself what it does all you do is to take and put it in here and the motor sounds like a little sports car shifts runs good fantastic automobile drives if you&#x27;ll see the amperage on the gauge see it going down amperage goes way down that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what I like about electric cars if you floorboard the car that most it will do would just be about maybe a hundred amps and that&#x27;s what we want to do is to keep the amperage down on electric car so able to go anywhere really anybody wants to go if you want to take a trip you don&#x27;t have to worry about it going go plug in the house because it&#x27;s called the surge technology it&#x27;s a beautiful automobile and I love it and I&#x27;ve put a lot of hard work in this car and we&#x27;re gonna make it no oil no gas to fool with and the technologies here it&#x27;s gonna be here it&#x27;s gonna go it&#x27;s gonna work beautiful for the whole world for mankind see year-round this is your future people [Music] as we have seen so far electromagnetism seems to be offering the most viable path for many contemporary inventors the magnetic motor continues to challenge the overunity barrier but even simpler methods are being demonstrated through common ingenuity dennis lee a better world technology has been struggling to pursue his dream of achieving energy independence for everyone on the planet held in prison for two years without ever being convicted of a crime Lee mounts public demonstrations in major US cities lining up individual dealerships to market his device a controversial figure who some dismiss as a fraud and others see as legitimate if outspoken PT Barnum of free power to the people Lee has assembled an impressive line of prototypes and processes including those by other inventors like Yul Brown although he claims his machines are not utilizing zero-point energy because they draw heat from the surrounding air his numerous devices supposedly achieved super efficiency rates by recycling excess energy through closed-loop system I built the world&#x27;s most efficient heat pump and developed it and these are the evaporators for that heat pump right here they&#x27;re eight feet high three feet wide now the refrigerant we put in here boils at 40 degrees below zero therefore any time day or night outside in a wait in a rainstorm or in a windstorm a hailstorm or a snowstorm or just out on a nice hot sunny day or in the middle of a cold night as long as the refrigerant that&#x27;s inside this panel is colder than whatever the air is out here or the phenomenon that&#x27;s hitting this panel then the heat from the air or the Sun or the wind or the rain or thus neat or the snow will be transferred into the refrigerant on the other side because it&#x27;s the second law of thermodynamics hot goes to cold so if this is the coldest thing outside anything out there that touches it it&#x27;s going to give a teeth to it a little bit of heat goes long way that gas starts expanding like crazy and as it expands it then is drawn into the compressor not through suction I&#x27;ve got engineers and inventors that don&#x27;t like to use the term suction but through negative pressure so as the compressor is creating this negative pressure the gas is migrating to it and so a compressor is a gas pump it&#x27;ll pump gas and so the gas is being pumped by the compressor into the compressor elevated in temperature and even though if you touch this panel it&#x27;s ice-cold to your hand and if you touch the line going out of the panel it&#x27;s still ice-cold to your hand when it hits that compressor compressor takes all the gas in this space puts it in that space elevates the pressure in the temperature going out of the compressor do not touch that line whenever that thing is on because it&#x27;s 200 to 250 degrees hot and so that&#x27;s where we get the heat all of the heat is transferred in here we then use a compressor to take the relatively useless energy that we&#x27;ve got and elevate the temperature and pressure make it very useful energy then that heat would be transferred later this is a direct-drive compressor this direct-drive compressor takes freon from the panels and it runs that because this direct drive is causing the Pistons to go up and down that gives us heat into the boiler the boiler expands the other freon back through that into a double-acting piston that&#x27;s going back and forth we&#x27;re converting with mechanical apparatus we&#x27;re converting that into shaft rotation that shaft rotation turns this wheel as this wheel turns it causes the compressor to turn as the compressor supplies the heat it causes this wheel to turn you might say these two wheels are powering each other and by the way once the freon has taken the heat it then made the power it then goes up here this is a condenser we&#x27;re sucking water out of the bottom of the tank could be the well and we&#x27;re running the water through this pump right here that&#x27;s also driven by the same drive mechanism running the water into this condenser so world&#x27;s most efficient condenser at a hundred degree Delta t six million BTUs and as we&#x27;re then running the water through we&#x27;re making the water hotter but the water will also be being pumped and as I do this I&#x27;ll show you water being pumped and then also we&#x27;re cooling down the freon which is going into this canister and is being pumped right back into the boiler by a little combo a pump that&#x27;s running on the same cylinder you&#x27;re ready to try it let&#x27;s go ahead and try out let&#x27;s turn it on guys okay if you&#x27;re ready maistro&#x27; anytime you&#x27;re ready okay so it is pumping water from energy taking out the air and will light the lights to from excess energy so the lights are being lit from excess energy from the air they&#x27;re pulsing it wasn&#x27;t set up to do that so we don&#x27;t have it stable but we thought we&#x27;d just demonstrate the excess power that we have main thing is this pumping water is supposed to be pumping water that&#x27;s a closed loop because it&#x27;s continuing to go through the boiler and in fact I had a heat pump in a walk-in freezer we cranked the temperature down to 20 degrees below zero in dead air space now I imagine this if you got any background in refrigeration we&#x27;re in dead air space the temperatures 20 below zero we did it every single Saturday for an entire year people from all over the world came to see it we said bring your own test equipment take the thing apart if you want to we had a ten thousand dollar challenge to find any gimmick or anything in it and every single weekend we crank the temperature down to 20 below and dead air space and we made water hot enough to burn your hand from energy we took out of that box at 20 below at a two-to-one COP same average performance of the GE heat pump in America only it&#x27;s 20 below in dead air space and we challenged all the heat pump manufacturers to come any type you want to either find a hoax with us or bring your unit down and see if you can do that nobody ever came a lot of customers came lots of people people from all world came Pakistan everywhere so anyway we&#x27;re in here testing this every year every every weekend for a year and a man came to the show one day and there for like what a guy this was now we&#x27;re trying to build this thing it&#x27;s going to take two years and two million and I&#x27;m raising capital selling heat pump things to get the money and a guy walks in and he comes up to me at the end of the show and he says mr. Lee I am absolutely astonished I want to shake your hand and I want to tell you I have no doubt you have got the best heating system in the world yours tops everything out there from solar all the way down the line you did it but you need to know me you know why you need to know me because I have built the world&#x27;s most efficient heat engine and you&#x27;ve got the world&#x27;s most efficient heat source he says if we got together with our two technologies we could become the most dangerous men in the world I thought wow I&#x27;ve never been the most dangerous man in the world I&#x27;ve kind of wanted to be and so you see this man&#x27;s name was dr. Fischer now this guy built the steam built that proved that they built the steam engine wrong I had the pleasure of building his unit in my research lab and we took his great big unit because why wouldn&#x27;t I want a great big one I don&#x27;t want to put everybody on the grid system with a new system that can exploit them some more with all the arrogance that comes with it I wanted to give people the opportunity to be totally independent of the grid system remember that was my goal so we took the big one we had and we scaled it down into a model not much a little bit smaller than this one it was a little smaller than s it was about that long it&#x27;s about 13 inches long 6 inches in diameter and that one was going to be big enough to be able to power all the energy you needed for your house and so I didn&#x27;t want one bigger than that and by the way that little unit could fit in the glove compartment of any american-made car I went across the United States of America telling my story I told it in every state of the United States and I got a thousand people to join me telling my story we put a media ad campaign together because the media wouldn&#x27;t cover it so we ran commercials and we did a 60-second commercial cutting a and say you can power your house with no electricity external electricity run your car with a new engine that runs with no gasoline we did a 60-second commercial nationwide as far as we can tell about 10 million people saw it and after that happened that was too much that couldn&#x27;t be tolerated and so I got a letter from the state of California inviting me to come back to California to go to court so I flew back from New Jersey to California to go to court and when I walked into the court the judge said you&#x27;re probably wondering why you&#x27;re here and I said yes I am and he said well because I&#x27;ve been ordered by the state of California to put you in prison and I said well that&#x27;s really interesting you&#x27;re putting me in prison but I&#x27;ve never been convicted of the crime how do I go to prison without a trial and without being convicted and I said you can&#x27;t do that can you and he said well he says I&#x27;ve been ordered by the state of California to put you in prison so that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re going but sounds like you got a hell of a case for appeal that by the way is a quote and I do have the transcript I walked out of prison two years ago and now we have rebuild our whole national network of distribution of distributors we&#x27;re in every state of the United States we&#x27;re in every major county in the United States we have people now who understand exactly how the government works exactly how the big boys work exactly how the energy companies work and we&#x27;ve got it all figured out and we&#x27;ve got far far far more technology than we ever had in 1987 we got a lot more money than we ever had in 1987 and we&#x27;re about to rock your world [Laughter] [Music] as if the amazing overunity results of these pioneering inventions are not enough a curious combination of side effects the free energy research involves such things as the transmutation of metals the formation of new isotopes and yes even anti-gravity levitation effects from spinning magnetic discs conjure up images of UFOs hovering in midair British inventor John Cerro has led the way along these lines but his technique is not the only approach the remarkable works of Canadian inventor John Hutchison has drawn widespread attention from businessman and government scientist since 1979 he began using ultra high electromagnetic frequencies to transform matter in some very unusual ways it has come to be known as the Hutchison effect the objects you are seeing moving there is the form of levitation by translational movement meaning that the objects become lighter and can float around the heaviest being the barium cylinder did you see there with the two wires coming out of it tends to slide around seven pounds of its own weight physics of it is soft resonation of what they call a ferromagnetic and piezoelectric barium type name through a power amplifier and broad and narrow bands of electrical energy going into this crystal so the applications of this in advanced applications using free energy are zero-point energy to power it would be in propulsion technologies this is a crystal converter unit that I made about a year ago to see the principle worked and indeed it seems to work to this day the principles involved the Casimir effect and space charge type of barrier technology and semiconductors and a jitter activity called zero-point energy that goes through time and space the idea is to get the material inside this to interface with the jittering action of zero-point energy and moving on to what they may look like inside I actually bring out a piece here of this material of common minerals and that produced in a special way and I take a reading here and I should be getting a higher reading I don&#x27;t have a hot spot somewhere on here I have here almost a half a volt as you can see as one can see there&#x27;s no batteries in this or anything else except this crystalline material with different configurations and this is a steady state it&#x27;s always that and has been tested up to a year&#x27;s time and under stress tests also so which maybe decide to then of course mount the same material in cylinders different cylinders of course are different mixes in there and I found that that some of the cylinders are not as powerful as this material here are this very tiny one here actually this has more power than this large artillery shell unit here and what I want to do of course is to demonstrate it in the sense but making actual power and that means to turn on small motor ok I&#x27;m attaching this to the base here another lead the top and it should spin which it does so yeah basically this kind of material powering motors of course the very small motors that&#x27;s fine but scaled up in larger amounts of material and power up to several horsepower it&#x27;s needed Hutchison hopes his simple shake-and-bake method of producing these crystal energy converters will attract investors who can see the potential of permanent batteries which never need charge on toxic that will interface with the zero-point energy facing fire Hutchison&#x27;s more dramatic experiments border on the paranormal and have generated more than just a passing interest from u.s. military research labs we&#x27;ve had about 750 demonstrations of levitation translational movement metallurgical samples falling apart changing into transmuted unknown metal quite a variety of obscure types of effects would impregnate it into metals other objects in metals monopole magnetic fields written up in many journals quite a host or a Pandora&#x27;s box of different types of effects on the outer edge scientific community in this remarkable series of video clips shot by Hutchison we see what happens with he fine-tunes the electromagnetic frequencies aimed at target objects and his garage [Music] [Applause] [Music] on the subatomic level I feel that there is a dimension shift activated by very conventional electrostatics RF feels that I use and Tesla waves that I use that actually form a key way that opens up another area of time of space that may activate the zero-point energy field and interventional reactions let&#x27;s say to gravitational waves and time waves or Corona as if you wish perhaps are dealing in pronouns and graviton which are for maybe particles sent out causing a distortion which causes objects to simply break apart or pulsate in the center of things field bars and fall apart or if you come weightless [Music] [Applause] [Music] here ice cream and a plastic cup [Music] confinement a 70-pound cannon doll [Music] what is interesting and also frustrating about his invention is that he&#x27;s using the combination of Tesla coil and vandegraaff to produce a very disruptive and lifting experiments which in one case for example actually lifts the 19 pound bushing toward the ceiling just from electromagnetic fields now when we analyze that we find that there&#x27;s position versus time graph that we can plot and also the velocity versus time but when we actually analyze the acceleration versus time that&#x27;s an increasing straight-line so we&#x27;re forced as scientists to admit that we have third derivative effect which for my mind actually lends itself to a novelist new force which I call hyper force because we have to take a derivative of that to finally get a flat straight line a constantly increasing acceleration so the Hutchison effect has been used as a benchmark for a comparison to many other high voltage propulsion devices electro gravity in other words now that we&#x27;ve witnessed the awesome potential of these revolutionary new energy sources some interesting questions begin to surface what are the consequences to the environment to the very fabric of space-time itself once we begin harnessing these little understood forces on a planetary scale remember the promise of nuclear energy that electricity would be too cheap to meter are there downsides to tapping free energy that we may not be able to predict until it may be too late we have effects which can get down now into the very fundamental thing that drives everything the mind stuff the connection of the mind to the body and everything for example if you were to generate extreme pulses extreme powerful pulses of this so-called scalar potential stuff with a hidden internal stuff if you jerk that or hard enough you jerk the normal smooth flow of time stream and what you really do is you snap the body loose from its mine connection you jerk the - loose from each other that&#x27;s instantaneous death at every level every cell dies every germ dies if a Paramecium dies every virus dies the whole body dies so obviously if you&#x27;re going to try to take think of energy and those enormous amounts you&#x27;re going to be extremely careful and you can&#x27;t do that just willy-nilly without risking terrible effects from it so there are some limitations that will emerge on this technology there is a danger however that you may tap too much zero-point energy and then of course these things that he doesn&#x27;t explode which has happened too few times with these devices of mine so in essence it&#x27;s an interesting technology to get involved in but I notice that there&#x27;s some precautions one needs to take if you&#x27;re having too much drawing up from the electromagnetic jitter of zero-point energy they&#x27;re gonna get a minor meltdown and it had to clean this area out here once because of a minor meltdown what a new energy source be dangerous for example I would I would say of course you have to respect it I mean its energy so therefore it&#x27;s always potentially dangerous it&#x27;s double-edged and I think it would take a healthy respect to to investigate it one should be cautious and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s very reasonable I&#x27;ve heard some good things I&#x27;ve heard there could be health effects there could be good effects as well as a potential for detrimental effects I think it&#x27;s like anything else it&#x27;s energy it could be used for good it could be used for bad it&#x27;s up to us perhaps because of their traditional understanding of invisible forces like Chi or key oriental cultures especially the techno enthusiastic Japanese embraced the concept of free energy well respected scientists like sanity psyche and say who ji Inomata receiving substantial government and industry support [Music] meanwhile the Japanese of course are beginning to commercially develop various systems for example a Japanese consortium funds the poems and Fleshman work at the Japanese Toshiba Corporation is working with Inomata and various other corporations are coming together to develop free energy options and of course Japan has no vested interest in the oil they don&#x27;t have any domestic source so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in their best interest to be the first kid on the block to make little gizmos that will replace our circuit breakers and internal combustion engines to understand this machine you need you know my change paradigm shift yourself you know so Farah feedings ordinance I&#x27;d consider only material world we should sink another one as an unseen world and we should recognize unseen world and material is connected connected this energy comes from the other dimension [Music] we&#x27;ll really have a true science when it is accepted in science and the true technology when all the phenomenology is thoroughly worked out and thoroughly understood when all the models are redone so that we adequately can model this theoretically and we can do engineering link set down in design the circuits they&#x27;ll work every time we have components on the shelf we can buy assemble and their work we&#x27;re not at that stage today we are at a stage today which is the birth of the baby we&#x27;re not at the stage where it&#x27;s already a teenager running around playing playing baseball on the baseball lot we&#x27;re at the birth of the baby and the birth is very difficult because it&#x27;s opposed by so many interests the Orthodox scientific community still very adamantly opposed it because they think that it&#x27;s nonsense they think that it&#x27;s this whole idea of perpetual motion in the closed system creating energy from nothing and that is nonsense you can&#x27;t do that there are very strong and very powerful economic interests in the world probably the strongest economic interest in the world which are adamantly opposed to it can you see what this does to the oil-rich nations can you see eventually can you see what this will do to many things now actually what it&#x27;ll do you&#x27;ll phase the all petrochemical industry won&#x27;t go away you still need you all for the materials that&#x27;s in it and the chemicals and so it&#x27;ll be more and more petrochemical industry rather than keep burning and wasting the oil and putting all the pollutants in the biosphere so many things will readjust it&#x27;s going to wrest control from a lot of the great wealthy control barons who now dominate largely the economic world and their world is going to change now what you&#x27;re going to see I would predict and we&#x27;ll see if history bears this out when those barons really realize that this stuff is for real and it can be made to work and with Internet and with free publishing and computers and everything they can no longer contain the information and it&#x27;s very embarrassing to keep killing the inventors that they stop that about 15 years ago at some point you&#x27;re going to see overwhelming availability of funds become available when the funds become available the scientists will change over into it because they go where the money goes they&#x27;re bought and paid for simple as that you can&#x27;t do research on this you&#x27;ve got the funds you cut off the research grants professor gets without a job he leaves the university and so science is simply bought and paid for in this country and much of the world when the money goes the science will go to it now that will put the sharp young graduate student on it finally with some funds to do the experiments and work on their doctorates and so forth you will have a very rapid assimilation and advancement of a totally new and extended electromagnetic science at the time you get to a certain stage in scientific development sometimes to stages where you&#x27;re faced with problems and barriers and you sort of forced to rethink and go in different directions I think we&#x27;re seeing that one of those peculiar time periods in the history of science where we&#x27;re going to overturn some cherished models not not too much but make some changes and they will open the door to an enormous amount of new technology in electricity and magnetism and nuclear reactions in motor development in battery applications in spaceflight in perhaps in anti-gravity I think there are in creating scarce elements from plentiful elements I think we have just reached a plateau now where the the world door is opening to what a millennium of new science we&#x27;re talking about real life hardware we&#x27;re talking about experiments in science that are telling us beyond any reasonable doubt that we have technologies that will enable us to be free from the bondage that we now feel free from some of these economic constraints that we&#x27;ve created for ourselves because you see if energy is free and it will be very shortly food is free housing is free then we&#x27;re afraid to create our express our creative gifts and not be like drones and we&#x27;re also free to explore our great ourselves and it&#x27;s gonna be a very exciting time coming up the future of the world as seen by conventional thinkers or even many far-reaching thinkers is tame compared to what a cold fusion and free energy is going to do no aspect of human culture will be untouched by the this energy revolution the very fact that the material that covers 70% of the planet&#x27;s surface will now be available as a fuel source in the poem the fact that water makes a huge percentage of our bodies and this is a fuel and a source of energy this is going to have incredible psychological and religious and historical and geopolitical implications the Middle East picture and the strength of the oil interests there is going to be drastically altered air pollution will be abolished in most cities that are now affected by the internal combustion engine and space travel which is a favorite subject of mine will be transformed with the ability to travel to the planets and to the stars will be given a gigantic boost one that I never in my lifetime expected as an engineer who deals with those things some people are saying that the title of my book the coming energy revolution is a bit fearsome that revolution implies a sudden radical change and that the status quo will suffer and that people whose jobs depend on the status quo will suffer so perhaps evolution is better - great way to look at it but one way or another our leaders our political leaders our business leaders our utility company executives have to address the changeover to clean energy sources and it&#x27;ll probably come from abroad so it probably will happen fairly fast I&#x27;m not really concerned myself about a radical shift because people seem to be on the verge of readiness for change a lot of fear but also some positive anticipation and maybe it takes an unraveling of what we have to put together a cleaner more sane world is mankind ready do we have the maturity to handle it are we giving matches to a baby that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the question well the first answer is we&#x27;re kind of backing ourselves against the wall if we maintain the status quo we&#x27;re doomed anyway it looks like we&#x27;re going to get a shot by having this energy available to us if we&#x27;re not mature enough to handle it well I guess we&#x27;re doomed either way we have a chance to survive the chance to go on but yeah it will take in a way a consciousness transformation there says their consciousness movement and things like that that people are starting to wake up it&#x27;s not just a me game now it&#x27;s a Wii game and as we learn to work together and have empathy for one another we can transcend the old selfish consciousness which has caused all the problems and all the wars and everything else into a recognition that we are a planetary beam [Music] we&#x27;ve only been able to present a handful of inventors and their remarkable devices in this program they&#x27;re hundreds if not thousands of people worldwide scientists engineers entrepreneurs they&#x27;re actively working right now researching and developing this phenomenal technology to the point where it can be successfully scaled up and mass marketed we are at a pivotal crossroads in human history can we as a society release our fears associated with the violence of the past and embrace the unknown can we cast aside our rigid skepticism in favor of an open-minded spirit of inquisitiveness our very survival may depend on how we answer these questions we hope we&#x27;ve given you enough of the necessary information with which you may face your future decisions regarding this exciting you feel one that will soon affect all of our lives and the very fate of our planet earth as well I&#x27;ll see you at the finish line the race is on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] if you are fascinated by the amazing technologies and concepts you&#x27;ve just witnessed now you can get even more valuable information and details from the new energy series five full-length videos nine hours of in-depth conversations and demonstrations of free energy systems explore the worlds of inventors and theoretical physicists who are changing the paradigms of science vol 1 features 1 atomic peers in particle physics any electrical charge is automatically a broken symmetry now what this means is there is a virtual photon flux of violent flux exchange between the vacuum itself which is filled with this virtual photon flux volume 2 John Hutchison I feel that that is also true I think the mind connect is also a cohere of frequencies and transmit them up and then walk this doorway into space and time this motor here drew twelve and a half amps volume three twelve volt Joseph Newman this motor right here only draws seven-and-a-half amps and look at the size of the power look at the size of a propeller look at the size of the motor look at the size of the motor now this is exactly what I teach throughout my book I taught it to dr. Hastings I&#x27;ve taught it to the world but the larger you make the mass then the smaller amount of power it will take and the more power it will produce without you more highlights truly read this there&#x27;s an old mechanical device it&#x27;s got it&#x27;s got two inner wheels on the inside the two outer shell if we host with magnets they got eight magnets on this side eight magnets on the inside here let&#x27;s see what kind of torque we got at 75 psi and volume time Dennis Lee okay here goes haha maxed it out so it went all the way off the end of this thing 150 foot pounds of torque by this engine they&#x27;re just 29.95 for each state now the prager get over 599 the savings of 32 sure brow makes your order today call</p>
