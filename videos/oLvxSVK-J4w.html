            <p>in that context that I&#x27;m really quite happy to have Dr Harold put off with us tonight Al is an old friend that we&#x27;ve spent far too many times sitting in board meetings for forever and never Los Vegas and other places on on boards that we sat on but I&#x27;ve come to appreciate him particularly because he&#x27;s a world class physicist I mean he&#x27;s building an extraordinary International reputation in number of fields and the thing that&#x27;s common to all of his kind of Engagement all of these is that um how has is permeable how is one of those guys who is open to ideas open to the possibilities that most people or lots of people are not and that&#x27;s what makes him a really quite interesting guy uh you&#x27;re going to hear all about this program that he did to the CIA but he&#x27;s also in the Forefront of doing physics on Alternative Energy Zero Point Energy the world&#x27;s expert in the area of Zero Point Energy he&#x27;s also interested in faster than light travel and Antigravity kind of things and how you build a ship to take you to Alpha centari and and it&#x27;s really quite fascinating every time I get a chance to uh spend some time and talk with him and people are after like crazy and I just blesss that he answers my telephone so we&#x27;re we really quite happy to have you with us tonight how uh we&#x27;re also happy to have Joe MCM Joe is sitting down here in Joe mcmo you&#x27;ll hear about Joe mcmo Joe MCM mcmonagle was the first remote viewer he was a warrant officer in the Army at the time and is responsible for a number of the things that Hal&#x27;s going to talk about and maybe if we&#x27;re lucky we&#x27;ll get him to come up afterwards and tell us a quick story or something about some of the things he literally did this will make for an interesting question and answer period afterwards but to start it off Dr [Applause] thanks well to begin with a reasonable question might be what&#x27;s a nice physicist like you doing in an area like this but I think you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;m going to give you the answer to those to that question and I think you&#x27;ll see that without a doubt this has been one of the most fascinating pieces of my career not one that I planned as you&#x27;ll see but one that uh just turned up and there I was the right guy in the right place at the right time or right guy in the wrong place at the right time you&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;ve started I&#x27;ve labeled this CIA initiated remote viewing program at SRI International although CIA initiated it and the first programs were with the CIA it wasn&#x27;t very long before as our results began uh began to be known around the community that we then ended up with separate contracts with the Navy with the Air Force with the army with some places I still can&#x27;t name and finally the defense intelligence agency came in as kind of an over uh over umbrella kind of function and so most of the work that we did uh in this period was uh really you would have to say A dia program defense intelligence agency to give you a bit of a timeline historically the project was top secret special Access program and you&#x27;ll see these names scan eight Sun streak center lane Grill flame and so on what that meant was that they were also code word protected so that means that someone could have a top secret clearance but they could not get access to the program or to any of its results unless they were on a special list it was that very well protected at present about 20% of the content of the program is still classified but a declassification program uh began as the Cold War was winding down in 1995 and July of 95 the CIA program which ran for 3 years was Declassified including most of the content and in September of 95 an unclassified history of the program was released but not very much of the content published as part of a CIA funded uh study to give an overview of the program oops I must have pushed the wrong button okay let&#x27;s see if I&#x27;ll do it this way as part of this declassification program uh many of the documents began to be Declassified and that&#x27;s the tally as of the present time 990,000 Pages have been released and another 20,000 pages are still classified now they&#x27;re actually classified for good reasons uh many of the uh remote viewing involved remote viewing terrorist activities involve remote viewing uh drug running and so actually a lot of the parts that are still classified are actually the prot viewers because if the bad guys out there began to realize how good remote viewing was it could create a problem for remote viewers so that&#x27;s a large part of why some of the material remains classified now maybe one of the most uh paranormal things you might say of the program was the fact that ever got started at a place like SRI this is Sri in mow Park California this set of buildings here at the time it was doing about $300 million worth of business a year uh about a third of it for Private Industry two-thirds of it for the government and of the part done for the government about half of it for uh Department of Defense and intelligence agencies when the program started we were in a building up front here called uh uh bioelectronics but very quickly when the program because of its results began to get highly classified we ended up in a building called the radio Physics laboratory here which was guarded and our program was in a secluded cubicle on top of the building cyber loock doors and all that kind of thing now the way I got involved in this was that I had just finished uh co-authoring a textbook while I was at Stanford University on fundamentals of quantum Electronics lasers that kind of thing and there&#x27;s nothing like writing a textbook to realize how little you know and as part of that uh quandry of struggling to put things in textbook and then realizing what you don&#x27;t know I became interested in the issue that many physicists at the time were interested in and that is well we can handle inanimate uh objects we can handle particle collisions we can look at astrophysical phenomena but what about things like life like Consciousness is it just that it&#x27;s too complex but eventually we&#x27;ll be able to figure it all out from quantum physics physics or do we have to extend physics and so that was something I was struggling with as were many my colleagues and about that time was when a well-known poly polygraph expert by the name of CLE Baxter was doing experiments and one day just on a lark he happened to connect his polygraph up to a plant they see on people and then he thought of uh burning a leaf on the plant to see what response he would get when he had the thought the plant responded and so that started a whole series of experiments where he seemed to have gathered data indicating that living organisms that are brought up together are somehow in in contact with each other and so I thought that was kind of neat uh these days we would talk about in terms of quantum entanglement I thought okay well maybe we can learn something about organic life Consciousness or whatever by examining interactions between plants between algae cultures or whatever so what I did from a purely physic standpoint I wrote up a proposal to be funded where I was going to take some algae culture that had grown together separate them by five miles uh zap one with a laser beam and see if there was a response on the other one see if I could measure the velocity of propagation between the two and so on so I sent that off to cleave Baxter to see what he thought of my idea and one of these serendipitous things I got to tell you it scares me when I think how my life has changed because of real flukes but here&#x27;s an example it just so happened the CLE bter went to a cocktail party in New York City and while there he met an artist by the name of Ingo Swan now Swan had also been doing some quote psycho Kinesis experiments at city college in New York and so when he heard about Cav&#x27;s experiments he said well can I come over over to your to your uh lab and see if uh if I can affect your plants and so cleave invited him over while he was there he happened to see my proposal on the desk and so uh he wrote me a letter this is the kind of art you can&#x27;t see it too well here uh he he&#x27;s actually a well-known artist many of his paintings have uh been on book covers magazine covers um in his letter he said look why do you want to work with algae culturs they can&#x27;t tell you what&#x27;s happening you should be working with someone like me at least I could tell you what&#x27;s happening now ordinarily this is the kind of letter I would have just thrown in the garbage can except he included with it uh a writeup on the work he had done with gertude schmeider in City College in New York where in fact he had apparently been able to raise and lower the temperature of sensitive temp temperature measuring devices that were in thermos bottles well as a physicist that caught my attention so I invited him come out to Sri that&#x27;s him on the right and uh in preparation for his visit I started talking to my my friends and colleagues and they said you know these guys are all frauds and charlatans you better really have something that if he shows the result you know it could not have been by some kind of trickery well fortunately at the time I had access to a well shielded magnetometer which is just a super high-tech version of a compass needle it was buried inside of electrical shielding magnetic shielding superconducting shielding it was thermally isolated acoustically isolated and buried in the floor of the building this was built uh on a Navy contract to detect uh quirks sub subnuclear particles and the idea was if you saw any kind of signal coming out of this thing you knew you had detected uh what you were looking for because this was supposed to be imperturbable from the outside so when he showed him up I took him over there and I said uh well I&#x27;d like for you to uh see if you can perturb this he says well where is it and I said well it&#x27;s it&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s under the floor and he said why I need to look at it I said no no it&#x27;s it&#x27;s you know super conducting it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s liquid helium uh in there I mean we can&#x27;t let you look at it he said no I don&#x27;t mean that way just I will just look at it meaning what we now call remote viewing ordinarily uh the output from the device has this sort of senous wave takes about I don&#x27;t know a minute to go through a cycle and when he quote looked at it it did that and he was drawing what he saw inside of course a poor graduate student whose life dependent on this panicked and he said oh something must be wrong maybe there are bubbles in the line uh let me let me see if I can find out what&#x27;s wrong and by the way after the fact we found out that the drawing he made little sketch and description of what he uh put down there was in fact quite accurate and this had never been published before so after a few minutes went by and the graduate student couldn&#x27;t whoops couldn&#x27;t uh find any problem he said why don&#x27;t you do what you did again and there it was and I asked him of course well his name was Ingo Swan I said Ino how did you do that he said I didn&#x27;t do anything I just looked at it and that happened so the graduate student asked us to leave go have lunch somewhere come back later and we&#x27;ll see if he can do it again and meanwhile he&#x27;ll give me a chance to get a good Baseline and see if there&#x27;s something wrong with my system and so I we were gone for lunch uh this went through several Cycles we brought him back in and we said okay Engle well look at it again and that happened so he said well uh I I don&#x27;t want you around here anymore we left he went ahead and gathered data for hours and the system worked just fine there&#x27;s a whole another story I could tell you about the Navy showing up and say we gave you all this money to make something imperturbable what happened here that&#x27;s another story so I wrote this up as a physicist would and I circulated around my colleagues and said you know can you come up with any reason why you know this might be</p>
