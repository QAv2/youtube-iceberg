            <p>do you believe that extraterrestrial intelligence has visited planet Earth I think you can go a step further it hasn&#x27;t just visited it&#x27;s been here a long time and it&#x27;s still here and and that statement seems so incredible that it&#x27;s tough to believe if you had to assign a probability to that statement that you believe extraterrestrial intelligence has visited this planet what probability would you assign 100% this from Gary Nolan 100% I mean he is a esteemed doctor over the entire world to say 100% is just amazing you know not 99% not I&#x27;m kind of sure he says 100% puts everything on the line what do you believe to be the most compelling evidence to support that statement you just need to look at what your government is doing right now about it I mean just go and look at the number of politicians and this is interesting on both sides of the aisle who have come together and signed off on this statement and then my experience with people who frankly I know have worked or are working on the reverse engineering programs</p>
