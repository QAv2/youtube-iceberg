            <p>so 0 point energy basically is you you there&#x27;s um the vacuum or the void has uh fluctuations within that that are are are energetic they they vibrations in a sense the void is not empty the there is no such thing as a vacuum that&#x27;s right originally uh physicists thought that empty space was empty truly empty right but once quantum theory uh went forward it was found that it&#x27;s a result of Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle that there&#x27;s always some Jitter going on at some deep level and this is what you&#x27;re going for in your research to develop a way of tapping into this energy exactly when you calculate how much energy is in their in a region of space um Fineman and others have said well it&#x27;s at least the order of nuclear energies even in quote empty space so it&#x27;s a case of you know trying to find out how how to collect the energy well how close are you to actually getting to this you know I mean like you said like we talked about earlier andison he experiment with 1,200 different elements or materials before he got tungsten to create the liob I mean how in fact in our proposals to our investors we actually use the Edison story to point out uh you know this might take a while uh there are four or five techniques in principle um whereby we see it might be doable but we&#x27;re still basically anyone working in this field is still looking for the right engineering set up the right construction to do it turns out that this effect in general you get the most energy at very small levels so may require a lot of nanom Machining or something and so unfortunately it&#x27;s not like um a big fire that you could just ignite microscopic well are you confident that it will happen that you will be able to get what you&#x27;re going for I&#x27;m confident that eventually we will uh what I&#x27;m not confident about is stating a specifically time specific timeline I certainly hope it&#x27;s within my lifetime and I expect it to be within my lifetime have you had remote viewers look and see what this substance is or possibly you know using some of these other areas to kind of tune in because it&#x27;s actually I haven&#x27;t although some have volunteered that they&#x27;ve looked on their own and they sent me data but it&#x27;s still not U Know specific enough uh you&#x27;re looking for a material is that what you&#x27;re actually looking for we&#x27;re probably looking more it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to involve materials uh it&#x27;s also going to involve geometrical uh shapes but also can actually involve the process I mean just to give you an idea for example the example gave plates coming together that&#x27;s a very mechanical thing another case is to make uh Arc discharges sort of microscopic ball lightning right and there uh you get a plasma that gets squeezed very similar in other cases you&#x27;re setting up bubbles in liquids uh with sound waves and then the bubbles collapse and there&#x27;s a possibility that that also would release uh Z Point Energy schwinger Nobel Prize laor wrote a number of papers where he felt that was could be a mechanism that might show up in Sun so all these different uh approaches are like wildly different from each other you got plates you got electrical discharges you&#x27;ve got bubbles being created in liquid others we&#x27;ve looked at involve gases so 0 point energy vacuum it it&#x27;s a medium that that things can travel through right the fluctuations are kind of like let&#x27;s say water um or water sort of like looking at the the electrical or electromagnetic equivalent of the froth at the base of a waterfall just a lot of random motion that&#x27;s why generally we don&#x27;t notice that it&#x27;s there because it&#x27;s all random and therefore any effect in any given direction is going to be canceled out by affect in an opposite direction this vacuum fluctuation energy which I&#x27;m concentrating in the electromagnetic part actually there are other parts also have all wavelengths and frequencies so that means that not only not only is it wavelengths of few centimeters or something but there are wavelengths that are as big as the universe so in that sense we are not just figuratively or metaphorically but we are literally in touch Across the Universe because our atoms are bathed in this sea of energy that includes all these wavelengths some of whose wavelengths stretch out you know across the solar system or whatever well it&#x27;s something behind it there&#x27;s another another more subtle layer let&#x27;s say there is this you know foone that exists and then something is generating well yeah actually this is an area that I and my colleagues at The Institute for advanced studies are looking at right now because even when you say okay I&#x27;ve got Zero Point Energy say well what exactly is that well it&#x27;s electromagnetic what do you mean it&#x27;s electromagnetic well it&#x27;s got electric Fields it&#x27;s got magnetic fields and waves and okay well what is electric field a wave in what and so in some sense unless you just want to draw the line and say man it&#x27;s mathematically works I&#x27;m not going to worry about it there are still the questions well obviously there&#x27;s something even deeper than that because we&#x27;re not describing what the 0 point energy electromagnetic waves are waves of right exactly what I&#x27;m sort of getting to is this whole idea of Consciousness you know where you&#x27;re saying that you can&#x27;t really Shield or you&#x27;ve been able to Shield some of the z0 point energy field but you couldn&#x27;t Shield it from a remote viewer you know so like Consciousness somehow is traveling in some medium or a part of some non-local aspect that&#x27;s even Beyond these fluctuations uh certainly has got to be the case and these fluctuations are handleable by normal physics and they appear in the textbooks and so on but no one has a model for how something like remov could really work so obviously there&#x27;s a lot more going on even beyond what we can model right but there&#x27;s probably is a science or there&#x27;s some maybe um more subtle medium in which Consciousness then can travel or it would be reasonable I mean certainly as a as a physicist I assume if it walks it&#x27;s physics so if it travels even spiritually it&#x27;s physics but even Quantum FY says the Observer you know is is maybe the center that affects everything around it so I mean just by having uh the obser ever affects something means that you know Consciousness is sort of a center point of the universe each individual Consciousness let&#x27;s say is a center of of totality I mean that&#x27;s how I see it yeah well certainly uh and some physicists have really pressed that point home uh Eugene vigner was especially uh pressed that point that really as long as we&#x27;re leaving Consciousness out we&#x27;re making a mistake and Consciousness is somehow involved in the observation process and certainly from a physics standpoint um any measurement which yields information to an individual obviously somewhere along the line had Consciousness involved so it&#x27;s a case of well just how much was it involved and John Wheeler who&#x27;s one of the icons of physics U has made a big issue out of uh you know that it&#x27;s a participatory universe as his phrase rather than just a remote obser</p>
