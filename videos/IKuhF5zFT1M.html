            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p> - Since I was a kid growing up  at the height of the Cold War,  I was always fascinated  by the deepest,  darkest secrets  of our government.  What weren&#x27;t they telling us?  ♪ ♪  Some people believe there&#x27;s</p>
<p> a huge government secret  hiding right beneath  our feet...  ♪ ♪  An entire network  of military bases  and top secret facilities  under the ground.</p>
<p> But is there any evidence  of this massive  subterranean lair? Is something going on down there that we don&#x27;t know about?  ♪ ♪ - Absolutely.  ♪ ♪  - We know that the military  started moving underground  during the Cold War,</p>
<p> back in the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s. - That&#x27;s the end of the world right there.  - And rumors that started  in 1955  about an underground base</p>
<p> called Area 51  were only confirmed  by the FBI in 2013. This is intense.  But some suspicious line items  in the military budget...</p>
<p>- There&#x27;s about $50 billion for classified programs.  - And even more suspicious  patents that were purchased  by the federal government... - They&#x27;re using heat to tunnel</p>
<p>through and melt rock. - Oh, man! - This is science fiction to me.  Could indicate that there&#x27;s  way more happening  beneath the surface</p>
<p> than we ever imagined. &quot;Patrolled by military dog teams.&quot; That is top secret stuff. [gun cocks]  So I&#x27;m headed deep  into the underworld...</p>
<p>- Go, go, go.  - To see what I can find out.  ♪ ♪ The &quot;Eagle&quot; has landed. And this is just the beginning.  ♪ ♪  Right beneath our feet,  there are cities</p>
<p> hidden by time.  They hold the clues  that could rewrite history.  [dog barks]  [bell tolls]  ♪ ♪  Into the abyss, huh?  ♪ ♪ Whoo-hoo!  I&#x27;m Don Wildman,  and my mission is to explore  the farthest and deepest</p>
<p> reaches of our planet,  using cutting-edge  technology...  How cool is that?  To dig into the greatest  mysteries of our past...  ♪ ♪  Going deep into the cities</p>
<p> of the underworld.  ♪ ♪ I used to go to grade school, and, just like fire drills, we would do duck and cover drills,  which were for nuclear attack, which was ridiculous when you consider the fact that no way is anybody</p>
<p>surviving this thing, much less eight-year-olds with their jackets over their heads in the basement.  But those were the kinds  of things  that were part of life</p>
<p> in the &#x27;50s and the &#x27;60s.  The imminence of nuclear  holocaust is much less a daily thought on the average American&#x27;s mind today than it was when I was young.  The Cold War is long over,  but some declassified relics</p>
<p> from that era  may show that  the nuclear threat from Russia  was just the beginning  of a secret underground  that only top-level officials  in the government know about.  ♪ ♪  Usually, when I go</p>
<p> into the underworld,  I&#x27;m rappelling  into murky caves  or squeezing  through tight crevices  in some ancient ruin.  But this is gonna be  different--  an underground world  built in secrecy  with high-level</p>
<p> military technology.  And I couldn&#x27;t be  more excited.  ♪ ♪  My first stop is  in the Arizona desert,  at one of the many</p>
<p> decommissioned Titan 2  missile sites  that exist across the country. Wow, it smells like a military base, doesn&#x27;t it? - Yeah.  ♪ ♪  - These missile silos</p>
<p> were underground structures  built during the Cold War,  ♪ ♪  constructed to house  an arsenal of nuclear warheads  to deter the Russian threat.  ♪ ♪  And it was all done  in total secrecy. Wow.</p>
<p>This is intense. How far underground are we at this point? - We&#x27;re 35 feet. - Wow. You worked in the silo.</p>
<p>- Yes, during the height of the Cold War. - What was that like? What did that feel like? - It was boring and scary at the same time.</p>
<p>Kind of had the weight of the world on your shoulders. - You were aware of that feeling. - Absolutely.</p>
<p>- Interesting.  ♪ ♪  David Harutunian was a Titan 2  ballistic missile analyst  during the Cold War.  His job was to wait  for this phone to ring.</p>
<p> And if it did, he&#x27;d put  this key into this switch  and launch a nuclear attack.  And if it happened,  it would&#x27;ve all taken  less than 60 seconds.  How crazy is that? So your day of work</p>
<p>was to make sure that this thing was up and ready to go. - State of readiness. 24 hours a day. You thought you could launch</p>
<p>at any moment. But the thing that was most upsetting about it was if we had the launch order, we knew an attack was coming, and we knew that all our loved ones would die.</p>
<p>- Mm.  The Titan 2 was built in 1961,  when a telephone  looked like this,  a television looked like this,  and a baby&#x27;s car seat  looked something like this.  ♪ ♪  And yet, this secret</p>
<p> underground facility  had some  insanely cool technology. - So this is a long cableway. - Whew, that&#x27;s amazing. - This thing is built</p>
<p>to be like a Slinky, so it can move up and down, side to side. We had to be protected from the shockwave. - Yeah.</p>
<p>- It&#x27;s gonna be like the world&#x27;s worst earthquake if a nuclear detonation went off up there. - Right. Right. - And it&#x27;s a cableway,</p>
<p>&#x27;cause it&#x27;s all the cables coming from the control center to the missile.  - The cableway is  a massive version  of the shocks in your car,  designed to protect  this entire underground base  from any nuclear explosions</p>
<p> above. So, you&#x27;re down there, two hundred and some feet away from the rocket, which is up here. - This is the silo,</p>
<p>and this is the launch tube. The missile sits in the launch tube,  protected by that  really heavy door. - Man, that&#x27;s a hard door</p>
<p>to push.  ♪ ♪ Oh, my Lord.  Look at that.  ♪ ♪  That&#x27;s crazy.  ♪ ♪ Incredible.</p>
<p>Wow. There you go.  So give me some read  on what I&#x27;m looking at here.  - It&#x27;s 103 feet tall.</p>
<p> It weighs 330,000 pounds  fully loaded.  - Mm-hmm.  - It has 430,000 pounds  of thrust,  which is equivalent</p>
<p> to two 747s  at full throttle.  - Wow. How fast does it take for this to get to its target in the Soviet Union? - About 30 minutes. It&#x27;s gonna go about</p>
<p>17,000 miles an hour. - Wow.  To put into perspective  how ridiculously fast  this Titan missile was,  the commercial airplanes  we fly in today--  they go around 570 miles</p>
<p> per hour top speed.  So this nuclear missile  flies about 30 times faster. And what is the actual bomb? - It&#x27;s a nine-megaton bomb, which is equivalent to 9 million tons of TNT.</p>
<p> ♪ ♪  - How does that compare  to Hiroshima?  - It&#x27;s 600 times  more powerful  than Hiroshima.  - Jesus.  Unbelievable.</p>
<p>And how many facilities with this nuclear missile were ready to go on a single phone call? - 54. - That&#x27;s crazy. - Absolutely.</p>
<p>- So in the case of nuclear attack, 54 Titan 2 missiles  all lift off  basically at the same time? - Only totally retaliatory, not a first strike weapon. If the Soviet Union</p>
<p>launched against us, this was the deterrent. Mutually assured destruction. The 54 Titans were going to wipe out 54 of their cities or military bases.</p>
<p>- Yeah. That&#x27;s where it just enters into a whole &#x27;nother realm. I mean, it&#x27;s just hard to conceive of that much destruction.</p>
<p>And today, even more so. - Today more so. There&#x27;s more of them, and they&#x27;re more accurate.  ♪ ♪ - So we&#x27;re at the top</p>
<p>of the missile. How far down is the bottom? - The bottom&#x27;s 146 feet down.  ♪ ♪ - Wow. That&#x27;s insane. - This is where</p>
<p>the engines would sit. - Man. And that&#x27;s the-- that&#x27;s the end of the world right there.  ♪ ♪  This once-top secret</p>
<p> underground base  was built in 1960,  and the public had no idea  that we had 54 weapons  of mass destruction  hidden deep below ground  until 30 years later.  ♪ ♪  So what else</p>
<p> could our government  be hiding today?  ♪ ♪  One thing that caught  the attention of the public  was some very covert  government activity  in remote parts  of the American West.  Back in the &#x27;50s,  the government</p>
<p> prohibited the public  from entering  a fenced-off region  of the Nevada desert  called Area 51.  ♪ ♪  Around the same time,  there were numerous sightings  of unidentified</p>
<p> flying objects nearby.  ♪ ♪  And so the theories began:  they&#x27;re conducting  experiments on aliens,  or reverse-engineering  a downed spacecraft.  And the theories get wilder</p>
<p> and wilder  the deeper  you go down the wormhole.  ♪ ♪ - Flying saucers exist.  Mankind should be alarmed.  ♪ ♪  - One thing we certainly know</p>
<p> is that the government denied  Area 51&#x27;s existence  until a Freedom of Information  Act request  in 2013.  ♪ ♪  They admitted that since  the 1950s, an underground base  at Area 51 has been developing  secret weapons and spy planes.</p>
<p> ♪ ♪  So what about the aliens?  We may never know,  because all current activities  at the base are classified.  ♪ ♪  And the government  seems to be remarkably good  at keeping secrets.</p>
<p> So, what I&#x27;m curious about is  what else is hiding  down there.  And how massive could  a U.S. secret underground  actually be? There you go.</p>
<p>&quot;Warning: U.S. Air Force installation. &quot;Unlawful to enter. Patrolled</p>
<p>by military dog teams.&quot; That is Nellis Air Force Base right in there. But we&#x27;re not going inside. Because this--this fence defines the whole perimeter of the place.</p>
<p> This is one of many  military installations throughout the state. Top secret stuff.  ♪ ♪  Just a quick dune buggy trip  outside Las Vegas  takes us to this location,  which may be the origin  of our government&#x27;s  fascination  with secret underground</p>
<p> operations.  ♪ ♪  In the early &#x27;50s,  this is where some of  the first nuclear weapons  were developed and tested.  ♪ ♪  Back in Vegas,  the mushroom clouds  were so visible  that a new phenomenon</p>
<p> known as atomic tourism  exploded on the Strip.  ♪ ♪  Restaurants and bars  would organize happy hour  watching parties.  So the tourists  were having a blast,  but eventually,</p>
<p> the nuclear explosions  were also enjoyed  by enemy satellites,  and the U.S. feared  that Russia  was collecting valuable intel  about our nuclear  capabilities.</p>
<p> ♪ ♪  So the military took  the entire operation  underground,  performing nuclear tests  below.  This site  is still operational,  but you&#x27;d never know it</p>
<p> from above ground,  and only a classified few know  the true scope  of the operations.  But locals have reported  military vehicles  disappearing into the Earth.  And there&#x27;s rumors</p>
<p> of a network  of hidden labs and tunnels  stretching for miles  in every direction. There you go. You&#x27;ve got military here, and you&#x27;ve got this theory that the underground</p>
<p>is more than meets the eye. We can&#x27;t go in here, and we can&#x27;t know quite possibly what&#x27;s under there until we go looking for it.  I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s</p>
<p> any modern technology  that might show whether this  secret military underworld  could actually exist.  ♪ ♪  [dramatic music]  - We found out  after the Cold War  that the U.S. government</p>
<p> constructed  top secret missile silos  and nuclear testing facilities  underground.  ♪ ♪  Now, 70 years later,  some believe that  these operations still exist  and that there might be  even larger underground bases  the public doesn&#x27;t know about.</p>
<p> ♪ ♪  It&#x27;s fascinating,  but is it possible? [bell rings] [elevator whirring]  To learn more about how one  of these underground bases  could actually be constructed,  I&#x27;ve come to Fort Wayne,  Indiana, to explore  the underworld  with Lance Waddell,  chief engineer of the  Three Rivers Tunnel Project,  to get an idea of how</p>
<p> these underground bases  could be made. The &quot;Eagle&quot; has landed.  ♪ ♪  Is it even possible to do  a gigantic engineering project  underground in total secrecy? You don&#x27;t really get the perspective until you&#x27;re down here.</p>
<p>How deep is this thing?  - About 240 feet.  - My Lord. And this is just the beginning.  ♪ ♪ What&#x27;s that? - That is St. Barbara.</p>
<p>We always have her underground where the work is, because she&#x27;s the patron saint of miners. - How worried are you about things going wrong? - You get used to it</p>
<p>after a while. - Look at you. You can deal with it. - You hear that rumbling sound? That&#x27;s the locomotive coming up.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s our ride. - I didn&#x27;t buy a ticket, but okay. - [bangs on train] Good, Martin!  ♪ ♪  - The tunnel system that Lance</p>
<p> and his team are digging  is five miles long  and 19 feet in diameter,  running nearly 20 stories  below the surface.  When it&#x27;s done, 850 billion  gallons of sewage overflow  will run through it</p>
<p> every year,  instead of into one  of the three rivers above.  ♪ ♪  While this isn&#x27;t  a secret government tunnel,  I&#x27;d like to find out  how they&#x27;re building  this public project  to see if you could even dig  a tunnel system like this  without anyone above ground</p>
<p> knowing about it.  ♪ ♪  So we&#x27;re headed straight  into the belly of the beast.  ♪ ♪ Whoa! - My bad. - Follow you.  ♪ ♪ - Everything we&#x27;re seeing</p>
<p>is the machine itself. It&#x27;s basically a 400-foot long worm working itself through the earth. And as it goes, it&#x27;s building</p>
<p>its own tunnel behind it.  I&#x27;m actually inside the TBM,  the tunnel boring machine  that&#x27;s used to build  this kind of massive tunnel.  This thing is longer</p>
<p> than a football field,  and the machine actually  constructs the tunnel as it moves through the earth. - This is a probe drill. So the machine cuts a 19-foot diameter hole.</p>
<p>- Okay. - There&#x27;s seven of these motors, and when they&#x27;re all pushing, driving that machine...  - Yep.</p>
<p> - It&#x27;s up to 8.4 million  pounds of force.  - Wow. What happens to the rock it carves away?  - As the rock is cut up,  it falls into the bottom</p>
<p> of the excavation chamber,  and it&#x27;s mixed  with water slurry mix, and it&#x27;s pumped all the way to the surface,  then hauled out.  - Tons and tons of debris. - About 35 tons an hour.</p>
<p>- Really?  The huge cutting face  is obviously an effective tool  when it comes  to digging a tunnel.  But 35 tons of debris  an hour being shot  back up to the surface  would make it impossible</p>
<p> to dig  a network like this in secret.  To get rid of all that debris,  you&#x27;d need an endless parade  of dump trucks  carrying the rubble away.  Between that  and the expansive work site  itself,  enemies could easily monitor</p>
<p> a tunnel project  from spy satellites.  So, looking into this theory  that the U.S. government  and military have  a top secret network  of underground bases,  they&#x27;d need to create</p>
<p> a very different technology,  one that doesn&#x27;t create  a mountain of debris  on the surface.  As far as I know,  there&#x27;s no drill  that can make rock and dirt  evaporate into thin air.</p>
<p> Or is there? &quot;Method and apparatus for tunneling by melting.&quot; Melting?  ♪ ♪  [rustic music]  ♪ ♪  - Since the 1950s,  the U.S. government has  built underground structures  and kept them secret  from the public.</p>
<p> ♪ ♪  In the last 70 years,  we&#x27;ve found out about a few.  But the Cold War kid in me  wants to know  what else they could be hiding  beneath our feet.</p>
<p> We&#x27;ve seen that the method  of tunneling  used for public projects  would be impossible  to keep secret.  ♪ ♪  So I&#x27;m meeting with up  with David Childress,  an author and researcher</p>
<p> who&#x27;s spent decades  looking into the deepest,  darkest secrets  of the U.S. government.  David says he may have  the smoking gun  that shows how the secret</p>
<p> underworld is being built.  ♪ ♪ - All around the Nellis Air Force Base and Area 51 is a vast network of tunnels,  and many of these tunnels  are in the base,  but some of these tunnels  and entrances  go outside the base.</p>
<p> Since the 1950s, the locals in that area have reported seeing convoys  of military vehicles  driving down the road  and then just  suddenly disappearing.  - Hmm.</p>
<p>On one hand, it doesn&#x27;t surprise me. It&#x27;s a military base. It&#x27;s very secretive. - And it&#x27;s huge, too.</p>
<p>- Right. What I want to know is, could someone create a massive underground base without anybody knowing about it? - They do have the technology. This is a 1972 patent</p>
<p>from DARPA. - &quot;United States Patent, September 26th, 1972. Method and apparatus for tunnelling by melting.&quot; Melting? So they&#x27;re using heat</p>
<p>to actually tunnel. - They&#x27;re using heat to tunnel through and melt rock. In a normal tunnelling device, you would have a lot of rubble coming out the back.</p>
<p>- Yeah, yeah. - And you would need tons of trucks and things like that to haul all this rubble out. - Of course, yeah.</p>
<p>- But with the thermonuclear tunneling device, you don&#x27;t need that. It&#x27;s very clean. It doesn&#x27;t create a lot of waste and rubble.</p>
<p>- It sounds science fiction to me. I mean, this is sci-fi stuff.  So each mile of a tunnel  20 feet in diameter  creates enough rubble</p>
<p> to fill 18 Olympic-sized  swimming pools.  But according to this patent,  which was purchased  by the U.S. government,  huge tunnels can be dug deep  underground with zero debris.</p>
<p> Here&#x27;s how it works:  the nuclear reactor inside  heats the drill tip  to over 2,000 degrees  Fahrenheit.  Six hydraulic cylinders  with 18 million pounds  of thrust push the drill</p>
<p> through the earth,  turning all of the rock  into glass  that lines the walls  of the tunnel.  This is absolutely  mind-boggling--  if it actually exists.</p>
<p> ♪ ♪ What you&#x27;re suggesting, thanks to this technology, is that there&#x27;s a vastness to this that we&#x27;re not aware of, not to mention the depth, and that it&#x27;s totally secret, because there was no evidence of this being done.</p>
<p>- That&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s a vast network that runs throughout the entire U.S., from the East Coast all the way to California. - What would be the purpose</p>
<p>of this? - You have a network of underground bases, and then there are tunnels... - Right. - That are connecting them, starting in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>- No kidding. - Yeah.  Even if Washington, D.C.  is a radioactive wasteland,  these guys can still be  in charge and in touch  with various parts</p>
<p> of the military... - Mm-hmm. - From these underground bases. - I mean, I still don&#x27;t know if it truly works, but here it is</p>
<p>in a United States patent. It&#x27;s crazy.  - Yeah.  - In theory, this drill  could create a massive network  of subterranean tunnels</p>
<p> and bases in total secrecy.  But that&#x27;s in theory.  Could it actually work?  ♪ ♪  I&#x27;ve reached out  to the smartest man I know,  world-renowned geologist  Eric Drummond.</p>
<p>You got it all going on here. - Yeah, we got a rock here, brought in from the field, got a drill here, and we&#x27;ll do some drilling.  - I sent Eric</p>
<p> the nuclear drill patent,  and he designed an experiment  to see  if it could possibly work. So, we&#x27;re gonna compare basically old drilling versus new drilling? - Yes. - All right,</p>
<p>let&#x27;s get down to it.  First, we&#x27;ll replicate  traditional  hard-rock drilling,  like the kind we saw back  at Three Rivers,  using an extremely  scaled-down drill bit  and a scaled-down</p>
<p> chunk of rock. - I got a charley horse. [both laugh]  ♪ ♪ - There we go. - Nice. - We&#x27;ve made a tunnel,</p>
<p>and we made a mess. - Yes, you did. - If this was a mountainside, and this was a big tunnel, I mean, this is just piles and piles of the stuff.</p>
<p>- Yeah. - If you&#x27;re gonna try to be sneaky about it, if you&#x27;re just sort of doing it under the radar, this is not the way to go. - Right.</p>
<p> - Now we&#x27;ll try to do  a scaled-down version  of the nuclear drill  that leaves no rubble behind. So what do we have here? What is that? - It&#x27;s a plasma torch.</p>
<p> - We&#x27;ll fire up  the plasma torch  to around 2,200 degrees  Fahrenheit,  the temperature of the  patented nuclear drill bit.  I want to see</p>
<p> if that technology  can create a tunnel  that leaves no evidence.  ♪ ♪ - Whoa! Oh, man! - That&#x27;s it? That was almost too easy. That&#x27;s amazing. I mean, it went right</p>
<p>through that rock. And I don&#x27;t see any kind of debris around it. Look how clear that is. - Yeah, got the glass.</p>
<p>- That&#x27;s the glass. - What impressed me was Andrea went through this in mere seconds, like that. - Exactly. - It took us, I don&#x27;t know, 20 minutes to do</p>
<p>with the conventional drill.  ♪ ♪ - So there you go. I mean, that sells it pretty well to me. You can scale this up</p>
<p>very easily--in my mind, anyway--that this could create massive tunnel systems in a fraction of time with no debris.  I mean, out of sight,  out of mind.</p>
<p> You could be doing this  all over the place, as long as that technology exists. - Yeah. - I mean, that&#x27;s the leap.</p>
<p>Assuming that a nuclear drill has been developed, then we&#x27;ve got our answer. That basically proves it right there. - Yeah.</p>
<p> ♪ ♪  [dramatic music]  ♪ ♪  - it&#x27;s no secret  that the U.S. government  has underground facilities  they built  during the Cold War. - It&#x27;s a nine-megaton bomb, which is equivalent</p>
<p>to 9 million tons of TNT.  - But some people believe the  U.S. has a secret underground  that&#x27;s much more expansive  than we know.</p>
<p>- It&#x27;s a vast network that runs through the entire U.S.  - In 1972, the government  bought a patent  for a nuclear drill  that would allow them to dig  underground spaces  incredibly fast</p>
<p> and without anyone knowing  what was happening  deep beneath the surface. [torch hissing] - Ooh! It went right through that rock in mere seconds. [train horn whistling]  - But here&#x27;s the big question:</p>
<p> why would they do this?  And what would this secret  underground even look like?  To find out,  I&#x27;m headed to West Virginia.  ♪ ♪  - Hey, Don. - Wow.</p>
<p>- How are you today? - This place is amazing. Incredible. - Yeah. - It dazzles the eyes.  - That&#x27;s right, that&#x27;s right.</p>
<p> - Welcome to the Greenbrier,  a five-star luxury resort  in White Sulphur Springs.  ♪ ♪ It&#x27;s still grand, but back in the day, this was one of the premier places.</p>
<p>- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  - This hotel was a hotspot  for celebrity weddings  and high society types.  ♪ ♪  But for years,  it had a big secret  hiding</p>
<p> beneath its shiny exterior.  ♪ ♪ [elevator music playing] [clears throat] ♪ ♪  To find out what it is,  you need to go over 700 feet  into the ground.  ♪ ♪ The Greenbrier was built in 1913.</p>
<p> But in 1948, the resort  entered into an agreement  with the United States  government,  and a new construction began.  ♪ ♪  The hotel would add  another wing,  complete with new rooms</p>
<p> and an exhibition hall.  ♪ ♪  But meanwhile, underneath,  the government would covertly  construct  a secret fallout shelter  for high-ranking  government officials  that no one in the public</p>
<p> would know about  until over 30 years later,  when, in 1992, a journalist  exposed the secret.  ♪ ♪  This humongous  two-story bunker  is the length  of two football fields,  extending 718 feet  deep into the</p>
<p> West Virginia countryside. [elevator bell dings] - You come out, it just looks like a regular part of the hotel. - Sure. - But then it turns out-- - Oh, there you go.</p>
<p> ♪ ♪ Now this looks like a nuclear bunker. So this is the door that protects it all, huh? - Yeah, 25 tons of steel and concrete.</p>
<p>- That&#x27;s impressive. So this is the Cold War. Let&#x27;s say the Cuban Missile Crisis happens. Huge emergency event.</p>
<p>They would show up at this place. - Right. - And they&#x27;re stashed in here  for an indefinite period  of time,  and at that point,</p>
<p> they&#x27;re sealed shut.  - Oh, yeah.  - Well, this would be  a very, very bad day.  ♪ ♪ Insane.</p>
<p>All right. So this is where you really get a sense of the scope of this operation. - Yes, yes. This is the part  that the government</p>
<p> had exclusive control over. [alarm blaring]  - Beyond that big door,  only people  with top-level clearances  would be allowed in  by the U.S. military,  who controlled the facility.</p>
<p> This tunnel leads to a complex  that would house  more than 1,000 people  for over six months.  The bunker had 18 dormitories  crammed with bunk beds...</p>
<p> - It&#x27;s just room after room.  - Along with a power plant  with purification equipment,  three 25,000-gallon  water tanks, and an infirmary. How many people</p>
<p>were gonna live down there? - 1,100. - Interesting. I mean, they didn&#x27;t know about this plan, they were just told at the very last minute, &quot;Sorry, this is where</p>
<p>you&#x27;re going. Come with us.&quot; - Yes. - Whew, my Lord. Wow, what&#x27;s this place? - So, if somebody</p>
<p>had been exposed, you take your clothes off, and they go in here, and then they&#x27;re going to burn them. - Okay. - And then all you need</p>
<p>is high-pressure water  to just wash that off. - It&#x27;s like a car wash. - Exactly. And then this room had all the supplies.</p>
<p>So everybody&#x27;s gonna be in fatigues.  - To imagine coming down  to this level  of wearing fatigues  and--you know,  quite a shock</p>
<p> to the system psychologically. - Yes, yes. - And they&#x27;re not with their families. - Right.</p>
<p>- They&#x27;re worried about their health. - Right. - Everything precious has possibly been lost. Who knows, maybe the country</p>
<p>is occupied at this point. - Right, and that uncertainty. You don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going on out there.  - It&#x27;s quite an amazing</p>
<p> situation to imagine.  - Yes.  It is a terrifying scenario.  - Yeah.  ♪ ♪  It&#x27;s refreshing to know that</p>
<p> smarter people than myself  have contingencies worked out  for even the most devastating  of circumstances.  ♪ ♪  But who exactly was this  elaborate shelter built for? Oh, that&#x27;s amazing. Look at that.</p>

<p>- The House of Representatives. - There you go. - Right. - So this is for the Congress. - Yes.</p>
<p>And then there&#x27;s a smaller room on the other side for the Senate. This was an emergency relocation center  for the legislative branch  of the federal government.</p>
<p>This was one component of the continuity of government program. ♪ ♪  - At the onset  of the Cold War,  President Harry Truman  signed into law  a program that directed</p>
<p> all branches of government  to form an emergency plan  in case of nuclear attack.  He ordered each branch  to prepare a secure location  that would permit  the continued operation  of government  in a time of crisis.</p>
<p> ♪ ♪ So the separation of powers is behind this whole thing. Even in the face of nuclear disaster, the U.S. government</p>
<p>still has to be maintained as the structure that&#x27;s in the Constitution. - Exactly.  - So the story of this place  is really hiding  in plain sight, in the biggest sense</p>
<p>of the word. - For sure.  - And right under  everyone&#x27;s nose,  this bunker remained a total  secret for over 30 years,  until 1992, when, at the end</p>
<p> of the Cold War,  it was decommissioned  and declassified.  ♪ ♪  But it&#x27;s a glimpse into how  these underground facilities  are designed  and the government&#x27;s  anticipation of their need,  emergency or otherwise.</p>
<p> And given the revolutionary  advancements of science  and engineering  over the last 70 years,  maybe even  with nuclear-powered  drilling technology,  what would the secret nuclear  facilities of today look like?  How advanced, and how much</p>
<p> more massive, could they be?  [dramatic music]  - From underground  nuclear missile silos,  test sites, and bunkers  designed to move the entire  government underground,  there is already an underworld  right here in the U.S.  ♪ ♪  But how many sites are there?  ♪ ♪  To find out, I&#x27;m meeting up</p>
<p> with Todd Harrison,  who analyzes  the defense budget every year.  ♪ ♪  Could there be something  in the budget  that tells us the scope  of the secret underground? What percentage of budgets</p>
<p>eventually get seen? - Very few, actually. But you can see some. If you look at the budget documents today... - Yeah.</p>
<p>- You can actually see which line items are going for classified programs. And there&#x27;s about $50 billion dollars out of that defense budget</p>
<p>that is marked as being for classified programs and activities.  ♪ ♪  - Some people call this  $50-billion secret fund  &quot;The Black Budget.&quot;  ♪ ♪  Sounds mysterious, right?  I actually thought  it more likely to be fodder  for conspiracy theory</p>
<p> chat rooms,  rather than a reality.  ♪ ♪ Is there such a thing as a Black Budget? - There is. That&#x27;s the classified budget. It&#x27;s black.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t see in there. You can&#x27;t see all of the details unless you have the proper clearances.  You can see lots</p>
<p> of interesting code names,  like tractor rut,  a lot of them  that begin with &quot;tractor.&quot; [both laugh] But you can&#x27;t see precisely what it&#x27;s being used for. What we can tell is, you know, like 40, 50 years ago, things have been declassified</p>
<p>now, and we now know that we were investing a lot of money  into figuring out how to build  and operate a spy satellite.  - Interesting. I&#x27;m thinking about</p>
<p>what&#x27;s happening underground. Advanced military technology, Black or otherwise--have you ever heard of such a thing as a nuclear-powered drill? I mean, a big-time drill? - I have not, but that&#x27;s not that different than a nuclear weapon that&#x27;s designed to penetrate</p>
<p>the ground before it detonates. We have those. - Sure. - They could take that technology and, through classified programs, try to apply it</p>
<p>to the subterranean world. - Sure. Nuclear-powered drills, man. Christmas is coming. - Maybe.</p>
<p> - Could we have spent some  of that $50 billion  of secret money  on a nuclear drill  for building  a massive underground  through other methods?  Todd&#x27;s research  may not be able  to confirm that just yet.</p>
<p> But we are learning that,  as more and more intel  is declassified,  it&#x27;s clear that virtually  all Black Budget spending  is for weapons and defense.  And while we know that a lot  of the military brass  in the 1950s  had their eyes to the sky,</p>

<p>built underground  command and control complexes  to survive a nuclear war  with the Soviet Union, but the Army has been reinvigorating that  for urban warfare.  We certainly saw ISIS  and al-Qaeda in Iraq</p>
<p> go underground.  The Army is preparing  for more urban conflicts,  and that&#x27;s going to be  something the military is gonna have to be prepared for against major threats, like North Korea or Iran,  that have the ability</p>
<p> to build big,  tall complexes under these  very large cities,  very, very difficult terrain  to fight in. - Mm.  Paul says that North Korea</p>
<p> alone  has at least 4,800  underground military bases.  ♪ ♪  And geographically,  the United States  is almost 100 times larger.  So it makes sense</p>
