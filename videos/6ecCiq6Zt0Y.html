            <p>to another good idea and imagine a machine that could power your house for free well that&#x27;s exactly what two Australian inventors claim they&#x27;ve developed using magnets and a battery their new generator has been described as revolutionary and foreign investors are lining up for a piece of the action Chris Allen reports so John this is the machine yes this is it Chris what&#x27;s it capable of well it&#x27;ll it&#x27;ll pair a house this will the machine will Pro provide sufficient electricity to run a house and have power to burn it&#x27;s sounds too good to be true but inventor John Christie is convinced his machine will change the world so John basically you&#x27;re saying this machine can produce five times as much power as it consumes yes it does this one exactly as we see it it does and in fact it can produce more than that once kickstarted from a battery John and his partner Lou britz say this prototype will run for years without stopping generating 2 4 Kow of power a day you don&#x27;t get more revolutionary I think I mean we&#x27;re talking about something that has the capacity to change the way that the world produces its electric power it has a capacity to change the way that Motors cars are are propelled can you can replace the combustion engine in fact John these are Big claims are you sure you can live up to them we don&#x27;t really need to live up to them Chris what what the the technology speaks for itself I mean a house holder could buy one of these machines and install it in his garage and power his house forever without buying another kilowatt from a retailer I mean that&#x27;s how serious it is Steve brassington is an independent electrical engineer he&#x27;s seen the machine and backs up everything John says it&#x27;s revolutionary that&#x27;s the only way to describe it I think the um the technology it&#x27;s not bending physics it&#x27;s just using principles um that I guess are are commonly in use in power generation today in a different way these guys have thought outside of the square basically it&#x27;s magnetic attraction and magnetic repulsion that provide the movement or the moment of the of the motor can you understand why some scientists are skeptical about it there is no physicist or or engineer who has looked at our our um motor or has looked at our figures who says it doesn&#x27;t work Lou is an electrician and John a businessman in cans in Far North Queensland the two unlikely inventors have been tinkering with their machine for 6 years they&#x27;ve applied for an international patent and have been swamped by people wanting a piece of the action the uh these the coils we mentioned the coils don&#x27;t get hot local businessman Alex Roma is one of the many offering money to help develop the generator it proves up to uh to be what they say it is certainly would be something I&#x27;d invest in John has also spoken to to millionaire inventor George Luen the man who came up with the Triton workbench and who&#x27;s Now setting up a fund to stop Australian inventions going overseas There&#x27;s an opportunity here I think to share an invention with the world um that is beyond anything that we&#x27;ve ever contemplated before scientists here at the local University say while they&#x27;re interested in John&#x27;s machine they&#x27;re also cautious they say if the machine can generate as much power as John says it can then they will have to rewrite some of the law of physics and they&#x27;ve urged people to be cautious about investing in it until the generator has been independently tested anybody who says it doesn&#x27;t work hasn&#x27;t seen it or haven&#x27;t hasn&#x27;t looked at our figures they haven&#x27;t reviewed it if they look at it they&#x27;ll all agree with us that it does work John says the household generator should be available in a year and sell for about $5,000 if he&#x27;s right it will make him much more and how much do you think your technology could be worth I have absolutely no idea we could be talking about millions of dollars here yes oh I very definitely you&#x27;re talking millions of dollars but uh I uh I&#x27;d hesitate to even take a stab at it good idea</p>
