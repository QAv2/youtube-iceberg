            <p>all right hi everyone good to see you out there welcome to my channel my name is Thomas and I do educational videos uh we&#x27;re gonna get right into a video 71 on the reciprocal system of theory and I believe this is a video number uh 49 on his final book that&#x27;s called beyond space and time Larson was a uh kind of a mining engineer and he was working on some side projects uh in his life back in the uh 20s and 30s oh and uh he uh kind of stumbled across some ideas worked on worked them out over the next 20 years while you know keeping his day job and eventually uh put out his fundamental postulates and then on the heels of those postulates wrote many many books on physics and astrophysics chemistry astronomy and um basically Theory of Everything and uh his final book is called beyond space and time and that&#x27;s the one we&#x27;re looking at it came out uh posthumously after his death in 1990. he uh this book came out I think in 1995. and and uh the postul main postulate is that the universe is not made out of matter and it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are the same in that they are reciprocals of each other uh that&#x27;s basically implied in a ratio or a relationship it&#x27;s a fraction uh the reciprocal of three is one-third three over one and the reciprocal is one over three is M over space space over time they so the qualities of both space and time adhere to each other so uh what we know about space is that it has multi-dimensional we&#x27;ll just say three dimensions x y z coordinates uh you know up you know up to the to the right and forward those are the XYZ coordinates they&#x27;re all at 90 degree angles to each other uh and that&#x27;s what we know about space uh and so those uh qualities also occur in time so time can be thought of as being three-dimensional like that uh time what we know about time is that it&#x27;s always progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later the flow of time and so we also know then by the reciprocal relation that space has those qualities also the flow of space space things are always getting further and further apart and that can be seen in the Hubble telescopes recession that observed the recession of the distant galaxies all of the galaxies are moving away from each other the further away from each other they are the faster they&#x27;re moving in the same way that if you took a balloon and you put a bunch of dots on it with a magic marker and you blew up the balloon all of the dots would be moving away from each other and the further away from each other they were the faster they would be moving apart uh and in the same way if you sucked in the balloon then they would all be moving toward each other and the further that they were away the faster they would be moving toward each other uh and so uh that is uh the other part is that uh space and time are both quantized meaning that there is a minimum unit of time and there is a minimum unit of space one unit there&#x27;s nothing less than one everything is in one unit increments and um one unit of space uh in one unit of time space over time that speed 60 miles per hour for example but one unit of space over one unit of time is the speed of light so in Larson&#x27;s system the speed of light is really like the neutral point whereas Einstein says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson says it&#x27;s the neutral point and there there&#x27;s an entire half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and Larson refers to that as the cosmic sector or sector 2. sector one is the normal sector that we&#x27;re familiar with and uh he calls that the material sector or sector one that is moving slower than the speed of light sector one uh you know uh Grows by aggregation things pile up on each other stick to each other uh and um eventually you get to the most complicated aggregation of matter and that&#x27;s the DNA molecule which has a few billion atoms in it and at that point the DNA molecule becomes uh eligible to be taken control over by a sector two component so and then that is what Larson calls the life unit so there&#x27;s a DNA that is not under the control of a life unit that is inanimate you know DNA but DNA can be activated or brought to life through a control unit and then these life units become more can become more and more complex uh and develop uh over time and eventually get to that their most complicated form which Larson says is the intelligent human being or humanoid and at that point that human being can be uh taken under the control of a sector 3 unit sector 3 is the unit that is really uh beyond space and time or independent of space and time maybe you would say the origin of the space and time uh other uh ancient books May or theories of everything may have called this God or the spirit world Larson calls it sector three and sector three uh then kind of battles for control over the uh over the body through with the sector two sector two unit is bent upon survival whereas the sector 3 unit is directed toward ethical Behavior or good behavior and so there is are certain times where those two work at Cross purposes and there&#x27;s a battle that&#x27;s going on between sector two and sector 3 for control over the body and um that uh is basically mediated through the human being&#x27;s free will so that was the last chapter that we read here chapter 17 that was called Free Will and he basically you know says now we have confirmed the existence of Free Will and we gained some understanding of the matter which is exercise so now our next objective will be to examine the nature of the choices that are made and the next four chapters will be devoted to this so chapter 18 here is called right and wrong uh perhaps there are certain principles of right and wrong founded in the nature of things and in human nature which changing in their application from age to age are yet permanent in their Central meaning and um a very striking result of the addition of new items of scientific knowledge to those that were previously available is the way in which problems that had seemed hopelessly insoluble clear up as if by Magic when they are examined in the light of the new information so it was with many of the most recalcitrant problems of physical science when the reciprocal system was first developed long-standing questions in physics in astronomy and cosmology some of which had been given up as impossible of solution were suddenly found to be explainable in simple and logical terms the same phenomenon is now being encountered in our exploration of the metaphysical Realm that is the sector three or beyond space and time in previous chapters we have seen how the miraculous Feats of inductive inference and the puzzling aspects of ESP experiments can easily be explained on a logical and purely scientific basis those are Communications from sector 3 ESP um inductive reason inductive inference intuition scientific Insight religious Revelation those are all Communications from sector three now it is clear that the facts brought out in the preceding discussion also furnish an equally logical resolution to the age-old pro age-old problem of right and wrong here is a problem that has occupied the thoughts of philosophers of theologians and of the Common Man not only for centuries but for millennia distinctions between right and wrong are continually being made by human beings even by those who have persuaded themselves that such concepts are mirror illusions but the source of the criteria upon which the distinction is based is far from self-evidence and it has been the subject of endless debate and controversy um and now he&#x27;s kind of going into a literature review uh he talks about uh and quotes John Stuart Mill uh and science has hitherto had nothing to offer in this area as most of the scientists who have considered the matter freely admit um and he cites some other people uh and then he says that philosophers have been no more successful in finding a solid basis for a system of Ethics than the scientists and in order to have anything at all to say on the subject they&#x27;ve had to resort to some kind of arbitrary assumptions on which to base their reasoning and um in the ordinary course of events if we encounter a problem our first task is to devise a method by which to approach the question at issue then we apply this method which may be nothing more than logical thinking about the problem or may involve some very complicated procedures and if the method turns out to be adequate for the purpose we arrive at an answer in the case of a reasonably simple question of right and wrong on the other hand we know the answer to begin with and the problem with which we are confronted is to identify the means by which we obtained it I have many times been uncertain oh he&#x27;s quoting uh quoting this guy Warren Weaver that um okay there is little tendency to deny the validity of the answers that are obtained by this unknown process even though even those who reject all of the religious explanations and regard ethical values as byproducts of Social and scientific prop uh progress generally concede this point I think we all know the essential values when we can think about them abstractly uh the controversial issue is where and how this knowledge originates the conclusion of this present work is that it is communicated to human beings from sector three by a process variously term Revelation Insight or intuition each level of existence has its own governing laws and principles and although they differ materially in some very important aspects each of these sets of laws and principles constitutes a self-consistent system the ethical code is simply a portion of the system of rules which govern sector three okay so now he&#x27;s bringing up this ethical code a portion of the system of rules which governs SEC sector three and the extension of that sector of existence into human life level three as we have termed it so a level three is is a person who is under the influence of sector three from this it follows that right is merely an abbreviation for in Conformity with sector 3 laws and principles whereas wrong is a term that is applicable to anything that is in conflict with these laws and principles a significant point in this connection is that those decisions which are commonly regarded as involving moral issues are decisions between only two alternatives the issue in each case can be expressed as is this right or wrong in non-moral matters there may be many choices for example if an individual has a sum of money available for spending he has many Alternatives choices that&#x27;s to what to purchase as well as the possibility of saving the funds for later use on the other hand the question as to whether a person should take advantage of an opportunity to acquire a sum of money by dishonest means is recognized by everyone as a moral issue and here as in moral issues in general the choice is specifically between two alternatives the two Alternatives of right and wrong here we are dealing with a choice between two codes of conduct two different sets of rules not with the kind of decision that is involved in determining how one&#x27;s money will be spent so Larson really refers to that as an economic decision an economic decision is one that has many different options you know you could you can go buy a candy bar or you could go buy a piece of fruit or you could you know go buy a you know a beer or something uh and all of those are you know economic decisions that you make um now they might have slight moral decisions in terms of um you know whether they&#x27;re good for you or bad for you we&#x27;ll say if we were talking about uh you know you could buy a red shirt you could buy a green shirt or you could buy a blue shirt those are and you could buy a white shirt a black shirt um you know you have all of these different options but when it comes down to right and wrong it&#x27;s it&#x27;s you have two choices either right or wrong the definition of right as Conformity with the laws and principles of sector three does not necessarily conflict with the religious doctor and that right means according to the will of God the will of God if it exists can just as logically be expressed in the form of a set of laws and principles applicable to sector 3 existence in general as in the form of a code by which to judge right and wrong directly the present investigation does not resolve the issue as to the ultimate origin of the moral code but it does advance the consideration of the matter by a few important steps it shows that there is an intelligent existence outside space and time which may have the characteristics attributed to it by the theologians it shows that Communications from this outside sector of existence can be and are received through the processes variously termed Revelation Insight Etc and it shows that the Notions of right and wrong are based on the laws and principles governing the outside sector transmitted to the human race by intuition and revelation and insight in view of this substantial area of agreement it may it must be conceded that the religious answer to the question of moral judgment the question upon what principle do we discriminate between right and wrong is consistent with the scientific findings here and presented but this is likewise true of some uh different explanations such as Emmanuel Kant uh rejected the religious answer and advanced the contention that the moral code is an inherent endowment of our Consciousness part of a store of a priori knowledge that is available to us simply because we&#x27;re rational beings this is correct but the reason why our status as rational human beings gives gives us the answers to moral questions is that human beings are in communication through intuitive Channels with sector three where the moral code originates theories based on ethical relativism the system of thought which holds that there are no absolute standards of right and wrong and that the proper criteria for ethical judgments vary with the culture involved and with the individual circumstances are in direct conflict with the results of this investigation and must be rejected so Larson flat out rejects ethical relativism there is a right and there is a wrong um and they come from sector three and there isn&#x27;t this oh in a certain culture this is okay but in this culture it&#x27;s not okay and they&#x27;re both right he rejects that okay now um support for ethical relatives activism stems largely from the observation that man&#x27;s ideas of right and wrong depend to a considerable extent on the particular culture in which he lives religious prohibitions with respect to the eating of certain foods are frequently cited as an example these prohibitions have the force of moral law for the believer but they are meaningless to those who do not subscribe to the religious beliefs that are involved from items from such items as this the relativists have concluded that moral principles in general have no objective status but derive their validity from the particular cultural study setting in which they exist the positivists and Allied philosophical groups carry this argument even further and contend that the existence of so many conflicts and uncertainties in the various moral codes is sufficient evidence to show that there is no such thing as a definite standard of moral right and wrong um then he uh cites AJ eyer uh Richard Von mises and um one can point out in detail innumerable cases um in which the uncertainty in the Judgment of single ways of behavior contradicts the existence of an inborn Norm common to all people the second uh religious conception of the moral laws is invalidated by the fact that the allegedly revealed Commandments are so vague and incomplete that their application requires continually new interpretation which after all is a work of the inner intellect so those are kind of positive positivist arguments the weakness of the foregoing arguments can easily be seen by reference to the discussion in earlier chapters as they&#x27;re brought out the moral codes promulgated by the religious authorities are by no means confined to the principles which the founders of the various religions formulated as a result of insight or revelation okay uh it looks like we&#x27;re out of time so we can uh we can start back here uh when we resume next time have a great day we&#x27;ll see you soon</p>
