            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Hey, what&#x27;s up guys? It&#x27;s Justin with Hydrogen Fuel Technologies on YouTube. Hydrogen Sorcery on Tik Tok. It is December 14th, 2025, about 6:35 p.m. And uh I just saw this come out. This is uh coion and Anthony energy, George Eagley on Tim Mature podcast.</p>
<p>Um I just subscribed to this guy. I don&#x27;t know who he is, but really well done. I&#x27;m not going to steal his thunder. I would I would steal the video, post it online, but he gets more views than I do, which was good to see. Uh anyway, you can read through this about George Eagley.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to play just a few minutes of it &gt;&gt; in Ventura. And we&#x27;re joined today by Dr. George Egley, a mechanical engineer and independent researcher known for his work on energy science on topics ranging from low energy nuclear reactions and dusty plasmas to bioenergy measurement. He earned his mers in mechanical engineering from the technical university of Budapest in 1974 and a PhD in heat and energy transport in 1982. Early in his career, he researched nuclear plant thermal hydraulics at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Nuclear Energy Research Lab and spent 1981 and82 as a visiting researcher at Brook Haven National Laboratory.</p>
<p>In 1993, Dr. Egley founded Egley Research and Development where he developed the Egy Wheel vitality meter as part of his longunning foray into biopysics. More recently, his work has focused on low energy nuclear reactions and direct electrical output from plasma devices, which he&#x27;s published as a multi-part series in Infinite Energy magazine and presented at the International Conference on Cold Fusion. He also holds patent filings on an apparatus and methods for generating condensed plasmoids recently published in 2025. Dr.</p>
<p>Egley currently serves as the editor of Infinite Energy, the magazine of new energy technology, a bimonthly publication focused on theory and experimental research in alternative energy topics, including cold fusion, 0 point energy, and more, which are the focus of our discussion today. So, George, welcome. It is truly a pleasure and a great honor to have you with me, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. Uh just one more uh by sentence that I&#x27;m a distant relative of Edward Teller who is the father of the US age.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not going to play this whole thing. It&#x27;s an hour long. I highly encourage you to go and watch it. Um I&#x27;ll put the link in the description. But I want to talk about a few things about this.</p>
<p>This is infinite energy right here. Uh, I guess this has officially been shut down, which is unfortunate. Uh, you could go here and get um old publications. I used to have a whole burn CDs worth of Infinite Energy magazine. And notice you&#x27;re getting the cool stuff like of note metal hydrogen energy with nano powder.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s up our alley right there. This is from June 2024. Infinite energy. Now, something to think about with this infinite energy now that they&#x27;ve officially scrubbed it and you have to go through this uh way back machine to get it. understand that there is a wealth of information uh centralized in declassified energy and propulsion sector of uh these laboratories and these corporations that got published in infinite energy magazine.</p>
<p>Now understand is you could take those and you could throw them into artificial intelligence and have the AI analyze the data there and you can use that as a quick way of going through tens of thousands of pages of data from different laboratories to see where uh the results got everybody so on and so forth. So, you may want to go ahead and go up here and get yourself some I&#x27;m sure you could find these on. There&#x27;s other ways of finding these back, but Infinite Energy magazine is probably one that um they took officially. He even says it in the interview that he officially shut the the main website down. And uh like if you go here infiniteenergy.com site can&#x27;t be reached.</p>
<p>So understand take that as a a way of if you&#x27;re a researcher into this stuff and you&#x27;re going to be jumping into the future with this artificial intelligence. It&#x27;d probably be wise to get a bunch of back issues of Infinite Energy magazine as data to feed into this new AI. At any rate, you know, he&#x27;s a PhD from the Budapest University of Technology. I&#x27;ve followed his work for quite some time as well. I&#x27;ve read some of his papers.</p>
<p>Uh, beautiful place he went to school at. Uh, I&#x27;ve tried to follow this stuff as much as I could. The ICCF conference proceedings and they&#x27;ve been going on at some prestigious places. Rome, Italy in 2009. I remember when I first got into the research.</p>
<p>Um, when one of my idols was was Dr. Mike Mccubry. Uh, I remember looking at a lot of stuff from here and understanding now that all roads lead to Rome. As Jordan Maxwell, the great esoteric occult researcher said, all roads lead to Rome. This is true yesterday.</p>
<p>This is true today. And it seems will be true tomorrow. Again, my phone always wants to beep and notifi not notify me at strange times in the matrix. Confirmation on that, sir. Anyway, it was held in, you know, been held in Japan and the Asian countries a lot, especially Japan because Japan is at the forefront of the hydrogen research and always has been.</p>
<p>And because they&#x27;re so small and minuscule compared to Russia and the United States, they never were able to flourish like they should have been in terms of the hydrogen and cold fusion research. They&#x27;re also at the forefront of using hydrogen for health. And I&#x27;m in a bit of a it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a one-way argument, but I&#x27;m in a bit of a argument with one of my old school research buddies, or at least I thought he was my friend that he wanted to attack me and call me insane in the membrane because I kept studying this stuff and I guess he just didn&#x27;t. He just decided he was going to make money off the student public and sell health machines and do nothing else. He pretty much stopped.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t want to get into all that my little stupid feud that has pissed me off this weekend. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m doing this video. But I tried to keep up with the stuff going on here. And notice a lot of this stuff. It gets highly classified as well.</p>
<p>All this stuff has been a lot of these people work for um government and defense sponsored research labs and universities. A lot of their work um remains classified. This is as dude says in this it is a basically a he says it&#x27;s a closed &gt;&gt; one of the reasons he says because of ridicule but another reason is because the goddamn military and the defense sector has got their [ __ ] tentacles in this and they don&#x27;t want the public to have access to this type of technology. Not only is it pretty much desktop fusion technology, but you can do things like transmutate elements and crazy [ __ ] like that, and you got yourself a basically a gold printing machine technology. So, anyway, we got this going on in the background.</p>
<p>And again, as I&#x27;ve said, I think the cold fusion element actually there&#x27;s so much evidence to show Ponzip Fleshman was right. There&#x27;s been so many people, so many laboratories, so many groups of people over the years that have got online and basically apologized on camera that they were wrong, that they were getting results, and they&#x27;re studying this [ __ ] in the background, and they&#x27;ve been doing it for 30 or 40 years now. We could probably bring out commercial grades. All the safety testing has been done. Everything&#x27;s been done.</p>
<p>You could put it in somebody&#x27;s house, heat or power their house for months on end, using nothing but just water as the fuel. We don&#x27;t need to wait another 10, 15 years for this [ __ ] They&#x27;ve already been doing this work behind the scenes for 30 plus years, 40 plus years now. Again, in my some of my previous videos, I argue about the fact that all these big wig uh in YouTube influencers want to talk about when it comes to nuclear fusion is the big hot fusion technologies that centralized Nazi power systems that is going to do nothing but just charge you for power. The smaller cheaper hydrogen L&amp;R reactor technologies is what the residential side and small business really what the world needs. We need commercial grade power, large power systems.</p>
<p>Yes. But for once we need to understand that the majority of the world needs smaller, more compact power generation technologies. Because we&#x27;ve been enslaved by the centralized nasty power gener, the coal, the oils, the nuclear fizzing plants, and now even the more what they&#x27;re calling SMRs, small modular reactors, small modular nuclear reactors. They&#x27;re still not [ __ ] small. You might can fit them on the back of a [ __ ] semi-truck, but it&#x27;s a goddamn semitr.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not powering somebody&#x27;s house. That&#x27;s powering a [ __ ] city. We need something even smaller. The size of a [ __ ] desktop computer. The size of something that would power a [ __ ] nuclear submarine.</p>
<p>Okay? And we can have that and we could especially have it with the nuclear LER technology that I&#x27;ve shown in previous things that even the projection reports are showing Len hydrogen Len all in it. So, I&#x27;m gonna put this at the uh I&#x27;m not going to steal his thunder and steal his video. I&#x27;m gonna put the You want to watch it, go ahead. He&#x27;s hard to understand, but basically he&#x27;s pretty much um confirmed AlenR a thousand times [ __ ] over. Has the data to prove it.</p>
<p>And again, it would probably be smart to for somebody watching this to go in and pull infinite energy magazine backlogs. So, you&#x27;ll have that to be able to feed into artificial intelligence because there&#x27;s some good, really, really good information in these magazines that the general public doesn&#x27;t pay attention to. And classified information got put in these magazines. I know that for a fact. We also got SpaceX going public supposedly next year at a um $800 billion evaluation.</p>
<p>It might even go further than that and go one or two trillion when all the Tesla and Elon Musk fanboys throw all their money into it. So hopefully I could get in before it goes public someway where it&#x27;s going to be cheaper and ride the wave up and then dump my shares or whatever I&#x27;m going to do with it. I don&#x27;t know. I I might even be totally [ __ ] broke when all this decides to go down. But there&#x27;s going to be a lot of money made with this IPO.</p>
<p>Also, I know that these [ __ ] rockets are goddamn toys. is [ __ ] dog and pony shows [ __ ] public and it&#x27;s not the propulsive technology we&#x27;re going to be using to get to the moon and to get to Mars. I also know that Elon Musk is a goddamn lie when he gets on [ __ ] national television. He says, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen aliens. I don&#x27;t know anything about aliens.&quot; You cannot run goddamn SpaceX and be doing 80% of the goddamn payloads into space for the United States and for basically the world.</p>
<p>and you not know anything about what&#x27;s been going on in this UFO UAV subject. It don&#x27;t make no [ __ ] sense. Never has, never will. There are some secrets and some stuff inside [ __ ] SpaceX that hopefully if it goes public will get dragged out with it. All SpaceX, Tesla, Boring Company, Neuralink, all they are are old DARPA classified technologies that was given to uh the commercial public private sector and people were allowed to make companies out of it.</p>
<p>And Tesla just or Elon Musk just happens to be one that got five or six of these companies. And uh anyway, people need to be paying attention to this because this is probably going to shoot higher than any</p>
