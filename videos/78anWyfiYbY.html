            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) affects our everyday lives, whether you&#x27;re looking for directions on your phone, buying products online, or asking your smartphone or smart device about the weather for today. But what are the consequences of that for you in the</p>
<p>world? Maybe you were denied a loan on unfair terms, or based on wrong information, and maybe private information was improperly considered. Or have you ever encountered a video or news story that appears real but is actually fake, so now you&#x27;re wondering what to trust? How AI actually works is often mysterious, a blackbox even to the people who are creating the code, and this can lead to</p>
<p>misunderstanding or a distrust in the results. In the end, this limits the positive impact that AI can have on this world. It&#x27;s these issues that motivate IQT Labs to explore trust and transparency and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>IQT Labs is a research organization that&#x27;s part of In-Q-Tel, the non-profit strategic investor for the U.S. national security community. Our mission is to deliver technology and</p>
<p>insights that contribute to national security that also have a positive impact on society. We&#x27;re able to accomplish this through research datasets and education. Our short term, purpose driven research projects</p>
<p>leverage our in-house expertise in machine learning, geospatial analytics, cybersecurity, biotechnology, and data design and visualization. In addition to partnerships with academia, the private sector, and government we build open carefully labeled data repositories to promote applied AI research across multiple domains and we use these data</p>
<p>stores to run public coding challenges. Our currently available data stores SpaceNet and Voices have engaged researchers from around the globe, and our research findings have illuminated important operational and strategic insights for policymakers, government officials, and society.</p>
<p>So let&#x27;s look at an example. We conducted a study called Super Resolution which assessed the value and limitations of different resolutions of imagery for object detection, and how well images can be enhanced.</p>
<p>Not only did we deliver a new tool for performing object detection at low resolution images, but our insights directly inform several fundamental decision points such as the size and expense of satellite hardware. Many of our projects have delivered new capabilities and important insights such</p>
<p>as applying machine learning to cybersecurity to improve defense against cyberattacks, using visualization techniques to map assets, and a computer network evaluating the use of data privacy techniques for searching genomic databases and assessing the security vulnerabilities of AI models, and much more. IQT Labs aims to make this world a better place by addressing the hard</p>
<p>problems that matter to government, industry, and society alike. We&#x27;re IQT Labs,  doing research for the common good.</p>
