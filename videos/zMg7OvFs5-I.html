            <p>breakthroughs in electrogravitics actually involve a real no it&#x27;s a scientific understanding of electro kinetics okay and electro kinetics is the basis for most of the Townsend Brown patents and it&#x27;s also the basis as we&#x27;ve discovered as I&#x27;ve discovered no use in Seraph echt Rudolf since her who we&#x27;ve researched CIN er he&#x27;s got a patent and you&#x27;ve had we have a book called the sensor effect describing that phenomena well from your presentation I got the real feeling that the large-scale breakthroughs are in the near future do you think that&#x27;s the case what we see you know maybe not anything flying but definitely the lab work I guess the next two five years or so well that&#x27;s true if you look at the magnetic research of Gordon Roshan and some of the other work that were no witness to and promoting three to five years is a very good estimate mainly because the space tourism industry is scheduled to be actually in business absolutely Bigelow Virgin Galactic and there&#x27;s a third two company we&#x27;re already building they built their space hotels they need to launch them and they&#x27;ve already got contracts to launch them so do you think once they once they have an established infrastructure in place based on rockets they may begin the Rd cycle for maybe gravity control breakthrough propulsion advanced ironwork you think they&#x27;ve already expressed that interest yes they all of them want something better than rockets and that&#x27;s with the National Space Society conference and the international development of space was dedicated to astronauts are looking for something better Buzz Aldrin is complaining that we still have only rockets to work by Burt Rutan the winner of the XPrize is saying the same thing after around 1960s the aviation advancement leveled off well one of the things that I&#x27;ve wondered about is it seems like the stigma is disappearing for a gravity control definitely and but but at the same time there&#x27;s still kind of that remaining stigma and maybe more of an uncertainty right now from the mainstream community do you think we&#x27;ll overcome that and the near future or is it really just going to take confirmation of a major breakthrough well uncertainty is probably not a good word to use I mean I would say the lack of knowledge is probably more valid for example is hunt for zero point was Nick cooks attempt to show the history of gravity research my book electrolytic stew does that as well it shows you herald-tribune articles from 1955 and also tons Brown&#x27;s article from 1929 on how I control gravitation so we&#x27;re getting new insights that show the previous prior to nineteen fifties very public announcement of research and development and then sort of the cover-up in the covert silencing of unacknowledged research that never did make the media afterwards okay so it does require breakthrough and certainly breakthroughs are always welcome in the industry but in our day and age that&#x27;s more security conscious I would fear and I also am aware of I would say in a very conscious sense that any true breakthrough with great robust power to launch something like us space shuttle in orbit without rocketry oftentimes will risk having a security clamping of classified the status applied to it although it doesn&#x27;t the success of the state conference and its relative openness almost seemed to go against that grain we hope so</p>
