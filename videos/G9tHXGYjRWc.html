            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everybody today i will try to explain uh the hardest part of the project and this is uh how this actually this generator spins the st how the rotor spins around the stator to produce electric current you&#x27;ll see you can see on this image this is autocad design project so i will explain each part of this let&#x27;s say shaft mechanism and how did i get each of each of those parts and connect them to to be able to work in the right order to to be used for uh for our generator yeah and what did what can you see here let&#x27;s start from below like this is let&#x27;s say from number four so number four is like the main shaft on which the rotor spins and this will be let&#x27;s say our main support like main support and main chart for the complete generator and you will see now why so what is this part for this is actually part took from a car real axle or car reel shaft on which on which are connected the wheels yeah and and the tires yeah you will see now on the image i will now go to the google and you&#x27;ll see now what&#x27;s going on so this is like the car real rear axle and what do you have to do when you go and when you will buy this like part that we need is you will go to the carved graveyard and you will ask like to buy this rear axle now and at home you will cut it somewhere around here very good or somewhere around here it doesn&#x27;t matter and you will get this this part so this part from here to here this is like uh this is like our main shaft yeah and if you go back to autocad you will see this is the the top of this shaft and on this shaft are connected this number three and this is like the mechanism on which car braking disc is connected and on which it&#x27;s actually car car tire mounted you know with the wheel so so let me to explain again so if i go back so this is like the car rear axle you will cut it somewhere here you will uh also dissemble this this breaking mechanism yeah and you will get part like over here by part number four which will be longer let&#x27;s say to to down if you see to down towards toward down and what is what will going to be next yeah so this part three and four you get from the car and and what then yeah then we have part two which is extra actually a car breaking disk car breaking disks i will explain now on the image if i go back to google and i go to car breaking disk you&#x27;ll see now this yeah and if you see now this image which shows the car breaking disk and the braking mechanism which is not important to us but car breaking disk it&#x27;s on the shaft and in this this part over here this like brown brown part it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like the top of our our shaft or axle yeah and on this is car breaking disc and you will see now so so so this purple part purple part from the autocad you know this is number two is actually if you now compare it yeah this this holes and this image here you will see that i cut this breaking disk on this edge yeah on this inside edge yeah just to have this this part yeah so somewhere over here and what will be this yeah uh this will be used like our support number two will be used as our support for wings yeah actually on this part we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll will be our wings will spin yeah and you will see how so let me go to point three again and why this is important so actually on the part three we will connect r2 to rotor discs yeah and they are spinning around this axle and how they are spinning yeah so we will let&#x27;s screw the two discs on this this mechanism over here which is number three which it&#x27;s drilled some holes on it yeah and on this mechanism actually rotor spins yeah rotor discs are spinning and let me go back to the image to see or no wait uh i&#x27;ll go down so how this actually rotates around this around this shaft yeah so on this on this shaft number four we actually have like conical bearings and i will explain you now why so why this like conical shape you will see now from the image let me go back here and to the conical bearing and you will now understand yeah so this is like conical shape yeah bearings are on our part four like two of those yeah one one one at the bottom and one one at the top and you will see now if i back so so this is the conical bearing and this bearing it&#x27;s one instance on number four yeah and one it&#x27;s in number three or or or at the top of number four and when we push this up it will go inside yeah it will go inside and and then then you know then you understand probably when we have bearings this part number three will rotate around this shaft and this is all this is all this is like our mechanism uh our spinning mechanism which is sold which is used from a car which can withstand the the very high power and we don&#x27;t have to worry about this anymore because if we do that custom media by with the bearings and some custom-made it will be more more expensive and it and it will it will not last so long yeah so this is like the point yeah and now you probably understand yeah so this is like the number four is the rear axle of a car cut it somewhere over here and then we have this this part on on the top of this axle is like this conical shape you know on which this mechanism for car spinning goes yeah and this on this is connected the the car breaking disc which is cut it yeah and on this we will weld our wings and of course screw that with the screws from the from the wheel yeah yeah from the tire and this is it this is complete mechanism explained how how actually our roller spins and what we have to buy so we have to buy like complete this part it&#x27;s it&#x27;s cheap it you get this some graveyard from some old car very cheap then you will cut the car breaking disc on this on this for on this edge at this edge yeah and here i explain the conical bearings just how this rotates actually around the shaft and this is it thank you for watching if you do not understand i will well you&#x27;ll see the details in my project documentation but i explained it very good i think here how this actually works thank you</p>
