            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas I do videos on many different subjects um particularly on the esoteric and obscure and uh today we&#x27;re uh doing I believe it&#x27;s the 51st video on the reciprocal system of theory which was a dis um developed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century up until he died in 1990 he has many many different books most of them are in scientific subjects uh chemistry and astronomy and physics and various permutations of those uh he also has two books on economics we are looking right now at his final book which came out after he died um that is called beyond space and time and this book is mainly on metaphysics religion psychology philosophy and uh some biology now we also uh this is I believe the 29th video that we&#x27;ve done on this book um now just to give you a brief uh overview of Larson he had kind of an epiphany around 1930 uh where he was doing some various uh scientific experiments he was a he was a mining engineer I believe some kind of engineer and he um was working on some stuff on the side and it took him about 20 years of calculations and so on to kind of narrow his Focus down and he eventually came up with two fundamental postulates the gist of which is uh and then he took those postulates and through a process of deduction he developed uh the you know the basic parameters of the reciprocal system um I did about 15 videos uh earlier on the um talk that he gave from 1986 that is called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so if you watch those videos you can kind of see how his thought progression goes um but uh the gist of it is that unlike the Greeks who thought that the Universe was made out of matter and Einstein who substituted in matter energy for matter with equals m c squared and so is kind of saying that the universe is made out of energy Larson says that uh because a vehicle is MC squared and that energy and matter can be converted one to another that means that neither one of those things can be the fundamental thing that the universe is made out of and he looks uh more at the c squared part the speed of light squared he says Larson says that the universe is made out of motion motion for Larson uh other people have come up with that uh including Thomas Hobbes I believe Renee Descartes and I think the astronomer Eddington Arthur Eddington I&#x27;m not sure about the Eddington part but um they didn&#x27;t make it work because they didn&#x27;t really redefine motion but Mark Larson turned around and defined motion as the relationship between space and time so anytime you have a time over space or space over time relationship you have motion and he says that uh time and space are reciprocals of each other uh which also means that they are the same as each other except that they are reciprocals meaning that what quality one has the other also has um and so by extrapolation he says space is normally three-dimensional although I would say three or four dimensional and so therefore time is also three or four dimensional and a time progresses it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later and therefore by extrapolation space is always progressing as well things are getting further and further and further apart and um that uh he was evidenced by the recession of the distant galaxies the um expansion of space uh through the Hubble telescope uh that was determined through the Hubble telescope back in the day in the 20s and um so that&#x27;s where he&#x27;s that&#x27;s where he&#x27;s going from so any type of relationship that you have between space and time is motion the simplest example is speed speed is uh you know the bike is moving at 15 miles per hour 15 miles of space in one hour of time that is speed you know acceleration is base over time to the second power you know uh I dropped the stone off of the Tower and it fell at a rate of 9.8 meters per second per second or 9.8 meters per second squared that is an acceleration but you can flip it around and go the other way the time over space way and uh you have also other chemo all the other scientific entities being represented such as uh energy Larson uh derived that energy is time over space it took me three hours to move that thing 10 feet uh that is time three hours of time uh per one uh 10 feet of space and in the same way you have uh you have something that is called force force is time over space to the second power and matter is time to the third power over space to the third power and so when you have Larson&#x27;s system where he&#x27;s he he gives you the uh time space uh coordinates so to speak uh of all of these different scientific phenomena you can go back and plug them in to various equations that scientists have developed over the uh centuries and you can check Larson&#x27;s system to see if it works uh and that is another very attractive thing about Larson systems is that it has built-in checks to it and Larson himself said that um the reciprocal system uh notice it is a system of theory not not just a theory but a system of theory the reciprocal system is correct but whether I have applied it correctly is a different question I may have made some mistakes in my application of the theory and those mistakes will eventually come out in the wash because they won&#x27;t check they they won&#x27;t stand up to the to checking it um against the various checks that it has the time and space um components and so on so Larson it turns out did make some mistakes in his theory I believe and others have other people that have followed him have attempted to correct many of the mistakes he didn&#x27;t make many he made a few crucial mistakes though and those have been attempted to be corrected by people like Dr Bruce perrat Dr kvk nehru Dr Gopi Krishna and others over time but um and they have I believe also improved the theory that way but uh right now Dr Bruce Pratt just recently passed away and um he was kind of the main engine that was uh driving the reciprocal system toward a productive um channels so now uh you know I&#x27;m trying to come along and not necessarily resurrect the theory but just um bring it to more uh people&#x27;s eyes and uh to emphasize how important this theory is and that it deserves uh some serious attention because it is a game changer um and I do believe that when all is said and done um all science science the hard Sciences soft sciences and probably a whole lot of other things will be undergirded by the reciprocal system of theory we will eventually um and the he has a society they they found it the society based on that which unfortunately was called Isis which is the international Society for a unified science that was uh arrived at back in the 70s and um that is what it is it&#x27;s a unified science so now we&#x27;re looking at chapter 13 we just finished chapter 12 on miracles and chapter 13 is called emotions um now the the background for the beyond space and time is that more or less according to Einstein the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe but for Larson the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe meaning there&#x27;s half the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light the half that&#x27;s moving slower is the half that we&#x27;re accustomed to and he calls that the material sector or sector one and this is the realm of chemistry uh you know atoms and molecules inanimate objects and then over here at sector 3 or sector two is the uh the cosmic sector which is uh beyond the speed of light faster than the speed of light and the way that it works is that foreign unit a um uh slower than the speed of light uh entity atoms and molecules uh Aggregates it gets more and more complex through basic aggregation just glomming on to each other and once uh you get to its most complex level which he says is DNA a DNA molecule has such a several billion atoms and that is the most complex and that but that is actually the minimum that is required uh for a cosmic entity to uh grab on to this material entity and take over take it over control it in the same way that a thermostat controls the environment of a room it&#x27;s just a small component of the room but it controls the environment and he calls that the life unit so life comes from this uh this unit unification or grouping of the material unit and the cosmic unit and then life evolves uh which I don&#x27;t know exactly about that term but it evolves from you know the amoeba and so on all the way up to the intelligent human being the most complex form of life is what he says and at that point that is becomes under the control of a sector 3 unit Larson defines a sector 3 unit as a unit that is beyond space and time meaning that it is independent of space and time and that it is uh kind of precedes this whole space and time thing and uh he calls that an ethical uh so it turns the intelligent human being uh into a potentially ethical human being and the human being is kind of caught in the middle of sector two and sector three where sector two objectives are are giving it um you know uh directions for survival whereas the sector three unit is giving directions for ethical or good behavior and the human uh has the choice sometimes those things are working in Harmony and sometimes they&#x27;re working in opposition now we just went through four chapters uh on uh things like Revelation Insight ESP and um uh intuition that uh our communication processes from sector three from this beyond space and time area which uh you know you would probably want to call God Larson calls it sector three information received by an individual from sector three this is the beginning of the chapter on emotions information received by an individual from sector 3 through the processes of Revelation Intuition or Insight discussed in the previous chapters joins with information communicated to him by other persons or received it directly through his own senses and the entire combination of material is then subjected to that individual&#x27;s internal processes in the next chapters we will examine the aspects of these internal processes that are relevant to the general subject matter one of the First Reactions may be one of the first of these reactions may be an emotional response to incoming um information and uh it goes through a little of the scientific literature here but eventually says for our present purposes the important points to be noted are that the emotion is initiated by incoming information and that it results in action let us consider one of the so-called primary emotions fear when a situation arises that produces fear in a man or animal the first result is physiological pulse rate blood pressure respiration and many other body functions are altered to produce a state of physical Readiness for action the next result is action itself if no deterring Factor intervenes the individual whether he be man or animal takes to his heels or you know I would say you know yes I guess that is the result of fear taking to their to his heels or running away flight now let us ask what benefit does a human being derive from this fear emotion the answer clearly has to be nothing at all human intelligence is quite capable of initiating flight if such action seems to be advisable in fact the currently favored theory is that the intelligence must authorize the flight even if fear is present on that basis there is no time saved and in any case the difference in time is not likely to be significant nor is fear necessary for the physiological preparation when a situation that calls for emergency action is perceived the body gets the shot of a adrenaline that facilitates quick action whether or not the fear is present there is no good reason to believe that the further physiological changes induced by fear will improve this situation on the contrary experience shows that fear often results in ineffective action or even prevents taking any action at all paralyzed by fear is a description commonly applied in such cases thus on balance fear is definitely detrimental to survival so far as the human race is concerned this is not generally recognized in current thought and then he uh goes into a commentator who&#x27;s talking about Darwin and um you know survival and uh and he did Larson disagrees the human race has found it advantageous to get along without the prehensile pale that was so important to its tree dwelling ancestors on balance the case in favor of the retention of the fear emotion would seem to be no better than that in favor of retaining the prehensile Tale but it is true that unless this emotion had a survival value for some species it could not have been produced in the course of biological evolution which operates entirely on a survival basis it follows therefore that the emotion of fear just like the prehensile tale must have had a survival value for organisms the organisms in which it developed the explanation clearly lies in the inferior mental capacity of the lower forms of life their brains are not capable of recognizing the threat analyzing the situation and originating flight if flight is required within the time that is available for such organisms it is advantageous to have a mechanism that initiates flight almost automatically a threatening situation causes fear and fear results in flight uh and now he&#x27;s uh he&#x27;s citing uh Brooks Spinoza um and uh but um he&#x27;s basically saying here that um you know because humans now have intelligence uh have developed intelligence they no longer need emotions on this basis the primary emotions or at least fear not emotions but but fear on this basis the primary emotions are precursors of intelligence they enable non-intelligent animals or animals of very limited intelligence to react in certain classes of situation in a quasi-intelligent manner but now that evolutionary development has produced a greater degree of intelligence that intelligence arrives at better results in the great majority of cases because it not only takes into consideration the unique characteristics of each individual situation rather than evoking a standardized response in each situation of a broad General class but it is also capable of initiating a wider variety of responses it would therefore be beneficial to man and perhaps to the higher animals as well if the fear emotion could be suppressed [Music] um the principal reason why the emotions have not been entirely superseded by thought and human activity is that these are separate processes that have evidently evolved independently when one physiological feature evolves from another as in the case of the evolution of eyes from light sensitive skin areas the change is gradual but although emotion and thinking serve essentially the same purposes uh they operate on entirely different principles okay so uh we&#x27;re gonna stop it off there um and start up uh talking about how thinking and uh emotions uh kind of serve the same purposes but uh have this different sources okay uh have a great day we&#x27;ll see you next time thanks for tuning in</p>
