            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this channel is dedicated toward educational matters primarily filling people in on um little-known theories of everything people who&#x27;ve spent their whole lives working on their magnum opus all-encompassing you know research um and nobody&#x27;s really ever heard of them or very few people and they are mostly lost to history but for whatever reason I picked them up and figured out that they were really on to something and I&#x27;m trying to get that knowledge out there now or that information out there so that people can pick up the mantle and carry their uh theories forward today is number 176. uh video number 176 on the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory that was first proposed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he worked on this up until his death in 1990 and uh several other researchers have uh been working on the theory since then but it&#x27;s still very very small uh Niche group there um not really putting out a lot of uh content especially since the death of Bruce Perrette back in 2020 we&#x27;re looking at Larson&#x27;s book from 1979 right now called Nothing But motion and we are in um chapter 10 of this book called Adams and so uh the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we do not live in a universe of matter we don&#x27;t live in a universe of energy we live in a universe of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time have a generalized reciprocal relationship um space and time uh basically are components of a fraction that makes up motion so motion can be time over space or space over time and then also they have their coordinate aspects meaning that both space and time come in uh three or more Dimensions XYZ coordinates and so you can have space over time to the second power or time over space to the second power or time to the second power over space to the third power or whatever the permutations are and all those things are different scientific entities for example matter is time to the third power over space to the third power pressure is time over space to the fourth power magnetic flux is time over to the second power over space to the second power capacitance is space to the third power over time all these different uh physical entities are relationships between space and time space and time not only have their coordinate aspects but they also have their clock aspects the clock is always getting later and later time is always getting later and later and later this is a scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude you can measure the the pace of that but you can&#x27;t measure the direction it has a magnitude but it has no Direction you would Envision that as a taking a balloon with a magic marker putting dots on the balloon and then blowing up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other and a space has that same clock aspect in that way um was observed by the Hubble telescope whether you want to claim fraud about that or not um according to that you know telescope the all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other if that&#x27;s true it&#x27;s the same kind of model that you would use for this uh balloon or you could use something like raisin bread all of the raisins are moving away from each other as you cook it not in any particular direction and then space and time also have their discrete unit requirement they space and time do not are not continuous they come only in chunks there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space and exactly one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so that sets up the speed of light is really like the background or the origin of this universe and we have two separate universes or sectors of the universe as Larson calls them the material sector where everything is moving slower than the speed of light but we also have the cosmic sector where everything is moving faster than the speed of light those two sectors are inverses of one another so exactly even though we cannot really see the cosmic sector or know what&#x27;s going on there the fact that we can see the material sector and make measurements there means that all we have to do is reverse the roles of space and time to understand exactly what is going on in the cosmic sector where everything&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light um and so Larson basically uh derived all of this through [Music] um induction he had uh understood certain things about um how he could he could use uh specific discrete units to describe uh among other things the inter-atomic distance of atoms and he took these specific uh findings and tried to figure out how to apply them generally and it took him about 20 years or more to do that by the 1950s he was ready to State his two fundamental postulates which are basically the universe is made out of motion motion is a relationship between space and time space and time have a generalized reciprocal relationship and they both they all have their coordinate aspects their their clock aspects and they come in discrete units and then the other postulate is more more General that the Universe um uh follows the laws of mathematics ordinary Community mathematics and it has uh euclidean geometry um the magnitudes are absolute and uh some people have come along and have disagreed with Larson about the geometry of the universe Bruce Perrette in fact claims that the geometry is actually projective of which euclidean is a small subset so he&#x27;s not really saying Larson is wrong but saying that Larson was incomplete with his euclidean geometry but that&#x27;s for another uh another day uh we&#x27;re going to get into this chapter on Adam so atoms are basically rotational combinations so that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s how he builds up his universe is by basically combining um motions so there are really four kinds of motion you&#x27;ve got your translational motion you&#x27;ve got your vibrational motion you&#x27;ve got your rotational motion and you&#x27;ve got your rotational vibration and these can come in one two three dimensions and then you also have um your Photon which is a simple harmonic motion like a sine wave which comes about says Larson as a result of combining a translational motion and a vibrational Motion in the other uh in a perpendicular dimension um some of Larson&#x27;s followers have said that actually the the photon the simple harmonic motion comes from a by rotation to counter rotating uh entities when you uh put them into interference that also creates a sine wave so that is the alternate presentation of the photon but once you have a photon then you can have a second Photon and those two photons together once you start rotating them that&#x27;s how you end up getting atoms okay so we&#x27;re going to take over here in this middle of this chapter chapter 10. some questions now arise as to the units in which the displacements should be expressed as will quickly be seen when we start to identify the individual structures the natural unit of displacement is not a convenient unit in application to the double rotating systems the smallest change that can take place in these systems involves two natural units as stated in chapter 9 probability considerations dictate the distribution of the total displacement of a combination among the different dimensions of rotation the possible rotating combinations therefore constitute a series successive numbers of which differ by two of the natural one-dimensional units of displacement since we will not encounter single units in these atomic structures it will simplify our calculations if we work with double units rather than the simple uh single natural units we will therefore Define the unit of electric displacement in the atomic structures as the equivalent of two natural one displacement units on this base again remember that the electrical displacement is one-dimensional and the Magnetic Dimension displacement is two-dimensional on this basis the position of each element is the series in the series of combinations as determined by its net total equivalent electric displacement is its atomic number for reasons that will be brought out later half of the unit of atomic number has been taken as the unit of atomic weight at the unit level dimensional differences have no numerical effect that is one to the third power equals one to the second power equals one but where the rotation extends to Greater displacement values a two-dimensional displacement n is equivalent to end the second power one-dimensional units if we let N represent this the number of units of electrical displacement as defined above the corresponding number of natural units is 2N and the natural unit equivalent of a magnetic two-dimensional displacement and is 4 n to the second power in as much as we have defined the electrical displacement as the electrical electric displacement unit as two natural units it then follows that a magnetic displacement n is equivalent to 2 N to the second power electric displacement units this means that the unit of magnetic displacement the increment between successive values of the two-dimensional rotational displacement is not a specific magnitude in terms of total displacement where the total displacement is the significant factor as in the position in the series of elements the magnetic displacement value must be converted to equivalent electric displacement units by means of the two and the second power relation for some other purposes however the displacement value in terms of magnetic units does have significance in its own right as we will see in the pages that follow in order to qualify as an atom a double rotating system a rotational combination must have at least one effective magnetic displacement unit in each system or expressing the same requirement in a different way it must have at least one effective displacement unit in each of the magnetic dimensions of the combination structure one positive magnetic displacement unit is required to neutralize the two single negative displacement units of the of the basic photons that is to bring the total scalar speed of the combination as a whole down to zero on the natural basis this one positive unit is not part of the effective rotation thus where there is no rotation in the electric Dimension the smallest combination of motions that can qualify as an atom is two one zero 2-1-0 remember that is the notation he&#x27;s using the first number is the primary magnetic rotation the second number is the secondary magnetic rotation and the third number is the electric rotation two one zero that is the lowest that can qualify as an atom this combination can be identified as the element helium atomic number two helium is a member of a family of elements known as the inert gases or the noble gases a name that has been applied because of their reluctance to enter into chemical combinations the structural feature that is responsible for this chemical behavior is the absence of any effective rotation in the electric dimension the next element of this type has one additional unit of magnetic displacement since the probability factors operate to keep the eccentricity at a minimum the resulting combination is 2-2-0 rather than 3-1-0 the succeeding increments of displacement similarly go alternately to the principal and subordinate rotations helium 2-1-0 already has one effective displacement unit in each magnetic Dimension and the increase to [Music] 2-2-0 involves a second unit in one dimension as previously indicated the electric equivalent of n magnetic units is 2N squared unlike the addition of another electric unit the addition of a magnetic unit is not a simple process of going from one to two in the case of the electric displacement there is first a single unit then another single unit for a total of two another bringing the total to three and so on but two times one to the second power equals two and two times two to the second power equals eight in order to increase the total electric equivalent of the magnetic displacement from two to eight it would be necessary to add the equivalent of six units of electric displacement and there isn&#x27;t no such thing as a magnetic equivalent of six electric units the same situation arises in the subsequent additions and the increase in magnetic displacement must therefore take place in full two N squared equivalence thus the succession of inner gas elements is not 2 10 16 26 36 50 64. as it would be if two times the quantity n plus one to the second power replaces two n to the second power in the same manner that n plus 1 replaces n in the electric series but 2 10 18 36 54 86 118. for reasons which will be developed later element 118 is unstable and disintegrates if formed the preceding six members of this series constitute the inert gas family of elements or the noble gases 2 10 18 36 54 and 86.</p>
<p>so those are the series then 2 1 0 is helium two two zero is neon two um three two zero is um Argon and then um three three zero is Krypton and then um uh five four three zero is uh Xenon I think and then uh four four zero is uh radon I think is what it&#x27;s called 86. the number of mathematically possible combinations of rotations is greatly increased when electric displacement is added to these magnetic combinations okay so you so you got these noble gases the thing that the noble gases all have in common is they have a zero at as the third number the electric displacement and so you have this 210 18 36 54 86 118 sequence so all of the numbers that fill in the gaps between those numbers uh do so because they have uh non-zero numbers as their third number uh the as the electric uh rotation and that can be either positive or negative so the number of mathematically possible combinations of rotations is greatly increased when electric displacement is added to these magnetic combinations but the combinations that can actually exist as elements are limited by probability considerations the magnetic displacement is numerically less than the equivalent electric displacement and is more probable for this reason its status as the essential basic rotation also gives it precedence over the electric rotation any increment of displacement consequently consequently adds to the magnetic rotation if possible rather than to the rotation in the electric Dimension this means that the role of electric displacement is confined to filling in the intervals between internet gas elements okay we&#x27;re going to leave it there we&#x27;ll take over tomorrow thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
