            <p>foreign I love like you watching YouTube and I saw this film were there actually updates in physics maybe mid-century that were not disclosed to the public well I mean it quieted down because nobody ever got anywhere or it quieted it down because it did get somewhere and it went black it was absolutely brilliant so my role in the resolution forest team were John Burroughs James Warren race Hobbs is very much looking at the history of physics because that&#x27;s my background that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done professionally and that&#x27;s what really interests me what Eric Weinstein said on Jess&#x27;s film with how push-off was Mindless following and so brilliant listen to this certainly Aerospace corporations have knowledge in the UAP area that specifically are sequestered by against foia oh because of proprietary I appreciate labels which the whole thing was set up to be that way on purpose right but the idea that there would be fundamental physics knowledge that would be housed in an aerospace company and not shared with the physics Community there is no evidence of that no evidence for it not that I know of and I would that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not the case but that would be this crazy egregious it would change our entire concept of who we are if somebody kept fundamental physics secret in the years since we became capable of exploding Fusion devices it&#x27;s that simple and direct statement about physics going dark in the 1950s possibly really resonated with me so I&#x27;m going to explore that for you let me explain why it is potentially so important first of all renderson Forest 1980s quite a while ago but wenderson Forest is the key to understanding UAP because they effed up John Burroughs was injured and he is still alive encoded inside his body is the remnants of what he was exposed to the military are very aware of that and in some ways John&#x27;s a threat to them because his DNA his heart problems and the other problems he received by standing too close to the highly strange in Randall&#x27;s River Forest is the clue to what he was standing too close to and for me that really opens a door because either John was exposed to an alien UFO or he was exposed to an unusual force of nature all he was exposed to a piece of military technology the clue is inside him we can get the answers to UFOs strange forces of nature or possibly a man-made weaponization of a very exotic physics by studying John and so if we understand the physics that I think Eric Weinstein is correct in saying is hidden from us for the first time in history we as members of the public are being kept in the dark maybe for a very interesting reason maybe physics is no longer public and defense contractors are hiding advances in propulsion systems I mean the plastic thing would be a way of defeating gravity if that&#x27;s possible or time travel or other weird stuff time dilation even faster than light travel or wormholes or really advanced stuff isn&#x27;t really being studied at University level anymore it seems to be inside the raytheons the boeings the Lockheed Martin&#x27;s the Marconi the Bae system contractors because they&#x27;re hiding it from Freedom of Information and I think the big advances of physics aren&#x27;t in the public domain anymore and it is just possible that out there are extremely strange things that aren&#x27;t necessarily weaponizations but they could explain UAP they could explain exotic physics of natural phenomenon or they could explain weapon systems and I think that just might be possibly what&#x27;s going on what do you think the first branch of the decision tree is is it stuff that is unintentionally in the air versus stuff that is intentionally in the air the unintentional stuff was broken into two categories and that was clutter and Atmospheric effects the stuff that is intentionally in the air was broken into the next branch which was us not us not us was broken into two things known others and unknown others and that other is intentionally in the air not us not anyone we know could be coming out of the ocean could be time I mean who the hell knows but anything in that other category is astonishing so this is just an introduction and I really encourage you to go and watch Jesse&#x27;s film with Hal and Eric the link is in the description because it touches on such a weird interesting big points and I&#x27;m gonna follow up on this has physics gone dark if we members of the public understood modern contemporary post quantum physics would UAP suddenly make sense if we understood the physics and is that physics being hidden is it no longer in academic institutions but protected against Freedom of Information possibly for National Security but also for a commercial gain behind the private privileges of Defense contractors what a good question I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to answer it for you stay tuned because the truth really is out there foreign</p>
