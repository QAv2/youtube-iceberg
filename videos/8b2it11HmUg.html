            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this channel is dedicated toward educational matters primarily bringing to light uh some of the great Giants of the past who have spent their whole life working on some fundamental educational uh Endeavor never to be recognized in spite of putting out one or more Magnum opus&#x27;s uh you know explaining their work and um for whatever reason I&#x27;ve studied a lot of these things and I&#x27;ve tried to collate uh you know as many of them as I can and present them on this channel today is video number 179 on the reciprocal system of theory and this Theory uh was put forward by Dewey B Larson uh he died back in 1990 but his work continues on uh with some other people some of whom also have most recently passed but um but not enough there&#x27;s not too many people working on this it&#x27;s very obscure uh and it&#x27;s a very powerful system it&#x27;s a system of theory meaning that if you understand how the system works you can plug it into any subject that you&#x27;d like or even make up your own subjects and plug it in uh you know you can uh figure out how the reciprocal system works now the basic ideas and Larson did just that he um he plugged it into physics and astrophysics and astronomy and metaphysics and chemistry and economics and uh you know things as uh even dream interpretation um other psycho psychological topics religion and um the basic idea behind the theory is that we live in a universe of motion the universe is made out of motion and um other people have arrived at that same conclusion in the past but Larson extended the um you know the theory by defining motion as the relationship between space and time so motion is the relationship between space and time this sets up this relation sets up a fraction it sets up a reciprocal relationship between space and time hence the name the reciprocal system of theory um now we know one basic kind of motion speed the bicycles moving 25 miles per hour uh that is 25 miles of space in one hour of time and there&#x27;s a reciprocal relationship between space and time you can say instead of saying the bicycle is moving 25 miles an hour you could say the bicycle is moving at uh you know uh you multiply one by two and divide the other by two or you know however you want to say it you could say the you know the bicycle is moving 50 miles in two hours or um you know what you basically have is you have a fraction so say you have the fraction two-thirds the reciprocal of that is three halves and so when you multiply them together you get one so that sets up a relationship where you have a one and then you have uh numbers that are less than one on one side and numbers that are greater than one on the other side and this is what you get when you have space and time space and time in Larson&#x27;s system both come in discrete units meaning that they only um come in chunks there is no continuity there you only you have a minimum of one unit of space and a minimum of one unit of time and um one unit of space in one unit of time one over one equals one and that equals the speed of light the speed of light is the one which is like the origin of the whole system the background and then you have one half of this universe that is moving slower than the speed of light and then one half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and theoretically if you multiply them together you get one the speed of light um now that goes against what Einstein said where Einstein said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe uh that&#x27;s true for this slower than half side the material sector as Larson calls it but he&#x27;s ignoring what&#x27;s called The Cosmic sector where everything is moving faster than the speed of light and the speed of light is actually the minimum speed of the universe uh this uh half of the universe has been basically undiscovered by Legacy scientists it has to do with mental phenomena life phenomena and um but you can&#x27;t see it we only really see space we don&#x27;t see time we see space we see time as its inverse its reciprocal in space now space it&#x27;s a little more complicated than that because space and time both come in uh one two or three dimensions the coordinate aspect of space and time we know that space is multi-dimensional three or more Dimensions an XYZ coordinates or some other kind of geometrical coordinates that same is also true of time time is multi-dimensional three or more Dimensions space and time also have their clock aspects we know time to be progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later in the same way space is progressing things are always getting farther and farther and farther apart which was observed uh really about the same time Larson put together this Theory by the Hubble telescope noting that all of the galaxies the distant galaxies are moving away from each other uh that is the progression of space and can be envisioned by using a balloon and a magic marker put a bunch of dots on the balloon you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific direction that is what is called a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude it has no Direction now in Larson&#x27;s system there&#x27;s basically four different kinds of motion you&#x27;ve got your translational motion you&#x27;ve got your vibrational motion you&#x27;ve got your rotational motion and you have your rotational vibration rotational vibration and those can occur in one two or three dimensions and those combinations of motion are what build up to make first photons and then sub atoms and then atoms and then everything so uh one thing that you have to re recognize here is that in the Legacy science universe space and time are the container of the universe we think of space as empty and the action that&#x27;s going on in this universe is taking place in space spaces the container of the activity but in Larson&#x27;s universe space and time are the contents of the universe the universe itself is made out of space and time but space and time don&#x27;t exist in and of themselves they only exist together in motion okay now we&#x27;re looking at Larson&#x27;s 1979 book called uh nothing but motion and this covers mainly physics Atomic physics right now we&#x27;re in chapter 10 which is called atoms this is uh his breakdown of what atoms are they&#x27;re basically uh rotational combinations combinations uh you have to start with your basic Photon your photon is your simple harmonic motion your wave which comes from a combination in Larson&#x27;s system of this translational Motion in One Direction and then in a perpendicular Direction a vibrational motion and so you know when you combine the two you get a sine wave Larson&#x27;s uh followers uh really have said say that this simple harmonic motion comes from a by rotation it&#x27;s a an interference between two counter rotating system that also creates a sine wave that&#x27;s a discussion for later but for now um you know we&#x27;ll just take the photon as is and then once you start to rotate the photon in other dimensions you end up first you get a disc and then when you rotate the disc you get a sphere that is those are two two-dimensional rotations or what Larson calls magnetic rotations that comprise the atom and then there&#x27;s another rotation which Larson calls the electrical rotation which also um is optional for the atom and it fills in the blanks in the periodic table between all of the noble gases so we&#x27;ll uh go back half a paragraph here and then continue on okay on comparing the periodic table with the rotational characteristics of the elements as tabulated in this chapter it is evident that the horizontal periods reflect the magnetic rotational displacement while the vertical groups represent the electric rotational displacement in revising the table to take advantage of the additional information derived from the reciprocal system of theory we may therefore replace the usual group and period numbering by the more meaningful displacement values so Larson&#x27;s basically coming up with his own periodic table when this is done it is apparent that a further revision of the tabular arrangement is required in order to put all the elements into their proper positions mendeleev&#x27;s original table included nine vertical groups beginning with the inert or noble gases group O and ending with a group in which the three elements iron Cobalt and nickel and the corresponding elements in the higher periods were all assigned to a single vertical position in the more modern versions of the table the number of vertical groups has been expanded to avoid splitting each of the longer periods into sub-periods into two sub-periods as was done by Mendeleev one of the most popular of these revised versions utilizes 18 vertical groups and puts 15 elements of each of the last two periods into one of these 18 positions in order to accommodate the full number of elements in the light of the new information now available it can be seen that Mendeleev based his Arrangements on the relations existing in the eight element rotational groups 2A and 2B in the notation used in this work and uh 2A and 2B in the note in the notation used in this work and forced the elements of the larger groups into Conformity with this eight element pattern the modern revisers have made a partial correction by setting up their tables on the basis of the 18 element rotational groups 3A and 3B leaving blank spaces where the eight element groups have no counterparts of the 18 element values but these tables still retain a part of the original Distortion as they force the members of the 32 element groups into the 18 element pattern to construct a complete and accurate table it is only necessary to carry the revision procedure One Step farther and set up the table on the basis of the largest of the magnetic groups the 32 element groups 4A and 4B for some purposes a single extension of the current versions of the table to the full 32 position width necessary to accommodate groups 4A and 4B is probably all that is needed on the other hand the useful chemical information displayed by the table is confined mainly to the elements with electric displacements below 10. and separating the central elements of the two upper groups from the main portion of the table as in the conventional Arrangements has considerable Merit the particular elements that are thus separated on the basis of the electric displacement are not the same ones that are treated separately in the conventional tables but the general effect is much the same when the table is thus divided into two sections it also appears that there are some advantages to be gained by a vertical rather than a horizontal Arrangement and the revised table has been set up on this basis the New Concept of Divisions which is emphasized in this table we will be explained in chapter 18. in as much as carbon and silicon play both positive and negative roles rather freely they have each been assigned to two positions in the table but hydrogen which is usually shown in two positions in the conventional tables is necessarily negative on the basis of the principles that have been developed in this work and is only shown in one position the aspects of its chemical behavior have led to its classification with the electro positive elements we&#x27;ll also be explained in chapter 18. okay so um he&#x27;s basically revising the periodic table to um this doesn&#x27;t even seem to be directly related to the reciprocal system but just more based on common sense you you have okay what you have is you have hydrogen to start the table and then helium which is the first noble gas then there&#x27;s a group of eight that ends with neon then another group of eight that ends with argon and then then there&#x27;s a group of 18 that ends with Krypton and a group another group of 18 that ends with um zidan and then there&#x27;s a group of 32 and another group of 32 so you have you know three sets of two uh in addition to that first row that is just hydrogen and helium then you know you have eight eighteen eighteen and thirty two thirty two and it basically you know the equation that Larson uses is two x to the second power so two times one to the second power um is uh is the first row of two and then two times two to the second power is eight and then two times three to the second power is eighteen and two times four to the second power is 32. and uh you know the people who came up with the periodic table didn&#x27;t really understand that because they didn&#x27;t uh you know they only really got up to uranium in classifying the at the elements and so they didn&#x27;t realize that there was the second group of 32 which starts with element 87 um and goes all the way up to element 1 18.</p>
<p>but if they only know up to 92 they don&#x27;t really see that there&#x27;s a whole group of 32 there anyway um you know that so that&#x27;s another Innovation that&#x27;s coming from Larson directly from the mathematical aspects of the theory uh you know what Larson is doing is he&#x27;s using the theory um and he&#x27;s coming up with a theoretical Universe from the basic postulates of the reciprocal system and the deductions from them and he&#x27;s basically comparing his theoretical Universe to the universe that has been observed and measured by scientists okay back to Larson in the original construction of the periodic table the known properties of certain elements were combined with the atomic number of sequence to establish the existence of the relations between the elements of the various periods and groups and thereby to predict previously undetermined properties and even the existence of some previously unknown elements the table thus added significantly to the chemical knowledge of the time in this work however the revised table is not being presented as an addition to the information contained in the preceding pages but merely as a convenient graphic method of expressing some portions of that identify that information everything that can be learned from the table has already been set forth in more detailed form verbally and mathematically in this and the earlier chapters some of the implications of this information so that such as its application to the property of valence we&#x27;ll have further discussion later okay so that is the end of chapter 10 on atoms and uh then we go to chapter 11 which is called subatomic particles and remember Larson said that in some ways the subatomic particles are a little bit more complicated and so it&#x27;s better to go over the atoms first and then to go over the sub atoms so here we go on the first uh the chapter 11 subatomic particles we&#x27;re just going to get into the first paragraph here before we call it a day um while the series of elements contains no com combinations of motion with net positive displacement less than that of hydrogen which is notated as two one negative one now remember the notation is a b c a is the primary magnetic rotation B is the secondary magnetic rotation and C is the electric rotation this does not mean that such combinations are non-existent it it merely means that they do not have a sufficient speed displacement to form two complete rotating systems and consequently do not have the properties which distinguish the rotational combinations we call atoms these less complex combinations of motion can be identified as subatomic particles as is evident from the foregoing these particles are not constituents of atoms as seen in current scientific thought they are structures of the same general nature as the atoms of the elements but their net total displacement is below the minimum necessary to form the complete atomic structure they may be characterized as incomplete atoms okay we&#x27;ll get back to that tomorrow thanks for tuning in and have a great day</p>
