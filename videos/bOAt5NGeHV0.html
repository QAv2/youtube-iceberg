            <p>does this have implications for for how humankind was formed and and and whether we live in a base reality and whether we you know we&#x27;re in a sort of a simulation I mean we certainly have what we perceive as free will I guess I don&#x27;t think anybody&#x27;s blocking us from doing certain things so you know I certainly have free will to do what I did right and exposee some of these truths so but you do have sort of weird aspects of reality like the anthropic principle like the idea of planks constant was slightly different or if hydrogen bonded with oxygen in a different way that didn&#x27;t form these Crystal structures and we wouldn&#x27;t have a habitable Earth and so you have all these sort of things in physics that if they were slightly different we wouldn&#x27;t have this sort of Goldilocks perfect habitable zone oh yeah I mean Earth&#x27;s like very finely tuned right the temperature gradient is just enough where you know our exoskeleton or whatever you want to call our body can handle it is that a coincidence or did aliens set this up I don&#x27;t know I mean that&#x27;s why we need doctoral programs of study like I you know was talking about</p>
