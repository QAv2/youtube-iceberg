            <p>recently I&#x27;ve been preparing a model prompted by uh measurements of RF in particular microwave frequencies whatever these weird signals we&#x27;re seeing they&#x27;re bouncing off of it and being focused to somewhere just like a dish focuses the energy we are located where you see that graphic right almost dead centering yes so we&#x27;re going to look at how those Rays uh interact with and reflect from this surface wow these ways we are looking at parallel rays of energy coming down from above the ones right in the center they&#x27;re being focused and the ones at the edge you can see where these things are being brought to a point and there&#x27;s m a big concentration of energy up here somewhere and I believe that the uent Basin could be acting almost like a satellite dish one that both collects and directs energy from somewhere out in space</p>
