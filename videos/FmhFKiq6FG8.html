            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello this is Greg alom Galactic Gregs coming to you with a broad survey of numerous anti-gravity technology projects this is a comprehensive review of so many projects it&#x27;s going to knock your socks off my friends she actually had started a research institute to fund anti-gravity research and let me tell you what this review has several of the top propulsion engineers in Advanced Space Program Engineers that were available from the Marshall space flight center there&#x27;s dozens in the room in here and they&#x27;re all listening intently and having very serious uh discussions with the lady in question that&#x27;s why this is interesting they took it seriously this was a very top-notch program with some of the best space Professionals in the business no woo woo no laughing it was serious content my friends watch this you&#x27;re going to really enjoy it and if you&#x27;re not subscribed to my channel subscribe bang that Bell and hit all so you can get all the notifications because I&#x27;m going to bring you a lot more exciting stuff on this channel just hold your socks and uh buckle up it&#x27;s going to get interesting but uh let&#x27;s get right into it and talk about um gravity just kind of to start with the basics what is it basically it&#x27;s the fundamental physical Force interacts between different masses over both long and short distances um it controls the orbits of the and those are all things we&#x27;ve heard before um and anti-gravity is basically the the science of modifying gravity so anti gravity is kind of a misnomer um it&#x27;s really more gra gravity modification but Cally it&#x27;s called an gravity so just kind of start at the beginning right so kernus published his theory of heliocentricity in the 1500s and then um Kepler of came up with the planetary motion stuff in the 1600s and then Newton published his law of universal gravitation in 1686 and um I guess one thing to really note about his law of gravitation is that it follows the inverse squared law meaning that it it dissipates over a distance proportionate to the inverse of the the square of the distance um it made firsted by in Cavendish in the Cavendish experiment um and then um Einstein of course published his general relativity in the early 1900s so that kind of leads us in what does relativity have to say about gravity um so relativity says that gravity is basically a a deformation in space time so sometimes you see those pictures of like a planet and then there&#x27;s kind of a dip in space time that it kind of sits in and um so relativity kind of say that that anti-gravity is sort of impossible without negative Mass um some people would disagree with that but that&#x27;s what relativity has to say and then um so the standal model of physics doesn&#x27;t really include negative Mass was sort of a problem so a lot of people talk about what you call unified field Theory which is there&#x27;s four forces right there&#x27;s gravity electromagnetism and then the strong and weak nuclear forces and those forces are each mediated by a particle phon or ones um the graviton has been proposed but never never really been seen um so it&#x27;s a proposed particle and the all of the other forces are unified meaning that you have one theory that kind of agrees with all of them but gravity is not unified meaning the that describe the other ones don&#x27;t apply to gravity and so it&#x27;s kind of um an incomplete picture perhaps and we all know that um electromagnetism is quantized magnetism is quantized um so the a good question would be gravity is that quantized too and we don&#x27;t really have a good theory for that right now although some theories have been put forward so I want to talk about anti research in sort of the early days start so this is a photo or a sketch from HD world first B um so one of the earliest anti-gravity machines that were that was kind of put forward was the um Thomas Townson Browns Browns generator or Browns gravitator that was in the 1920s he pointed the term electr gravitics which you hear sometimes in the literature these days um um basically basically you have an asymmetric capacitor here so a capacitor where one electrode is larger than the other and um so that that supposedly can create a Thrust in One Direction but vacuum tests have kind of shown that that&#x27;s perhaps ion wind and not the Antigravity effect um sometimes you see these little like on YouTube sometimes you see these little foil lifters where it&#x27;s like free sticks triangle and a piece of oil going around the top and then a thin wire going around the bottom and that&#x27;s kind of the same the same um basic thing where it&#x27;s an asymmetric capacitance thing some people call those simple anti-gravity lifters but really those are just of Tesla did a lot of work in in this field he had what he called the space Drive one of his sketches of a vehicle that he proposed putting his space drive into and so he patented that the patent numberers there um he called it anti-electromagnetic propulsion and um he talked a lot about electr pulsation and he had what he called the dynamic theory of gravity which was really more of an ether Theory where he talks about um ether filling all of the space and he talks about Mass being really just little vortexes of The Ether and then he says that you know as a as a particle decays it&#x27;s really just the ether kind of spinning down or not vortexing quite as fast and then dissipating um and he totally rejects the notion of um curved SpaceTime so that relativity example we were just talking about about you have the planet kind of sitting in the curved SpaceTime um Tesla doesn&#x27;t agree with that really at all um in 1948 the Gravity Research Foundation was founded by um Roger bson um he started a annual essay prize where you would write an essay on gravity and then he would give I think it was like a $4,000 prize at the time and that prize has been won by many famous scientists Stephen Steven Hawkings is one of them um five Nobel Prize winners have won the bapson prize um some of those essays are sort of in favor of anti-gravity being possible and some of them are more critical so this is um actually an essay that won in 1953 um by a scientist named Bry the wit and he was kind of talking about just to paraphrase this is you kind of need a good theory before you can really make a working device is what he&#x27;s kind of saying here we don&#x27;t really have the theory so why we have devices that we say work so he&#x27;s saying we&#x27;re a little ahead of ourselves on that um so then in the 1950s there were several government and government contractor programs so there was something called the aeronautical research laboratory which is now called the Aerospace research laborator research laboratory and um they supposedly conducted um many anti-gravity experiments on the right patteron air for space in the 50s and um perhaps may still be um involved with that now and then there was the research institute for advanced study that later turned into Lock Works um in the 1940s there was the seral generator and um that was purported or claimed to be a combination of anti-gravity and free energy um it&#x27;s kind of this this like a metallic you&#x27;ve got like a magnetic r an insulator ring and then like a copper on the outside and um there&#x27;s these little uh cylinders that that rotate and and the thing does rotate around and it makes a lot of noise and it appears to do something but it&#x27;s been sort of widely panned although it&#x27;s still in development with some Modern efforts there was the dean Drive in the 50s and 60s this was claimed to be a reactionless drive meaning that there&#x27;s no propellant exhaust coming out as you thrust forward in One Direction um it was basically like they have kind of a asymmetric weight thing that&#x27;s asymmetrically kind of oscillating around and it creates kind of like a linear oscillation and um a lot of people think that effect may be actually just due to the friction of the thing oscillating back and forth and then the friction just kind of pushes it forward so that&#x27;s probably just an effec of friction there was the Wallace machine in 1968 um this one was patented um it&#x27;s basically some spinning brass discs and Brass is one half integer you know nuclear Spin and so the the idea of this is that you spin the the metallic around and um it&#x27;s supposed to align the nuclear Spin and then um you know he he calls it the kinomic field so he talks about the motion of metals and he really gets into the kinetic part of um aligning the nuclear spin again this one is unsubstantiated there&#x27;s a lot of people that talk about this was patented and then kind of fell off the map and so sometimes people talk about maybe it went black or um was kind of Taken under but it&#x27;s also just kind of unsubstantiated there&#x27;s the lweight gyr Scopes so Eric lawe was widely known as the father of magav um his hypothesis was that the these um rotating spinning discs could create a force that&#x27;s um orthogonal to both the spin and Direction so if you look at this thing here it&#x27;s spinning on this axis and then it spins on the this axis as well and then the the forces in I guess this direction um so he had these big jar scrips that he would like pulled up over his head and they were really heavy and he would like hold it really effortless looking and he did a lot of um kind of interesting public displays of his you know swing in his jart the heavy jar scps around his head and that kind of thing and so he made kind of a splash with that but um you know it maybe can be account accounted for through centripetal forces and Newton&#x27;s Second Law explaining the effect so it&#x27;s kind of a cool and maybe a useful effect but it&#x27;s not necessarily true like anti-gravity for gravity modification so I was going to talk a little bit now about the modern efforts so um in 1973 there was the Mansfield Amendment and this restrict restricted DOD dollars from being spent on non-military applications so things like propulsion or well you know anti-gravity propulsion kind of fell under that um that umbrella and so this kind of means that we&#x27;re not really doing Gravity Research in the public sector of the government anymore at all by legislation and so kind of the explanation at the time was well this stuff doesn&#x27;t work so we don&#x27;t want to waste money on it but maybe another explanation is that they had their own black budgets and they didn&#x27;t want to double spend on their other projects so they just legislated that they didn&#x27;t do that anymore so I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s different interpretations of what was going on with the V building um in the 1970s um there is this guy John Hutchinson who he&#x27;s kind of he&#x27;s like all over you can find videos of him on YouTube like supposedly levitating things and he was really trying to replicate Tesla&#x27;s work he was really big into Tesla and so he know he noticed these anomalous effects when he was playing around with Tesla coils and um he claims that he replicated The Philadelphia Experiment which is of course the experiment where the the ship like disappeared and then reappeared so um so he had these like um this is a picture of a bar of metal that he supposedly could focus his machine on a metallic object and it would just kind of like melt and twist down into itself and then you would touch it and it wouldn&#x27;t be hot to the touch um so there was no heat but it somehow was rening the metal or deforming the metal in some way um and then he claims that after he did this successfully for a long time that um he started getting attention and then people came in and um started trying to get him to replicate it and he lost his ability to perform the experiment which kind of means you can&#x27;t replicate it right I saw one of those beams one time yeah my dad actually saw one of those yeah the guy halfway lab showed me one it was a 6x6 beam it was split down the middle and then twisted like it was Taffy but it didn&#x27;t look like it had ever been hot he had it mounted on the plaque he brought it out of his office and showed it to me his he did experiments with Hutchinson yeah so Hinson is affiliated with the haway lab in Toronto um and they do have a lot of these metal pieces that have these weird deformations in them but it&#x27;s unclear exactly how that happened and um if you ask Cal pudol what the the cause of it was he&#x27;ll say oh I just think that guy was telekinetic he said it was telekinetic this guy according to these guys he would sit there in his basement he had these radio transmitters and Tes the coils and all this stuff and there was no theory behind it and he would sit there and adjust the knobs and do this and do that sometimes for hours at a time and then eventually after an hour or two thing weird things would start happening yeah and so Hal thought that he was just telekinetic he just focused on it for hour Happ he wanted to happen so bad that just happened and the strange thing about it was he was uh what agoraphobic he he didn&#x27;t want to go outside so he stayed in the spacement all the time but when people found out about his effect they wanted him to come out and show it to people so they took him into a psychology ol ologist and he gave him some pills for the agoraphobia agoraphobia and they said that after he started taking those pills he could never do it again so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the loss of ability where he was suddenly not able to replicate it anymore so according to Hal it&#x27;s cuz he was a telekinetic but Hal believes in those things so take that with a same story anyway it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an interesting anecdote um so then um in 1990 there was the Woodward effect so um Jim Woodward is known as sort of the father of the mock effect so sometimes you hear about the mock effect in like popular literature but um so this is another reactionless Thruster kind of like the dean Drive was a reactionless drive so meaning that you get thrust but there&#x27;s no propellant coming out the other end um so he said that this would enable basically a warp drive where you&#x27;re um you have a large negative mass and then it warps SpaceTime and then what you have here is something called a um an Al yeah um and so this is supposed to be like a compression and an expansion of SpaceTime that basically causes it to like travel in one dire so this this part is kind of interesting so in the 1990s we actually had quite a bit of um sort of anti-gravity research that was done here in Huntsville and um there&#x27;s a UAH scientist named ning Lee she worked with a brad student named Doug tour uh this is mainly here this Doug tour and that&#x27;s um he was the chair of the physics department that&#x27;s Larry SMY and um so she theorized that if you had a magnetic field on a um superconductor it would align the ion spins and the um the ion Matrix of the the solid state ceramic that it would align the ions and produce this gravito magnetic gravito electric effect and so popular mechanics did an article on her um NASA got involved and they did a collaboration in the late &#x27;90s and then um she actually left UAH and founded this company called AC gravity LLC and that was in 1999 and if you look for her company it&#x27;s still registered but no one really knows what they&#x27;re doing um and she got us $500,000 dood contract in 2001 and then it kind of ended there and we&#x27;ll talk about that more in a second maybe oh okay yeah so what happened tole um so if you Google what happened to n Lee just Google that sentence it&#x27;s kind of like a weird internet legend that has originated made it out of hunsville um this is a Reddit post on your AR conspiracy talking about hey what happened to Le why did she get Dar DARPA funding and then disappear um so that&#x27;s just kind of an interesting internet legend that has come out of in school she had two other graduates yeah I&#x27;ve actually I&#x27;ve talked to some of them I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve run into people even outside of Huntsville in the sort of Weird Science anti-gravity community and when they hear I&#x27;m from huntsv they&#x27;re like oh my gosh ning Lee what happened to her tell me and I&#x27;m like I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know what happened she was a member of how five for a while yeah yeah I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of people that have worked with her tour we took a tour over her lab really back in 1997 the sponsored event yeah y well if anyone knows what happened in Le I would like to know I heard she went up to Maryland around that area I&#x27;ve heard that I&#x27;ve heard I&#x27;ve heard three different stories about ningle I&#x27;ve heard that she got breast cancer from handling the um the the toxic chemicals with the superconductors without gloves um and that she died in the US I&#x27;ve heard that she went back to China and died there of breast cancer I&#x27;ve heard that she just got sucked into the dod and has been doing DOD stuff quietly ever since and um I&#x27;ve heard that she went back to China to get funding because she couldn&#x27;t find funding in America and so she&#x27;s working in China now there&#x27;s a lot of different stories about Doug toor went and founded a a company yeah I&#x27;ve got a slide on that here in a second so kind of related to the Ning Lee thing is the podet canob effect so this is a Russian scientist who really within just a few years of ningle publishing her first paper about um about superconductors and gravity he started doing this uh rotating ybc o disc and ybco is kind of interesting because it was actually invented out of UAH by a a a grad student and it was famously stolen by another University and patented within like the next day of it being revealed to his Professor he the next day he went to another University was suddenly chair of the department and was filing a patent for ybco literally the next day so what&#x27;s ybco vitrium barium copper oxide it&#x27;s a super conducting material it&#x27;s one of the more high temperature ones it was invented at UAH the same stuff ning Le used right huh that&#x27;s the same stuff ning Le used yeah ning Le was using ybco and then kind [Music] of he&#x27;s on my LinkedIn I forget his name a stat I would love to talk to him actually I might be able to find I was a graduate student oh really it&#x27;s amazing how much HP know little results well I used to read stor CNN interviews I was in the middle of it I know everything yeah wasn&#x27;t his name Doug Tor was yeah he was the one that invented it he I think there&#x27;s a j Richard saying there&#x27;s a black there U does any Robert Becker he worked with her as wellt Doug was her stage yeah Robert Becker did a quantized gravity thing where he took Maxwell&#x27;s equations and then he kind of Applied them to gravity and quantized gravity kind of analogous to how you would electricity and um his thesis is over at uh and I it&#x27;s not on PDF I had to like go and take a picture of every single page of his thesis it&#x27;s only been checked out twice right oh I checked out Robert Becker&#x27;s thesis at U and it&#x27;s only been checked out twice it was checked out in 1999 by the DIA inter um departmental Library loan system and then it was checked out by me last year yeah so the PO canel effect rotating ybco superconductors produces supposedly gravity shielding and the kind of funny story about this is that he says that this was discovered because he was playing with superconductors trying to do something unrelated to gravity and then a guy one of his collaborators walked into the the lab and he was smoking a pipe like a tobacco pipe and the the smoke drifted over the the superconductor where the experiment was and supposedly there was like a a vortex in the smoke up over the superconductor and so they started looking at kind of like what what force is making that vortex in the smoke and um they investigated further and they decided they thought it was a gravity wave or gravity beam going up and perturbing the smoke above the superconductor um but he had a 2001 patent he actually did collaborate with NASA Marshall space flight center in um the early 2000s and um The Story Goes that he came over here and we didn&#x27;t pay for his travel in time and he got pissed off about it and didn&#x27;t want to come back anymore but um he claimed a 2% reduction in weight and he was sort of like widely pamed by the community um it was kind of a big splash when he first came out and then um a number of people well a small number of labs have replicated or attempted to replicate with varying degrees of success um there have been some near replications done by this guy Claude puyer in France and I&#x27;ve got a slide on him here in a second but so du tour and Jose Jose Vargas who was also at U here briefly um they actually then went to the after the nly stuff kind of wound down they left and they went to the University of South Carolina and they created basically their own gravity beam generator and you know they talked about it being an in inhomogeneous um electric field so they have like two electrodes like one could be a sphere or like a hollow cone or they talked about different shapes of electrodes but the idea is that they&#x27;re asymmetric so like one is different than the other and then um they got a website called experimental quantum gravity which is still online although it&#x27;s unclear what they professional activity is or what they&#x27;re still working on it&#x27;s kind of unclear but their website is still up um and thenir was their collaborator with that at the University I think they were awarded a couple ofs and then then they disappeared yeah so there&#x27;s some evidence that they got some some funding through an sbir and then they kind of fell off the m just like they have a patent that picture huh a picture out of a patent yeah yeah that&#x27;s a picture of the one of the conical electrodes Jose Vargas actually came to NASA and pitched to msfc management and he drew that picture on the wall in front of us and he was talking about fins Ling or kin laran mathematics he used all these strange symbols and nobody knew what in the heck he was talking about Robert Becker is one of the like 12 people in the world that can read a Jose Vargas paper and understand what the heck he&#x27;s talkinging talking about he also applied to be the uh director of our lab there oh Rogers got it you say oh he applied for that position be no your whole Lab party oh oh okay so the whole superconductor thing in general has been sort of widely panned and then abruptly dropped right so the Popular Mechanics article if you try to Google it you cannot find it it is not up anymore um you can find some other blogs that have reposted it but it&#x27;s no longer officially up research was never made public by the university canav course was Ed by the University of tanier almost immediately and then Giovani modise who was a p can uh collaborator I noticed uh last night I was doing some research in his Wikipedia page has been delet huh really VHS yeah I I&#x27;ve seen some interviews with him and he talks about this the smoke story and super um oh and there&#x27;s also this book I was at a Sci-Fi conference a couple years ago called dragon conon in Atlanta and they had like a Sci-Fi bookstore booth in the in the um Marketplace and they had a whole bunch of science books and I bought this book called bogus science and then like years later I was flipping through it and they were talking about podl canob and they even mentioned they even mentioned um Huntsville and the fact that podle canob had come over to Huntsville and that they talked about ningle but they didn&#x27;t name her directly but it was like obviously talking about her and so there&#x27;s sort of like maybe some kind of like undercurrent of let&#x27;s go discredit this for some reason either that ority really they didn&#x27;ts she they felt threatened by her paper she even went and talked to them paper and told basically told him that when they did their experiment they&#x27;re going to find a result that uh has going to occur because super there actually believe that happened it was Jim Ashburn Jim Ash Jim Ash yeah he lives here in town yeah I would love to talk to him yeah I found him on L um okay so CLA cyer in the 2000s he&#x27;s kind of like the only that has somewhat successfully done pod podob like stuff and actually published right so he&#x27;s uh he has sort of a modified experiment where um he uh he he does the the ybco I think his doesn&#x27;t rotate it&#x27;s just static and his ybco and he claims to get a propelling Thrust out of the super conducting disc and um so this is a picture of a liquid nitrogen doer with the superconductor down in there and he you know uh actuates or triggers the emitter and um the doer basically explodes from whatever force is caused by the uh by the superconductor some kind of force coming out of the superconductor that explodes the liquid doer and um this was actually tested at Nasa Marshall space flight center in 2015 which has not been published uh my dad did that and um they received they uh very similar results where you can you can trigger the the the superconductor and there is some sort of explosion that comes out of the superconductor but when you take the disc out and look at it it&#x27;s totally undamaged so the doer around it explodes but the disc is undamaged so whatever force is coming out of it comes out of the disc in such a way that it doesn&#x27;t blow weird yeah we took we took the tested them in mini buckets from Walmart because we blew up glass sters all blew them all over the lab and it cost too much so that&#x27;s kind of the anomalous effect that um those results kind of need some more explanation just or exploration just to kind of figure out and then um one of the more recent an gravity devices or experiments would be Morning Star Applied Physics so some of you have probably met John Brandenburg and Paul Mand so they have this company warning star and they have what&#x27;s basically a modified Soro machine so we talked about the Soro machine a little bit earlier um Brandenburg talks about his gem Theory which is this uh grao Electro magnetism Theory and they claim a 7% 7% weight reduction um so this you can see it&#x27;s very similar to the Cal generator that we looked at earlier it&#x27;s got the rollers and they magnetically rotate and all of that but they also kind of the different part about this one is that there&#x27;s actually a pherom magnetic fluid inside the center disc here and um I think it&#x27;s actually just vegetable oil with some iron shavings in it but um so they claim 7% reduction and then kind of the rumor that they&#x27;re sort of privately claiming is they&#x27;re now claiming 20% weight reduction but um I&#x27;m not so sure they&#x27;re actually getting 20% um so there&#x27;s of course the more well-known ones like Boeing Phantom works so um this uh Gravity Research for advanced propulsion or the grasp program um has been around probably for a while but they admitted to it publicly in 24 is when they sort of admitted they had that program uh I was reading there&#x27;s some chatter about maybe podl canv being involved in this I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s true or not but I was sort of hearing that and then um so these are the so Phantom works is where you get these black triangles that people talk about sometimes so if you&#x27;re into like the UFO scene muon has a lot of reports of these like black triangles that people look up up and they just see like a black triangle blocking out the stars in the sky and there&#x27;s a lot of reports of of things like that and that is supposedly the tr3b black triangle and sort of the rumor is that that&#x27;s what you call an ARB which is an alien re reproduction vehicle which is sort of like meant to look like a UFO but isn&#x27;t really one CU it&#x27;s really F going so um and the mechanism May resembles a brown generator I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s hard to get information on and then of course you have recent declassifications um so in December 2017 some of you may be aware there was a big a big um a big declassification of several different documents um most of them related to this a tip program the advanced Aviation threat identification program and that was if you&#x27;re familiar with like the two the Stars Academy they did a lot of media promotion around these declassifications and so like here&#x27;s one here&#x27;s two examples of some documents that were Declassified this is a defense intelligence reference document uh this one is on traversable wormholes Stargates and negative energy and this one is titled W Drive dark energy and the manipulation of extra Dimensions so these are Dia documents were actually released who are the authors huh the authors uh it&#x27;s right there but I can&#x27;t read it how wrote one of them how wrote one of them I don&#x27;t know who the other one was yeah how&#x27;s group where Eric Davis being primary WR L yeah how how how is written there&#x27;s a bunch of these DD documents that how has written um I&#x27;ve got a bunch of them how wrote one about how if you can manipulate space time then you could essentially fall towards any direction you wanted to fall and then it also affected time which would make a UFO difficult to shoot down because yeah the bullets come at them but they effectively they have all weight to do something about it inside the craft yeah H talks about the SpaceTime bubble around the craft and so it looks like they&#x27;re gr really fast but to them inside the ship they&#x27;re going at a normal speed so it&#x27;s kind of like dodging bullets in The Matrix when they when the air comes through them at Hypersonic speed it goes into the time field and the air doesn&#x27;t seem to be moving at them so fast that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no fluid friction yeah according to according his document that he wrot his documents yeah so these are kind of interesting there&#x27;s some kind of funny um funny cartoons and some of them of like worm holes and stuff kind of so the future what&#x27;s the next step for anti-gravity looked at a whole bunch of different devices of like varying credibility so how are we going to get to the point where we have credible anti-gravity and I have a picture of hille here because you might as well do it here so in conclusion um what now um we kind of need theories with testable hypotheses that was what that rice swiit guy said right for the batsin award he was talking about hey we&#x27;re kind of ahead of ourselves here we need good theory so that we can test it and see if the theory is right or not so we we really need to focus on like the the the quantized gravity is that a thing or not and figure out the theory and then go build something um we think we need independently funded research because when you&#x27;re at a university or an academic institution and and you want to work on this stuff and they say oh no that&#x27;s Fringe you can&#x27;t do that or you have a result that you want to publish and they say oh no that&#x27;s crazy and then so that that suppresses a lot of Publications that maybe are accurate but they&#x27;re perceived badly and so professors are afraid to publish it but if you had a privately funded research institution you can just study whatever you want to and you don&#x27;t have to worry about tenure so the other thing is promising results always seem to disappear so like can you build 10 of which will which will be able to receive frequencies with wavelengths of 10 to- 29 M now there those frequencies do exist all we need is an antenna and if we build an antenna and that rectifier to it we will get a DC current yeah so you&#x27;re talking about like the high frequency gravity wave corre but the high frequency I I don&#x27;t mean just Ultra Ultra ultra high like camera range or something yeah but wavelength of 10 to minus 30 well if you&#x27;re familiar with Ray Chow he talks quite a bit about gravity wave transducers using superconductors as basically a gravity operating in Nano nanometers yeah we are talking about 10 to 10 to is a distance between molecules and nuclear yeah electron and nucleus so we need that antenna yeah because where does the energy come from which keeps electron spinning around nucleus without slowing down at all those are the ones with the energy those are the which somehow somehow rectifi frequencies coming from outer space and provide the propulsions that by now some of those electrons obviously quit spinning and what happens can you name an element that has nucleus only and no spinning electrons around can you leave that element exist that would well TR will decay in 11 minutes I think well every every every atom every we have today contains a nucleus and at least one electron spinning around it can you name an element which ain&#x27;t got no electron spinning around it and where a neutron has noon spinning around it but it has a half how much does that thing weigh per cubic cm what does it weigh correct 1,800 times the weight of an electron typical atom or molecule is free is full of free space right now if you ain&#x27;t got no spr free space everything has collapsed into nucleus how much does that weigh per cubic cm or cubic [Music] inch hundreds and hundreds of tons and that is called black hole so when can&#x27;t tell you how small an electron is know when you when you want somebody to look into those exotic Sciences come up with the designs that detects detects very very high frequencies in wavelength of 10 to minus 30 I think that&#x27;s a great idea well do exist already furthermore you can detect it not detected rectified yeah well they have like the light no is called permanent magnet oh yeah permanent magnet nothing more than aier extremely high frequencies yeah and that now because it rectifies it as a circular current around it and circular current obviously causes a magnet to exist now if you looking for some exotic science why don&#x27;t you find me I was start resourcing it should come talk to me about yeah do you know anything about uh James woodwork&#x27;s work James Wood yeah so that&#x27;s the guy and uh yeah so I I met him in September actually in um SD&#x27;s park there was a ction conference um Tony and John Cole and I were there and he&#x27;s a he&#x27;s a nice he&#x27;s nice um there was he that was his like personal conference where it&#x27;s like basically the groups that work with him and then the groups that try to disprove him it was kind of funny actually because it was like it was the groups that try to prove him right and then it was the groups that try to prove him wrong and it was a conference just for like 40 or 50 people that fall in that category but yeah I&#x27;m sort of familiar with his work but I know that he only ever gets like a micro Newton of thrust he never really gets that much but that&#x27;s just about every single one of them they&#x27;re all getting these these very small B of rust um yeah so it&#x27;s hard it&#x27;s hard to say that if they&#x27;re getting anything out of it or is it just some sort of secondary effect of something else uh like let&#x27;s say um uh with uh like the one with uh with the Russian scientist who saw the smoke going up you know that that could just as easily been a current or a Vortex you know because they got a really cold mass uh they got some liquid nitrogen lying around and and that could actually be causing a u a convection currents it was outside the chamber was it yeah when he claims that it was like even like a floor above the lab that you would get this deflection but it&#x27;s still a cold spot uh that would still it would still be a a heat gradient in there because it is it is much colder than the outside environment yeah I mean there&#x27;s there&#x27;s been alternative explanations for like the poer effect which is kind of you know going on the leonov thing there&#x27;s some people that would say that oh the explosion is just the liquid nitrogen vaporizing so there&#x27;s like there&#x27;s alternative ex like that now I do know that they have they&#x27;re developing graphity sensors for mining operation because um because you they they they get they want to get it down all the way down to like um to a Precision of one billion of a g so they can uh pick so they know if there&#x27;s like a deposit of oil or or or iron in the ground now I was wondering why couldn&#x27;t they use something like that for these experiments I mean there really are really affecting gravity and that and if they&#x27;re really having an effect on gravity these things should be going off like an alarm my answer to that would be why don&#x27;t they do something like like that for that experiment because no one buns it that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t do that these gravity meters out they tend to sit them down and and there for days or hours at time uh to see the gravitational shifts and things we we actually had one up Marshall and I found out very quick that it was worthless to us but because we were looking for stuff that were happening you on milliseconds not something that&#x27;s happening over hours and days so the frequency real low for things okay my Rec of the or work uh it was saying that above this spinning disc there was a in in the gravitational attraction right even several floors up in a building yeah canot said the same thing yeah and and that caused we have a lot of debates about this all going on and that caused a number of people to including myself to say you know this would be really neat wouldn&#x27;t anything because you could make the equivalent of a simple Water Wheel by taking a bunch of rods with large mass on them with one of the mass above spinning this and then on the next FL the same kind of thing run uh this run generator and produce El current from one of them to continue driving the device and then all the rest of them above would be producing electricity without having to spend anything so it would be a way of generating large amounts of of energy be for free that was one of the problems this kind of a this kind of a Gund an apparent production of a professional Mo machine the ningle original results my understanding of the ningle like sort of Roadblock and maybe you can tell me if this is accurate but I heard I heard that she was trying to make the discs too big and that they would crack all the time and that she spent all her time trying to make these big discs and they kept cracking instead of just making some smaller ones and getting some results we did make some small she really focused I think looking for results and let&#x27;s be honest you&#x27;re looking for money yeah and only way you get more money is you have find some kind of results for people to hang their yeah was if you you go to a bigger disc more can you tell us exactly what kind of to Quan deter the magnitude of the effect was I don&#x27;t think she got that far did she I mean she reported that she was seeing a certain percentage of reduction wonder I don&#x27;t think Sheed anything about any I think she published a lot she just had that paper she published suggested that there should be the you thinking of that came he did publish a 2% weight loss I don&#x27;t rememberer had a little accelerometer on his thing think Dad do you remember how measured his Force well there were two podl c experiments the first one was the spinning disc yeah the second one was the the impulsive electrical experiment that produced was said to have produced a gravity wave that was columnated that would uh like disturb a rubber ball hanging hanging on a string in a vacuum and it you could move it to the next building across the street and it would still disturb it anyway that&#x27;s what they said although you know they never would show a film of it they were doing that at the Moscow Institute that&#x27;s what he did after he went he left tempier Finland and went to Moscow and then he published this paper with this where M which Institute I don&#x27;t remember the exact name they call it the Moscow Institute or the materials Institute of some sort anyway they had uh they used the big Mega Vol marks bank and a chamber so I don&#x27;t know if that one&#x27;s been replic by anybody I thinker has the most quantive measurements in terms of like actual numbers rather than just looking at the physical deflection you can see with your eye back the way did a small experiment you had a 4 in disc but it wasn&#x27;t a two layer anything just ybc old disc he didn&#x27;t see anything I don&#x27;t think he used the voltage as high ASL yeah and pyer was using about 2 Kilts too yeah so it&#x27;s much lower that off was using about a half a million volts yeah well we can the poyer test that was done at Nasa it was the the force was measured with a little fiberglass Rod that went down into the liquid nitrogen doer and it had a little U accelerometer on it so the vibration that went up the fiberglass Rod would read the um it would read the a and you could get like a force like thrust measurement off that yeah we got in excess of 500 G&#x27;s but we never reproduced the waves that he claimed except for we did float we put a second superconductor under the doer just in a coffee cup and we floated a little magnet on top of that you know where you levitate a magnet and uh when we fired the the poyer device the little mag magnet the theory being that if we made a gravity Wave by prod by putting electricity through a superconductor that maybe the inverse would also be true that if a gravity going wave going through a superconductor might produce a current so if you if you levitate a small magnet just by the M effect right over a super conductor that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s a super current which is generated by the magnetic field produced by the magnet which exactly mirrors the field and makes the magnet float so we thought perhaps if we put that underneath the doer very close to it that that would be disturbed and that actually did happen when we fired it the little magnet went flying away and you know we told management about this and but we never we never saw the waves that he claimed now when you&#x27;re doing a pulse powered experiment with 20,000 amps at 2,000 volts getting the signal is never a problem you know you you have to Shield everything and you still get a signal I mean not even plug your not even put your input leads into your oscilloscope you will get a signal and it will look approximately like your current waveform so it&#x27;s not a question of getting the signal it&#x27;s a question of getting the right signal so when we use a double Faraday cage we did not reproduce four years signals however we did see a whole lot of really strange effects like the tossing of the magnet and forces coming off the disc and you pull the disc out and the disc is unaffected and if it was if it was a thermal thermal explosion between the layers of the disc it would have destroyed the disc but you pull it out and it was pristine and we even got a million frame per second movie of a wave coming off one of his emitters and this wave apparently was what kept blowing up our our doers they he blow them all over the place so we blew up Min buckets from Walmart after that anyway it was interesting it&#x27;s something that you know with our Institute maybe we can try to readdress that but plan we talked about funding and uh that that that seems to be the common denominator of all this stuff fun or lack of yeah who&#x27;s where is there any money you know are are you aware of any private money that&#x27;s being spent on this or is anybody talking to Angel Investors or that sort of stuff or let me give you the down low on the situation so you&#x27;ve got your black budgets that obviously is well funded and then you have your academic budget which is non-existent because they think it&#x27;s h and then you have your random billionaires who have a hobby okay and they made their money doing something else but they are applying their money towards weird anti-gravity stuff just because they want to be known for something other than what they made their money in so there&#x27;s several there&#x27;s a handful of like random billionaires running around who fund these types of things um the Church&#x27;s Fried Chicken billionaire funded the haway lab uh the American Best in and sweet billionaire barbert Bigalow of course is Bigalow Aerospace um there are some others that I know of but we&#x27;re we&#x27;re really trying to address that problem with the Institute that we&#x27;re doing because I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve been in I&#x27;ve seen Government research I&#x27;ve seen academic research I&#x27;ve seen private research and money is always the problem the technology is never the problem the technology is there and the talent is there the money is there so what we&#x27;ve done with the Institute is we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve sort of assembled some of these random people with big budgets in a hobby and we&#x27;ve said hey can can we like pull money into like a big stable pot of money so that we can have like a safe well-funded sandbox for people smart people to play in and not have to worry about government election Cycles affecting their budget or tenure affecting their budget or even when you find your billionaire like sometimes the billionaire runs out of money or loses interest orun or you know disappears so you can&#x27;t just be dependent on one wealthy investor you need a big pot of money that&#x27;s stable that you know isn&#x27;t going anywhere so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to do with the Institute is just fund The Institute and then pick projects that we think are promising and then fund those so we&#x27;re kind of creating like a new vehicle for funding this type of research um that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of the approach I&#x27;m taking right now is there any possibility of of I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s probably hard if find possible to but crossover between black world and the illuminated world that that because frequently things move from the illuminated world into the black World about that many times and they disappear but I mean it&#x27;s to the black world&#x27;s advantage to keep the illuminated world going because that acts as a spawning ground for ideas that they might not have a black so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not necessarily to their advantage to keep them completely seated and and potentially since Griffin is now of the group that that controls Dara uh and he has a history that goes through UAH there would seem to be possibly some fer ground yeah um I&#x27;ve thought about that the the combination of the private and the and the you know a public private institution and then kind of working with the the black budget a quote from Griffin a quote from Griffin NASA is no longer by any means a research organization that is a griffin quote that&#x27;s Griffin quote I imagine there are some strong opinions about Griffin in the room can you tell us the instit where you located that&#x27;s what I want to ask what tell us is is a nonprofit uh if someone has an idea a technology or if they have a basis for for science uh uh scientific principles and they want to come to you what do they do what do they get out of it well so we&#x27;re trying to make sort of a an environment where smart people can gather and experiment with ideas and be rewarded for their intellectual property how um royalties the what royalties royalties generous Ro so you&#x27;re a corporation or or we&#x27;re a public benefit corporation which um is a newly legislated form of entity which is kind of like a nonprofit kind of like a C Corp so basically we have a public benefit Mission which is the furtherance of public science in our case and then um we&#x27;re privately so a b Corp can take investment and give investors a return whereas a nonprofit cannot so since we were trying to attract these like random High net worth individuals we really wanted to be a b Corp and not a nonprofit so that we could take their investment and give them a return for their investment so that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re a b Corp um B Corps actually don&#x27;t exist in the state of Alabama which is why we&#x27;re registered in Delaware um some states have them some don&#x27;t but um yeah so we&#x27;re planning on um negotiating um generous royalty rights to the inv because you can go over on the Arsenal and you can invent for 40 years or 30 years and never see a royalty even though it was your idea or you can come to the Institute and get a generous cut of your own intellectual property and we of course would have the resources to commercialize your yeah that&#x27;s the next step what what you&#x27;ve got to be able to get someone to manuf get something valuable out of and that&#x27;s a different entity usually yeah so so we put the resources into funding the research and we put the resources into making money off of the research which is commercialization or patent sales or licensing or a variety of mechanisms and then right now we&#x27;re closing money to build basically a big facility here in town so it&#x27;s going to be about 100,000 square foot facility um uh and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to have you know RF labs and Optics labs and material la lab and a machine shop and spaces that you can rent if you have a company you can come rent a space and then share our machine shop so you don&#x27;t have to make your own machine shop we have that already so it&#x27;s going to be like a a community space where you can actually uh get some of this research done and then we&#x27;ll have funding as well for people so um that&#x27;s the whole point is to make it make it easier for the inventor to invent because inventors spend so much time worrying about where the next dollar is going to come from and they shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about that they should be thinking about the science and the technology so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to do so where does the money actually come from from investors General yeah not contracts um we&#x27;ll be doing contracts but we are taking investment Capital right now yeah so we&#x27;ll have Equity investors there are share you do have shares just there okay the shares are traded just like a C Corp okay I I have that works yeah and it&#x27;s taxed just like a C Corp but you just have this public benefit Mission which is in our case furthering public science and you already have a suite of potentially interested investors yeah we&#x27;re closing that right now okay good yeah yeah we&#x27;ve got um ego money rich man ego money right that&#x27;s where it comes from usually yeah um there there&#x27;s some of those um random rich people pet projects that they want to they want to work on so but they see the value in the research you know they&#x27;re usually people who your ideal investor isn&#x27;t someone that you have to convince that the research is valuable your ideal investor already knows that the research is valuable and is interested in giving you money so you go find those people you don&#x27;t try to convince someone who&#x27;s skeptical you go to the person who already believes in the ca so what about the he&#x27;s afraid of Disappearing that&#x27;s a whole another [Laughter] problem um I think doing it in the public is better in that case but that&#x27;s a difference doesn&#x27;t mean will disappear even if you do it in the public it still don&#x27;t mean that the inventor won&#x27;t disappear for lot of reasons like me we do you anticipate that that once you get your facility up and going and have some creative participation in there that that in itself will give you a good mechanism to go talk to these people that have loads of money in oh absolutely I mean yeah that that otherwise it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot of drawing on napkin and and you&#x27;ve got some physical Hardware physical spaces enthusiastic participants that goes much farther toward getting some reals yeah what what do you say to an inventor who claim ether in space ether does exist that it is extremely high frequency electromagnetic wave what it needs is to be detected used as a source of energy what do I say to that I would say I believe and I would be interested in talking about that Tesla believed in The Ether I I know a lot of people like that too and I&#x27;m interested in talking to more of them for sure space has permitivity permability and resistance permitivity and permability you got your inductance your capacitance it&#x27;s got physical characteristics because it&#x27;s made out of something IE e h it&#x27;s interesting that the form of the equation for the resonant Circuit of RLC circuit is exact same equation for the speed of light it&#x27;s uh some constant over the square root of the permitivity and permability inductance and capacitance same thing they if you&#x27;re interested in that kind of thing there&#x27;s this guy on YouTube his name is Ken wheeler I don&#x27;t know if anyone&#x27;s ever seen Ken Wheeler&#x27;s videos but he talks about how it&#x27;s absurd to say that space is empty because space has properties which is what you just said so um if uh if you give me your email address or something I&#x27;ll send you some of Cu he&#x27;s talking about exactly what you&#x27;re talking about and I&#x27;m going to the dinner after the event huh I&#x27;m going to the dinner after this I oh good yeah yeah get your presentation get the presentation thank don&#x27;t forget subscribe the channel and bang the Bell because we&#x27;ve got a lot more exciting videos to come here on Galactic Gregs</p>
