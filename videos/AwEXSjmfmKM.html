            <p>What if everything we think we know about UFOs is wrong? What if they&#x27;re not visitors from space, but something far more complex and potentially dangerous? Computer scientist Jacqu Valet, the man who inspired the French scientist character in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, has spent 60 years studying this phenomena, and what he&#x27;s discovered will change how you think about reality itself. Hey you followers, I&#x27;m Christina Gomez, and welcome to this episode of UFO News Updates. In a recent interview with the Soul Foundation, Valet revealed cases involving mysterious deaths, a massive classified database of 240,000 UAP encounters, and his controversial theory that we&#x27;re dealing with a control system that&#x27;s been manipulating humanity for centuries. But here&#x27;s the most chilling part. Valet believes our very survival as a species may depend on figuring out how to communicate with this system.</p>
<p>and time is running out. &gt;&gt; When we we started I started building the databases uh based on French cases and cases in Europe and um discussing it with with people in French universities that idea of is it a control system came up. The question that any scientist should ask you know I mean what is it? We have many thousand dozens of thousands of cases. So it&#x27;s doing something. It&#x27;s not hiding.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s in fact in full view. Uh there are many cases where somebody&#x27;s driving on the highway and something lands in front of the car. Okay. So this is not this is not somebody hiding. Uh this is very much in your face.</p>
<p>Valet&#x27;s latest book, Forbidden Science Volume 6, Scattered Castles, published back in January, reveals how his analysis of over 500 high strangers cases, led him to view UAP as a projection into our own reality, a keen to a simulated environment. Ballet started as a proponent of the ET theory, the idea that UFOs are visitors from another planet. But analyzing thousands of cases revealed patterns that just didn&#x27;t fit. The behavior was too absurd, too theatrical, too focused on psychological impact rather than scientific study. &gt;&gt; The particular case involved something very strange.</p>
<p>It involved discs just like what people are reporting now as drones except that those were didn&#x27;t have propellers that appeared in the sky and they seem to exchange light um light rays and they thought that this may be some new weapon that was being developed and they started in the late 70s in daylight when They came to the site. There was a truck there with what uh what they inter first interpreted as a dead body there which may have been you know uh maybe a decoy or something else. Someone had set fire to the truck and there was a man there uh who was in a uniform and told them to go home and that there was nothing to see that um but that was at the place where those beams had been had been exchanged at at night &gt;&gt; between 2008 and 2010 working under top secret clearance for the intelligence ay&#x27;s advanced aerospace weapons system applications program, better known as OAP. Valet and his team built something unprecedented. A data warehouse containing 240,000 cases from around the world, integrating 13 to 14 separate databases with translated foreign reports from 393 sources worldwide.</p>
<p>that structure was going to feed into an an artificial intelligence system that would have two purposes. The first one would be to refine it because we don&#x27;t nobody needs 240,000 cases to know that there is some sort of a phenomenon happening. uh we need, you know, if we had 20,000 of the best ones, we could turn that over to the scientific community in different in different disciplines from medicine to chemistry to architect to uh you know agriculture and everything else and uh based on that there would be a number of teams could feed from that. That was the idea. It was not done because we were cut off after two years.</p>
<p>and I really don&#x27;t know the current disposition of what we did. So at that point uh the project terminated and I I should make it clear I don&#x27;t have any uh secret clearance or particular access you know outside of of of that that that study. &gt;&gt; The database included cases of UAP related injuries or anomalies not publicly declassified. Then after just 2 years and $22 million in funding, the program was terminated. The database vanished into the classified world and Valet confirmed the database&#x27;s potential for AIdriven analysis of the top 20,000 cases, but emphasized its classification limits and its scientific access.</p>
<p>What do you think happened to that database? Was it transferred to another program or is it sitting unused in some classified vault? Drop your thoughts in the comments. Valet has strong opinions about the current congressional approach to UAP research. Take a listen to this. &gt;&gt; When is the last time science had to wait for a decision of Congress to study something? I mean, that&#x27;s not the way a university works. You know, you you&#x27;re doing some experiments.</p>
<p>You you in the course of those experiments, you discover the discrepancy. You study the discrepancy because it could lead to an invention or to a breakthrough or to a new theory of something. You have you have a patient in front of you who is dying of something that that has not been recognized before. You you document it. You you don&#x27;t call your congressman.</p>
<p>So why are we spending all this time in Washington assuming that Congress is going to do science? This is not what we pay them for. This is not what Congress does laws &gt;&gt; and the laws may or may not have anything to do with science. So we&#x27;re talking they certainly have a role in this which is very important but we are misunderstanding the the role of the legislature. The criticism hits at a fundamental issue highlighted in the recent 2024 congressional hearing. Lawmakers are frustrated by lack of transparency from Pentagon offices like the all domain anomaly resolution office arrow.</p>
<p>But Valet argues this misses the point entirely. Science doesn&#x27;t wait for political permission. as he notes, when&#x27;s the last time science needed Congress to approve studying a new phenomenon? You document the anomaly, you investigate it, you don&#x27;t call your congressman. And this tension between political oversight and scientific investigation continues to hamper serious research. Perhaps Valet&#x27;s most sobering revelation concerning humanity&#x27;s future was mentioned here.</p>
<p>Do we know that the phenomenon has been with us for a long time? Maybe as long as humans have been on the earth raises a question of why do we see this concentration now? Well, now is the first time now we&#x27;re coming to a test and astronomers have have said, you know, for many years that in the evolution of a planet in life evolving on a planet will get to a point of discontinuity where it assembles technology to the point where it can destroy its own envir. environment and there are indications that maybe we haven&#x27;t destroyed it but we have committed a number of faulty decisions in in our technical development and um in our economic development that threaten our own existence on the planet. Valet believes we&#x27;re at a critical evolutionary juncture, the point where a species either learns to manage its technology responsibly or destroy itself. Drawing from insights in recent scientific papers about the great filter hypothesis, many civilizations may not survive this transition. And the increased intensity of UAP activity, Valet suggests, might be related to this critical moment.</p>
<p>If advanced intelligences monitor developing civilizations, they would know we&#x27;re approaching this makeorb breakak point. And Valet&#x27;s approach goes beyond passive observation. He built an observatory in Northern California trying to provoke a response from the phenomenon. And this is what happened on the last day of his research. &gt;&gt; In the middle of the night, there was such a bright light that that woke her up.</p>
<p>And there were no curtains anymore. There was nothing on the windows. There was a light that brightened up the whole forest. It was intense white tending to the ultra violet. And she saw this and um then told me about it and it was like something very much alive saying goodbye.</p>
<p>And that you know the there there is a sense of humor in all the manifestations of UFOs. A sense of humor at a level which is difficult for us to accept. &gt;&gt; The timing was too perfect to be a coincidence. Nothing for years. Then this spectacular light display on the final night as if the phenomenon was kind of winking at him.</p>
<p>And this aligns with patterns noted by other researchers. The phenomenon seems to avoid scientific documentation while maintaining just enough presence to continue the mystery. And Valet spent six decades studying UFOs and reached a revolutionary conclusion. We&#x27;re not dealing with visitors from space, but with something far more complex. a control system that&#x27;s been shaping humanity&#x27;s consciousness throughout history.</p>
<p>Whether this system is trying to guide our evolution, test our responses, or simply maintain its own hidden existence remains very unclear. But Valet&#x27;s research suggests our survival may depend on learning to communicate with it intelligently. The massive database his team built could have provided answers, but instead it disappeared into the classified world and were left with congressional hearings that treat symptoms rather than causes. Do you think Valet&#x27;s control system hypothesis explains UFO behavior better than the ET hypothesis? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below. I&#x27;m Christina Gomez and that is it for today.</p>
