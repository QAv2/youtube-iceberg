            <p>believe that that other life forms exist um I also believe I just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t make any sense why they&#x27;re like let&#x27;s just hang out never show ourselves and just do like really cool tricky stuff and have people get a bunch of blurry images of it that we can never [ __ ] see yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the weird thing know what it is man I mean it&#x27;s either natural phenomenon or it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been here a long time um or they&#x27;re probes uh from that are triggered by a certain I don&#x27;t know techn ological escalation in human society you know some of the footage that you see you&#x27;re like that is what is that it just went into the ocean it just went into the ocean at the same it&#x27;s still traveling at the same rate that it was traveling in the air things that don&#x27;t have any um that don&#x27;t that don&#x27;t um adhere to the laws of physics because they aren&#x27;t really in our Physical Realm in a way I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t really know cuz I I just it it really it baffles me and then also when the government starts releasing stuff and you got a guy going around like well you know I&#x27;ve been cleared by the you know whatever CIA or whatever to be able to talk about this weird to talk about stuff that you&#x27;re supposed to not be talking about is a weird that&#x27;s weird and then I&#x27;m like is it propaganda is it like I don&#x27;t know man it&#x27;s by 17 and uh it we were camping and uh at at night and then we decided to to climb a be in the middle of the night so we were crossing a big cattle field and then I was walking and two friends were ahead of me and I kind of just looked to my right stopped looked to my right and I just saw these in the distance I don&#x27;t know how far it would be but like you know they looked like about that big from my perspective so it was really really weird I had two friends I I kept looking at I was like come here cuz I didn&#x27;t want to not look and then look back and then they weren&#x27;t there type of movie [ __ ] but my friends came back and they look down and they they describe I didn&#x27;t even tell them what I was looking at I said tell me what you see they described what I was seeing I don&#x27;t know what it was wow but I&#x27;ve heard other stories about three lights um same kind of [ __ ] I when I&#x27;m watching like UFO whatever documentary stuff I give me chills because I&#x27;m like I&#x27;ve seen that whatever that is I&#x27;ve seen that you do hear about sightings like even in the 1800s you know 17 that&#x27;s the weird thing right that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the thing where I&#x27;m like well if it&#x27;s true but I mean in the 50s I mean there&#x27;s like shots of it there&#x27;s people took photographs of these like Squadron of glowing discs and they were kept and they going so fast that Jets couldn&#x27;t keep up with them so I had to scramble Jets at the next base and they our baseball team is are called the voyagers based off of that incident really yeah so I mean in Great Falls but like I don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s the weird thing about it I mean I do I agree with you I think there is some kind of like propulsion system and that you know is able to like change on a dime and like doesn&#x27;t necessarily get affected in the way that normal so there&#x27;s probably multiple things going on simultane that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying basically just re he recounts stories of paranormal um whether it&#x27;s uh you know occult stuff spiritual stuff but um not spiritual stuff but it&#x27;s like ghost stuff or aliens um or interdimensional travel that type of stuff and then he talks he tells the story and kind of reenacts and then at the end he kind of debunks it or tries to debunk it but he seems to be pretty impartial but he was talking about how like when they landed on the moon they did they they basically did seismic tests and the reverberance there was a reverberance that would indicate that it&#x27;s possibly Hollow and it&#x27;s it does sound like a farfetch thing but there there is a lot of there&#x27;s some kind of interesting things there again I&#x27;m not like a firm believer in it but it but if you think of it in a Fantastical way like what if that was a spaceship that just like Idol you know just they just stopped that spaceship did some experiments on Earth or whatever and just left the spaceship there I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m dumb hi guys how are you that one seems so stupid I know but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s fun to look [Music] [Music] into [Music]</p>
