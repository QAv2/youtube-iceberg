            <p>all right hello everyone uh welcome to my channel this is a channel that is dedicated toward educational matters uh particularly shedding light on uh little-known authors little-known theories theories of everything cosmologies um all-encompassing theories that uh the author or authors spent lifetimes or at least one lifetime working on but never really got the traction uh out in the uh kind of the public to get their theories out there today is video number 183 on the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory that was originally devised by Dewey B Larson back in way back in about 1930 and he kept working on it kept plugging away uh first a long period of inductive reasoning to uh take the specific to the general and then uh he then he arrived at his fundamental postulates and uh two postulates and then he took those two postulates and he took that uh through a process of deduction going from the specific to the uh General uh General to the specific and uh basically a process of uh if this than that and he derived an entire theoretical Universe from his postulates um I went over that in about 15 videos earlier here uh it&#x27;s called Uh a talk that he gave called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system and you know he starts with the postulates and then goes if this then that this and that and his theoretical Universe uh is very similar to the actual universe that the Legacy scientists have discovered through in through their observations and their measurements so uh the basic idea uh in the postulates in Larson&#x27;s system is that we live in a universe of motion the universe is made out of motion it&#x27;s not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy in particular matter and energy are actually just two different kinds of motion and motion in general is the relationship between space and time so that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time uh hence the name reciprocal system uh motion is basically a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator and all of our basic scientific quantities are actually just kinds of motion because you have um both time and space are multi-dimensional that&#x27;s what Larson calls a coordinate space and coordinate time three or more dimensions of both space and time and um so to they have their scalar aspects which Larson calls clock time and clock space uh that&#x27;s scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but has no particular direction uh the clock is always getting later and later and later and uh in in terms of space uh the clock is always getting farther and farther and farther apart so space is always getting farther and farther farther apart but in no particular direction space and time also have their discrete units so there is no minimum there is a minimum unit of space and time there is no there is no such thing as space or time under less than one unit um and ultimately there&#x27;s no such thing as space or time at all they are only they only exist in the context of motion they only exist together in motion and when you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light that sets up the speed of light as being really the midpoint of the universe the uh the zero point the origin or The Ether of this universe Larson calls it the progression of the natural reference system that is a motion outward uh at the speed of light in all directions and uh from that he basically derives his whole universe we&#x27;re looking at his 1979 book called Nothing But motion here he&#x27;s basically using these same principles to derive Atomic physics and then some organic chemistry later on once he sets up sets it up we just got done uh with the chapter 11 on the subatomic particles chapter 10 was on atoms and now uh we&#x27;re about to start chapter 12 which is called basic mathematical relations okay uh let&#x27;s uh let&#x27;s hear from Mr Larson it was pointed out in the introductory chapters that when we postulate a universe composed entirely of motion every entity or phenomenon that exists in this universe is either emotion a combination of motions or a relation between motions the discussion thus far has been addressed mainly to an examination of the primary features of the possible motions and certain of the combinations of these motions at this point it will be advisable to consider some of the basic kinds of relations that exist between motions in as much as Motion in general is defined as a relation between space and time expressed symbolically by S over t all of the different kinds of motions and the relations between motions can be expressed in space-time terms such an analysis into space and time components will be particularly helpful in putting the various physical relationships into the proper perspective and our first objective in the field we are now entering will therefore be to establish the space-time equivalence of the various quantities that constitute the so-called mechanical system consideration of the analogous quantities of the electrical system will be deferred until we are ready to be given an examination of electrical phenomena one set of these mechanical quantities is customarily expressed in velocity terms and it presents no problems one dimensional velocity is by definition s over t now uh just to clarify a little bit s over T is speed and or velocity speed is the scalar form of velocity so speed is 10 miles per hour that&#x27;s space over time what velocity adds is it adds a vector it adds a Direction so velocity is space over time but it&#x27;s in a specific direction space over time 10 miles per hour due north would be velocity it follows that two-dimensional and three-dimensional velocity is s s squared over t squared and S to the third power over t to the third power respectively acceleration the time rate of change of one-dimensional velocity is s over t squared I dropped the ball uh and it fell at 9.8 meters per second squared that is acceleration in addition to these quantities which express motion at velocities or speeds there is also a set of quantities which are fundamentally based on resistance to movement although in some applications this basic significance is obscured by other factors the objects which resist movement are atoms and particles of matter three-dimensional combinations of motions in a universe of motion where nothing exists but motion the only thing that can resist change of motion is motion the particular motion that resists any change in the motion of an atom is the inherent motion of the atom itself the motion that makes it an atom furthermore only a three-dimensional motion or motion that is automatically distributed over three dimensions is able to offer effective resistance as any vacant Dimension permits motion to take place without hindrance the magnitude of the resistance can be expressed in terms of the quantity required to eliminate the effective existing motion that is to reduce this motion to Unity in the conventional reference system this is the inverse of the motion of the atom s to the third power over t to the third power and the resistance to motion or inertia is therefore t to the third power over s to the third power power in more General application inertia is known as mass inasmuch as current physical Theory recognizes gravitation and inertia as phenomena of a quite different character the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass which has been experimentally demonstrated to the almost incredible accuracy of less than one part in um 100 billion is regarded as very significant although there is considerable difference of opinion as to what that significance actually is as expressed by Clifford M will quote the theoretical interpretation of the iotvos experiment which demonstrates the equivalence has varied will asserts that it is now believed that the results of this experiment rule out all non-metric theories of gravitation he defines metric theories as those in which gravitation can be treated as being synonymous with the curvature of space and time after the theorists have arrived at such far-reaching such a far-reaching conclusion on the basis of what will admits is no more than a conjecture it comes as something of an anti-climax when the reciprocal system reveals that nothing of an esoteric nature is involved gravitation is emotion but it can manifest itself either directly as motion or inversely as resistance to another motion multiplying Mass t to the third power over s to the third power by velocity s over T we obtain momentum t to the s t to the second power over s to the second power the reciprocal of two-dimensional velocity another multiplication by velocity s over T gives us energy T over s energy then is the reciprocal of velocity when one dimensional motion is not restrained by opposing motion it manifests itself as velocity when it is so restrained it manifests itself as potential energy kinetic energy is merely energy in transit so to speak it is a measure of the energy that has been used to produce the velocity of a mass this is one half MV squared equals 1 over 2 t to the third power over s to the third power which is matter times s to the second power over t to the second power equals one-half T over s and can be extracted for other use by terminating the motion this explanation of the nature of energy should be of some assistance to those who are still having some difficulty with the concept of scalar motion both speed and energy are scalar measures of motion but on on our side of the unit speed boundary the low speed side where all motion is in space speed can be represented in our conventional spatial system of reference because it causes a change of position inward or outward in space whereas energy cannot be so represented on the high speed side of the boundary that is the cosmic sector in uh the relations are inverted there are Mo they&#x27;re all motion is in time and the measure of that motion the energy T over s the inverse of speed s over T can be represented in a stationary temporal reference system whereas speed is neither inward nor outward from the the time standpoint and cannot be represented in the temporal coordinate system here is the reason for the purely scalar nature of any increment of speed beyond the unit level such as those discussed in chapter 8. the added speed does have a Direction but it is a direction in time and it has no vectorial effect in a spatial system of reference we will find this very significant when we undertake an examination of some of the recently discovered high-speed astronomical objects in volume 2. Force which is defined as the product of mass and acceleration f equals m a becomes a t to the third power over s to the third power times s over t to the Square t squared equals T over s squared acceleration and force are thus inverse quantities in the sense in which that term is generally used in this work that is they are identical except that space and time are interchanged they are not inverse in the mathematical sense as their product is not equal to Unity one special type of force that is of particular interest is the gravitational force that which the Aggregates of matter appear to exert on each other by reason of their motions inward in space in this case the mathematical expression f equals constant m 1 over distance squared by which the force is ordinarily calculated is quite different from the general Force equation f equals m a when taken at their face value these two expressions are clearly irreconcilable if gravitational force is actually a force even a force of the as if variety it cannot be proportional to the product of two masses that is to uh M squared when force is when force in general is proportional to the first power of the mass there is an obvious contradiction here most of the other common quantities of the mechanical system can be reduced to space-time terms without any complications for example impulse the product of force and time has the same dimensions as momentum uh times ft equals T over s squared times T equals t squared over s squared I&#x27;m not too sure about that one I was under the impression that uh impulse was t squared over s anyway both work and torque are the products of force and distance and have the same dimensions as energy work in torque f s equals T over s squared times s equals T over s pressure is force per unit area uh which is uh T over s I&#x27;m not sure where he&#x27;s getting this from exactly but uh pressure is forced per unit area that&#x27;s uh T over s squared um divided by S squared so pressure is T over s to the fourth power density is mass per unit volume and that is uh mass is T to the third power over s to the third power times one over s to the third power and so that is um t to the third power over s to the sixth power viscosity is mass per unit length per unit time that works out to be t to the second power over s to the fourth power surface tension is force per unit length and that turns out to be T over s to the third power and then power is work per unit time power is 1 over s is as energy per time T over s times 1 over t equals 1 over s all of the established relations in the field of mechanics have the same dimensional consistency on the basis of these space-time Dimensions as in the conventional forms since the mass terms in the equation are in all cases balanced by derivatives of Mass on the opposite side of the equation the numerical values in these equations likewise retain the same relationships as all that we have done from this standpoint is to change the size of the unit in which the quantity of mass is expressed what has been accomplished then is to express mass in terms of the components of motion since mechanics Deals Only with space time and mass it follows that so far as mechanics is concerned by reducing Mass to motion we have confirmed the validity of the basic postulate that the physical universe is composed entirely of motion okay we will leave it there and we will probably go over this paragraph again and then proceed onward in this chapter on basic mathematical relations thanks for tuning in and have a great day</p>
