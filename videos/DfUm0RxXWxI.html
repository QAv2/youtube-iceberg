            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Stanford University okay so we go ahead and get started so we have over here Gilman Louie so uh Gilman&#x27;s come to the class pretty much every single year since it started not just this class but the other class that John wi and I do together so he&#x27;s basically like a Stanford Professor now so uh Gilman was founder of um Gilman was founder of Nexa Corporation where he designed and developed the FAL F16 flight simulator and then through a series of mergers and aqua dispositions Gilman became CEO and chairman of a well-known gaming company called Spectrum holite as well as uh chairman of micros um another gaming company and at Spectrum holite Gilman was notable for being the first person to license Tetris out of the Soviet Union have some questions on that later and then um he left the private sector and became the first CEO and founder of inel which is a nonprofit that was created to basically connect the US intelligence Community with uh the startup venture-backed entrepreneurial committee uh community and um after then he went back to the private sector moved to San Francisco founded alop Partners where he&#x27;s been investing there since 2007 also involved um in the intelligence commune and just a number of Senate committees and uh still has an active Public Service career so have some questions on that as well I think that&#x27;s a short a bridged bio but we&#x27;ll dive into some additional things so I guess I&#x27;ll start um very briefly in terms of a couple questions on your early career in gaming and then really focused on your work at inkel since I think that&#x27;s what the class is very interested in and then a little bit about your VC work at ala partners and then um finally some of your Public Service uh Civic engagement works so um so I guess uh just in terms of gaming how did you get into gaming and uh specifically uh the Falcon F-16 simulator was one of kind of the big big hits that you developed I guess can you talk a little bit about that sure um you know I was one of those kids growing up in San Francisco Public Schools um and in any public schools even in those days you you have detering of the kids and so there was always that you know honors program track probably almost all of you guys were in it and when you were going through public schools and um so in any one of those classes are 30 kids and there&#x27;s always a kid who&#x27;s the smartest kid in the class and there&#x27;s always the kid that&#x27;s the dumbest kid in the smart class and I was the dumbest kid in all the smartest class so uh and and before they had the diagnosis of ADHD uh you know I just got bored and I started making paper games um my brother uh who served in the Navy um used to sneak me into the local uh Community College and and to play the first generation computer games and back then it was you know it&#x27;s basically you had a cyber system and you were you had a basically a terminal with paper tape and uh I used to play Star trekk Star Trek uh 77 Star Trek 73 uh and you know you had the thing that go you know Spock fire fire phasers so I said hey this is pretty cool this is a lot more fun than class um I had uh I was just told by the school district I still hold the record for the lowest GPA ever to win the outstanding student award in San Francisco which is like had a 2.9 GPA but um that&#x27;s a different store for a day so uh I took my paper gaming background and you know combined it with learning how to program and the first generation micro computers came out the k8s Apple twos the Commodore pets uh I started to write programs for those computers and recruited my frat brothers because my frat brothers you know you grow in San Francisco State you&#x27;re not going to get a job afterwards so I convinced them to work for me for nothing and said at least this the way you get experience and so the frap Brothers and I put together the company and we started publishing games and in those days it was on a cassette put it in a Ziploc bag you send it to a local computer store and they put it on a hanger and that was uh how we used to make computer games and uh and Falcon came about because uh we were at a West Coast computer fair in 1978 and uh all my non-asian fra Brothers decided to go have lunch so we&#x27;re sitting there in a this J group of contingents of Japanese Executives show up thinking that we were Japanese Americans we didn&#x27;t want to tell them we were not but so we kind of faked it and then they say hey we&#x27;re looking for developers to develop software for a new computer that we&#x27;re playing to launch in in Japan and it turned out that group of Chinese Executives uh came from a company called asy Microsoft of Japan and uh I got my first Contact tracks to actually develop games for the Japanese Microsoft standard called the MSX and the lead product manager I was on the Tokyo train and he air he loved airplanes right so he he you know he&#x27;s one of those guys who had every single magazine about every single fighter jet in his bag he pulls this out and he goes he gives me an F15 you know magazine about the F-15 he goes you think you can build one of these as a simulator on the on the MSX and because because you&#x27;ve got a lot more memory now we have 16k of memory 16k um I said wow 16k that&#x27;s pretty good but I can&#x27;t do the F-15 HUD because I can&#x27;t do the pool lines I can do the F-16 because it&#x27;s a simpler HUD so why don&#x27;t we just do the F-16 instead so I wrote my first program with my friends we published it in Japan it became a hit and uh that was the first generation it showed up in the US as a Sega cart um but it it was great I mean I had to go in and learn everything there was to know about air planes and what you can do on AK on AK machine or 6K machine yeah so when you guys merged with Spectrum holbi um and it formed a company called sphere and then you were CEO of that and then the name changed back to Spectrum Hall white so won&#x27;t dive into all of those details but um another hit game that was developed was Tetris which you first licensed from its Soviet Creator in 1987 um were there some negotiations with the Soviet government as well on that or dealing with the Russians you know this class is Sil valy on the US government so government the difference between negotiating the rights for Tetris is not that different than negotiating a nuclear armor disarmament treaty with them right uh it&#x27;s kind of really interesting you know what happened to us was this we&#x27;re sitting around at the Consumer Electronic Show and typically you have these guys who go from who Scurry around looking for interesting games from abroad and try to get the rights and then license them into the US by selling it to a game publisher and so they showed us this game um and it was Tetris and I loved it I said this is great and the agent was saying hey look everybody&#x27;s turned down this game because you know brother bun turned down the game EA turned down the game Sega turned down the game because you know it was a stupid game right there&#x27;s there the graphics were awful nobody dies you know bad sound right and I kind of go yeah it&#x27;s really addicting I really kind of like this game and I said but I want to make some changes I need to talk to the programmers and the agent kind of looks at me he goes well we got a problem here I go what&#x27;s the problem he goes well the programmers are in the Soviet Union so I turned to my partner Phil Adams I said get the rights put it in a red box with a hammer and sickle and get it out in the next 6 months cuz I had heard through the rumor mill that there was going to be a the very first set of talks between the Soviet Union and the us and it would be between Reagan and gor off I said get the game rights right and if this thing actually comes to he we&#x27;re going to launch the game during the talks and that&#x27;s what we did right we launched the game during the talks we even hired a fake gorbachov and a fake Ronald Reagan look alike if you were any ads in the USA to day that says you know of course there&#x27;ll be the headlines you know gorov meet with Reagan going through all the issues around nuclear peripher and then on you know the back of the page would be our ad with the fake Reagan and gorbachov saying what they were really do doing during the secret Summit they were playing Tetris right um but it got ugly the the game became a hit and I had met a friend in Japan and he wanted to license it to the Japanese and um I could I came back and there&#x27;s a whole story can buy several books on this you know the rights got confused and so the Russians decided that there was going to be a lot of money into this thing and because Nintendo wanted it for the Game Boy and my paring company that time we were owned by the Maxwell Corporation and they my sister my not particularly smart sister company in England decided to trade the rights of Tetris for blasteroids like who cares about blasteroids awful good so um so what they did was they renegotiated the rights in Japan and and and then went back to Russia and get the Russians to say that the regional contract is void and that they that which would allow them to get the rights directly to Nintendo right and basically null avoiding the regional contract that we have because their claim was the agency that we were dealing with didn&#x27;t have the rights to negotiate it and they were kind of making up the rules as they went along um I mean it all worked out in the end because at least I got my rights protected uh because it was again the Japanese were good to me but the other guys got all cut out Atari got cut out and the game became a big hit and the reason I became a big hit was because it was the first game to ship packed in with the first generation Game Boy in fact there&#x27;s some pictures of Hillary Clinton playing Tetris there was a hardcore Tetris player you know she had her own Game Boy and she would endlessly play it so there&#x27;s actually a picture you look it up on the internet for playing on a on a Game Boy on a airplane playing Tetris but it it it was nuts but the negotiations were tricky the original programmers got nothing right uh my my Japanese friend did a great job continuing to negotiate with the Russians and with the Japanese and eventually the rights reverted back to Hank and Hank shared those rights with Alexi so at the very end Alexi Act got his due but he had to wait like 20 years uh but in the meantime during those 20 years at least he got a chance to get out of Moscow Liv in the United States work at Microsoft and kind of live the American dream but um it was tricky so then after that you held a number of other positions in the gaming industry you were chairman of micros Chief creative officer of Hasbro um but I&#x27;m what I&#x27;m really curious about is how did you jump from all of that in the gaming sector to running utel so my company got bought by Hasbro right we went public did the classic thing then hasel came in and bought the company and I was also on the board of another company called wizards of the co who produced the game called Magic the Gathering and then we got the rights for Pokemon and then we published that and then Pokemon went crazy just like it Pokemon gos gone crazy today same same story just one was about paper other one was about your cell phone um so I was a Chief creative officer hassard that&#x27;s what happened after the company got bought they said we want you to be our chief creative officer and set up our online strategy for all hpal and I got to tell you that is the best job in the world the chief creative officer of a toy company I mean I was Tom Hanks in the movie Big right they paid me a lot of money to go this toy sucks right or you know I look at this toy this furry toy that basically talked and was called the Furby and I go this it&#x27;s going to be the hottest things in slice spread right we got to get the Furby we got to get that that that product and then and then we oh we got to get the Star Wars rights you know we had these little painted characters and we sold them for tons of money we sold a billion dollars worth of Star War was terrible movie but great characters that I mean we had really good painting on those characters it went crazy um so I was having the time of my life right they bought my company they bought the second company I was on the board of for a large obscene sum of money back in those days and and I was going to St their online division so H said okay look we&#x27;ll put together the plan we&#x27;re going to do what they called a tracking stock in those days we were going to create a stock that would be publicly listed side by side Hasbro that will be the the digital media of Hasbro and I would they basically they said we&#x27;ll make you the number two of that company which you right can&#x27;t had a better job than that right and I don&#x27;t have to be a public CEO anymore have to worry about all this stuff I just have fun so um hasel gets a call from Fortune Magazine and Fortune says hey look do you have any fighter pilots in your senior executive ranks because we&#x27;re going to do this kind of kind of cute article about who&#x27;s the top gun in public companies and we got all these former military fighter pilots right and we&#x27;re going to go and spend a day fighter pilots in the class right cool so so we&#x27;re going to take them we&#x27;re going to put them in t-34s over Atlanta and dog fight and see who was the best guy right and has goes so we don&#x27;t have any fighter pilot but we did buy this game company right that did this flight simulator and they go the Ridder goes oh that&#x27;s perfect right gamer versus fighter pilot right and I was the gamer so um so H Alan Hassell calls me up and goes Gilman we need you to go to the land I represent hasel don&#x27;t don&#x27;t crash the plane right uh and that time my game became a pretty big hit falcon for a lot of the military guys were using it in fact Falcon 4 was designed originally as a trainer but we didn&#x27;t win the contract with the Department of Defense because they said they can&#x27;t give a contract to a bunch of Gamers so uh we lost the contract I just published the game and then we made millions of dollars so men more copies than trainers out there but the so the fighter pilot at the Virginia International Guard basically put me in the backseat of the F-16 right taught me how to cheat during a dog fight they would say you know if you ain&#x27;t cheating you ain&#x27;t trying right so you know they taught me all the tricks of how to unload the plane right before the merge right and how how to get the jump on the other guy so here I am I&#x27;m in Atlanta in these t-34s I have a fighter weapon School pilot who&#x27;s the guy who&#x27;s supposed to take it off and land so if I don&#x27;t kill myself since I&#x27;m not a licensed pilot um uh but I had enough sometime right real real sometime so so I I take my controls and the first guy I had to go against was the head of hydri and struggles Federal group and he was an F-15 reservist Brigadier General former A1 decorated pilot right so a anybody knows anything about airplanes and A1 is not that different than the t t34 except that the A1 has a lot more power right and the fighter weapon School guy is F14 driver right who is not used to an underpower aircraft you know he not used to bleeding off all that energy in a turn so so I go up right first time do left left I&#x27;m dead in 34 seconds right and I go up again against Randy I&#x27;m dead in 28 seconds which is the way it&#x27;s supposed to be you know he&#x27;s an A1 pilot and I fly video games um then that the fighter weapon Skool guy tried to take out Randy and he was current but you know even though got behind Randy he can never get into the actual into the sight so you to see Randy smiling laughing and we&#x27;re so close right because we were on guns guns and um then it came time for me to fly against the president of Bader who&#x27;s a Canadian F1 pilot so um I ate his lunch I did a maneuver he totally did not expect right and uh did a snapshot got him out and then we land and then suddenly Randy takes my tape and you know and so I go home then I get a phone call from Randy and Randy goes hey you know I&#x27;m recruiting for this job and you know you might be really interested I go I&#x27;m not looking for a job you can&#x27;t get a better job I&#x27;m like I&#x27;m the toy guy he goes no no no you you&#x27;ll like this job right I said okay just send me this stuff over because you know he&#x27;s said that 15 driver I got to listen to what he has to say so Randy sent to me this PE this white paper and it&#x27;s titled the corporation right everything in this is in code words right the corporation the activity the engagement right I mean it&#x27;s like there was like reading a spy novel and I said well who wrote this thing right it doesn&#x27;t say anything he goes well you know we need to have a meeting can you come to Washington we give you a little more in Insight so I go to Washington and then he tells me this job is for the CIA and they had this idea that they&#x27;re going to create this something they didn&#x27;t know what the thing was was but they were trying to solve a problem the problem they were trying to solve was how to get technology companies who historically has never engaged with the federal government to actually provide Technologies particularly in the it space that the government can leverage because they were really afraid of what they called at that time the prospects of a digital Pro Harbor uh you know the challenge of the digital PRS everybody thinks of some kid in the Philippines launching a massive Cyber attack in the US they were not worried about that uh what they were really worried about was you thought about the conditions to Pro Harbor per Harbor happened when every different part of the government had a piece of the information but they couldn&#x27;t Stitch it together to say look at you know the tack andur Harbor was imminent right the White House had a piece of information Naval intelligence had a piece of information you know the you know the ambassadors had a piece of information State Department had a piece of information but they couldn&#x27;t put it all together right the military had their sensors and they just figure it out so they you the CIA was started because the whole idea to creating a CIA in 1947 was to avoid po Harbor ever it happen again and so in the conditions in 1998 they began to realize that information was siloed across all these different intelligence agencies of which he could never Stitch it together and that the only hope that it had was to get it Solutions in and this is was before the age of big data but but fundamentally they describe was was the big data problem and how how do you Stitch that together to get intelligence out of that data so so I guess can you talk a little bit more about the process in which incel was created and where did the name incel even come from yeah it was called pelus at the time um the former head of Alex Brown CEO of Alex Brown became a personal advisor to the director of Central Intelligence um and and and that advisor uh our special advisor was Buzzy Chrome guard Buzzy&#x27;s son later became a Amro Special Force Navy SEAL kind of guy right I mean Buzzy was crazy right he loved being ahead of Alex Brown but he secretly really wish he was the Spy right or Special Forces all his kids at the age of six were throwing knives against trees and stuff like that and that&#x27;s why they grew up and kind of joined the Special Forces so Buzzy said um we need a way to engage and uh so he created this group director Central Intelligence sewed it to the said it and said look we don&#x27;t know what it is but here&#x27;s our problem we want you to give we want you to allocate $3 to $50 million for us to create this thing and we&#x27;ll get people you trust to figure it out so we&#x27;ll get Bill Perry Rich you guys just met a couple sessions ago uh Norm Augustine no chairman of lock Mart we&#x27;ll get um Steve Freeman from Goldman Sachs and you know it&#x27;s like the who&#x27;s who of industry and the defense St Department right around in in the intelligence service around the table to create this thing and somebody they met with me they kind of said what do you think of our business plan I said kind of sucks because it doesn&#x27;t say anything and it&#x27;ll never work I I said what you should do is just create a venture capital fund if you create a venture capital fund like the way Intel has a strategic Venture you can mine all the deals in the valley you can cherry pick what you want right you&#x27;re not going to take a whole lot of the deal and as long as you provide a valued service like easy access to the federal government who&#x27;s the largest buyer of it and you don&#x27;t have to deal with any the paperwork called the federal acquisition regulations so, 1650 pages of finely printed rules and regulations if and you don&#x27;t have to deal with defense contractors you can get the right companies to play so I said but your name is a bad name pelus is a bad name because remember pelus is a Greek mythology flawed human who became a God and did some bad things with his mom and I said we got to have a better name than that so um it was originally called inq it and the e i n was for information kind of technology and the Q was named after the character in James bot right Chris remember so so we we very conscious of our problem right this is a CIA we&#x27;re going to go to Silicon Valley or Berkeley and we&#x27;re going to convince them to cross not go to Kleiner not go to Sequoia not to go to all those other Venture funds and come to the CIA you know in those days particularly in the Beltway the the view of of same with today&#x27;s view so Val in Beltway it&#x27;s like a bunch of liberal you know people with t were wearing sandals who don&#x27;t care about our country and they&#x27;ll never ever do this this is going to be terrible right and CIA is like Evo it&#x27;s bad you know we kill people for a living you know they&#x27;ll never do deals with us I said no no no no no no outside the Beltway if you do it right CIA can be cool right it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like James Bond and they go no James Bond is MI6 I said nobody knows right just take the queue so that&#x27;s what we did and then and then of course into it got all upset because they they said it was like brand confusion so Scott called up and complained and and then the CIA told me to tell Scott to stick it I said you don&#x27;t want to pick a fight first day out of the sh you don&#x27;t want to pick a fight so we called up Intel and we said we call it in qel would you sue us and guys Intel said no right it said they like it&#x27;s Intel with the Q inside so that so we we we we play that all and it became Inky tail and you know um and our debut happened in the Press because the DCI accidentally leaked see it didn&#x27;t just happen this last week accidentally leaked to The Washington Post that they were going to do this so the Washington Post was going to write a story so the CIA being the CIA was really worried that if the Washington Post came out in favor of the idea of the Central Intelligence Agency setting up a venture capital Fund in Silicon Valley the the New York Times would take the opposite point of view right and so there was a dilemma um so they asked me to call the New York Times so that they that the Articles would come out at the same time so if they came out at the same time they can&#x27;t change their mind particularly if they don&#x27;t know what the other guy is thinking right so I called up my friend and he said fine we&#x27;ll put it on the business section this sounds pretty cool we&#x27;ll write it up as a business story where because we had to keep it away from the editorial desk at the New York Times the editorial desk the New York Times hates the CIA right but the business guys thought it was cool right because it was Venture C was kind of cute story um particularly named after the Q character so so everything I called it at C it&#x27;s all set when when the post runs their story same day the times is going to run their story and it&#x27;s going to be a positive story my friend writing an article and then the agency cost me back goes no you need to call up the times and ask them not to publish the article well you just told me to call them right right I got it all set up me what&#x27;s wrong now they said well here&#x27;s the problem we for we didn&#x27;t know the DCI kind of told the Washington Post was going to be an exclusive and nobody told us that so George kind of made this promise to the post George Tennant so um quick cut I call back to times my friend starts laughing just laughing on the other in the phone he goes the editor is sitting right here right you ask him so the editor picks up the editors of New York Times picks up the phone and go look it&#x27;s going to be a great story but just because you want us to hold the story so the post can run run the article first right I go yes exactly and the agency promises they&#x27;ll give you some other exclusive down he goes tell George tenant that um not only are we going to run the story we&#x27;re going to run it A1 above the fold and it&#x27;s going out on the wire now and then the thing just took off like w fire and uh nobody cared about Spy only I think only Baron&#x27;s like two days later r a negative piece about spies in the valley but everybody else thought it was cool so it was widely covered and we were kind of like Off to the Races but that&#x27;s how how we C got it finally named it Cel and how it became really really positive you know and it did solve a whole class of problems but you know our our biggest challenge was not Silicon Valley our biggest problems were in the agency you know there was a lot of concern by the Congress first that we were using taxpayers dollars so to get other people Rich right they didn&#x27;t like that idea they didn&#x27;t like the idea that is this really a fair mechanism because government is about fairness and they were afraid that Inc would be picking winners and selecting losers uh there was a group of neocons who thought that we were uh basically in interfering with industry right we tried to remind people of time this 1999 that $30 million against a hundred billion being invested by Venture Capital really didn&#x27;t know to anything right um so we had you know teams of Investigations we had the House Appropriations Committee special Investigation Unit sent investigators down that checked if whether or not this thing was legal to do they hired business Executives of National Security to basically see if this business idea had any legs they had inspector General&#x27;s office came in and do a complete audit against the CIA this is my first three months on the job right I mean and we cleared that but the other problem we had was the cultural problem in the agency yeah and and so I guess one more question on that so like one of the concerns of Congress was that incel would make so much money just like profits from unicorn type Investments that it might fund operations that they don&#x27;t have any oversight over so I guess what was kind of the solution you would never do that oh so we call it catastrophic success right so what would happen if we did the next Google right so the big concern was if we give you $30 million and you come back with3 billion right now you got a new problem because the CIA has a slush fund that so the House Appropriations Committee was very concerned about that not just the slush fund let&#x27;s say you didn&#x27;t make that kind of money but you got something in TW um you could self-fund this organization which means you never had to go back to the Congress for ever get any more new Appropriations now I would think that would be a good thing right I mean most people would say look taxpayers SP give one time make enough money right we never have to use another dollar taxpayer again wrong Congress goes it&#x27;s the our only way to control government is to control the budget so unless we&#x27;re giving you money we have no control over you and we&#x27;re never don&#x27;t going to give up that control so you had to promise us that you never make too much money you have to promise US you can&#x27;t make too much money if you do it&#x27; be really bad so we actually tried to design the model so that we wouldn&#x27;t make very much money right so we said okay uh we won&#x27;t buy shares we&#x27;ll buy warrant we&#x27;ll only take a little bit in warrants we try to structure it as some sort of contract no matter how hard we tried we made money right we did Google Earth we kho which became Google Earth we did palente I mean we had like eight public companies um but you know we came out with a structure that everybody just agreed to the rule structure was this the CIA did not want to see the money go back to treasury so the agreement with the Congress say any proceeds was in the nonprofit and it&#x27;s up to the nonprofit to administer and it won&#x27;t go back to treasury the CIA was concerned that this would become this a money production exercise that people just rob their funds out of right or even worse cut the cia&#x27;s budget and balance it with the the proceeds for mikito CIA had to promise get the pr to that we will never give the money to the CIA then what do we do with the money so the deal was uh it would be used for research and um research activities as directed by the independent Board of incel on behalf of the intelligence Community but cannot be used for Investments so all the proceeds are used to fund special projects now things like project Cosmos you know getting people together think about space working with companies around big data so that&#x27;s how they&#x27;re using the BR seeds but it was there are a lot of hurdles that we had to overcome right um but I would say the toughest hurdle was still in the building because we were not trusted in the building by by a certain percentage of the building I mean the S&amp;T guys loved us Science and Technology folks they loved us um because it&#x27;s kind of their initiative and then the analyst thought this was pretty cool because the analyst likes information they like new tools director in operations hated us so they basically pulled me into a room and told me I was the equivalent of white whale 20,000 Le on see um that there&#x27;s nothing I could do that they could ever use they already had the best Technologies because they had all these defense contractors and I had stolen their money and that anything I that the West Coast would provide partly wouldn&#x27;t work anyway and it would get them all killed so get the hell out of here right so you know so I think that mean it go up DCI goes how did it go I go wow I think I just got my first hazing uh but you know from their point of view they were right I mean we we were we never were in the field we we didn&#x27;t understand your business and if it didn&#x27;t work people would get killed right or the wrong thing would happen so the dite in response to that said okay your job now is to spend half the time in the building or out in the field and half the time toing venture capital and Buzzy was really smart because Buzzy said unless you get and warm up to the DL and understand your business you will never be trusted um and you should go after the young case officers the Younger Next Generation because they&#x27;re going to be much more open-minded than the old guys and you&#x27;re going to earn their respect so my first you know two or three years up until 911 was kind of building that that that that bridge of trust right getting inside that Circle of trust um but 911 really changed everything so I guess how did inel change after 911 well before 911 we were a great a great experiment right it&#x27;s kind of cool sidebar thing look at some cool Tad see what companies we engage with 911 was like this moment where we just got to ask it I mean my my office was on the top of the Twin Towers in Arlington was the USA the day towers and it was a straight view shot right into the Pentagon and my staff watched that that plane do the turn in because the the Twin Towers in Arlington are the is the turning point for for Reagan National that&#x27;s where everybody used to site in before they go on the Final Approach and so what was weird was this plane went behind the building rather than in front of the building and my staff that&#x27;s watched that plane plow in to the Pentagon now I wasn&#x27;t there I was in the special meeting trying to figure out what the threats of 2015 were going to be and then everybody rushes in the room goes we don&#x27;t need this meeting anymore we just figured it out right and um so so as we we&#x27;re going back to our office we see the the fire and people don&#x27;t remember the fire lasted for days in the Pentagon you just loed into this building it wasn&#x27;t like the twin to Towers where fell and and number seven fell and there was a pile of rubble this thing was burning and the people going into the building going to work every day while the building was on fire right because we&#x27;re at War and so we were immediately called into what can we get to solve this problem now right and so know one of the stories at the time was you had this company that was doing technology later got bought by IBM for the casinos a guy by named Jeff Jonas and and he built the software that allowed casinos to figure out whether there was clusive activities in the casino right uh for and this is really important if anybody wants to everybody saw the movie about the kids for MIT who go in and you know but this guy wrote the software to beat those kids right so what he did was he figured out you know certain patterns and he put all the data in the data pole so he as soon as Ernestine charged the credit card or the cameras would pick up ernestine&#x27;s face it would automatically run it against you know the book now say Ernest wasn&#x27;t in the book but his software would also do an analysis of the table that ernin sits down the front in the blackjack table find out if there&#x27;s any relationship between Ernestine and the dealer right because that&#x27;s the biggest threat to a casino there&#x27;s a collusive activity between a player and somebody who&#x27;s the dealer you could get burned for two 1020 million in one night and the rules are if the casino catches ering while she&#x27;s still in the casino they get to recover the money but as soon she leaves they don&#x27;t get to recover that money goes to stay in Nevada so there&#x27;s a huge incentive to come up realtime systems to catch bad guys and so we had just started a pilot with 911 happened and um what we did was Jeff figured out all the data that was necessary given the fact of all the attackers we had to find out you know what their relationships to other people and what MOS that they were using and it turned out of the 23 attackers I think it was like 21 20 or 21 of them uh would have been discovered um if they had run that set of algorithm against the first bomber attack remember the Twin Towers were attacked twice the first time it failed while there were some bench warrants out on the guys who were involved in the first time and they pulled that thread they what they found was people using the same address people using the same frequent flyer numbers people using Sim same phone numbers and they would have been able to figure it out 21 of the 23 simply by matching the original data that they had the first time but they didn&#x27;t have the tools so once they figured out that inut could be useful then it was like okay whatever you guys need and from that point forward it was inel was like first port to call when you needed new technology and you didn&#x27;t have it in building so the psychology completely changed yeah so I guess another interesting aspect of incel was the inel interface Center uh within the CIA and helped bridge the gap between incel&#x27;s unclassified efforts and then the agency&#x27;s classified work building a problem site can you talk a little bit more about that and um kind of what how does that work well you know most strategic funds fail they don&#x27;t accomplish the mission right I mean people don&#x27;t like to talk about it but when a corporation sets a vent typically a bunch of VPS usually somebody not good enough to run the division right uh or some Maverick who&#x27;s kind of a pain in the butt or somebody from a finance department saying hey you know let&#x27;s do a venture fund the problem with most strategic funds not all but most strategic funds fail because they have no strategic value to the corporation because they&#x27;re investing without any direct links into the operational part of the Enterprise right so the line managers go look I don&#x27;t care about what you invest in I don&#x27;t care about what the startup is I got to produce on my p&amp;l every single day and if I get stuck with your stuff I&#x27;m not doing what I&#x27;m doing and then if I take your stuff and it&#x27;s successful right you get all the all the street credits for it because you know VPS and big corporations are all competing against each other for Budget right so one of the things that we recognized and when we set up incel was we needed a fast track to get the technology into the building because look our job wasn&#x27;t to make money our job was to find technology that would actually be in operational use again DCI being very smart chose the very best officers young officers on a career track now how many here have been involved with government military okay so there&#x27;s a ranking system that goes you know GS the GS schedule goes up to 15 then you become senior executive or senior intelligence officer which is the equivalent like becoming a general right sis 1 2 3 4 five so what they did was they got all these 15s who were the best and brightest who are about to make Sis one and said we&#x27;re going to pull you out and you&#x27;re going to do incub the reason why they did that was one not only to help trans for the solutions that we found because they knew they had the personal networks in the building to know who to avoid in the building right because in any group big Enterprise it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s the groups are really really there there always smart people around the table but there&#x27;s smart people around the table who are designed to kill you and there are smart people who want to make change right so they were able to say don&#x27;t talk in fact my first on my first trip to New York I had the person in charge of the new New York field office pumi Assad who was the former deputy do and former deputy D DDI said here&#x27;s a list of names and I go oh this is great this is the list of guys I should work with you know goes these are the people to avoid in the building never ever ever engage with these they are smart they will make you do studies they will give you py they will bury you in a hole right so so what these young officers did was find all of the change agents in the buildings and cut deals with them and but the other thing that we did that was different was we allocated a budget that that group got to spend at the line level it says not only if you take this technology we&#x27;ll give you money to actually Implement we&#x27;ll give you head count to actually Implement right so they gamified the system because what they were smart they figured out is as soon as people knew that these guys had extra budget everybody wanted the game to get the extra budget extra headcount so those were the trades were made so you had trusted people in the building who knew all the networks that would work or would stop us they knew that if they were successful that it will go towards their promotion boards which is everything in in in government if you know if you got to understand if you go out of the line let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re F-15 pilot and you get your your next sentence with the Pentagon well that sucks right because your peer group gets to continue to fly planes for the next you know tour right and then when you come back and you do the evaluations they&#x27;re going to be ahead of you relative to your pair groups nobody wants to be pulled out so they had to create that kind of system um but those officers were the magic that made us work because Congress this measured Us by how many Technologies actually gained Traction in the building and had operational effect so our metrics are real simple how many solutions did you transfer and you better tell damn good story in front of Congress in the classified briefings about how many lives you saved or how many lives of the bad guys you killed or how many people you protected because if you can&#x27;t translate in that line in that you know sound bite or what today would be considered a tweet you were done and so it was awesome I mean they were very smart we get all the credit because we&#x27;re the guys out in the front and we didn&#x27;t you tell we&#x27;re running around in the Silicon Valley we&#x27;re being cool and all the articles are being written by us but the real hero were the guys in the quit the men and women the quit they were they were doing all the heavy lifting so can you talk in just in terms of employee there&#x27;s the employee investment program and a separate LLC that co-invested alongside with than youel but allowed employees to gain equity in these companies um I guess like can you just share a little bit more about that first that doesn&#x27;t exist anymore yeah but when we started we had this real concern that we couldn&#x27;t attract really good investors and young talent to actually work this right um an agency was really C they didn&#x27;t want a bunch of former guies running around in Silicon Valley right because come l a spy agency right I mean well the first thing you got to do as a case officer is to look like everybody else so right and what do case officers do they recruit somebody who&#x27;s local to do the work for them right we were being recruited so you want to recruit people who are really really good at their jobs who know how to do investing well anybody who&#x27;s really good investing if you&#x27;re going to attract it&#x27;s going to cost money even even for young kids coming out of Stanford right which where where we spend a lot of time recruiting from and so we needed something that was the equivalent of carry but it had to pass a Washington smell test so we had this thing we said um we can&#x27;t give you carry but here here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do we&#x27;re going to take a part of your compensation um instead of give you a cash bonus we&#x27;re going to invest that for you in every investment we made we had two goals one was the compensation goal but there was another more subtle goal that I wanted see in Washington investing is just called we call it investment which it&#x27;s really dispending money so whenever an agency says I invest in blah right it means you just spend a lot of money and so what I wanted people not to do is play in the experimental kind of sandbox which was easy to do you know hey this is really cool tech let&#x27;s put some money in here because it&#x27;s not our money right but the moment it was like their money it&#x27;s like no we&#x27;re not doing that deal that deal sucks right that&#x27;s the behavior that we wanted to have in place unfortunately people started to make money and um you know our first few deals you know we had some young Associates who were making by government standards obscene sons of money you know so they got like a $150,000 appreciation off the stock because the company got sold like K got bought right so there was this out cry that you know these people are profiting off of taxpayers dollars right even though I gave 100% of my money proceeds to the CIA memorial fund right so because they would always stole that in my face and I would just look at I go I&#x27;m giving my money to the widows and orphans what are you doing with yours right so that at least protected me but after a while we got to the point and finally when I left um they just the compromise was simply why don&#x27;t we just put a bonus program in place replac the equity program you know and you know the CEO the senior executive staff makes seven figures at Ino right but it&#x27;s all based on bonuses now because it somehow it sells better um I should prefer my program better because it&#x27;s like my view is love you have to have skin in the game but you know there are political realities and so you know regardless of the fact of that program being too effective um they come out of a compromise but you can tell today in a different place than when I got started when I got started was a huge risk nobody knew what the hell inel was and if you were to ask Bill Perry if Bill Perry followed me rather than came before me if you were to ask Bill Perry to predict at the point in the time he decided to join the board whether inut was going to be successful he would say not only he thought it was going to fail everybody in the board thought it was going to fail right so it would really hard to attract the best talent if you knew was going to fail but now in can tell is kind of the thing it&#x27;s the in thing right it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a way to get like a different track if you want to get into the investment World particularly if you&#x27;re coming from the military government you have any interest in that it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s pretty cool so they don&#x27;t have any problems attracting Talent today yeah so you know they prob don&#x27;t need those kinds of tools that we did in the very beginning MH so I guess um how did inel make investment decisions wow so um you know this is a challenge that I think diux has or any organization who wants to play in the valley or any of the technology areas through the country um so we&#x27;re sitting down with the CIA in the first six months and we&#x27;re in our board meeting and uh board asked a simple question to the agency goes what problems are we supposed to solve right and they all thought about it and thought about it and they came up with this list Bill Perry looked at this list they went on and on and on it must have been about4 billion dollars worth of problems on this list right and he kind of goes somebody please classify that list and shred it he like that&#x27;s not going to work so what they did was they sat down and being very thoughtful of where were their holes in their operational capab ities that could be solved with technology that was not readily available from traditional sources right so they reduced that down to a thing they called the problem set the problem set was very useful for us because the problem set allowed us because inel was designed that a handful of us had clearances but most of the people did not have clearances at inel and the reason for that is the moment you get stuck with a clearance you know too much right so but if you know nothing you can speculate all you want so if Ernestine didn&#x27;t have a clearance she could talk about you know something that she saw in 24 and said wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if you had this this and this and you know there might be this event that crisis and if we had this technology we can we could avert this crisis I could not say that because I have knowledge and even if I was just speculating like the way ER would be speculating everybody assumed that whatever came out of my mouth was no longer speculation so so a small group of us would take take that classified problem set and translate it into an investment thesis give you an example we had a problem with our cables cables or our official Communication System we used to communicate with people in the field State Department uses the cable system the military uses the cable system there are classified versions of the cable system right um and I said email this is like email it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s all in Cap all in caps right but it&#x27;s this email so we&#x27;re going to change this from a problem set relating to cables and we&#x27;re going to go out and go look for email Solutions right or we got this thing about spy Spy satellites right how do we go like analyze all this imagery and how do we get analysts to use this but we can&#x27;t talk about it&#x27;s all classified uh I know what we can do we could talk about like 3D gaming like you know we can make this like create the whole world in 3D and go find a company that can go out through that so we hire a bunch of Gamers which became keill which is now Google Earth so we took that problem set translated an investment thesis then widely talk about it to the other VCS VCS are pretty smart they go okay this is great if we find something one of our portfolio companies can immediately get they get a deal with inel they get immediately into Revenue they don&#x27;t take too much of the equity and they&#x27;ll do all the diligence for us so that became the the the beautiful cycle right companies would pitch us VCS would pitch us we would communicate the problem set if we liked it they would go thumbs up because they knew that the feds like it means there&#x27;s a revenue source and the stuff was good if we reject it then they kind of go particularly was like something like cyber security said well we&#x27;re not making that investment I mean I don&#x27;t know if you guys want to they thank you very much here&#x27;s the next one and so that&#x27;s how we got the problem set and how it got to work and then we would then find a customer in the building that was related to that problem in the first place and paid that customer to take that technology in and use it in an operational way that&#x27;s how paler got started I mean paler was this Peter deal and Alex basically meeting with me saying we got these algorithms on on fraudulent transactions we think there might be some value for the intelligence Community we brainstorm they came back and I kind of said on the black Bo need to kind look like this the team went away and did a mockup in two weeks and then immediately we took that team and put him inside the building to work a what we call a CT counterterrorist problem and they just learned that business and that became paler pal were somewhere between 10 to 20 billion dollar today because the counterterrorist problem is the same problems that banks have in fraudulent transactions and any other kind of fraud transaction additional questions for Gilman on and youel I&#x27;m really curious what it was like to deal with Congress um just in general like what was your experience trying to work with that I&#x27;m I&#x27;m also curious specifically why they couldn&#x27;t just take some of the money you were making yeah uh I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t want you to have too much leverage or something like that yeah um you got to understand so I&#x27;m a little bi so first I admit that I&#x27;m biased right so I&#x27;m always going to be biased more towards the Senate than the house um just because I was s a technical Advisory Group for the senate in a long time but one of the things I I quickly realized in the in the Congress is the power Brokers are not the members power Brokers are the staffers the staffers hold all the power right because look if you with with a notable small group of exceptions of Congress people and Senators who do their own work there&#x27;s just so much work a congress person has to go through and read and the senator right and quite fr$ 30 million that&#x27;s not even a rounding error on it&#x27;s not even three digits removed from a significant digit on the budget right it&#x27;s such a tiny number so the idea that a senator or a congress person is going to spend the level of effort to really understand the model is Nal you got 10 minutes in the hearing with the members to sell the members and if you don&#x27;t sell that member it&#x27;s over your program is dead right the leg work has to be with the staff and you got to understand staffers have many different motivations you know you get some staffers who are lifetime staffers who want to do public good you got some staffers who say you know what I need something to Rattle the system you some staffers who come from the system who may have grudges from the system that they left so they all come in different flavors so one of the challenges you have is during is a danger whenever you talk to Congress a staffer or a member of the White House that they actually do what you say that you might actually catch them in a moment where you&#x27;re listen they&#x27;re listening so you got to be really careful about what you say because there were couple times where we would say something it would end up in an executive order I mean there was even a non-al related situation I was involved in we were briefing president and then the president goes up literally a few days later during the State of the Union teleprompter comes down right now he&#x27;s ad liing and Austin are words are coming out of his mouth in the in the State of the Union right so I mean stuff like that actually happens I mean you don&#x27;t think it happens like that but it happens like that a lot so you have to be careful and you got to be very targeted for example your program could be a great program you can tell could be a great program but this week the agency needs another program to get funded or get tracked action and if I distract the members because they like my program they&#x27;re going to give me program money they&#x27;re going to take it away from this other program because at the end of the day Zero you know there&#x27;s you know there&#x27;s only so much money in the bucket so that in some ways the agency was much more protective of and making sure that I did not accidentally run into members of Congress now the good staffers figured that out very quickly and and so there was this game between the agency trying to keep me away and script what I had to say and then there were times when the staff or would know how to run around that system so there was lots of times when a member would say we want to meet with Gilman and can we please lead the rest of the CIA handlers in the hallway so it got to a point where I would show up in the meeting they would add they would dismiss my handlers my handlers and it&#x27;ll be just myself but but understand there were it&#x27;s a high State scan right right some members were fantastic other members would drive me crazy right um and they all could come from they could all come from the same state I mean I had big supporters in California and I had huge distractors in California sometimes I give a briefing and they were had the Long Knives Out I didn&#x27;t understand why I was getting slaughtered and I walked out and he said oh it had nothing to do with you we just wanted to prove to the agency that you know we had a problem with the last guy who came in here so we took it out on you right it it but it is a very Congress is a very complex but overall I would say the Congress tries to be responsible the staffers try to be responsible and my first lcon was dealing with the House Appropriations Committee and and I I didn&#x27;t understand this the Stafford said you know what the amount of money I give you may not seem like a lot of money to you like in the bigger thing which is like $30 million buys a lot of park benches always stuck with me what does park benches have to do with National Security so I leave the meeting and I go back to the agency and because they always debrief me right there always somebody who&#x27;s Deb this just the culture of the agency so I&#x27;m saying there with the debriefer I&#x27;m explain what happened and I said I don&#x27;t understand the staff was going on and on by park benches look it&#x27;s really simple they spent $30 million on park benches they get a lot more votes than giving you $30 million they give you $30 million they can&#x27;t even talk about it because it&#x27;s classified right so you got to understand where they&#x27;re coming from so I had to learn that and it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s obvious it&#x27;s not like you can watch a movie called Dave and go to Washington and suddenly like I don&#x27;t understand why people don&#x27;t understand this because everything moves something else every gear turns another gear so you got to be careful with your mouth when you go there now sometimes the agency didn&#x27;t mind me kind of shooting off of my mouth because I could say things and they can basically say well we can&#x27;t control what he has to say right I mean he&#x27;s some stilling Valley right they they they can protect me by saying that I was kind of naive in my Approach but allow me to say say things that they couldn&#x27;t say but it&#x27;s a very interesting system and it&#x27;s very foreign if you spend all your life in Silicon Valley or even in the military I mean anybody who&#x27;s been in the military you sat around and remember I went at the agency and they said hey look you got to learn how to use guns got them from California right what I need need to use a gun for I&#x27;m not going to go out in the F shoot people they go look if you can&#x27;t shoot nobody&#x27;s going to talk to you right so you know they worked it right I had to learn how to drive why the military guys drive I had to learn how to shoot I had to learn how analysts do analytical briefings I had to follow the pdb around I got to tell you it was actually a better job than haspital job in fact the DCI his last line he sold me on the line that was the closer that convinced me that I should join incel and walk away from hro so he turns to me and he goes he&#x27;s trying to convince me to take the job and he says look here&#x27;s the bottom line you just have better toys and I would say today that in spite of my love for toys and Hasbro CIA has much better toys can you uh compare and contrast incel model with diux um it seems like similar di is on the fast trck for funding to get you know Tech or you know solutions to the go to the military seems like there&#x27;s a difference there yeah there&#x27;s slight difference right so first of all is it was interesting when General Petraeus came in and kind of took over the the CIA you know the joke in the building was hey after we briefed General portray know if this is true or not but after we briefed General betus and he looked at the budget he goes oh that&#x27;s really cool he thought that was like the the you know the Spy project budget he goes well you know show me the rest of the money you know because he came from dld and he goes no that&#x27;s it that is the budget right I mean the scale of problem between dld and Intel agencies dld just dwarfs it just dwarfs that budget so for diux to be effective right it the question is how does the sa def want to use Dix diux in the mission what is the mission my mission was pretty straightforward I got to get ITN to prevent digital PR har right that I got that one that was pretty easy to figure out dld is a different Beast dld look the procuran Cycles are much longer the budgets are two orders of magnitude bigger right to to have long-term strategic impact in the dld means you have to affect the p right which you have to get back to right the Strategic initiatives strategic initiatives in dld take 10 years 20 years I mean think about the time it took when the F-35 showed up on the drawing board right until it got its initial operating condition or the F22 right it takes decades so the measures of of success impact are going to be different on dld and the I so they can&#x27;t just graph the inel model into Dix say just do what they do I mean yeah they can go around and buy onesies and twoes and cute Technologies like the way inut does but it&#x27;s not going to affect the services the same way I can walk into a group of analysts working a CT problem and say Here&#x27;s a here&#x27;s a great piece of technology give it to them and have mediate impact right because they&#x27;re going to use it they&#x27;re right there who do I give it to if I&#x27;m diux I got to negotiate with the services and then the services have to figure out which unit going to use it do I send it out to the covec coms do I send out to the brigades do I give it to the Navy okay there&#x27;s any space on the ship and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a different class of problems so those guys are very committed to moving the needle and a lot of it their success is going to be based upon how dold uses them not in their ability to create a model of Engagement with the valley I suspect they will have no problems engaging with the valley I think de big biggest challenge as was my biggest challenge with their like two orders of magnitude bigger is once they find it right how does it really move the needle and D yeah you can tell a story that this brigade over here used that the striker Brigade used this piece of technology that&#x27;s great I mean that&#x27;s nice it gives you some cute brownie points but does it really move the needle for dld and you think of dold&#x27;s real challenges we&#x27;re going from the world that we know right which boots on the ground to this weird new world right of asymmetric Warfare to cyber to information operations right we can find ourselves easily in a cold war 2.0 proliferation nucle different kinds of nukes that now almost anybody can produce right in a handful of years where Automation and you know you know AI becomes the determining factors of who wins and who loses that&#x27;s a completely different fight I mean it&#x27;s the equivalent of us today saying we need to build more battleships going into World War II and somebody says airplane right and so their challenge is not finding the next piece of technology to make the battleship better their challenge is going to say what&#x27;s the equivalent of airplane to the dld today as it was in World War II that&#x27;s a much bigger challenge so it&#x27;s a hairy job R&amp;D from the private public public sector has decreased comparing to the private sector as we we all know and all these thex and EQ start to to to to appear and how do you see the relation between silicon B Valley and it communities and the government in 10 years where is this going well um the good news is I don&#x27;t think there going to be a lot of inut I mean there&#x27;ll be perod in times where everybody wants to a venture capital fund Department energy Department of aded you know everyone wants to do a venture capital that&#x27;ll sort of stuff out I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not worried about that though does creat noise and conflicts confusion right here I&#x27;m from the government you know I want to invest in you it kind of creates its own unique problems I think the real issue of of Silicon Valley is and the government particularly in things like the intelligence community and the defense department and and eventually law enforcement is the relationship of silicon Valley&#x27;s view of whether they believe in the they believe in the uh believe in the mechanisms and institutions that are asking them to support and I give you an example I think Snowden whether you agree with the guy or disagree with the guy had a huge impact right and how people think about whether to cooperate with the US government right right I think you know regardless of your political views today of the current Administration it&#x27;s going to have an impact if you believe in the mission 911 worked because everybody believed hey it&#x27;s a bad idea to have planes crashing in the building a lot of us people died right terrorism obviously wasn&#x27;t some that you read about it it was brought home right people rallied around that it was a single Mission it was clear as day it was right in front of us if those lines get confusing people are just going to check out they&#x27;re going to say you know what I&#x27;m not going to let my data be shared right because I don&#x27;t know how that data is going to use I&#x27;m not going to give my technology because I don&#x27;t have confidence that you&#x27;re going to use that technology appropriately right in my view of where I think this country should go so I think over the next four or eight years regardless of you know this Administration or the next administ the real challenge of your question for 10 years is is whether or not people have faith in institutions who are using this technology you know one of the things I say is you know technology is just a tool but just like the Germans right I mean it&#x27;s sort of like World War II versus the us so I let me get back step just one step so I&#x27;m the chairman of the Federation of American scientists Federation of American scientists used to be called the Federation of atomic scientists Federation of atomic scientists were all the scientists involved in the Manhattan Project who sat down one day and said we just invented this thing that could end the war at the same time we have created this thing that could be the instrument of death and we as scientists have a social responsibility to have input on how this piece of technology called you know nuclear Vision reactions get used in the world we have a social responsibility for what we create right Silicon Valley is going to find itself in that same place that the the Federation of atomic scientist found itself in in 1944 1945 and 1946 your algorithms could save millions of people&#x27;s of millions of lives kill tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people your technology could be used for great good it could be used for great evil right and you know and that you know moves so I think that&#x27;s going to have a bigger impact on engagement with technology companies not just here in Silicon Valley but all over the world and engaging with governments and and governments have a responsibility but show do the creators of Technologies to decide does this should this technology get get create it and how should it be used you can&#x27;t simply say I built it it&#x27;s not my responsibility anymore good luck just posted on the internet um taking your answer to both those questions which I I I think are both very insightful um Ian Bremer just said that one of the big dangers of 2017 is the Divide between Silicon Valley and the US government and it sounds like what you&#x27;re saying is both sides actually need to understand each other better and um with the defense department part of the issue is that you know it it is so massive and we don&#x27;t really know where the customers are and we don&#x27;t know how to convince the customers to there that they need this technology so what what training What schooling what connection would you want the broader defense department or the government to have with silen Valley and then what would you want in return is there some sort of mutual education that both sites need and going forward what what would that look like to prepare uh us over the next 10 years for silan Valley to be able to play that role as FAS has and for DOD to do what inq has essentially done yeah you know so you know I did write a letter to General Mattis I don&#x27;t know you saw that online um actually I wrote a few articles policy articles which I normally don&#x27;t do but had this sense that I needed to write some policy articles um the first thing I said is the defense department is going to have to deal with the realities of this next generation of technology in the world that we live in because if it if it doesn&#x27;t it will set itself up for its next failure uh C at a catastrophic level right um and it has to wrestle with a bunch of issues that are not about kinetics but really about software and use of of those Technologies and the application of those Technologies and and something that I made in clear in my letter was that okay even in traditional systems like traditional military Naval vessels or next Generation aircraft carriers or missiles or aircraft I said the big drivers the long P the tent is no longer you know the flight models or even the RSC cross-sections the hard Parts software because that&#x27;s something that almost every one of if you look at every program that&#x27;s been over budget they all had massive software problems right so we don&#x27;t even understand that and if if if the the decision at somewhere down the row of what we call in the kill chain so the argument today is we would never have a human out of the kill chain loop it sounds really good right that at the end of the day a human will always decide whether or not somebody lives or dies that sounds good until the other guy takes the human out of the loop and you die first right so you better wrestle with that not just as a matter of military technology military policy and engagement even with the state department as saying what are the new boundaries of responsible countries to use these Technologies right so that&#x27;s a different level of engagement and you need to engage your Silicon Valley because Silicon Valley can see what that world could look like more than you guys can because you&#x27;re you know we&#x27;re we&#x27;re heads down into okay let&#x27;s get this missile to be you know another 100 meters longer f pole than the other guy right how do I get myself an extra 0 2 G on the turn than the other guy right so we&#x27;re in there trying to you know perfect what we got and as we just saw in The Last 5 Years what takes place with happen on the Social Web I mean we display what five five regime changes powered by technology created by Silicon Valley right I mean so look at today what&#x27;s the most powerful tool the president has Twitter right regardless of what he tweets he just changed the way he engages with the world you said I can skip through all that Media stuff I don&#x27;t need to do any of that I get everybody to read me first right and and I can post and the world&#x27;s going to react and we can&#x27;t just say oh well you know that&#x27;s his that&#x27;s his use of the technology that so the defense department has to engage a Silicon Valley on what&#x27;s coming down the pipe what&#x27;s the bigger Vision what&#x27;s that world going to look like and then what should be the boundary conditions and engage in the series of policy discussions as well as decisions do we build it or not right do responsive countries build it or not what are an irresponsible country is going to do and how do we keep them in check right I mean it&#x27;s not just us versus the Chinese versus the Russians I don&#x27;t think anybody has a whole lot of interest in a world that&#x27;s completely upside down right you we can all play the marginal games around the edges of you know I got this i got this on the 109 line versus you guys or you know I&#x27;m going to fight over this piece of dirt versus this piece of dirt and those are all important fights and discussions but I think there are bigger issues at State and we kind of all the countries in the world kind of burying their hands heads in the sand pretending it&#x27;s not going to happen right even things like has nothing to do with military low I mean think think about next Generation uh Advanced manufacturing what does Advanced manufacturing do while the Chinese are replacing large percent of their of their factories uh labor work force were robotics Chinese buy 70% of the robots produced in the world right okay what&#x27;s that mean if you&#x27;re dependent on that job we talk about getting manufacturing jobs in the US right so we&#x27;re going move all the factories to the Chinese have no problem moving their factories to the US just move their robots to Arizona okay that doesn&#x27;t help I mean on some level it helps on the political level but it doesn&#x27;t really address the the problem now let&#x27;s say add that with a 10 to 15 year lifespan Improvement because because a better health care that&#x27;s provided in the world so now what&#x27;s that mean for natural resources right because most fights are over natural resources oil water you know land right that&#x27;s going to have an impact on DOD so DOD can&#x27;t just mono mono my weapons are better than your weapons my cyber guys are better than your cyber guys they better start paying attention to economic they better start paying attention to how technolog is going to impact forces of Labor and Supply chains right the whole fight over the South China Seas is about free free lanes because all that shipping goes across that those Waters well what happens when nobody needs to manufacture anymore in China because we can go down to the corner you know copy 3D printing thing get the thing printed I don&#x27;t need labor to be produced overseas so all of this is going to have an impact dld needs to take a step back and look at the bigger picture right now it&#x27;s really hard to do right because the budgets don&#x27;t allow us to do it in cycle time don&#x27;t all us to do it so unfortunately we&#x27;re out of time but thank you so much going thanks [Applause]</p>
