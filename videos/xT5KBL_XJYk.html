            <p>all right well what&#x27;s going on everyone and welcome to my channel this channel is for educational purposes and uh we generally look at theories of everything and uh all-encompassing theories that can help you uh with your life with your uh forging a new paradigm um you know helping you obtain a holistic view of the world and putting the pieces together uh today is our 373rd video on Dewey B Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory Mr Larson uh was an engineer in the 20th century and he had some uh novel ideas about the nature of our reality and our universe and uh he took those ideas and he wrapped them up into two fundamental postulates that he put out about 1959 and then from there took those postulates and through a process of deduction he was able to arrive at his theoretical universe so uh it&#x27;s really the universe that comes out of just from his theory if this then that if this then that if this then that and uh I did do about 15 videos on that uh much earlier almost a year ago and uh those are called the outline of the the deductive development of the reciprocal system uh let me just you know this has happened twice two days in a row here and um yeah the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so if you want to check those 15 videos out please do also um he took those uh that deduction that theor retical universe and he arrived at um uh the tech you know the uh substance for his books he in his books he Compares his theoretical Universe with the so-called actual universe that was discovered measured observed uh and compiled by the uh Legacy scientists so kind of the the mainstream uh scientific worldview and in many cases Larsson was able to create recreate the exact practically exact tables from the scientists that they painstakenly measured in their Laboratories Larson was able to pluck those same numbers right out of the air because he was using a theory that was accurate it and that really expressed How the Universe actually works otherwise he wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that now you could say that he&#x27;s just fudging the numbers or you know it&#x27;s just a uh scam that&#x27;s possible um it doesn&#x27;t seem that way just from me going over it um but I&#x27;m no expert so maybe Larson&#x27;s pulling the over our eyes I highly doubt it um but uh you know that&#x27;s probably the best explanation other than he actually is correct and um in many cases when he does have answers that differ from the Legacy scientists his answers turn out to be better and he&#x27;s able to show why their answers are wrong um and in many cases he does have Corrections for their uh answers uh when they&#x27;re dealing with uh Newtonian uh the Newtonian Universe in the same way as Einstein he he has he has better proposals in terms of the the Realms of the very small the very large and the very fast um the relativistic areas that Newtonian mechanics uh just didn&#x27;t really cover um but that the Einstein came along and tried to uh come up with um Band-Aids for those areas and um Larson&#x27;s uh Band-Aids work out a lot better than Einstein&#x27;s because Einstein is was really dealing with more of a pragmatic situation where he&#x27;s trying to get the right answers but he doesn&#x27;t have the right questions so he he maybe comes up with uh he borrows math from other people and comes up with the right the answers that he&#x27;s looking for but he doesn&#x27;t know why Larson is based in Concepts and in the theory and so he not only comes up with the pro usually the same equation that Einstein had come up with but he can tell you why that equation is what it is uh based on his theoretical understanding of the universe so it&#x27;s a very interesting study now uh after uh Larson wrote uh many books and many many articles he had a uh little uh Journal called reciprocity that put out um put out papers by Larson and by many of Larson&#x27;s um adherence for many years um Larson passed away in 1990 and um a few a few researchers have you know kept up the fight you know kept uh um putting things out one of the foremost was Dr Bruce peret who also passed away sadly in 2020 but uh not before he put out a great body of work and did uh some yman work in terms of uh crafting uh what he calls rs2 the uh re-evaluation of the reciprocal system updating the reciprocal system with new uh by dipping into new fields and dipping into um areas that Larson didn&#x27;t and being able to improve the theory that way and also staying within the spirit of the theory so um pet uh added in all kinds of um you know other areas that lson either didn&#x27;t know about or didn&#x27;t feel like it would be useful to use them in the theory because it might comp complicate things even more such as projective geometry lson was steadfast in trying to use ukian geometry because it was more or less more convenient and while ukian geometry is a subset of projective geometry sub uh projective geometry is more inclusive and covers more territory and therefore um pet was able to actually use the UK uh the projective geometry to obviate the need for um several of Larson&#x27;s metaphysical postulates larsson&#x27;s two fundamental postulates really only cover the physical universe but once we get beyond the physical to the metaphysical the um you know mental and life and ethical phenomena then uh Larson has to propose four new postulates to cover those areas and by including projective geometry and denying uh ukian uh denying U commutative mathematics and primary magnitudes as uh those are all parts of larsson&#x27;s second fundamental postulate um pet was able to get rid of those four uh metaphysical postulates of Larson so I think that kind of demonstrates that he was on to something now the basic idea behind larsson&#x27;s system and so pet used that and he also used things like um uh ancient folklore um and um science fiction and uh Linguistics uh and also uh DST philosophy and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re we&#x27;re going to look at today is an article that pet wrote called the da of Larson and um let&#x27;s just uh quickly go over larsson&#x27;s First Fundamental postulate which is by far the more important of the two um and like I said the second one um pet was really not on board with the second one anyway and he changed the uh the geometry and the mathematics and the magnitudes of the one but the first postulate which is um primary is that the universe is uh composed of entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so that&#x27;s it the universe is made out of motion not matter not energy not force nor anything else but motion energy matter and force are really three separate kinds of motion as are any of the other scientific quantities that we&#x27;re talking about they all can be expressed in uh fractions with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator but space or time can have multiple Dimensions as well in those fractions and um so the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time motion is basically a fraction with space or time is the numerator time or space as the denominator um motion has really uh it it is a scalar motion this is a motion that has a magnitude but has no specific Direction that&#x27;s the fundamental motion that Larson is referring to not vectorial motion that has a vector a a Direction but scalar motion which you can Envision using um a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other and really all of the locations on the balloon are moving away from each other and that motion is a scalar motion there&#x27;s no specific direction that they are moving away from each other each each location is moving away from each other location and uh you can also kind of find that in time time is always getting later and later and later and later it&#x27;s not getting later in any specific Direction so that&#x27;s what Larson refers to as clock time and clock space clock space is that everything all the locations are moving away from each other farther and farther and farther apart so in time it&#x27;s later and later and later and later in space it&#x27;s farther and farther and farther apart and then Larson also has coordinate time and coordinate space which is that uh space and time have a threedimensional aspect we can see that in space XYZ coordinates or volume you know um XYZ coordinates and um we we can observe that as far as space is concerned and since space and time are reciprocals of each other all reciprocals have the identical qualities and so we can also posit that time has three dimensions as well so Larson refers to that as coordinate space and coordinate time and then space and time come only in discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have that entity and and um if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time space over time being motion being speed the bicycle is moving 15 mil per hour 15 miles of space and one hour of time space over time then you have one or one unit of space per one one unit of time is the speed of light Larson refers to this as unit speed and he refers to this as the progression of the natural reference system or the null point the zero point the state of rest of this universe so when you perceive absolute nothingness and absolute Stillness what you&#x27;re perceiving is the progression of the natural reference system which is outward motion and all directions at the speed of light that is the zero point uh which equals 1 1 over 1 equals 1 unit speed this is also characteristic of reciprocals uh the center of all reciprocals is one anytime you have a reciprocal and you multiply it by its counterpart you get one the reciprocal of four is 1/4 4 over 1 and 1 over 4 they have the identical qualities except they are in reverse order and when you multiply them together you get one so one is the center of a reciprocal system and you know whereas in Legacy science you&#x27;ve got zero at the center motionless and you measure from that data from that zero point but in Larson system you measure from the unit datm the speed of light outward in all directions that means that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light and half is moving slower lson refers to these as the cosmic sector and the material sector this will all be relevant as we move through the da of lson I mean this article by Dr Bruce Prett called the da of lson all right let&#x27;s start it up here when people first look at Larson&#x27;s Publications concerning the reciprocal system the RS they find a conceptually different model from what they have been taught all their life and think it is something new and courageous but when you take a detailed look at what Larson proposes for his theory it is actually nothing more than an ancient philosophy that of Yin and Yang using modern scientific terms Yang is replaced by space and Yin by time one of the elementary principles of yinyang is that Yin can never be separated from Yang Larson says the same thing but with a more mathematical jargon space and time are the aspects of the ratio of motion uh pet uses the term ratio and I I&#x27;ve been using the term fraction but uh it amounts to the same thing as far as I can tell so space and time are the aspects of the ratio of motion you cannot have a ratio with without both a numerator and denominator so I think he&#x27;s saying the same thing uh fraction that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what a fraction is a universe based on the concept of motion is the da of Larson as an overview let us make a comparison of the taju yinyang symbol um which um I&#x27;ve attempted to insert into this video but it&#x27;s also the thumbnail for this video uh the yinyang symbol to the concepts that Larson uses in his Universe of motion described in the book nothing but motion okay and so we see the taju you know the familiar yinyang symbol with the two dots on it and the squirly squiggly line wav like line between the White and the black areas and um he&#x27;s got some arrows pointing at various things so the dark the the black dot within the white space he&#x27;s pointing at the unit speed boundary and this is called the time region now like I said this the squiggly line is really the speed of light and that is separating the material sector and the cosmic sector but that&#x27;s not the only boundary the other boundaries are the units other unit boundaries unit space and unit time so there&#x27;s three boundaries the unit speed boundary the unit space boundary and the unit time boundary and this comes out of the discrete unit postulate the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time uh universe is composed entirely of motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units so when you have the discrete unit postulate you have to have at least one unit of space and you have to have at least one unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space and you only have time and that&#x27;s why that black dot there is called the time region because this is inside a unit of space if you don&#x27;t have one unit of space you don&#x27;t have space so you just have time and the white dot within the black is also the same it&#x27;s unit time boundary if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time then you only have space and that is the white dot that is within the black area the black area is the cosmic sector and the white dot within it is called the space region okay and so the white area is called the white the the large white area is called the material sector and this he says 3D linear space and 3D rotational time this is um the 3D linear space is what Larson calls coordinate space and the rotational time um is what Larson would have called clock time and uh then we also have the um Cosmic sector that&#x27;s coordinate time and clock space so again the material sector and the cosmic sector are identical except for the um reversal of the roles of space and time same is true with the time region and the space region they are identical except for the reversal of roles of time and space and then again we have the unit speed boundary the speed of light is the border between these uh two larger regions okay now pet will probably explain this here the yinyang symbol has four distinct regions separated by three boundaries within its circle of completeness total of seven Parts white ordinarily represents Yang and equates to space whereas Yin is black the reciprocal of time uh the reciprocal aspect of time just looking at the symbol one can see both macroscopic and microscopic versions of those aspects interpenetrating each other Larson does exactly the same thing four regions defining where motion takes place contained by three boundaries to create his completeness of the universe of motion the design itself indicates that the interaction between the two aspects yinyang space time is dynamic and appears to be spinning suggesting the idea of rotational Cycles are at the heart of everything scalar rotations defines all structure particles and atoms in the reciprocal system now bear in mind that this part here is really rs2 uh I don&#x27;t know that Larson would have included this in his analysis here I think this is a contribution of Dr pet also the boundary between yinyang is not straight but curved like a wave suggesting that when space and time rotate waveforms are being produced in much the same way that air and water interact to produce surface waves the reciprocal system breaks the universe into two halves or sectors this boundary that wavy line between the the yin time and the Yang space aspects is called the unit speed boundary known to modern science as the speed of light 299,792,458 m/s are usually rounded up to 300 million m/s Larson however does not use conventional units like meters and seconds he uses natural units making the unit speed boundary Unity or one one natural unit of space per one natural unit of time this unit boundary forms the reference speed from which all other speeds are measured whether they be less than Unity sublight speed or and part of the material sector or greater than Unity faster than light speed and part of the cosmic sector Unity is the natural datm of the reciprocal system the end of the tape measure that you hook on to things to determine distances in the case of the reciprocal system this deviation from the speed of light is called a displacement from unit speed so that&#x27;s a term that Larson uses uh you know uh in his measurement from the speed of light displacements splitting one big empty Universe into two empty halves of space and time does not really accomplish a lot because neither half has any structure this is where the other two boundaries come into play with the smaller opposite aspect circles containing the aspects of Yin and Yang when the microcosm microcosm of one aspect intrudes into the macrocosm of the other something happens we get structure in the form of photons particles and atoms Larson expresses the differences between the macrocosm and microcosm as geometry separated from each other by a spherical unit boundary uh which is circular on the 2D drawing of yinyang the the micro the macrocosm is translational it moves in one-dimensional straight lines just as Sir Isaac Newton observed translational or linear motion is unbounded in that there is no fixed point no fixed end point it can go on and on to Infinity it is defined by the first power of the speed velocity the macrocosm is rotational it moves in a circle like a satellite orbiting the Earth rotational motion is bounded there is a fixed end point which coincides with the start point it can go round and round for an eternity the temporal analog of Infinity but always follows the same path it is defined by the second power of speed uh orbital speed or V squared now that is definitely uh an innovation of Dr peret and not um not uh Orthodox larsian ism when a Yang spatial macrocosm contains a Yin or temporal microcosm Larson calls that boundary the unit space boundary because within a natural unit of natural datum of unity you cannot have less than one unit of space but you can have more than one unit of time in the other aspect so even though you can have more time in that region you can only have a single unit of space hence unit space this is represented by the small black Yin Circle within the larger white region this defines the structure of matter the opposite is also true Yin temporal macrocosm can contain Yang spatial M microcosm separated by the unit time boundary the small white circle in the larger black field this defines the structure of antimatter or what Larsson calls Cosmic matter in conclusion the taju symbol is a complete description of a universe of motion the little round rotational microcosm contains bounded structure present at a location in the translational macrocosm of the opposite aspect together these four regions with three boundaries Define the physical Universe by the da of Larson all right that is the end of that article the da of Larson by Dr Bruce pet and uh I think that is worthy of your consideration and maybe uh gives you kind of a different Viewpoint that points out that the ancients had these same ideas um came up with an identical uh symbol to express exactly what Larson was talking about and uh that&#x27;s makes it even more interesting so thanks for tuning in today tune in tomorrow and we will get into another similar topic um and uh have a great day</p>
