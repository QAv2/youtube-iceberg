            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>uh hello everybody thank you for being here thank you for everybody watching this in the future uh today we have a really fun show i got a bunch of topics to talk about and uh yeah today is wednesday wednesday the third um if anybody gets in the chat room please let me know if i sound okay i&#x27;m like super paranoid that my audio is going to be messed up because it was a few times but i did restart my computer all right so what do we got today well i guess we got three main things to talk about first well one of the things we&#x27;re going to talk about is um i have a good friend his youtube handle is uh oh thank you melinda&#x27;s hero uh thank you i was hoping you&#x27;d be here because you were comment we were melinda and me were commenting talking through the comments and so i was hoping she&#x27;d be here because it was just a few minutes ago well thank you uh so yeah so uh first one of the segments today is my good friend his youtube handle is welcome to the show and he&#x27;s been a big supporter of me ever since like a year and a half ago since i&#x27;ve been on black lotus and he sends me all these cool science articles uh and so that inspired me to do a segment so what i&#x27;m going to do is i&#x27;m going to pull up these news articles okay and i&#x27;m going to read them with you discuss them with you but then we&#x27;re going to try to find the original research paper that uh the people in the article cite so i believe this is what the cycle happens this is what happens a group of scientists or a scientist publishes some cool research okay and then they publish it in uh and the whole world can read it it&#x27;s like a very academic paper and then these news articles like science now or bbc news they have like a science contributor and that person kind of reads that original article and kind of filters it down but when it gets filtered they may miss some of the important details they may misrepresent the data so we&#x27;re going to read some of these articles and i&#x27;m going to try to find the original paper and show you how to do the same thing so you could be your own researcher i&#x27;m going to teach you how to research like a scientist it&#x27;s not very hard it&#x27;s not very expensive so that&#x27;s going to be one segment i have like 10 different articles that welcome to the show sent me thank you welcome to the show uh if you&#x27;re watching this i know you are but probably not live i think we&#x27;ll come to the show is in london time so it&#x27;s 2 a.m right now so i hope you&#x27;re sleeping well welcome to the show uh the other segment i&#x27;m gonna do uh it&#x27;s gonna be a quick update on my uh plan to trap a bigfoot uh that&#x27;ll probably be the first thing i talk about and then the last thing is that uh a phd scientist named help put off he actually published a research paper about ultra-terrestrials what is an ultra-terrestrial well the ultra-terrestrial hypothesis is that perhaps some of these ufos we see in the sky some of these strange quote-unquote aliens well they&#x27;re not actually from another planet uh they&#x27;re not actually from another time they&#x27;re not actually from another dimension what they actually are they are actually citizens of earth they are they are their earth is their home they live on earth they&#x27;re more advanced than we are and they&#x27;ve potentially been here longer than us this is a very interesting hypothesis i&#x27;m starting to believe it could be true um why is it interesting well because sometimes you know these ufos operate in our atmosphere and so if you&#x27;re going to work efficiently in our atmosphere it helps if you are from the atmosphere you know if you could if you&#x27;re from earth you could deal with the gravity you could deal with the oxygen you can deal with the water um all of the you know chemical composition of the planet so it makes sense that some of these uh aliens could be ultra terrestrials or they could be inhabitants of earth earth is 2 billion years old 2 billion that&#x27;s a very long time and so humans have only been around for i think one of our earliest ancestor the fossils we have is lucy an early hominid and her foss was about 9 million years old okay so humans have been around for 9 million years but the planet is 2 billion years old as you can see there&#x27;s a lot of time there for other uh things to have developed so those are the three segments um i&#x27;m gonna try something new too i&#x27;m gonna start talking about my day a little bit so in the comments tell me if you like this or if you don&#x27;t because if you don&#x27;t like this hey my feelings won&#x27;t be hurt i will just not do this anymore but i see some other people that i enjoy on youtube and they talk a little bit about their day and what they do and it&#x27;s interesting okay so today i woke up early i was very uh felt like really active and so i went ahead and i sold a bunch of aluminum cans at a recycling center okay so when i was in graduate school i picked up the habit of collecting aluminum cans that were just on the floor so i lived in a college town obviously when i was in graduate school and people would just drink alcohol and just throw it out in the street that&#x27;s it so i would collect all these cans aluminum cans and i would sell them so right now the going rate that i found was 50 cents a pound for aluminum cans and i got 15 bucks so i had about 30 pounds of aluminum cans uh so with that 15 dollars i went to a little town called alvin texas close to where i live alvin texas is it&#x27;s kind of interesting for ufology because uh there&#x27;s a famous well maybe not so famous but there is a ufo sighting and video of a flying saucer in alvin texas the person who shot it was um oh my god i just blanked on his name oh mauricio ruiz mauricio ruiz um if you look him up then um you could uh hear about him and i think he could maybe find his original video let me type his name in my reseo it&#x27;s in the chat right now okay there it is so it&#x27;s spelled m m-a-u-r-i-c-i-o-r-u-i-z and then ufo or flying saucer so alvin texas is not known for much but there is a famous ufo video the video is very interesting it was shot on a camcorder the ufo is clear as day i mean it&#x27;s clear it&#x27;s not blurry uh i want to interview him he lives he still lives in the houston area so i i could interview him so i&#x27;m going to reach out to him he has a youtube channel he&#x27;s hispanic i&#x27;m hispanic i could talk to him in spanish i mean he speaks perfect english but that&#x27;s something we have in common so i went to auburn texas and i went looking for some video games and i did find some video games i&#x27;ll show you um i found a copy of uh transformers rise of the all spark now i got this for a dollar because uh it doesn&#x27;t really work that well so i&#x27;m gonna try to fix it i had some scratches on it but i&#x27;m gonna try to fix it we have a comment here real fast from a super fan or super supporter of the show melinda thank you for being here melinda she says in grad school we myself and others uh biology of the biology graduate student association started aluminum king collection bins around campus since there was no recycling very interesting uh that&#x27;s great yeah i love recycling when i pick up these cans i like to feel like i&#x27;m a ray from star wars the force awakens if you remember the star wars force awakens uh with the main character ray she was uh she collected scrap and that&#x27;s how she got money or food and so i feel like i&#x27;m ray from star wars and uh what is the other thing i was going to say oh the other thing why i like collecting illuminate kansas because there&#x27;s a famous video game series called animal crossing for nintendo and in animal crossing there&#x27;s this mechanic where you could just walk outside and you could just pick up fruits from a tree and just sell it at the store for money and i always thought that was awesome i was like i wish i could just go outside pick something off the ground and make money well that&#x27;s what aluminum cans are for me basically the other thing i do here&#x27;s a little tip uh if you&#x27;re ever walking around and on the street you see a a box of marble cigarettes marlboro cigarettes uh pick it up you know throw it away but on the lid of it there&#x27;s a little code okay so if you collect these codes on their website you get a bunch of free stuff like i&#x27;ve gotten like sunglasses lighters keychains gift cards and if you&#x27;re a member they&#x27;ll just send you free stuff i remember they would just send me stuff i didn&#x27;t have to do anything so there&#x27;s a little tip if you don&#x27;t mind picking up discarded marble cigarette boxes you pick them up sign up and get some free stuff the other thing is that yeah talking about biology graduate student associations i was actually the president of the biology graduate student association for one year one semester it was good uh we had fun we did a clean up of a natural area the big thicket preserve which i&#x27;ve talked about we went there and cleaned up we did a scholarship for the students so they could go present i learned a lot of really good leadership skills it was fun and i got a scholarship as well i&#x27;m watching all the star wars movies with my 10 year old son the first time watching them that&#x27;s awesome uh melinda that&#x27;s great what a great memory uh which movie are you on right now and what order are you watching them in i&#x27;m curious okay so yeah okay so speaking of space the other game i picked up i&#x27;m really excited about is uh mass effect legendary edition so mass effect is a a role-playing uh space adventure game um it came out like in the 2000s but what&#x27;s great about this is that this collects all three video games and they update the graphics so they they perform better they play better the other cool thing about the games is that you make key decisions in each video game and dose decisions transfer over to the second and third game so you could really build your character i waited to play them i&#x27;ve never played them so that&#x27;s good i get to play them in their best form uh so that&#x27;s a great game uh and here we go melinda says uh that&#x27;s awesome you were president of the biology association yeah i was nominated and i ran and then my good buddy i was his campaign manager after i was president and i helped him get elected and then he was president i taught him everything i know it was so much fun it was really it was a fun time okay so melinda says they&#x27;re watching the star wars movie in chronological order of the timeline we&#x27;re on the 1977 movie which i saw of which i saw as a five-year-old in the theaters very cool very cool very cool uh okay then i got uh what else did i get here okay so then i i picked up a copy of the godfather for xbox 360. uh this is based on the movie and i just heard it&#x27;s got really good reviews and then this game i actually picked it up yesterday i&#x27;m cheating a little bit but um but it&#x27;s a good game so this is a playstation 4 copy of um this is called forgot what it&#x27;s called okay planescape planescape torment enhanced edition and then just got like a sequel um ice wind so these are role-playing games like fantasy games like dungeons and dragons they um originally came out for the pc uh they&#x27;re supposed to be some of the best games ever made and they&#x27;re supposed to have really good writing like really good writing the other thing is i&#x27;m showing you these games because i might start playing video games like doing a live stream on the show i have all the equipment to set it up so you can watch me play but i i am going to try to do science-based games uh and talk about them oh and then the last game i got i got this as a brand new copy uh and so it&#x27;s brand new and it&#x27;s called uh spongebob squarepants uh bottle for battle for bikini bottom and it&#x27;s the rehydrated edition so once again this game came out originally like in the 2000s they went ahead and got the same gameplay but they redid all the graphics and they just made it a better play experience so those are the games that i did today so i sold aluminum cans i got some video games and i worked on the show so that&#x27;s my day let me know if any of that was interesting or if you prefer i don&#x27;t talk about my day my feelings won&#x27;t be hurt i think you have to actually try really hard to hurt my feelings um because if you just try to hurt my feelings it still won&#x27;t work i&#x27;ll usually just take it to stride so i want to say this don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t like it don&#x27;t worry okay so melinda says um melinda says i think it&#x27;s a great addition to your show telling us about your day it personalizes your show we&#x27;re getting to know you as well as whatever you&#x27;re talking about video games etc great okay well thank you so we got one vote up yes thank you we&#x27;re very democratic here um what else was going to say uh yeah like i said if i talk about my day like i just did now i&#x27;m gonna try to talk about science trying to talk about interest in ufo things like i talked about austin the ufo thing i talked about star wars recycling if you didn&#x27;t know that i mean you could recycle cans you could just find cans in the street if you don&#x27;t mind if you don&#x27;t mind getting your hands dirty literally and you can sell them and you can help the environment and make a little bit of money and uh yeah get those marble cigarette cigarette boxes why not that&#x27;s what i do i think right now i have like 3 500 points you get about like 100 points per box so what&#x27;s really funny is they must think that i&#x27;m smoking a lot but i actually don&#x27;t smoke at all i&#x27;m not a smoker but i have a lot of points all right let&#x27;s go into the bigfoot news okay first of all i got some new subscribers and i think these subscribers came from my bigfoot video okay so hello everybody here thank you for subscribing uh if you came here because of my bigfoot video so what i did is i advertised my bigfoot episode in a bunch of groups on facebook a lot of bigfoot groups a lot of um ufo paranormal groups and i gotta say i have i got a tremendous response i got so many comments i&#x27;m just i&#x27;m responding to comments like non-stop on facebook a lot of people are chiming in with their opinion they&#x27;re mostly all friendly uh you know one of the things i asked is is bigfoot better off remaining hidden or would it benefit from science and the majority of people they seem to say no just leave leave bigfoot b don&#x27;t it&#x27;s going to cause more harm and um my con and i i respect that and i i agree with it too to an extent but i was talking to my friend who&#x27;s a doctor a medical doctor and he told me that he thinks that you know nothing can hide from the scientific method eventually the truth will come out of course it&#x27;s a matter of time you know how long will it take it could be a hundred years it&#x27;s been about 70 years since the air force was founded you know but 70 years in this in the scope of humanity is a very short time i mean there&#x27;s still people alive that are 70 years old so what i&#x27;m saying is i think eventually science will show that bigfoot is real so i think it&#x27;s good to just think about it now you know preemptively think about how can we handle uh the disclosure or the the discovery that something like bigfoot is real how will it affect society um you know will people well a lot of us were thinking that people will probably start wanting to hunt him you know so there&#x27;ll be an increased pressure an ecological stress will be put on bigfoot because more people will know about bigfoot if it&#x27;s known that bigfoot&#x27;s real then more people are going to be like wow bigfoot&#x27;s real they&#x27;re going to want to get their guns and they&#x27;re going to want to go hunt them and that&#x27;s definitely going to put some pressure on bigfoot so that&#x27;s a consideration okay so then the other thing that happened was if you remember my plan dealt with um getting a body from bigfoot or let&#x27;s say giving getting evidence of bigfoot uh through bigfoot giving it to us and the why would biff would give us something like a body well it&#x27;s because we would be trading what would we be trading with bigfoot well we would be trading food like peanut butter and apples and cakes and stuffed pies because it has been shown that bigfoot will accept gifts it&#x27;s been shown people have reported that if you leave something in an area where bigfoot habituates or uh travels or lives that you leave it there you go away bigfoot will take it and then eventually he might leave something or he might interact with the things there okay so that&#x27;s a little a recap what&#x27;s really interesting is that i i somebody started messaging me oh here we go real fast this is my cat nebula saying hello i love nebula nebula loves me she&#x27;s got blue eyes and she&#x27;s very sweet okay she always waits for me she worries about me she waits for me on my walks my two best friends are this cat and a great blue heron there&#x27;s a bird a water bird cart a great blue hair and when i go for walks this giant waterfowl follows me around and you know these are my best friends i don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d ever i don&#x27;t think that they&#x27;d ever hurt me emotionally or financially or physically i think they really care for me but um anyway i mean that has to do with what we&#x27;re talking about being friends with bigfoot okay anyway one of the people in these groups commented to me so let me just read you the comment thread okay so i saved it here um this is really fascinating okay where do i start where do i start okay so i just advertised my show on this facebook group and i was just like hey guys um i&#x27;m a son i&#x27;m a wildlife biologist uh please check out this video i want to it&#x27;s a plan for how to get a bigfoot body uh i i don&#x27;t plan on killing a bigfoot because i think it&#x27;s unethical i would love to hear your feedback do you think this is a good thing do you think it&#x27;s a bad thing okay so this individual in one of the groups they responded in all capital letters they just responded dumb d-u-m-b dumb i was like once again it&#x27;s really hard to hurt my feelings so what i replied was hahaha thanks for your feedback have a wonderful week see i&#x27;m very nice to people uh and then i told them i would be honored to have you as a subscriber okay and then they said um okay then they replied okay this is the other person they said okay i gift them all the time for the last eight years they have eight years of experience gifting bigfoots every day this year i&#x27;ve gone through 140 jars of peanut butter i don&#x27;t think what you want will work as they are not a flesh and blood animal hiding in the woods interesting my mind was like like pop rocks okay so then i replied my plan involves gifting them do you have any tips on successfully starting gifting have you received anything in return okay and then they said they replied yes a lot of things sticks dear skulls the skull of a deer they said i started with apples then i went to peanut butter i put little wooden blocks out which they move all the time also dice i used to try and put an eraser board out and draw a stick man and my name don&#x27;t do that as when i did all my activity stopped or don&#x27;t put out stuffed animals don&#x27;t put out trail cameras and don&#x27;t talk to them that&#x27;s a lot of information they go more into detail but it&#x27;s very fascinating okay so this is what they said they started off giving an apple so they said hey give him apples no problem uh they said put out wooden blocks of toys like wooden blocks or dice for them to play with that&#x27;s fine uh this person was very creative they tried to put out a uh a board a dry erase board and draw them so they tried to do communication like i said they said that didn&#x27;t work they did not like this at all they stopped so he&#x27;s like don&#x27;t do that also don&#x27;t put up stuffed animals and i&#x27;ll explain more why you shouldn&#x27;t put up stuffed animals don&#x27;t put on a trail camera and most uh you know most uh disappointingly don&#x27;t try to talk to them don&#x27;t try to communicate with them very interesting this person has eight years of experience okay so then i replied so they don&#x27;t like stuffed animals and they don&#x27;t like being communicated with question mark they said this is where it&#x27;s very interesting this is some crazy animal behavior stuff they said they don&#x27;t like anything with eyes with eyes that&#x27;s why the doll was there okay so the dolls have eyes they don&#x27;t like anything with eyes that&#x27;s fascinating they don&#x27;t like it makes sense but it&#x27;s fascinating they don&#x27;t like anything with eyes they don&#x27;t they don&#x27;t like being looked at you know i&#x27;ve heard that this you know this could be just anecdotal there could be no science but i&#x27;ve heard that in places like india where wild tigers are a problem you know tigers will often attack you from the back because they want to remain hidden they don&#x27;t like for you to see them so some people will put like a mask on the back of their head with fake eyes and then that way uh you know the tiger won&#x27;t attack them i mean there are some caterpillars that have fake eyes like markings that look like eyes on their butts basically on the rear portion of their body so they won&#x27;t be eaten there&#x27;s some moths uh you know that have feathers i mean not feathers some moths that have wings that look like eyes and i&#x27;ve also read that if a shark you know if you&#x27;re in the water you&#x27;re swimming a shark won&#x27;t attack you if you&#x27;re looking at it head on so this makes sense that i think it&#x27;s so interesting okay so they don&#x27;t like anything with eyes this person says i&#x27;ve been doing this for about eight years they&#x27;ve been in my yard they hit my house uh left fingerprints moved things around in my yard and have said my name that&#x27;s so interesting i&#x27;ve seen them nine times close with my wife grandkids daughter neighbors have seen them there&#x27;s a lot of data here this is very data rich okay so this individual has not eight years of experience in those eight years they&#x27;ve only seen it nine times physically so that means on average you if you start a relationship with one you&#x27;ll only see them a little bit over one time one time 1.1 times a year that&#x27;s very fascinating they&#x27;ve hit the house i assume they threw something at the house i&#x27;ve heard about that do you lift fingerprints fingerprints are good fingerprints are very good they&#x27;ve moved things around the yard and they&#x27;ve said this person&#x27;s name they&#x27;ve said this person&#x27;s name they vocalized i&#x27;ve heard about this so fascinating okay so then i reply this is also fascinating to me thanks for sharing i sent you a friend request i hope that&#x27;s okay uh then said um then they said i just invited you to my page called randy&#x27;s bigfoot research if you would like and then they said that um i asked them they wanted me to talk on the phone right then and there but i was not ready i asked them to be on the podcast so i&#x27;m going to continue talking with them to see if i can get them in the podcast um i&#x27;m going to put the link after this episode i put the link to their facebook group they have a lot of pictures there i&#x27;m gonna share some pictures right now uh but if you uh if you can&#x27;t wait for that facebook group you can just look for randy&#x27;s r-a-n-d-y-s randy&#x27;s bigfoot research that&#x27;s your the group super fascinating so much information in there oh and then i think they gave somebody they told me where they live um she says they live they live north of black duck m n is it m n i&#x27;m sorry i do not know my state abbreviations is mn montana or minnesota i don&#x27;t know you guys tell me but do you live uh this person lives north of black duck and and okay we got some comments to catch up on and then i&#x27;ll show you some pictures that um this randy person showed me okay okay so let&#x27;s see okay so here&#x27;s melinda okay do we melinda says do we know enough about bigfoot&#x27;s social structure to accurately predict if a dead one would be traded uh solitarily and don&#x27;t know where dead ones are located or complex social structure and won&#x27;t give one up uh solitary so they might be solitary and they might okay so the concerns with melissa has are that yeah we really don&#x27;t know i&#x27;ve heard they have a family structure i am assuming they buried their dead because why don&#x27;t we find the bodies but i don&#x27;t know also i remember i saw a presentation in graduate school were some early hominids who might have been humans they were just stuffing dead bodies like corpses into a a big cave it was like a big pit so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s anecdotal evidence that&#x27;s not directly related to bigfoot but some early habits did have burial pits and caves um we don&#x27;t know if they live alone we don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re willing to trade you&#x27;re right we don&#x27;t know their social structure and we don&#x27;t know if they know what the dead bodies is these are all great points so these are assumptions that i&#x27;m making but if you look at those comments there&#x27;s other things that were left behind like um like uh like like fingerprints i&#x27;m thinking i&#x27;ll start off with some dna and i may not directly ask for dna so here&#x27;s a little trick i used to do when i was uh animal trapping so i was an animal trapper for a year so sometimes someone would have an animal crawling in their house and i would want to trap them i can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s already been half an hour i have so much to talk about okay so i would want to know okay well you know there&#x27;s different animals that go in people&#x27;s houses there&#x27;s squirrels there&#x27;s possums there&#x27;s raccoons etc etc so i would want to know what kind of animal it was so what i would do is i would locate the hole where the animal would climb into the house and then what i would do is just get a bunch of tape and put the tape around the hole where the animal would go in and then what would happen it would be like duct tape what would happen is the hair would stick to the duct tape and i could just visually look at the hair and i know what kind of animal i was like oh that&#x27;s a possum that&#x27;s a raccoon whatever and that would help me with my trapping method so you know let&#x27;s just say a body is maybe too intense what if i leave something sticky out for them to play with like a sticky block or something and they leave some of their hair behind they don&#x27;t mind leaving their fingerprints we know they don&#x27;t mind leaving their footprints but those are great points melinda your great points thank you for uh for keeping me in my lane you&#x27;re right i&#x27;ll put it right again these are all assumptions i&#x27;m making as a scientist let&#x27;s call them hypotheses a hypothesis is a statement that a scientist makes it&#x27;s a statement that can be tested but has not yet been tested so a hypothesis would be like um like uh okay so hypothesis is i believe bigfoot buries their uh dead that&#x27;s a statement that could be tested uh that&#x27;s pretty complex so let&#x27;s change it a little bit because bigfoot is like a mythical creature so let&#x27;s say um i hypothesized that bears prefer maple syrup to honey that&#x27;s a hypothesis it&#x27;s just a statement that i&#x27;m making i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true i haven&#x27;t tested it but i can test it i can design an experiment where i could put out some honey and some maple syrup and i could see if a bear would like one or the other so i&#x27;m making a hypothesis that bigfoot would trade a body and i&#x27;m also making a hypothesis that bigfoot berries are dead and i&#x27;m making a hypothesis that bigfoot knows where the dead are those are a lot of hypothesis so melinda thank you you&#x27;re right i don&#x27;t know any of this for a fact none of this is tested and perhaps you know i need to scale it down sometimes you know we start off with a huge experiment and then we&#x27;re like let&#x27;s start small so perhaps i could get some hair or some fingerprints uh okay so then melinda continues uh melinda has heard about the tigers and the masks with the eyes in the back she&#x27;s referring to this idea that a lot of animals like sharks and tigers they don&#x27;t like it when you look at them they don&#x27;t like the eyes it scares them and this person has said that bigfoot does not like any eyes so if you draw a stick figure with eyes they don&#x27;t like it if you give them a doll they don&#x27;t like it because it has eyes in it very fascinating audio walks io walks thank you for being here i walks i watch has been at every episode of science of the strange please subscribe to iowa&#x27;s channel he&#x27;s a musician and a poet uh and we he says i&#x27;m vanilla pale like the bricks in my cell of nonfiction very cool very cool statement i like it i like it vanilla pale like the bricks in my cell of nonfiction i love it that&#x27;s like a haiku i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s haiku because i&#x27;m not i haven&#x27;t counted all the syllables or whatever but it&#x27;s like a one sentence poem thank you for being here iowa&#x27;s and thank you for contributing okay then we have melinda says um with a lot of eye animals contact is confrontational maybe why bigfoot doesn&#x27;t like the eye thing on the other hand we humans like things with big eyes like babies kittens and puppies great comment also going back to science of the strange in my episode where i reviewed the movie nope nope is a movie about ufos here&#x27;s a spoiler about the movie in the movie nope which is in theaters now you should watch it is a great horror movie but it&#x27;s very scary there&#x27;s a lot of blood but it&#x27;s about a ufo the ufo here&#x27;s a spoiler it turns out to be a living animal just one large organism and it&#x27;s a predator and one of the characters finds out that it doesn&#x27;t like it when you look at it and so he learns not to look at it directly and he yeah it benefits him okay and then we have some more okay so uh melinda clarifies that nn uh refers to the state of minnesota so this person is in minnesota i mean it doesn&#x27;t surprise me i think bigfoot is in every state in the united states so okay iowa say they are awake in every layer of reality ultra-terrestrials yeah we&#x27;re going to talk about terrestrials uh but yeah you know you&#x27;re right if i if bigfoot is just a flesh and blood animal they would be ultra terrestrials that is a definition of ultraterrestrial uh uh an organism that is from earth but has remained hidden or is very advanced i believe that&#x27;s the definition of all terrestrial i&#x27;m not a hundred percent sure but that&#x27;s a i believe that&#x27;s a common explanation and i watch this they are awake in every layer of reality very true i suspect these bigfoot have extras like really good hearing really good sights really good smell really good taste they could probably produce infrasound a a frequency of sound that scares humans or animals they&#x27;re very muscular uh they can probably feel things better than us their sense of touch is better just like a lot of animals okay uh i want to make okay iowa says i want to make a ufo like stranger things a sensory deprivation tank with certain tech inside very cool i&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some directions for making a sensory deprivation tank i want to try too there&#x27;s a place here in houston if you live in a larger city where you could pay a little money and you could go in the century the probation tank for a little bit if you guys don&#x27;t know a sensory deprivation tank is what it sounds like it&#x27;s basically a tank that you lie in and it&#x27;s got water which is a salt water it&#x27;s very very salty so you float if water has a lot of salt in it you actually won&#x27;t sink you&#x27;ll float because of the chemical properties the water is also at a temperature that is the same as your body temperature and also there&#x27;s no sound in there and no light so you&#x27;re definitely you&#x27;re deprived of senses you know you don&#x27;t smell anything you don&#x27;t see anything you don&#x27;t feel anything you don&#x27;t hear anything and it&#x27;s supposed to uh induce hallucinations if i understand it correctly but iowa wants to build his own tank which hey go for it uh i know that that salt i know it might be a little expensive all that salt is very expensive the amount of salt you have to buy to put in the water is expensive and you&#x27;re going to need like a filter system but good idea melinda says complex social structure would indicate more time investment in others in the group and therefore would have greater value hence less likely to give up dead one if this makes it more clear okay there are a lot of reports that bigfoot parents are with their children so the dust even if you have family structure there does seem to be like but i&#x27;m wondering what about the reward like what if i give them a lot of food a lot of non-perishable food maybe like a bunch of beef jerky a bunch of twinkies you know i&#x27;m wondering you know the the amounts that i&#x27;m giving them like an astronomical amount like i want to blow their minds with how much food i give them but once again these are all good considerations that melinda is giving like i said i&#x27;m thinking i need to scale it back just try to make contact try to play games with them try to get some fur by using some sticky tape and start small okay great melinda has subscribed to iowa walks fantastic i&#x27;m so glad we&#x27;re we&#x27;re making a little community here uh thank you so much uh you&#x27;re gonna enjoy the music it&#x27;s very good uh would you give up a loved one for a bunch of beef jerky okay melinda i would not but if you remember there have been instances there are extreme instances where humans have eaten loved ones okay so let&#x27;s just talk about the dahmer party a dahmer party is a tragic story about early frontier people that that were trying to go to california to the west coast uh through with a wagon they were given misinformation and they got stuck in the wilderness and they were starving to death and they they resorted to cannibalism now i don&#x27;t think bigfoot&#x27;s a cannibal but i&#x27;m saying i wouldn&#x27;t give up a loved one for beef jerky because i&#x27;m well fed and because i&#x27;m happy and i don&#x27;t need food but um you know but i don&#x27;t know i don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;m trying to say let me know if that&#x27;s a bad argument i&#x27;m just saying bigfoot is different who knows what if bigfoot is suffering from food you know a food shortage you know i i agree with you if bigfoot is not if if he&#x27;s well fed everything&#x27;s going great you know uh you know their children have food it has food it has a stable future yeah i don&#x27;t think it would give up a dead body but what if it is hungry i mean the ecosystem of forests are burning down you know there&#x27;s invasive insects i mean unfortunately we&#x27;re seeing a biodiversity dip so perhaps bigfoot is suffering financially food wise i will also say that sometimes humans donate their body to science um but let me know if these are good arguments or not but hey once again thank you for this i i am used to getting feedback when i was in graduate school melania told me if you&#x27;re the same way but to me when i was in graduate school it was like it was like i was uh it was like i was in boot camp i mean i i there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it i understand why it happened but all the professors would give me a hard time just like a drill instructor would give you a hard time you know they would question everything i said they would push me to my limits i don&#x27;t think they were being jerks i think they were doing it to make me a better scientist because i was in training i was in graduate school that is to say i don&#x27;t mind feedback it doesn&#x27;t affect me negatively i appreciate it so nobody be uh be worried about that we have someone you who i hadn&#x27;t seen aaron morrison hey aaron morrison thank you so much for being here i really appreciate you being here uh everybody say hello to aaron feel free to ask any questions erin we have a really fun group of people here okay so melinda says cannibalism is an act of desperation and if bigfoot is ultra-terrestrial so less likely to be desperate for food you&#x27;re right they would have to be desperate for food and i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s less likely i would have to look in to see okay for instance here&#x27;s a good way of testing this hypothesis the desperate for food hypothesis i could look in the big thicket or whatever area of the forest let&#x27;s just call it the big thicket because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s closest to me that&#x27;s where it has bigfoot reports i could look at the resources being done in the big thickets to see if the large animals like coyotes if how are they doing are they doing badly are they suffering are they skinny are they not having as many pups if those large predators are suffering it&#x27;s possible that the bigfoot in the same area are also suffering and thus more likely to be desperate but that&#x27;s a good point and melinda says graduate school was hardcore yeah very hardcore but it was so much fun uh some of the best times of my life okay so now i&#x27;m going to show some uh photographs well we had another comment well this says um okay so melinda is talking about bigfoot uh if you&#x27;re just watching like aaron aaron we&#x27;re discussing bigfoot and whether i could communicate with bigfoot through leaving gifts which has been done i&#x27;m going to show you pictures of some gifting that&#x27;s been done so what we&#x27;re talking about now is is it possible that i could leave bigfoot a gift like peanut butter or a lot of food and bigfoot would trade a dead body of a loved one a body that died of natural causes so melinda has some feedback melinda says uh which is melinda is a phd biologist she says in great leap forward the famine in china in 1950s neighbors would exchange their offspring with neighbors and eat each other&#x27;s children because they were so hungry but yeah you&#x27;re right that&#x27;s extreme hunger extreme hunger um i had a friend uh who i had a lot of friends actually who were in the army during the afghanistan war and i got to say man that war treated the young people horribly they were they were treated horribly some of my best friends were in that in that war in afghanistan and anyway one of my friends was in the war and she talked about the extreme hunger she felt in afghanistan and how she never felt hunger like that and it was it&#x27;s heartbreaking but anyway hunger is crazy okay i&#x27;m trying to share my screen to show you some photographs this person sent me okay so let&#x27;s see share um i&#x27;m sharing my screen share screen okay sure okay let&#x27;s start uh share with audio okay here we go sorry okay okay now let me add this sorry i guess i&#x27;m kind of learning okay i&#x27;m sharing my screen this is what it looks like but let me show you these photographs real fast okay uh so if this is if this is going well you should be seeing some photographs okay so what we&#x27;re seeing is this person in minnesota so what they did is they left out this rubik&#x27;s cube and these two tongue depressor sticks wooden sticks and some dice and so you see they&#x27;ve been organized uh kind of in a in an interesting way so i think this person just kind of scattered them around but now they&#x27;re kind of organized so they&#x27;re saying bigfoot did this okay and there&#x27;s another photograph but how can i show the other one okay here&#x27;s another one okay now this this person said they left over like uh they left they said this year alone they&#x27;ve left over 150 um bottles of peanut butter for bigfoot they also said that they could tell when it&#x27;s bigfoot versus a bear because bigfoot i forgot to read this but bigfoots i mean a bear will just eat the whole peanut butter jar it&#x27;s like a plastic peanut butter they&#x27;ll just tear it up and that&#x27;s a bear but bigfoot will carefully remove the lid and they&#x27;ll lick everything completely clean like it&#x27;s from a dishwasher and furthermore what the bigfoot will do is they will organize the lids like this so these are organized by color uh you know loosely but you can see these are just peanut butter jar lids and uh yeah you see all the red ones are over here all the blue ones yellow black and brown and i&#x27;m not sure if that cross was left by bigfoot but this individual has a bunch of different pictures but these are some interesting ones they sent me personally to illustrate their points very interesting okay so let&#x27;s go back stop sharing excuse me pardon me okay those are some photographs and that that concludes our bigfoot update but let&#x27;s see if we have any comments here uh mr catfish hello mr catfish uh thank you for being here hope you&#x27;re doing well uh i hope you&#x27;re off work okay uh melinda if you subscribe be aware i make random raps that i make fast and usually delete them okay so i walks is here he&#x27;s a musician and he likes to make music and then melinda says uh thanking him okay so yeah there you go that that concludes our bigfoot update okay so now let&#x27;s um let&#x27;s read this ultra terrestrial paper how about we do that i think i have everything well actually the ultra restaurant paper will take a long time so let&#x27;s just read one of the articles let&#x27;s let&#x27;s read two articles because that&#x27;ll be a little faster and then we&#x27;ll save the ultra terrestrial paper for the end i might go for like an hour and a half um [Music] yeah put in a comment you know how how much longer it&#x27;s been 44 minutes comment how much longer you think this episode should be you know i understand if you have to leave early but you know if you were to come back how much longer would you want this episode to be i&#x27;m going to talk about this ultra-terrestrial research paper and some other research papers but i&#x27;d love to get that feedback okay i&#x27;m going to share my screen again and let&#x27;s look at some science articles and let&#x27;s learn how to research like a scientist okay so i&#x27;m going to share again that&#x27;s we&#x27;re going to do that again so uh hang hang hang with me okay just go to share screen entire screen okay share system audio share okay oh we have a comment here let me go ahead and hold on a second how can i do this okay before we do that we have a comment oops i&#x27;m so sorry guys i&#x27;m i&#x27;m having some problems okay metal gaming thank you for being here okay you like metal music and you like gaming i need to get into metal music but i love gaming thank you for being here okay so anyway metal gaming thank you for being here says i think danish esky esky willerslev famous dna researcher did investigations on several claimed bigfoot samples hair blood and tissue from all over the world hunters and random human results equals zero bigfoot dna okay interesting so let me read that again hair blood and tissue from all over the world hunters and random human results okay so i think what you&#x27;re saying is that after all this research it was all no bigfoot dna thank you for sharing this i&#x27;m going to look this research up so here&#x27;s what i have to say about this okay once again i don&#x27;t look okay now once again let me just state this right now i mainly study insects and invertebrates like water like worldly gig beetles and moss piglets also known as tardigrade i only study animals that have a fanciful name so i study microscope my microscopes i use microscopes i study you know organisms that are don&#x27;t have any bones why am i saying this i&#x27;m saying i don&#x27;t know a lot about dna that&#x27;s not my specialty you know in a lot of ways you know i feel like you know biologists and scientists are very specialized you know uh just like you like you know here&#x27;s an example like you know a dentist is a doctor but you wouldn&#x27;t expect a dentist to know about um oncology or about cancer so if you were to see your dentist friend and you start to ask them all this all these cancer questions you&#x27;re like you&#x27;re a doctor they may not be able to help you even though they&#x27;re a doctor of humans so what i&#x27;m trying to say that i&#x27;m going to talk about dna right now but i&#x27;m not an expert on dna i&#x27;m an expert about invertebrate zoology and invertebrate behavior and field biology and using microscopes so so take this with a grain of salt and please correct me if i&#x27;m wrong i don&#x27;t add mine admitting when i&#x27;m wrong i don&#x27;t mind admitting that i don&#x27;t know a lot about a subject but here&#x27;s what i think about dna it seems it seems that it would be melinda you could help me out with this it seems like with dna when you&#x27;re doing an analysis of dna it seems like the easiest thing to do is to identify the dna of an animal that already exists so let&#x27;s say you um get some dna of a fish and then you analyze that dna and let&#x27;s say that fish turns out to be a catfish and let&#x27;s say we already have a database of catfish dna that&#x27;s very easy you&#x27;re like oh okay this dna is catfish dna because you already have something to compare it to but what i&#x27;m thinking i don&#x27;t know if this is true that it would be much harder to identify something as a new species if it&#x27;s brand new dna so what i&#x27;m saying is like what if you have bigfoot dna and what if there is no bigfoot dna samples to compare it to the closest thing you would find is potentially humans or primates so i&#x27;m not saying this is true but i&#x27;m saying perhaps it is hard to identify a bigfoot by its dna alone because we don&#x27;t have any bigfoot dna to start with you know what i mean and because that dna may be very similar to an ape or a human because we&#x27;re both primates we&#x27;re all primates the other thing is that look dna technology is very finicky i know this because i work with geneticists it&#x27;s very finicky it&#x27;s very delicate to get dna i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true melinda please let me know anybody let me know if i&#x27;m totally wrong but thank you metal gaming i sure appreciate your feedback i appreciate that comment and i will look into that okay then we have okay hold on okay iowa&#x27;s next says uh what ultra-transitionals be an entity that would like us but pushed out of reality and is now sentient in the dream realm all right this this is a good question but it&#x27;s also like a poem so i gotta get in my poem mindset you know i walks is i think a very creative person and you know he comes up with really good questions and a a really great way of talking and so i appreciate it so much but let me get in the mindset okay would an answer surrender be an entity that was like us okay so let&#x27;s analyze that yes it&#x27;s potent it&#x27;s like i don&#x27;t know for sure but yeah ultra terrestrials could be like us and that they&#x27;re intelligent maybe they look like us maybe they look like a squid that&#x27;s why i chose the squid as the um the avatar or the thumbnail so yeah maybe they have some similarities with us in the way they think the way they make tools or the way they look okay so that part yes but they they were pushed out of reality okay pushed out of reality hmm pushed pushed seems to indicate that that they were forced to go into reality interesting well there&#x27;s some hypothesis that say that ultra terrestrials were maybe more numerous there&#x27;s more of them in the past and now there&#x27;s less of them and so now they live in the in the uh there&#x27;s there&#x27;s smaller numbers of these advanced species and so they live in the ocean that is true and and now it&#x27;s sentient of the dream realm okay okay now i think i got the full picture of what you&#x27;re saying okay so to answer you i walks yes i think an ultraterrestrial which is an organism that has lived on the earth longer than us and is as intelligent or more intelligent than us i think it&#x27;s possible it could live or they could live in the ocean because the ocean is about 80 unexplored and because humans are separated from the ocean because of the ecological niche ecologically we are built to live on land not under water we can&#x27;t survive the pressure we can&#x27;t survive under without the atmosphere and oxygen so i think they live underwater i do think it&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;re being they were pushed into the ocean because of some disaster or because humans took over the land and it is possible they are sentient of the dream realm in that they are more aware of the dream realm these are all really great ideas and they could be possible but a lot of these are just suggestions you know we would have to make hypothesis and test them to find out for sure but this is definitely great brainstorming and thank you for that question eyewax it&#x27;s very deep says i&#x27;m good another 75 minutes at least okay all right okay here we go uh metal says all dna samples showed only uh cow horse bear hair not a bigfoot okay all right well very interesting very interesting all dna samples showed only cow horse and bear hair not any bigfoot okay well that is fascinating that is fascinating now something we could do is we could replicate that study you know because science requires replication the two things you need in science are replicability and you also need um uh falsifiability so this is one study or several studies but they were only done by one scientist so it would be good to try to replicate the study and see if we get the same results the other thing i would do if i could get some there&#x27;s another person that said when i was advertising that bigfoot show someone in the comments said they had bigfoot hair and i asked him for a strand the other thing we could do not only dna analysis but we could observe the hair under a scanning electron microscope so this is a microscope that is a magnitudes stronger than a compound microscope or a dissecting microscope a lot of the electron microscopes what they actually do is they shoot electrons subatomic particles at your sample and then those tiny particles come back and they form an image and that&#x27;s why you could get so detailed like for instance you could um i took a class in scanning electron microscopy so you could get like pollen you could get one pollen grain okay so pollen is usually invisible you know this is what um this is how plants reproduce it&#x27;s in the air so you can get one little piece of pollen put it in the electron scanning microscope you&#x27;re usually looking at a computer screen and you could zoom in so much so much that you you expand that little invisible grain to the naked eye invisible grain of pollen you expand it so much that it looks like a giant ship like a boat you can imagine yourself walking on the surface what i&#x27;m saying is if i got some bigfoot here i wouldn&#x27;t first do dna analysis i would do a scanning electron microscope analysis because hair does look different at the when it&#x27;s magnified human hair animal hair in my graduate school where i went to graduate school at tambien state university there was a student who did uh analysis of scanning electron microscope of hair and they wrote a little guide for how to identify here but that&#x27;s very interesting uh thank you for all this feedback metal gaming tell me what your favorite game is middle gaming and what are you playing currently okay then we have metal gaming says hey how are you thank you guys very friendly we got some more comments from metal gaming okay uh there was also a famous nazi bigfoot but the result was a fraudulent hoax of a stuffed doll very funny a lot of hoaxes man there&#x27;s a lot of hoaxes hoaxes are everywhere one of the families okay one of the samples did show that two different bear species were breeding oh they didn&#x27;t uh think that so they got a surprise to discover that&#x27;s great that&#x27;s really cool man i gotta say look a lot of times when i started a research paper um i&#x27;m okay if i don&#x27;t get the results i&#x27;m looking for because as long as you do good research and you do good good methods and you take good records you will more than likely find some kind of discovery maybe it&#x27;s not what you originally wanted but you&#x27;ll find some kind of discovery and i love discoveries um that&#x27;s interesting so i think what you&#x27;re saying metal gaming is that a lot of people okay this person studied the dna but they all turned out to be either uh cows or bears um but there was nothing interesting there let me see here we go okay so bears or horses okay that&#x27;s interesting i wonder how they got the hair i wonder how they got the hair what i&#x27;m trying to say is i wonder if the you know when the person got the hair i wonder if what happened was they were like excuse me they were like um they were like i found this hair i think it&#x27;s bigfoot but they had no strong evidence to support it maybe they just heard something but they saw a shadow but yeah anyway i would love to get my own um bigfoot hair but thank you metal metal gaming that&#x27;s really good information i really appreciate that um okay wait hold on oh let&#x27;s go back here okay melinda says i think you can id it as a new species based on how different it is from known dna database if the database is sufficient this is what i heard when i was in school i heard that if any science project i think this is maybe american only but it may be international if you do any if you see if you sequence any dna of any animal you&#x27;re required to submit it to a database that is publicly accessible to everybody so melinda is saying that she thinks if let&#x27;s say okay so the example is this what if we get some hair of bigfoot and we&#x27;d do a dna analysis it would be a new species and so she&#x27;s saying you can identify a new species based on how different it is from the known dna database but what if it&#x27;s incredibly similar to what&#x27;s already there what if it&#x27;s not that different you know here&#x27;s the other thing i suspect okay this is a hypothesis i keep saying this word hypothesis okay so these are not facts these are statements that can be tested but they have not been tested so i&#x27;m not saying this is true but my hypothesis is that if bigfoot is real if bigfoot is a flesh and blood animal then what is happening is that they are some of these nine species that we have discovered that used to live with humans okay there used to be nine species of humans we think they all died out but we know that some of them interbred with us that we were able to breed with them so we have dna of neanderthals homo erectus we have some of that in our blood so what i&#x27;m trying to say is perhaps bigfoot can interbreed with us perhaps we are compatible sexually and we can have children and if we&#x27;re that compatible then perhaps our dna is very similar just some thoughts and i&#x27;m not saying these are facts i just want the feedback okay a middle game says it was hair blood and tissue that was researched collected from clean bigfoot hunters okay and then melinda says uh sufficiently full of known species okay uh she&#x27;s just elaborating on a different comment and melinda says i think you i can indeed it okay okay yeah i&#x27;ll just read this again i think yeah so the statement once again is i think you can id a bigfoot as a new species based on how different it is from known species species in the dna database if the database is sufficiently sized which i agree with very true okay well there you go guys great great discussion um okay i know there&#x27;s a lagging comment so i&#x27;m going to go ahead and uh it&#x27;s fine melinda don&#x27;t worry about it i understand what you&#x27;re doing okay uh let me get to one of our one of the articles at least and then i&#x27;ll get to the um then i&#x27;ll get to the ultra-terrestrial paper that was just put out but hey if you guys have more to say about bigfoot i&#x27;m not going to stop you i&#x27;m going to respond to every comment that said that&#x27;s what this this the show is about communication about spreading ideas um you&#x27;re never gonna get made fun of on the show you&#x27;re never gonna be judged unless you&#x27;re a murderer uh anyway let&#x27;s let&#x27;s look at a research paper and um you could comment about bigfoot if you want so okay so let me go share my screen again okay um okay yeah yeah yeah let me see do this full screen okay welcome to the abyss okay now let me pull up this article okay i think this is where i want to be yeah right here okay okay guys check this out so the first article i want to show you is uh this one okay so this is loading whoops i went a little too far i got ahead of myself oh that&#x27;s the wrong paper too where is this paper at let me see um not this one hold on guys i wonder if i lost that paper [Music] interesting huh okay well let me find let me find the paper that i want to show you okay um okay so look if you want to do some research this is the first thing you could do go to google and i&#x27;m going to type in uh giant squid uh feeding hunting let&#x27;s say we want to learn about giant squid feeding hunting just type that in and here&#x27;s the article i wanted anyway okay so okay so we&#x27;re starting our research journey let me know if this video plays can you see this video or is it laggy so this is a video of a giant squid hunting okay so the name of this article is uh okay first of all uh this is where it&#x27;s found it&#x27;s found at sciencealert.com um after the video i&#x27;ll put the link in the description but let me tell you how to do some in-depth research so this article was published in july 31st 2022 and it was written by michelle starr so we have this cool video and we have um the title first of its kind video shows giant how giant squid hunter prey in the ocean so what i want to do is like okay this is an article that was written by a reporter like michelle starr science contributor but it&#x27;s based on a real research paper so i want to find the original research paper so what i&#x27;m going to do and i&#x27;ve done this already so i know what works is i&#x27;m going to look for someone&#x27;s name i&#x27;m going to look for someone&#x27;s name and look for where they work okay so here we go so here it says that&#x27;s why a team of researchers led by nathan robinson all right so here&#x27;s my first lead nathan robinson so what i&#x27;m going to do is i&#x27;m going to go to google scholar my research is found on google scholar uh if you want to go to google scholar just go to scholar.google.com okay so i want to find i want to get to the bottom of this i want to find the original article so what i&#x27;m going to do is type in that person&#x27;s name which i believe it was nathan robinson and then i&#x27;m going to type in giant squid okay to try to find the original research paper okay so as you can see i already found it already so here are my results the first result says it says usually here&#x27;s a research paper it&#x27;s called studying the swift smart and shy under unobtrusive camera platforms for observing large deep-sea squid and if you look these are the authors of the paper there&#x27;s a lot of authors but the first author is nj robinson ding-ding-ding so what you have here is you have a date when it was published 2021 and yeah this is the original article now this one is available so you could actually get the article now if you&#x27;re writing a research paper and for college or for your company or for yourself and you want to do a works cited what&#x27;s really cool with google scholars you can just click here and it automatically has a citation so you could either do apa style or chicago style or harvard style you can just copy and paste it&#x27;s what i did in college guys okay so anyway let&#x27;s read the original paper so then i&#x27;m going to click here and here we go here&#x27;s the original research paper so you could up here you could get a pdf if you want to um and this is what the original research paper this is what it looks like when i publish research papers so what you have the sections of the paper are the title which is right here then you have the authors underneath it this kind of summarizes some highlights of the paper and then we have the abstract the abstract is a summary of the entire paper so the abstract lets you know what the whole paper is about but the paper is then divided into an introduction all research papers have an introduction okay and then after the introduction they have a methods so the methods shows you what they did all the details how when did we do it how did we do it what do we use to do it and the methods is important because this is supposed to you&#x27;re supposed to be able to replicate the study so you&#x27;re supposed to be able to read these methods it&#x27;s like a cookbook you&#x27;re supposed to be able to do exactly what they did and get the same results and here&#x27;s a photograph look so this is kind of showing where they studied the squid so this is known as a figure so this is figure one and it&#x27;s got a little bit of description so if it tells you what you&#x27;re looking at and why you&#x27;re looking at it it&#x27;s got some awesome photographs look at this giant squid boy look at that it&#x27;s beautiful oh my god anyway um so you can even download the high-res images so this is figure two uh it says uh image of an unidentified squid possibly the latin name of the squid so yeah if you remember from my bigfoot episode all species have a name that has two parts so this is the species name it&#x27;s in written in latin all species names are written in latin because it&#x27;s a dead language it is not changing so the idea is that if you name a new species for something in latin that language is dead it will never change and anybody in the world no matter if you&#x27;re japanese or you&#x27;re you know venezuelan or czechoslovakian i cannot i should have picked the easier country if you&#x27;re russian you could you could you know you could translate this from um from latin and usually these names are descriptive so if you look at this last part whoops hit the wrong button if you look at this last part of the name the slowani this is the this is the unique name of the species this first part that is a genus name so that&#x27;s a classification group so that&#x27;s a larger group of organisms but the second part the species epithet this is exactly what um the species is now this name is usually what is named after a person or it&#x27;s usually descriptive so it may this may translate in latin it may translate into long or red or hairy or cold it&#x27;s usually something descriptive about the species or it&#x27;s the name of a person okay and then if we go further we have some more pictures look at this oh interesting look at that squid boy or girl very cool okay i believe we&#x27;re still in the method section look at look at this we have some stalking the approach striking grappling releasing jetting away so this is what a giant squid does okay so look we have some e jelly and a bait bag right here in the top left corner so first the squid will stalk then they will approach then they will strike then they will grapple then they will release and they will jet away sounds like a date i had one time i&#x27;m just kidding okay so um if you look at this is figure four and the description says uh sequential video stills a through f of a giant squid approaching the e jelly very cool okay let&#x27;s look at this picture look at that look at all this cool information all right okay so then yeah the third section is the results section okay so now you&#x27;ve seen the abstract which is the summary of the research paper now you&#x27;ve seen the introduction which sets up the research paper now you&#x27;ve seen the methods what tells you exactly what they do now you see the results the results all they do is in a very black and white to just the facts manner tell you what they discovered they don&#x27;t make any conclusions they don&#x27;t make any assumptions this is just what we found okay and then we have the discussion so the discussion is the last long pace of the paper in the discussion section they discussed like what we&#x27;ve been doing today they talk about what does it mean that we found this thing what does it mean that we discovered how the squid feeds what are the larger implications what is the future research we could do that&#x27;s with the discussion section this is where you could go buck wild and crazy i always have the most fun when i write the discussion okay there&#x27;s one more section that&#x27;s important is uh right here author contributions this is kind of like acknowledgements where you talk about wait i think this may be something different hold on hold on hold on okay what i&#x27;m trying to talk about is acknowledgements so all papers have an acknowledgement sections where this is where you thank anybody that helped you with the paper you talk about who gave you money you know this research is very expensive it says right here that it was uh you got money from a national science foundation and here&#x27;s a grant number so you can look up this grant so if you&#x27;re american i got news for you you paid for this research okay the national science foundation is united states organization government organization that funds scientific research scientists have to apply for the money and they get it i paid for this research if you pay taxes and you&#x27;re an american guess what you own part of this research so go ahead and read it another interesting thing right here was a declaration of competing interests that&#x27;s very interesting i haven&#x27;t seen this very often but this is basically like let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re you&#x27;re writing uh a paper about like the effects of cigarette use on your lungs well you would want to put here if you work for a tobacco company because that would be a competing interest uh okay oh and then at the end there&#x27;s always an appendix which has supplementary data which it looks like there&#x27;s some really cool pictures like a video look at that squid boy i wonder if i could play this a lot i guess i can look at that let me know if this video is choppy but look at this squid go baby oh my gosh i&#x27;m in love look at it go i&#x27;m going to try that again wow that&#x27;s incredible i love it okay i&#x27;m gonna go back to the video because i&#x27;m not even sure if you guys were able to see this or i can&#x27;t see the comments so this all could look really crappy so let me know if this section was good look at these these look like giant isopods these are mud bugs if you ever see roly-polies which are actually crustaceans or pill bugs that live in your yard these are undersea versions of them they get really huge and they&#x27;re very scary looking but they look they look pretty similar to it look there&#x27;s a squid back there it looks like they&#x27;re eating that e jelly that&#x27;s awesome oh look at that squid what&#x27;s it gonna do what&#x27;s he gonna do a lot of videos once again guys let me know if this this whole section was okay another volume what is this a long video i&#x27;m going to fast forward too long didn&#x27;t read hold on what are we looking at here okay i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very fascinating but here&#x27;s some more pictures this is the e-jelly they keep talking about e-jelly i don&#x27;t know what e-jelly is but i could read the paper look at this i believe this is the platform to use for the camera yeah there&#x27;s a bait bag there&#x27;s e-jelly that&#x27;s awesome so this teaches you how to build a camera to photograph giant squid so you could you could read the schematic and do it yourself okay and yeah the last section i&#x27;m sorry there&#x27;s another section called references so in a references section you cite all the other research papers just like this one that you use in your study so all studies build on other previous studies so as you can see you know these are all different papers that they went ahead and cited it&#x27;s a lot goes on and on very cool okay let me go back to reality okay okay guys i&#x27;m back uh okay let me catch up on the comments but some of them are saying um metal gaming says squids are interesting very clever okay okay cool uh yes we can see the squid videos very cool i&#x27;m glad that worked cool guys that was a little experiment on my end i mean i just never did that let&#x27;s see um okay so let&#x27;s catch up with comments so metal gaming says i have 280 steam games just now i&#x27;m on sniper elite five and deep rock galactic i play a lot of different and i do like prog rock metal etc okay can you recommend a good a good first time prog rock song i like look this is what i like i like electronic music i like ambient music i like 90s rock like nirvana radiohead rem uh dave matthews band okay uh okay so here&#x27;s some songs so metal gaming likes dream theater pagan mine elegy uh and ofc iron maiden and armory etc i have a playlist on my youtube okay i&#x27;ll check that out uh i like history ufos aliens ghosts and other things as bigfoot stuff in the universe and sea creatures fish etc cool well you&#x27;re in the right place place metal gaming okay thanks for the stream by the way you&#x27;re welcome i forgot to say i also play rocksmith games using a bass or guitar it&#x27;s very fun and a good okay so a rocksmith is a video game that&#x27;s meant to teach you how to play guitar from scratch you actually plug in your guitar to your video game console a real guitar not not like a plastic toy guitar i might get into uh that i have so many hobbies i i don&#x27;t need to do that i need to finish my research papers okay uh wreaking havoc is here yo yo yo hey thank you for being here weekend sure appreciate it check out my episode a lifetime of abductions with the wreaking havoc yeah [Music] we can have it says that&#x27;s wild looking uh and then people are just saying yeah the videos look good oh yeah so yeah melinda says not sure if you said this before but before you start a study you need to see if your idea has already been done by others yeah not only that look i&#x27;ve had some static with some scientists i&#x27;ve had i had a project i wanted to do so i reached out to another graduate student and i told him because he was working on similar things and he went he went ahead and told me like hey don&#x27;t do this project because i&#x27;m doing this project or i&#x27;m doing something similar or i&#x27;m eventually going to do it you know there&#x27;s so many animals i didn&#x27;t want to fight with them i didn&#x27;t want to argue with them i was like fine no problem i&#x27;ll move on to something else but that&#x27;s a good point if you&#x27;re going to start a project you should see that&#x27;s what usually before you start a project you go to google scholar and you just read everything you can about it to make sure that it hasn&#x27;t been done before and you also want to maybe reach out to somebody to see if they&#x27;re not working on it already but yeah i hope you guys like that uh that was just a quick view of what&#x27;s going on um but man since we&#x27;re at an hour and 17 minutes i think let&#x27;s just get into that ultra terrestrial paper uh let&#x27;s do it so first i want to thank daniel allen jones he&#x27;s got some um groups he&#x27;s got a youtube page called the vortex uh if you look at my episode called texas ufos that&#x27;s daniel allen jones and he went ahead and gave me a lot of uh information about texas ufos but all his links are in the description and daniel allen jones he&#x27;s the one that went ahead and uh told me he posted about this ultra terrestrial paper by hal put off and so let&#x27;s talk about this ultraterrestrial paper so let me give you a little introduction so this ultraterrestrial paper is a a research paper that was published about intelligent things that may be living on the planets that we haven&#x27;t discovered like bigfoot i think bigfoot would classify hal put off is a phd scientist that has been known to work in places like skinwalker ranch uh he&#x27;s been able to do paranormal research very interesting so uh let&#x27;s check out this research paper okay so i&#x27;m going to go ahead and share my screen again let&#x27;s see your screen okay sure here we go back so okay here we go okay so first let me get credits because i found the article here so the the article was first mentioned here so daniel allen jones posted it on his facebook and the link he posted was this link so this is a ufo website i&#x27;m somewhat familiar with called silverrecord.com so in july 31st 2022 uh the website posted this article it says how put offs ultra terrestrial paper finally released here&#x27;s a picture of dr halp put off i guess he also worked with to the academy arts of arts and science if you see this little logo in the bottom right i believe this company still exists to the to the star&#x27;s academy of arts and science is a uh for public benefit company started by the lead singer a blink 182 what&#x27;s my name again what&#x27;s my age again what&#x27;s my age again that&#x27;s one of their songs the purpose of this um company was to write produce movies and books about the ufo phenomenon and research ufos and you know let the public know about ufos but while working with research scientists and government officials okay so it says right here uh that the paper was published in the journal of cosmology many in the eu hope community have been asking to read this paper and yeah okay so here&#x27;s the so they post the link and here is the paper itself all right so let&#x27;s go ahead and um let&#x27;s look at it real fast we have a little bit we know a little bit of what these papers are like okay let me try to make sure okay so this paper was published in the journal of cosmology so all these research papers are published in a different journal so this journal is called the journal of cosmology volume 29 number one and the pages it&#x27;s found is in the page 2001 through 2016. so uh it is about 16 pages long the name of the paper is ultra terrestrial models the author is only one h.e put off phd uh the uh and his so his his organization is the institute for advanced studies at austin and his email is put off at aol.com maybe i&#x27;ll ask him to be on the show okay that&#x27;s a cover letter okay here&#x27;s the first letter it says where the uh he works for the institute of advanced studies at austin and there&#x27;s the address it&#x27;s in uh west lake hills texas okay so once again here&#x27;s the abstract so let&#x27;s read this because this is a summary of the paper i&#x27;m not sure if we&#x27;ll read the whole thing but the summary should tell us basically what the conclusions are and it should tell us everything we need to know but just not in a lot of detail here we go okay under consideration in this paper are two seminal statements and they&#x27;re concomitants currently known as follows this happens a lot when you read a research paper you&#x27;ll start reading a research paper it&#x27;s very technical you&#x27;ll see a word you don&#x27;t know what it means it&#x27;s happening to me right now so what i do is i i stop and i look it up so already i don&#x27;t know what this word is we&#x27;re one sentence in and i am confused okay so uh khan okay tanf is a noun a phenomenon that naturally accompanies or follows something and as an example it says some of us look on pain and illness as concomitants of the stresses of living okay that makes sense so let&#x27;s go back and see if we understand okay so here we go so what did what they&#x27;re trying to say let me let me translate under consideration in this paper are two seminal statements and they&#x27;re uh things that follow okay so it&#x27;s basically saying like here are two really important statements and here&#x27;s what the implications of those statements are that&#x27;s another way of saying it okay number one there is an unidentified phenomenon interacting with the current human population on earth what a wild sentence oh my god that&#x27;s a really crazy sentence i i guess i agree with that but i mean there is an unidentified phenomena interacting with the current human population okay number two it is currently unknown whether the phenomenon is exclusively extraterrestrial from another planet extra dimensional from another dimension crypto-terrestrial uh which means it comes from earth uh oh man i think i was i think i was i might have been confusing ultra terrestrial with crypto-terrestrial i&#x27;m already making a correction here but uh let&#x27;s find out hold on a second i mean he should address it in his paper but man i think i might i think ultra terrestrial might be interdimensional and crypto terrestrial may be that it&#x27;s from earth oh i think i messed up already guys i messed up it happens to the best of us okay so we&#x27;re looking at what crypts of terrestrial mean um okay here we go wikipedia cryptospecial hypothesis um [Music] okay here we go the crypto terrestrial hypothesis was developed by uh this author who has since passed away i&#x27;ve read some of his books uh tony&#x27;s is his last name uh and later uh yeah was published posthumously it proposes that extraterrestrial beings are actually mysterious and secretive races of earthly origin these races have existed upon earth for at least as long as humanity and present themselves as extraterrestrials or occult beings some have suggested this is an extension of the ideas of richard shaver okay so i think i am incorrect i kept talking about ultra terrestrials but i was incorrectly saying that i was saying that ultraterrorist rules are crypto terrestrials so crypto terrestrials are what i just said they&#x27;re from earth so now let&#x27;s look up ultra sorry guys i let you astray but i&#x27;m correcting myself i&#x27;m self-correcting myself in the same video so let&#x27;s see uh yeah i believe ultraterrestrial means interdimensional but anyway let&#x27;s read the paper so i&#x27;m already correcting myself okay let&#x27;s go back to number two okay it is currently unknown whether the phenomenon is exclusively extraterrestrial from another planet extra-dimensional from another dimension crypto terrestrial from earth demonic or jinn dynamic um indicates the christian religion jinn is the muslim religion proto-ancient human or you know like i said with bigfoot this is one of the ancient human races time travelers or etc or some combination or mutation of any of all of these however it appears highly likely that the phenomenon per se is not constituted constituted exclusively of members of the current human population fascinating in this paper we address the above under the overarching theme ultraterrestrials in order to develop a template to be matched against data at hand and that may be procured in the future okay all right well it didn&#x27;t really give us a lot of results or anything but interesting we&#x27;ll read the background because that was uh i don&#x27;t know that was a little bit lacking for me and maybe i don&#x27;t know i&#x27;m gonna go back and see what you guys are saying okay let me just check on everybody whoops uh okay well there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any comments but let me know if you were able to understand everything with that ultra terrestrial paper i just want to know i just want to make sure everything&#x27;s going fine i don&#x27;t want to waste anybody&#x27;s time but we still have people in the room so i&#x27;m going to guess everything&#x27;s going fine so let&#x27;s go back and read the first part of that paper once again we&#x27;re reading how put offs ultra terrestrial paper that was recently published in a scientific journal and we&#x27;re not we&#x27;ve we&#x27;re going to read the background uh okay thank you melinda melinda says everything&#x27;s good so far okay so yeah let&#x27;s go back going back add to stream okay go back to the paper so once again you guys could read this paper if you want um i will put the link to it uh after the stream i i look i had done all the delay i have done all these beautiful links uh in the description but they all got deleted so i have to redo them you know i didn&#x27;t get too upset i was like whatever it&#x27;s not a big deal i have food i have health i have a beautiful cat who&#x27;s meowing right now she wants something i don&#x27;t know what it is i&#x27;m going to hold her like a baby to see if you guys can hear me out okay i&#x27;m holding the cat and let&#x27;s see if we can hear a mail okay background as one takes a decades-long view of the unidentified phenomenon sorry guys i don&#x27;t know if you heard that but i got a little notification i guess you saw the notification sorry sorry sorry this thing i think is a virus this is a virus i don&#x27;t like it i thought i got rid of it i i downloaded a a malware antivirus offer but it didn&#x27;t detect it so i have to do some more thing i don&#x27;t want somebody to steal all my information okay sorry about that guys i hope they didn&#x27;t hurt your ears okay as one takes a decades long view of the unidentified aerial phenomenon uap or ufo topic it is easy to become frustrated by by what one seeks as a lack of robust progress yeah i&#x27;m frustrated in establishing sure in certain iron-clad data points and even the most fundamental on even about even the most fundamental of issues yes brother i agree i&#x27;m frustrated because i can&#x27;t give certain iron-clad data points about even the most fundamental of issues these issues prompt such key questions as bullet point one is the phenomenon predominantly nuts and bolts in other words is it made of matter is it physical or is it psychological in our minds or metaphysical uh you know it&#x27;s i don&#x27;t know i&#x27;m not really sure what medical physical means i mean i have a vague idea assuming such distinctions can be made well guys i don&#x27;t know what benefits of being so i&#x27;m gonna put down the cats i&#x27;m gonna open a soda and i&#x27;m gonna look up the definition of metal physical here we go ah okay so here&#x27;s a word i&#x27;ve seen you know around but i don&#x27;t know what it means okay what does metaphysical mean metaphysical is relating to metaphysics wow thank you dictionary okay what is metaphysics metaphysics what is my physics okay metaphysics is oh it&#x27;s a philosophical it&#x27;s a philosophy branch i don&#x27;t know okay metaphysics the branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things including abstract concepts such as the being knowing substance cause identity time and space here&#x27;s an example they would regard the question of the initial conditions of the for the universe as belonging in the realm of metaphysics or religion okay abstract theory with no basis in reality the very subject of milk pricing involves one in a wonderland of accounting practices and a metaphysics of its own all right guys i&#x27;m still stomped guys i i gotta be honest with you i don&#x27;t know what that means let me know if you know what it means okay moving on uh bullet point number two is the source of the phenomenon predominantly terrestrial ultra-terrestrial so here&#x27;s a definition uh ancient occult group isolated pre-diluvial high-tech society stranded et gods oh okay so it looks like ultra terrestrial is kind of similar to cryptoterrestrial so ultratresso means ancient occult group interesting isolated pre-diluvian high-tech society okay stranded ets or god so these are stranded et&#x27;s that present themselves as gods or is it extraterrestrial assuming that distinctions between these alternatives are meaningful let me take a sip of my drink okay has the phenomenon ramped up in our era or has it been essentially constant over millennia uh next bullet point are oftentimes related topics such as claimed abductions crop circles and animal mutilations truly related or are they separate categories or a phenomenon all right these are all great questions i like cal poly&#x27;s writing style as well you know sometimes when you read these papers you&#x27;re just like man i cannot read this for the life of me but he seems to be a good writer easy writes easily easy to read and i&#x27;m really interested i want to keep reading are okay another bullet point are institutions such as governments truly that much more knowledgeable than we are even if only in certain protected domains or are they essentially in the same position as we are give or take some hard data in hand that&#x27;s a great question i think we&#x27;ve discussed all these things okay let me make this a little bit smaller a little bit bigger a little bit smaller i&#x27;ll just leave it there okay perfect okay uh number two critique as we critiqued our positions vis-a-vis these issues three factors stand out as weaknesses that potentially could be addressed by developing new strategies the weaknesses are number one gather data gathering is essentially passive typically reports are events are reported and data are gathered and analyzed this constitutes essentially a reactive as opposed to proactive mode yeah i understand what that is this is not meant as a pejorative statement astrophysicists find themselves in the same situation even seemingly proactive movements such as john greenwald&#x27;s uh fo foia government document search in the public arena or attempted collection of the detritus of classified programs by some under special protected conditions simply constitute efforts to cause the government to release data to passive ever hopeful recipients the ball is still in someone else&#x27;s court other more proactive measures could be taken ranging from the relatively prosaic setting up all-weather all-sky optical infrared monitoring stations through the more tech intensive approaches i uh eg i&#x27;m not sure what that means that means for example i think magnetic disturbance and rf radio frequency gigahertz detectors multi-variable monitoring suites exo archaeological investigations to the arcane search for evidence of anomalous manipulation of human genetic structure wow and stretching to the esoteric remote viewing telepathic contact wow okay nobody&#x27;s going to say that hal put off dr hop put of it does not unders has not been well read on the subject of the of ufos okay so i just want to point out some things um he said this the type of research we&#x27;re doing is reactive as opposed to proactive what does that mean well if we look at that squid research that sweet research was proactive okay somebody went out they built a camera system with baits with uh electronic jelly whatever that is with a camera they took a boat out they put it in the water they were proactive they took initiative they were the heroes of their journey and they got the data what does reactive mean well he&#x27;s saying that when we study ufos we&#x27;re reactive you know we are reacting to what happens a ufo comes the ufo is being proactive it&#x27;s flying above us we then take a photograph we&#x27;re being reactive and so we&#x27;re at a disadvantage he mentions john greenwald who i believe has the youtube group and the website called the black volt black vault so he&#x27;s he goes ahead and takes advantage of this foia i forget what that stands for i&#x27;m sorry his name is john greenwald jr and yeah he&#x27;s got the black vault website so he goes ahead and he takes advantage of this law where he could ask the government for documents and he gets all these documents to try to find out about ufos okay so those are some things we do to get research but then he also talks about how we could study uh all weather all sky optical infrared monitoring stations uh uh you know infrared that&#x27;s something that um uh wreaking havoc is doing with infrared cameras you can buy your own infrared cameras and then he says more more tech intensive approaches like magnetic disturbance and radio frequency gigahertz detectors multi-variable monitoring suits and exo archaeological investigations that&#x27;s interesting okay those are just different tools scientific tools to get information then he talks about other methods that are arcane like looking for manipulation of the human genetic structure so there&#x27;s the idea out there that our genetic structure has been manipulated by a stronger race i think if you look at the anunnaki which was a um sumerian and anunnaki stories they say that you know an ancient alien race came and they manipulated the dna that was here in order to make humans as a slave race i&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s 100 correct if i i mean i&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;m saying the story correctly but that&#x27;s he&#x27;s basically saying you know you could try to look for genetic manipulation and he says all the way to the esoteric like remote viewing or telepathic contact remote viewing is i mean it was done by the government by the cia this is apparently a method of um you put simply it&#x27;s a method of um of meditation so that you could see things like uh a russian submarine or a another another country&#x27;s like military base as examples without ever going there so you could be anywhere in the world and you could see any other place and then telepathic contact is you know using your mind to communicate with you know some of these alien races crazy okay number two by and large our models and hypotheses are relatively circum circumscribed in another word i&#x27;ve heard this word but i don&#x27;t know what it is this show is also a vocabulary show guys okay okay circumscribe means restrict within limits okay so let&#x27;s go back to that sentence by and large our models and hypotheses are relatively restrained restricted within limits yeah that makes sense okay uh as stated in entry two above although interested parties tend to be proponents of what would appear to be a wide range of hypotheses ranging from it&#x27;s all psychologicals check your dsm v that&#x27;s that&#x27;s meant as a joke i think but it&#x27;s he&#x27;s saying that some hypotheses or some skeptics are saying all this crazy stuff we talk about on the show it&#x27;s all psychological and he&#x27;s referring to this dsmv is i believe a diagnostic manual that psychologists and psychiatrists use to diagnose somebody it lists all the different conditions like um schizophrenia or bipolar disorder or depression okay through interdimensional time travelers and angels to graze and advance spacecraft from zeta reticuli there are additional options that they&#x27;ll mention in passing in the literature are not taken very seriously and therefore go relatively unresearched these include such categories as a hidden community of et&#x27;s or gods possibly stranded here millennia go allah zechariah sitchin&#x27;s earth chronicles series isolite isolated remnants of pre-diluvian high-tech society or the atlantis myth or an ancient occult group who happens to stumble on new new energy sources and control of gravity and including a post world war ii cover covert cabal of the military industrial complex variety dolan&#x27;s breakaway civilization concepts so richard dolan is originally a historian he&#x27;s got a channel called richard dolan and he&#x27;s got a website and richard julian was originally a historian an academic historian and he started studying history and he found that the history and the documents of history show that the ufo reality is real he believes primarily that ufos are extraterrestrial he believes there are different races he believes some of the races are reptilian praying mantis gray but he also believes in this breakaway civilization that&#x27;s another hypothesis so what it is it means that post world war ii there was a small secretive group of people within the military industrial uh uh complex that developed like super technology like faster than light technology they could super energy technology anti-gravity technology and they&#x27;re living uh secretly with all this technology so it&#x27;s a breakaway civilization it is a group of humanity that decided to live in secret with their toys and their technology okay number three analysis and speculation not forensics constitutes the present core modus operandi analysis and specul this is true he&#x27;s saying that mostly what we do is analysis and speculation now if you look at this episode that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been doing this whole episode when we&#x27;re talking about bigfoot there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it but all we&#x27;re doing is speculating and analyzing what we know we&#x27;re not doing forensics um forensics is like hardcore research you know it&#x27;s like analyzing data you know looking at things physical objects with a microscope we&#x27;re running dna tests you know a lot of times all we do is just talk speculate about things okay okay as the various hypotheses are generated and pursued hypothesis generation that&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve been doing all night is generating hypotheses the data are gathered considerable interventional effort goes into attempting a fit between the two hypothesis tense testing this is certainly a healthy activity hey just what i said yeah it&#x27;s fun there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it driving as it does from the instinctive and productive human earths to reduce ambiguity and interpreting one&#x27;s surroundings however there&#x27;s that word however honey i love you you&#x27;re a great lover however however what however what hal put off i&#x27;m just kidding okay however this approach could profit by incorporating elements of a more forensic gumshoe style by gum she was talking about these detectives you know like you got your magnifying glass you&#x27;re going to hit the streets that&#x27;s kind of what i said i mean forensic gumshoe style that&#x27;s why i said like i want to get somebody to mail me a bigfoot hair so i can look at it under scanning electron microscope i want to get i&#x27;m going to start gifting bigfoot something but leave a toy like a block with a bunch of tape on it so that he leaves his hair behind that&#x27;s a forensic gumshoe style investigation as in criminalistic and intelligence work uh the very fact that so many hypotheses remain on the table regarding the source of the phenomenon clearly indicates that forensic work to date has been inadequate to even eliminate certain hypothesis hypothesis and elimination exclamation point he&#x27;s right all three forms hypothesis handling are required he&#x27;s right okay i&#x27;m going to check uh make sure everything&#x27;s still good with the feed and then we&#x27;ll continue reading so guys let me know if everything&#x27;s good with the feed okay looks like it is but let&#x27;s read some of these comments all right all right so we have brad here whoa brad is in the room from the excellent channel creature movie reviews guys on my last video we talked about monster movies ufo movies bigfoot movies jurassic park movies and brad&#x27;s a great speaker so please subscribe to his channel creature movie reviews so brad says good to know i&#x27;m not the only one who has to look up words while reading these papers yeah dude i do it all the time thank you for being here brad uh yes look up words when reading books too sounds like the best way to learn no harm there yeah i mean it&#x27;s fun it&#x27;s fun to learn vocabulary metal gaming i don&#x27;t think necessarily aliens ufos have underground bases built into seas i do believe they submerge into the sea and do underwater research on life down there and how life evolves from waters okay yeah sounds sounds very true then we have melinda says uh that&#x27;s true the only trick is to remember what the words mean after you look them up yeah i got to remember them uh uh yeah so eg does mean for example so it&#x27;s a latin word meaning it&#x27;s a latin word and it means exempli gratia just like i said species names are in latin because it&#x27;s a dead language okay oh yeah here&#x27;s here she says the other thing you see ie which means that is from the latin okay so the way i can remember it so if you guys ever read a paper and you see eg and ie abbreviated you can remember that ie means that is because it starts with an i no wait that doesn&#x27;t work because it starts with an i and that is has an i in it i.e has means that is because that is has an i in it eg does not have an i in it but easy to say for example i don&#x27;t know it makes sense in my head and then um so yeah i.e means that is and that is latin for id est okay and he oh yeah here we go so melinda is also clarifying that foia means freedom of information act very true metal gaming says take uh take a look at this undersea squid type of creature i think in the end it gets destroyed by the bio bio western streams from the underwater vehicle thrusters oh interesting okay take a look at this undersea squid type creature i think in the end it gets destroyed by the oh blow blow streams from the underwater vehicle thrusters oh interesting so you&#x27;re saying that yeah that they could be they could be damaged that squid type creatures could be damaged by the thrusters interesting yeah well that does happen i mean whales manatees they get they get messed up um by the thrusters of a boat i know it&#x27;s not the same but let&#x27;s just say human craft are dangerous i mean even cars run over you know wild animals so boats and submarines they do hurt animals through the mechanics of them uh 98 of human day does not code for anything wouldn&#x27;t it be interesting if that part of our dna is from an alien population as you mentioned with the sumerians interesting you know there&#x27;s always you know in genetics i&#x27;ve always heard that a lot of virginia is junk dna in other words we don&#x27;t know what it codes for we don&#x27;t know what it its purpose is but i&#x27;ve some scientists are like well maybe it is important we just haven&#x27;t realized what it is yeah so there you go she says it&#x27;s called junk dna okay then melinda says okay melinda has subscribed to creature movie reviews great i hope you&#x27;re getting a lot of subscribers creature movie reviews because you really deserve it um it&#x27;s very entertaining uh thank you great okay metal gaming says look at the link oh okay so you provided a link interesting uh let me try to get that link up there sure your show was great on sunday sunday night is my pbs night so i gotta watch the recording yeah no no no problem here okay let me see let me try to find that link okay um you know what the link didn&#x27;t come up uh metal gaming try sending me the link again uh or if you can try okay if it doesn&#x27;t come up try googling i mean try emailing me the link if that&#x27;s not too much trouble my email is wild the number seven trees gmail.com try to email me that link and try to post it again here because um it didn&#x27;t come up i&#x27;m looking real fast sometimes you know sometimes um youtube deletes links it&#x27;s weird okay let&#x27;s go back to the paper uh but great great comments guys great comments okay back into the abyss and back to the paper okay number three strategy for forward motion great now we&#x27;re going to talk about like yeah what are we going from here given the tenor of the above remarks the following recommendations are offered as proactive measures to make headway specifically it would behoove us to set aside our tentativeness about any given hypothesis place it on the table as almost certainly true and go for it i like that with an aggressive forensic mindset that&#x27;s kind of what we&#x27;re doing with this bigfoot thing you know my hypothesis is that bigfoot is a flesh and blood animal my hypothesis is that bigfoot uh gifts gives you gifts if you give him gifts and my hypothesis is that we could get a body from bigfoot if we try hard enough or some hair from bigfoot or some fingerprints and yeah he&#x27;s saying go for it assume it&#x27;s true and aggressively go for it consider the following disparate hypothetical examples of the type outline and entry to in the abstract number one the extraterrestrial hypothesis in this scenario crash retrievals of nuts and bolts alien hardware have occurred the detritus the titus is like garbage or waste of which has been distributed in the u.s to corporate america uh he&#x27;s talking about the uh colonel corso scenario uh colonel curso corso says that he&#x27;s he wrote a book which i heard his book i think was called after roswell i heard that it was edited in the american version but the french version was not edited all the juicy details anyway he says that after roswell the crash in roswell all of that technology was separated into private companies the government gave it to them they didn&#x27;t tell it where it came from but they asked them to reverse engineer it and that some of those results are for example radio fiber optics setting aside the specific claims of colonel corso if such is the case certain telltale signatures should emerge under scrutiny moreover some evidence indicates that this could be the case these would include include a certain level a relatively low profile possibly statement influence integrated investment control of a select set of global multinational corporations with convergent interlocking technological developments eg which means let&#x27;s see for example um aerospace and electronics corporations that&#x27;s a really large sentence i don&#x27;t even want to break that down i need to make some progress that&#x27;s a really dense sentence okay number two if biological specimens have been retrieved the development of unusual lines of biological slash genetic inquiry by highly qualified professionals whose career path would seem to divert suddenly for what might be ex extrapolated from their earlier work for example accelerated research into retroviruses interesting okay so i think what he&#x27;s saying in this one this is biological so i understand a little better so he&#x27;s saying if bodies of ufos have been found then the development of unusual lines of biological or genetic inter integrity by highly qualified professionals okay so i think what he&#x27;s saying is that if you look at some experts in biology engineering is genetics some highly qualified professionals their career path would maybe have diverged suddenly so let&#x27;s say they were studying the genetics of uh potato viruses or tobacco viruses or a crop virus but they&#x27;re experts at you know a genetics well then maybe suddenly they started you know researching something very different like retroviruses and he&#x27;s saying this could be because they got some alien biological matter what exactly is a retrovirus guys i know what a virus is i think we all know what a virus is after 2020 but what is a retrovirus retrovirus is a type of virus that inserts the dna copy into the rna genome of its rna genome into the dna of a host cell that is in invades thus changing the genome of the cell interesting okay i thought that&#x27;s what i what a virus was melinda is a retrovirus different than just a virus um i mean i&#x27;m sure it is but i&#x27;m not sure once again i study invertebrates not viruses or genetics uh okay but that is what our retroviruses okay let&#x27;s go back okay next sudden initiation in the late 40s and early 50s without clear precedence and it is known ufo-related research institutes i fo eg means um for example patel of concentrated development of new highly strength high temperature low density intermetallic alloys funded by near my government facilities such as wpafb for example nitinol interesting let&#x27;s see what is nitinol i believe i think nitinol is probably some kind of it&#x27;s one of these alloys he&#x27;s talking about but let&#x27;s find out okay so oh nits and all i think stands for nickel titanium interesting is nickel titanium a product of ufo research when was it developed okay oh yeah so nickel titanium so nickel and titanium are both elements in the periodic table so they are both types of atoms and so this is an alloy it&#x27;s a mixture of both nickel and titanium whose ele two elements were present in roughly equal atomic percentages here&#x27;s history i just want to see when it was developed oh here we go so okay so it was developed by william j bueller along with frederick wang they discovered his properties during research at the naval ordinance laboratory laboratory in 1959 okay 1959 and then let&#x27;s look up roswell crash july 1947. okay so the idea i think what uh hal put off is saying is that in 1947 we acquired um crash from roswell and that then in 12 years in 1959 nitinol was developed because of the study of ufos wild stuff guys wild stuff okay the accelerated development of geopolitical alliances space weaponry etc for reasons not wholly interpretable in terms of national interest agencies like the u.s space force or the sdi interesting okay sdi uh the sonoran desert institute yeah that can&#x27;t be it let&#x27;s see sdi government agency i&#x27;d be like a grandma like a like a people uh let&#x27;s see sdi um oh perhaps i think maybe it&#x27;s office of state defense integration i&#x27;m guessing okay that makes sense let&#x27;s let&#x27;s find out if this is correct okay the mission of csdi so if this is correct then this should be about ufos the office of state defense integration pm sdi promotes and facilitates closer synchronization and coordination between the department of state dos department of defense dod by managing several high-profile politically military programs and functions okay very interesting now when was this office formed okay um wait what&#x27;s this 1974 uh congressional interesting i&#x27;m gonna try one more time i don&#x27;t wanna get stuck on this but i&#x27;m just gonna try one more thing interesting trying to find the date let&#x27;s try one more i said one more thing earlier but maybe one more thing okay i just want to see what it says about us maybe it says when it was formed um i don&#x27;t see any dates here damn well we&#x27;ll have to get back to this interesting okay guys okay evidence of covert manipulation of the ufo et theme in the public sector by government entities the cia 1953 robertson&#x27;s panel evidence for convert manipulation of the theme in the public sector this is interesting we can wreak in havoc uh when we did our video with creature movie reviews he asked a really good question he was like why um do you guys think there&#x27;s not a lot of movies about grey aliens there&#x27;s really not a lot there was like um this one movie it was a comedy with like joe rogan who plays a grey alien there was a communion there was fire in the sky but that&#x27;s it so why isn&#x27;t there a lot of movies about grey aliens so this is kind of you know covert manipulation of the ufo theme in the public sector okay evidence for generally sub rosa highly classified programs addressing the ufa ish ap issue uh for example as in the recent reveal awesome or eight that program interesting um what does subrosa mean i&#x27;m gonna guess that subrosa means like hidden or classified highly classified programs just to guess just to guess rosa means happening or done in secret i got it i used context clues okay so that&#x27;s what sub rosa rosa rose so i don&#x27;t know how to pronounce it okay so he says uh uh evidence for generally secretive highly classified programs addressing ufps like uh atip and asap interesting atip and asap are associated with luella zondo a former cia counterintelligence officer i&#x27;m not sure if he&#x27;s an officer he just he works for the cia as counterintelligence and then he was charged with his pentagon program to study ufos and their abbreviations are asap and uh atem originally they were also studying not only ufos but according to louis lozando they were originally studying all kinds of phenomenon from skinwalker ranch which is in utah uh look up skinwalker ranch for more information okay here&#x27;s another thing privatize access to space for example by enterprises such as spacex bigelow aerospace and blue origin or threats to national and international security for example national state terrorism might serve to stimulate the surfacing of certain technological developments materials at an accelerated rate and so on interesting so he&#x27;s saying that private access private means like you and me so we privately have access to space by spacex by blue origin which i believe blue origin is a company owned by the founder of virgin records i forget his name interesting okay number two the isolated humans hypothesis an isolated high-tech close community of humans with somewhat advanced scientific knowledge exist apart from known culture telltale signatures might include continuing observation of technology only somewhat in advance of public knowledge for example the 1897 airships fascinating so if you guys don&#x27;t know in 1897 there was a a rash a wave of ufo sightings but these ufo sightings they actually looked like ships in the air like piloted by balloons and people saw people reported people like other people would climb down from the airships in 1897 and they would be like oh yeah i&#x27;m just from another country and i&#x27;m just visiting and yeah we have this crazy spaceship interesting so i think he&#x27;s saying that he&#x27;s saying that those he&#x27;s he&#x27;s hypothesizing that those airships were actually real and they were actually made by a group of people that had advanced technology uh isolated humans that had they were isolated in high-tech closed communities fascinating okay okay unaccounted for missing financial assets i know there&#x27;s a lot of missing financial assets in our government and industrial grade resources possibly including individuals apparent covert misdirection of society in the absence of real evidence to accept the likelihood of the et presence the relative lack of evidence of extremely advanced sophisticated hardware oh here&#x27;s ie okay so egm is for example so that means that ie is uh for example let me see okay i said for example for ie dang melinda i forgot let me go back and see what you said i&#x27;m so sorry i forgot my brain is so old okay let&#x27;s see don&#x27;t worry okay don&#x27;t worry melinda i got you okay ie means that is okay so i.e that is eg for example okay i.e that is my brain okay i.e is that is okay so the relative lack of evidence of extremely advanced sophistication of hardware that is that is hardware clearly beyond present-day design and manufacturer even conceptually let me read that again so there&#x27;s a lack of evidence of extremely advanced sophistication in hardware okay so there&#x27;s lack of evidence i don&#x27;t know i&#x27;m not sure if this is true but is he talking about how cars look basically the same the the internal combustion engine is is almost exactly the same as what we&#x27;ve had since the model t forward so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lack of evidence of extremely advanced sophistication in our hardware um that is hardware clearly beyond present-day design and manufacturer even in concepts why don&#x27;t we have flying cars okay the stranded or colonizat colonizing et or god hypothesis telltale signatures might include evidence in myths from high-tech interpretation of claim devices beyond human capacity of the era to manufacturer uh eg for example nuclear-powered algae production mana machine in biblical times interesting hard evidence for isolated mountain bases detectable by satellite signatures a fast walker or uct uncorrelated target flight paths or anomalous under or anomalous undersea activity or base is detectable by distributed underwater monitoring systems okay i gotta tell you story so one time i was working at a hotel and um because i was doing some kind of technical work and because of that i had to go in all these hotel rooms so i went into this hotel room and the the guy in there was uh working for the military base so there was a military base in that city and so like like everybody i asked him about what he thought about ufo said did you ever see anything weird basically he told me that when he was younger he was working for the military he was in a submarine and for several days they tracked a large fast-moving object they couldn&#x27;t move it was too fast to be an animal and it was consistent for days they were tracking it and following it and they had no idea what it was this is what he&#x27;s talking about um uh anomalous undersea activity yeah by the way that guy also told me that his mother told him that she was in contact with ufos and she spoke with ufos but he said he never got any proof of it and that he really didn&#x27;t know what to make of it but he didn&#x27;t think she was lying weird right covert elite groups exercising occult religious influence in our society illuminati evidence for buried high-tech artifacts or locales with unusual signature radiation characteristics here or off planet etc okay let&#x27;s see let me check on the comments we&#x27;re on page eight so we&#x27;re halfway done with this paper although one of the papers one of the pages was just a cover letter let&#x27;s see how yeah so there&#x27;s like one two three four five six seven eight uh there&#x27;s like eight papers left eight pages left that&#x27;s not that much do you guys think i should continue or should i should i stop here and we&#x27;ll continue this paper on the next episode on sunday what do you guys think let me check in with everybody okay we&#x27;ve been on for two hours and 11 minutes okay metal gaming says did i get the link in my email i&#x27;ll check right now let me catch up on comments and then i will uh check my email i have it right i have my email right here mr catfish&#x27;s hair uh tag mr catfish he says how we doing we&#x27;re doing good i think we&#x27;re having a really good conversation uh okay melinda says retroviruses uses rna instead of dna to copy okay i do know that hiv is an example of a retrovirus interesting interesting uh man one time one time i received a weird message on my facebook group i have a facebook group it&#x27;s called deep wild tech if you want to follow it it&#x27;s like facebook.com deep wild tech one word and i have another facebook group called facebook.com v dot moss dot piglet anyway in one of those groups the deep wild tech group this guy messaged me and he was talking about some weird topics but he was talking about he was talking about mad cow disease which is a virus no no it&#x27;s not a virus it&#x27;s a uh what is it called what is the name of mad cow disease it&#x27;s a prion disease a cows get it from eating cow brains so people would feed cows other cows and then cows would eat cow brains sounds like a zombie and they would get something called a prion disease called mad cow disease and then if humans ate the meat of the cow they would also get mad cow disease anyway he was talking about mad cow disease but he mentioned something about viruses but he was like he was telling me about the idea that a virus could be used for good he was saying like he was telling me about the idea that a virus could change our dna but change it for the better i don&#x27;t know just maybe think about that okay and yeah melinda already knew what subrosa done in secret very good and then okay yeah so virgin airlines yeah richard branson&#x27;s the guy who has um privatized space travel okay uh chill with cat very good melinda says uh see you got to remember these things after you look them up learn them yeah and and and how we look words up we don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s hard to remember them okay look i have a pen right here hold on a second let me get my pen and i&#x27;m going to write it down that&#x27;s the only way you know if you guys need to memorize something i used to do this trick in college so one time i had a test i hadn&#x27;t studied for it so all i did is i literally on a piece of paper like uh basically like jack torrent in the shining i just hand wrote all of my notes over and over again and i memorized them so here&#x27;s a little trick if you need to memorize something a cheat is just a hand write it over and over and over again so i&#x27;m going to do that right now um stop my camera there&#x27;s a picture of a pink rose from my parents garden well my parents planted the rose bridge so that people will not climb through the window but it does produce beautiful roses okay okay okay i&#x27;m gonna write it down here so i have a sharpie and i have my notes here so i e e g okay so eg is for example i think let me check my notes i&#x27;m giving it i&#x27;m giving it a call let&#x27;s try melinda i really am scrolling up scrolling up okay eg means for example okay eg oh i was right okay for example ie means that is it&#x27;s written it is written thank you melinda thank you melinda okay melinda says that is a very interesting paper it is really good so far it&#x27;s interesting keep going okay nina says continue in your next program oh we have one person says continue one person says keep going we need some tie breakers guys prion causes proteins to fold differently so that you could see how that might alter us and i wrote index cards in college for tests got all a&#x27;s except organic chemistry it&#x27;s the best way to learn write it down over and over again yeah okay guys uh let&#x27;s get one more vote should i continue or should i leave it for later um but for right now i&#x27;ll read one more page and then we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll add up all the votes so guys go ahead and vote should i read the whole paper tonight or should i continue tomorrow we have one vote says nida oh hi nina by the way thank you for being here nina and then brad says continue going i&#x27;ll i&#x27;m going to read one more page and then we&#x27;ll tally up the votes let&#x27;s go back into the abyss honestly the only thing that&#x27;s keeping me from eating it is hunger i really need to eat before these streams if you notice on some of my streams i&#x27;m talking about food all the time okay so yeah let&#x27;s finish this pager paper and then we&#x27;ll count the votes okay okay so we are oh we&#x27;re actually on page nine oh we&#x27;re closer than i thought to finishing okay so when you have seven pages left okay i think so let me see nine yeah okay number four the interdimensional or time travel hypothesis basically what i&#x27;ve been reading is he&#x27;s he&#x27;s uh help put off is like hey guys be aggressive with your research all we&#x27;re doing is we&#x27;re hemming and hauling we&#x27;re just hey you know we&#x27;re a bunch of stoners there&#x27;s nothing wrong with this by the way or just a bunch of stoners like hey what about this what about that he says that&#x27;s good he said that&#x27;s healthy but he says why don&#x27;t you just get one of these hypothesis believe it&#x27;s true and just you know put the pedal to the metal and start doing hard research gumshoe research started analyzing stuff and what he&#x27;s doing here is he&#x27;s telling us how we could do that so he&#x27;s listing hypotheses and he&#x27;s telling us how we might find get some of this information to see if these are real so now he&#x27;s talking about this interdimensional so he&#x27;s going to tell us how you know if if we are being visited by interdimensional beings or time travelers what would be the evidence what can we look for so let me drink something and then we&#x27;ll continue reading okay gaining access to our space-time continuum telltale signs might take the form of 14 phenomenon or instant appearances or disappearances of beings okay bigfoot is said to appear and disappear instantly shadow people are said to do this alien upgrades you know ufo occupants in a reverse process humans experience portal access the alternate to alternate realities uh the appearance of beings out of sync oh the appearance of beings out of sync in dress mannerisms or language or technology similarly indecipherable this is fascinating okay so it&#x27;s like okay an example why why might we have time travelers why might we have interdimensional beings he says well one of the reasons is because we might see beings creatures or people out of sync means they don&#x27;t match up with us in the form of dress this would be like the men in black you know who have these suits they look like they dress from an older time or people that dress in like older or weird clothing mannerisms you know the way you act the way you walk uh the way you shake hands you know all your little you know little human behaviors or language so language is interesting um i had a paranormal experience i was in a big thicket i was in a research station i stayed there it was in 2017 i i stayed in this large house in the middle of the woods that was owned by the united states government i stayed there as a scientist by myself middle of the woods in a biological preserve also a paranormal hot spot i stayed there for all the month of december and part of january i remember christmas day i was by myself i was in the woods one of the best christmases of my life new year&#x27;s day i was by myself i was in the woods one of the best new year&#x27;s days of my life but i was incredibly scared at night because it was so cold it was kind of funny the uh the thermostat had a locking key that only the government could open and so it was always cold in the house and it was lonely the only other living thing in that house was this roach that lived in the bathroom it was not an ugly roach it was i think it was a native roach it wasn&#x27;t a german cockroach and i believe it was just you know taking refuge from the cold i was so happy to see that roach i was like it&#x27;s you and me roach there&#x27;s no one else in this house you and you are the only two living things i would try to feed it i would make smoothies in the morning so i would try to feed it chunks of frozen smoothies i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;d ever ate it and you know it would go away it would do his business you know i would see it in the bathroom i&#x27;ll take a shower and i was very lonely and i was very scared at night and you know if you go to the front porch you would look up at the sky from my front porch and i could see all the stars anyway i was at night in a day i had so much fun best time of my life it was with another researcher there who lived somewhere else and she was studying clams and i was studying beetles and we would just have fun and we would talk about ufos and anyway scary stuff at night i was terrified i had trouble sleeping and i was scared one of these nights i received a phone call and i believe it was from two non-humans their voice was very strange it did not sound like a human voice it did not sound like a man&#x27;s voice it didn&#x27;t sound like a woman&#x27;s voice it did not sound like a foreign language so what i&#x27;m saying is their language was out of sync anyway they started laughing at me i got scared i i yelled at them and they hung up on me but i wish i could go back and i wish i could um i wish i could have been friends with them i wish i could have invited them over if i could do it again i would have been like hey guys i&#x27;m so glad you called me i feel honored uh come over i got some beers i got some smoothies there&#x27;s a roach here uh you know that the kind you smoke there&#x27;s a literal roach here let&#x27;s have let&#x27;s have some fun the other thing if i&#x27;m going to assume that they were actually they were well according to this they were not extraterrestrials they&#x27;re interdimensional beings but if i&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re interdimensional beings i believe they were observing me i had been in the research station for a while a ufo had been spotted in that area while i was there i believe they were observing me they must have saw me it&#x27;s kind of creepy they were looking at me while i was you know collecting beetles and they decided to call me it&#x27;s just like that bird you know that great blue heron there&#x27;s a great blue heron that follows me around when i go walk and he follows me to my house and he&#x27;s a great flyer and so a lot of times when i&#x27;m walking i i just assume i&#x27;m being washed a watch what am i from uh from wisconsin washed i assume i&#x27;m being watched by this bird there&#x27;s eyes in the sky and i don&#x27;t mind anyway that&#x27;s a little tangent but anyway uh technology similarly indecipherable financial transaction timeline or other futures oriented activity indicative advance for knowledge okay so he&#x27;s saying that yeah people are making financial moves interesting interesting what if i&#x27;m thinking about the lottery i&#x27;m thinking about back to the future too and biff tannen with the sports almanac i don&#x27;t know i&#x27;m just thinking what if some of these interdimensional time travelers are are um winning the lottery or they&#x27;re in cahoots with lottery winners i don&#x27;t know that seems even far-fetched for me but he&#x27;s saying yeah financial transactions or futures oriented activity i believe he&#x27;s talking about stocks bonds indicative of advanced foreign knowledge so he&#x27;s like people were organizations making a lot of money you know and it indicates that they knew what happens what happens in the future okay evidence for teleportation of individuals or materials over geographical distances appearance of humanoids in conformance with predictive genetic evolution of present-day homo sapiens etc this last one is tricky appearance of humanoids so he says humanoid so i don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s talking about humans he&#x27;s talking about human-like things in conformance with predictive genetic evolution oh okay i think i know what he&#x27;s saying so he&#x27;s saying that i think he&#x27;s talking about the grays here he&#x27;s saying that humanoids like grays they look like what we&#x27;re assuming genetically will have evolutionary will happen to us in the future so he&#x27;s saying that in the future we probably won&#x27;t need a lot of muscles we probably will need to talk our brains would be bigger so that&#x27;s what the grades are if i&#x27;m reading that correctly okay obviously in the above examples we have a health or sculpture montage of elements from much of the mythology of claimed ufo experiences where i consider we need to go with it is this to shift away from a strategy that relies solely on further on further content analysis toward what the intelligence world calls traffic analysis that is to first order that is to first order independent of content okay that is while not skewing the present strategies in place we incorporate into our studies in an aggressive and proactive way as we can muster more forensic work to expand our playing field and extract from the data and it and its and its surrounds more is this a typo or microsign more reading right here more forensic work to expand our playing field and extract from the data and its surrounding surrounds more of the patterns i think he means its surroundings you know i have typos in my research papers it&#x27;s no big deal and maybe it&#x27;s not a typo uh but anyway let&#x27;s just i&#x27;m gonna try i&#x27;m gonna i&#x27;m gonna um i&#x27;m gonna assume you mean surroundings let me read that statement and replace this word with surroundings more forensic work to expand our playing field and extract from the data and its surroundings more of the patterns and networks that appear to yoke the data together rather than just attending the data itself okay interesting so i think what he&#x27;s saying is like look let&#x27;s think big picture let&#x27;s not just look at the reports let&#x27;s not just look at the hair of bigfoot let&#x27;s not just look at uh i don&#x27;t know et cetera let&#x27;s look at stuff around it you know what&#x27;s the bigger picture let&#x27;s expand our scope to try to find patterns which makes sense to me i like it i like it okay let&#x27;s um so yeah that concludes this page i mean there&#x27;s a little more but i&#x27;m gonna go see count the votes and see what we think all right guys okay let&#x27;s catch up on comments yeah i think most people are saying continue for the next one okay that&#x27;s what nina says uh creature movie says yeah i better get something to eat and actually get some sleep yeah uh here&#x27;s one author is saying that we were talking about a few shows ago uh that you did so we so so much talk about this and that with ufos etc we need the scientific approach perfect paper is a reference for a research project yeah um did you name the cockroach wilson the castaway with tom hanks now i don&#x27;t even think i gave him a name for guy he&#x27;s beautiful i think he was like a light color maybe oh maybe oh maybe warren buffett is in cahoots fascinating okay guys well yeah the votes say we should continue so we&#x27;re about halfway done with that paper we will continue uh i know there&#x27;s a lag here so um uh i will continue this discussion on sunday although actually on sunday we&#x27;re going to be reviewing the new predator movie called pray with um bobby dizzle uh bobby dizzle podcast search for it subscribe bobby dizzle it will be his

it&#x27;s on youtube okay guys if you guys have to go i understand uh we&#x27;re gonna watch a real quick uh video about uh squid oh yeah this is a great video i&#x27;ve seen this before okay so this video is very cool actually this video is the craziest squid i&#x27;ve ever seen in my life uh it&#x27;s an unknown organism it&#x27;s a squid from the indian ocean it&#x27;s a cephalopod i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a squid but the way it moves it acts it&#x27;s like a ufo it&#x27;s wild but um yeah let me go ahead and show that video if you guys got to go no problem you always come back and watch this crazy squid video but it is it is a good squid video uh thank you for the link uh metal gaming okay so yeah i&#x27;m pulling it up right now guys uh so some context this is a really good video the reason why it&#x27;s high quality it&#x27;s a deep-sea video i believe it was shot by an oil company so the reason why there&#x27;s such good cameras here is because his oil company has these cameras deep sea to monitor their equipment not to catch really cool squid but they got lucky and they were able to shoot this amazing squid video uh but i&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re expensive their camera is very expensive it&#x27;s probably out of the reach of most of us maybe warren buffett can do it but not us okay and i&#x27;ll put the link to this in the description so you guys can watch it later [Music] okay okay pulling it up guys okay sorry about that unknown organism indian ocean [Music] underwater okay all right guys give me a little bit okay i got the video up okay let me just make sure the quality is high it&#x27;s about a minute and 18. so turn off the volume it&#x27;s about a minute and 18 seconds so oh yeah quality let me bump it up to hd okay okay okay guys here we go oh you guys can look it up yourself if you want very cool cool yeah it&#x27;s crazy everybody&#x27;s just talking about how crazy it looks yeah that&#x27;s a great great way to end so yeah okay
