            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is channel for educational purposes we survey and take deep Dives on um some of the theories of everything that you might have overlooked or never heard of before um things that you can hang your hat on things that you can uh you know stick your teeth into things that will if you study them they will reward you by giving you a coherent all-encompassing theory that you can you know base your decision making on you can base your kind of your internal Paradigm on and today is the 289th video that we have done on Dewey B Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory and Mr Larson lived in the 20th century he was an engineer uh he was uh trying to figure out an equation for the inter-atomic distance between uh different elements and um stumbled across a hypothesis of um what he should really plug into his equations and um that eventually led to him formulating his reciprocal system in his two fundamental postulates came out in the late 1950s and uh then he from there he used a process of induction and went from his fundamental postulates to the generalized um theory of of the universe of how um a model of the universe and then he wrote books on things like chemistry and astronomy and metaphysics and uh physics and psychology and religion and economics all based on the same Theory same set of postulates and the first and major postulate that Mr Larson put out basically states that we live in a universe made entirely out of motion not matter not energy but motion matter and energy are just two different varieties of motion in fact and along with really all of the other um scientific quantities that we know of including force and um electric charge like current magnetic flux susceptibility permeability permittivity capacitance resistance acceleration um these are all forms of motion and uh what kind of uh distinguished Larson&#x27;s Universe of motion was that he defined motion as the relationship between space and time that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time space and time are basically two the two elements that go into motion uh they do not have any real independent existence only together as motion and as two reciprocal aspects of motion so motion is basically a fraction or a ratio with chyme or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator with the caveats that space or time space and time are both they both have coordinate aspects meaning that they both can come in three dimensions and that space and time both have their scalar or progressing aspects meaning that a scalar a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no Direction such as a clock a clock is always getting later and later and later but in no particular direction and uh you can uh so a lot of those Larson Larson called that clock time clock space you can visualize using a balloon with dots on it you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but in no particular direction this is the progression of space or the flow of space all of the dots are moving away from each other that is clock space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and then the third General caveat is that space and time only come in discrete units they are quantized there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time below which you do not have space or time so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space and a corollary of that is that if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space and if you don&#x27;t have space then you only have time uh Larson calls this the time region similarly if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time then you don&#x27;t have time and if you don&#x27;t have time that means that you only have space and Larson refers to that as the space region and also if you have a full unit of space in a full unit of time space divided by time you have the speed of light which Larson refers to as unit speed one over one equals one the speed of light is the unit speed of the universe which basically means that it&#x27;s the midpoint or the null point or the origin or the central point or the zero point or The Ether of this universe and that there is half of the universe that is moving slower than the speed of light which Larson refers to as the material sector which contains the time region and um half of the universe that is actually moving faster than the speed of light which Larson refers to as the cosmic sector which includes the space region so we basically have three that third caveat sets up three separate boundaries in the reciprocal system unit time unit space and unit speed unit speed divides the universe in half and then unit time is a subset of the cosmic sector and unit space is a subset of the material sector or the unit space boundary which is what he calls the time region and so in the time the time region is the region inside a unit where the action occurs inside a unit of space this is for microscopic uh you know the unit of space is microscopic 4.56 times 10 to the minus 8 meters a very large compared to an atom but uh too small for us to see and that is the realm of the atomic and molecular world that is all occurring in the time region in the space region we have really the instantaneous the unit of time is 1.52 times 10 to the minus 16 seconds so anything less than that and you&#x27;re dealing in the space region um okay so so we we start with that so we&#x27;ve got these uh these three different boundaries set up here and when you cross the boundaries you basically the rules change you invert invert the general rules so in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and clock time progressing time time is always getting later and later and later but if you cross the boundary the unit speed boundary and you move into the cosmic sector you cross the speed of light and you start moving faster than the speed of light then the rolls of space and time uh invert and you all of a sudden have coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space space is now always getting farther and farther apart it&#x27;s progressing and so that shows how when you cross a boundary in the reciprocal system a unit boundary you the rules invert so Larson started with that along with the second postulate which basically uh indicates the math and geometry of the universe and has been subject to some dispute but um he then derived his entire theoretical Universe from that um and wrote many books and articles on the subject but then when Mr Larson died in 1990 and Left Behind the you know handful of followers some of whom were uh well-versed in the reciprocal system especially Dr KV k nehru a professor from India who started following up on the reciprocal system I think way back in the 1970s and uh has written many many articles on various aspects of the reciprocal system uh we are looking at uh one uh a paper that um Dr nehru wrote uh that is called um glimpses of a new paradigm and this is kind of um summary of you know some of the uh more easily explainable features of the reciprocal system uh we&#x27;ve done uh two episodes on that so far so this is the third episode so if you want to go back to the beginning of the paper go back a couple episodes and listen to those videos we are going to repeat one paragraph but then um go go on uh this this section of uh Dr nehru&#x27;s paper it&#x27;s called the Grand cycle of the universe we&#x27;ve already mentioned that quasars are the high greater than unit speed explosion products of aged galaxies when gravitation in space is attenuated by distance and becomes negligible the Quasar as a whole shifts from the region of less than unit speed conventional uh the conventional spatial reference frame to the region of greater than unit speed the three-dimensional temporal reference frame so that&#x27;s just what I was just talking about the Quasar is something that does cross that speed of light boundary and when it does the rules shift it shifts from being three-dimensional space to being in three-dimensional time and then in addition it also shifts from being in clock time to being in clock space gravitation ceases to act in space and starts acting in time this leaves the outward progression of space-time without check as there is no inward progression of gravitation in space and the constituents of the Quasar start flying out in space at unit speed that is the progression of space so once it goes into this um Cosmic sector instead of getting later and later and later in time now it is all of a sudden getting farther and farther and farther apart in space eventually the Quasar ceases to exist as a spatial Aggregate and disappears all together from the material sector in other words the atoms of the erstwhile Quasar emerge into the three-dimensional temporal reference frame of the cosmic sector at totally random locations so um you know basically it crosses over into the cosmic sector and then it basically you know disintegrates because it starts getting the different uh aspects of the Quasar start getting further and further and farther apart the corollary is that similar set of events occurs in the cosmic sector Cosmic atoms aggregate in three-dimensional time forming Cosmic stars and galaxies parts of which explode on attaining a size limit and eject Cosmic quasars which eventually exit the cosmic sector and end up entering the material sector since they come from a region not localized in space these incoming Cosmic atoms would be uniformly and isotropically distributed throughout the three-dimensional space again isotropic basically means uh it looks the same in all directions okay so these incoming Cosmic atoms would be uniformly and isotropically distributed throughout the three-dimensional space since the transfer occurs at the unit speed we ought to observe these particles at unit or near unit speed these of course are the observed cosmic ray primaries so the cosmic rays um that the scientists have observed are the result of cosmic quasars the reciprocal system traces out in detail how these Cosmic atoms being greater than unit speed structures in a less than unit speed environment promptly Decay ejecting speed and uh Cosmic Mass that is inverse mass or inverse speed also or energy and Cosmic Mass finally ending up as the most primitive structures of the material sector namely hydrogen um now I think Larson says that they actually end up being massless neutrons and then they would probably have to build up the hydrogen from there uh anyway there may be some dispute between them about that then the entire cycle of aggregation in space and eventual ejection begins in the long run as much matter comes from the cosmic sector as it leaves the material sector thus the Dual sector universe as a whole is in equilibrium and steady state while each sector continues to expand in space or in time as the case may be there is no necessity to assume the singularity of a big bang or to break any conservation laws as in continual creation okay so Larson&#x27;s Universe once it gets started is just a steady state uh things flow from the material to the cosmic sector and an equal balance is created by things that flow from the cosmic to the material sector so um when it flows out of the material sector to the cosmic sector it becomes new matter in the cosmic sector and then when it flows back to the material sector it becomes new matter in the material sector so the origin you know of matter in the material sector is the cosmic sector and vice versa now I&#x27;m not sure what I use the term new new is really referring to time and so maybe in the cosmic sector you would say close together matter instead of instead of new but anyway the next section here is called the solid state because of the fact that the minimum space that can occur in physical action is one of is one natural unit of space the Quantum of space if two atoms are made to approach each other they cannot come any nearer than one unit of space however by virtue of the reciprocal relation between space and time these atoms can accomplish the equivalent of moving inward in Space by actually moving outward in time okay so now he&#x27;s talking about a different boundary okay so when we&#x27;re talking about the quasars we&#x27;re talking about crossing over from the unit uh crossing over the unit speed boundary the speed of light the Quasar breaks through the speed of light and moves into the cosmic sector or the cosmic Quasar breaks through the inverse speed of light and into the material sector that&#x27;s one boundary of the universe where the rules change when you when you break through now we&#x27;re talking about the two in internal boundaries of each sector uh or one of each sector uh the time region and the space region the time region is the region of less than a unit of space and the space region is the is the unit uh is the area of less than unit time and so when you break through those boundaries you also have to invert the rules okay so because of the fact that the minimum space or unit space that can occur in physical action is one natural unit of space if two atoms are made to approach approach each other they cannot come any nearer than one unit of space however by virtue of the reciprocal relation between space and time these atoms can&#x27;t accomplish the equivalent of moving inward in Space by actually moving outward in time so they can&#x27;t move any closer in space because there is no space What less than one unit and you don&#x27;t have space then you&#x27;re actually in the in the time region and so the only thing that you can do is move outward in time which by the reciprocal relation is equivalent to moving inward in space and is seen by us as an inward Motion in space we do not see from our perspective in the material sector we do not see time we only see space we see time only as it affects space so like an example of that is like iron filings in a magnetic field uh the magnetic field is in time we do not see the magnetic field we only see the material uh iron filings the pattern that it forms in space so we don&#x27;t directly see the magnetic field we only see the effect that it has on space okay so the same thing is happening here within the time region uh once they get to an a minimum unit of space then they can no longer move in space because less than one unit of space does not exist at that point you only have time so the only thing that can happen is you move outward in time which is the equivalent of inward in space and so he says this they promptly do until a force or motion a force equilibrium is achieved giving rise to the solid state of matter so the solid state of matter is an equilibrium that is arrived at [Music] um inside the time region uh where you know the forces are all equal since less than one unit of space does not exist within the unit of space all motion could be in time only Larson therefore refers to the inside of unit space as the time region the space-time progression always acts away from Unity in the outside region away from Unity is also a way from zero but in the inside region away from Unity is always toward zero therefore the space-time progression is inward in the time region so when you&#x27;re within the time I mean so basically you have the space-time progression um and then its opposite is gravitation normally the space-time progression is moving everything farther and farther and farther apart um but and gravity is moving everything uh closer together again you can use your balloon with a DOT with dots on it you blow up the balloon that&#x27;s like the space-time regression you suck in the balloon that&#x27;s like gravitation but once you get into the time region the region inside a unit of space the rules reverse and now gravitation is actually moving things farther and farther apart while the progression is moving things closer and closer together outward in time when you are moving something outward in time it it is seen by us it and its equivalent is inward in space so in the outside region away from Unity is also away from zero but in the inside region away from Unity is toward zero that is the progression therefore the space-time progression is inward in the time region um it&#x27;s inward in space in the time region it&#x27;s equivalent but it is outward in time so um I would kind of revise that sentence but since gravitation always opposes space-time progression it acts outward in the time region um again I would say that that&#x27;s equivalence equivalent outward in the time region it it appears to act outward in the time region you know from our viewpoint okay uh further while the space-time progression is constant at unit value gravitation attenuates with distance meaning that you know the further apart you are the the less Force the less the force of gravity the two motions are the two forces that of the progression and of the space time and of uh gravitation therefore reach a stable equilibrium at some distance in the time region and produce the configuration of the solid state so this is the equilibrium that he was talking about between those two forces that creates uh the solid state Larson finds that a single theory of cohesion Atomic cohesion explains all kinds of bonds uh you know the different bonding between between atoms and molecules basing on Purely theoretical um computations he is able to calculate quantitatively the various Solid State properties of hundreds of elements and compounds accurately okay we will see that when we look at his book that is called basic properties of matter and uh he has a chapter in there called inter-atomic distances he has another chapter called distances and compounds this is where he takes his theory he takes his fundamental postulates and applies them through a process of deduction and comes up with a theoretical Universe from his theoretical Universe he calculates uh different um basic properties of matter such as the melting point the boiling point the inter-atomic distance the compressibility all of these different uh these different qualities uh properties of matter he calculates them strictly from Theory and then he Compares his calculation to the actual scientific tables that have been published about you know what is the boiling point of oxygen what is the boiling point or you know what is the boiling boiling point of um you know silicon carbon all of them and he predicts them and you know 90 plus percent of his predictions are within like one percent of the experimental value or whatever you know occasionally there are some a few glitches but usually he&#x27;s able to explain those um for one reason or another um it&#x27;s actually you know when you talk about you know bringing the receipts I mean he&#x27;s either fudging the numbers in a such a complex way that we don&#x27;t get it or I don&#x27;t get it at least or he&#x27;s he&#x27;s uh bringing the receipts because he&#x27;s he&#x27;s able to basically reproduce the scientific tables that have taken you know generation after generation to compile about the basic properties of matter and he&#x27;s able to do that basically off the top of his head so um you know strictly from Theory we will get into that when we do look at his book basic properties of matter okay now um the next section here is called new light on Quantum phenomena and uh nehru goes into quantum mechanics quite a bit here not not in this section but in a different article that maybe we will take a look at down the line but we will start with this uh section when we resume tomorrow um now uh for me just reading this was very uh revelatory um uh he he kind of just clicked clicked me in on a couple things and I&#x27;m definitely gonna go back and read this article again there&#x27;s a lot to this article you know a lot of times people you need the repetition people uh you know I could read Larson over and over and over and over again or I could read neru over and over and over again and it doesn&#x27;t it might not just hit the right way uh in the on my wavelength what I&#x27;m thinking about but then one time I&#x27;ll read it and it&#x27;s like oh that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying and uh I had a couple of those moments here just now reading this and so I&#x27;m excited for myself and I hope that some of you uh as well were able to click with some of this um and if you didn&#x27;t just repeat you know sleep on it for a day and repeat and it might click for you that time um it it doesn&#x27;t always happen like magic but when it does it&#x27;s very exciting because you you broke through a conceptual hurdle a lot of times our conceptual hurdles are related to the uh wrong think that we had plugged into us from our schooling and so on and uh our our faulty paradigms and so we got to clear those away and so sometimes um you know you have to be patient in uh you know you can&#x27;t just drop your old Paradigm until you have something to replace it so okay well uh hope you all have a great day and I hope you tune in tomorrow thanks</p>
