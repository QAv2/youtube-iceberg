            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald abuse ATS founder and chair of the International Society of unified science and president trans power corporation commercial custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company we have many many commercial software packages and we also write many custom programs I work as a theoretical physicist as well as a systems engineer and today I&#x27;m going to talk about the reciprocal system and so-called big history this is in response to a TED talk given by Professor David Christian you can see the link in the article I wrote back in January 30th 2013 I will be annotating this as I do with all my youtube videos Professor Christian is a fine professor and speaker we have his big history course from the teaching company before giving a critique based on the principles of reciprocal system let&#x27;s recognize that he and others such deep historians are making an excellent effort at attempting to integrate scientific knowledge from many different disciplines quite naturally they rely on mainstream conventional science and that&#x27;s where the problems begin so here we go number one in our view there was no Big Bang the notion that all the matter and energy in the universe are concentrated into an infinitesimal died at the beginning is quite absurd I mean obviously this violates every known physical law and principle however professor David Christian does say rather parenthetically that the universe begins with the creation of space and time and you certainly agree with him there that is our space-time universe came as as a result possibly of some non space-time units converting themselves to space-time units of course that&#x27;s speculation but that&#x27;s the best hypothesis we have in this invoice now number two the next threshold star formation notice that the big historians use the term threshold for their major transformations that occur of course professor Christian says that between stellar energy generation comes from the fusion of hydrogen where as we the supporters of the reciprocal system say that it comes from the fission of heavy elements in the core there is after all of gravitation segregation and all stars unbeknownst to our opponents in theoretical physics so the heavy elements are in the core nature&#x27;s he then follows the connection Alliance says that the heavy elements are formed from supernova explosions this we do not agree with heavy elements are formed all the time from lighter elements by the process of neutrino capture by gravitational segregation they settle eventually in the center of stars and that&#x27;s where vision begins the real source of stellar energy number 3 he goes on to discuss life which is of course another threshold and said that this involves an increasing complexity he states the first two laws of thermodynamics and then says that non-uniform energy flows are the cause of complexity actually according to the reciprocal system entropy overall universe does not increase or decrease the universe is cyclic and there is no heat so my group rejects the Big Bang and we reject this suppose that heat death at the end of the movers so our punished thing very linearly whereas my group the International sytem unified science believes that the universe the physical universe is cyclical also an elliptical system life forms from a combination material and cosmic in verse Adams with the cosmic atoms in control conventional biology does not explain the demarcation between life and non-life because the the conventional biologists only know of material atoms so so again here the reciprocal system understands the situation much better then the biologists or the physics or chemistry and now we get to the number four after biology discusses the evolution of man setting that man&#x27;s difference from other animals is an quote collective learning this is true but it&#x27;s an aspect of our ability to reason furthermore he does not discuss the ethical differences between men and animals we are supposed to follow the golden rule whereas animals cannot and certainly do not and the reason for this demarcation is that a rational ethical man has a component from the non-physical realm or the non space-time realm it&#x27;s like a metaphysical control unit or ethical control unit award but it&#x27;s so that&#x27;s what separates rational and ethical men from primitive no ethical matter so in sum we&#x27;re in favor of big history but we wish the historians would incorporate the principles of the reciprocal system rather than just rehashing the conventional rather logical use of quote modern physics that&#x27;s up for the future find out more about the reciprocal system of Theory obtain my book the end mysterious universe this is the simplest way to understand the system&#x27;s way $9.50 Man song calm or Transpower court calm once you&#x27;ve finished with that book you can get my work existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything this is thousands of pages long thousands of equation so it&#x27;s more for scientists engineers and professors and then when you&#x27;re finished with that you can get the computer software database and two modules the civil system micro cosmos database on which the process macro cosmos database so these will allow you to actually apply the reciprocal system to your daily problems and science or engineering and of course you guys go to my theoretical physics blog site www.assist.org</p>
