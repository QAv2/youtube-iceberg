            <p>look between the SpaceTime curve SpaceTime itself and the local vacuum that&#x27;s where the Symmetry is coming in whatever happens to it from SpaceTime is balanced by what the opposite being happen that stabiliz it hold it right there it&#x27;s in an equilibrium condition so yes this is the way you have to explain what you&#x27;re doing now how do you get that done scientifically you don&#x27;t have a lot of choices of people that can handle that kind of electrodynamics but you do have them they are available you got to be sure you&#x27;ve got a couple of them Terry Barrett myON Evans is out of it because myON has a a genetic problem he&#x27;s in whales right now anyway and he&#x27;s being taken care of but he&#x27;s one of the most Brilliant Minds on this planet so you could use him for Consulting purposes he also is a a chemical physicist he knows not only the physics and all this other stuff and all the higher symmetry electromagnetics he&#x27;s a founder of that but he also knows chemistry so he&#x27;d be an ideal consultant Terry Barrett can handle all this higher Symmetry electromagnetics and he can he can hang in there with all of this so you have to have people that know general relativity no unified field Theory where there&#x27;s a higher symmetry electromagnetics developed so that you can unify you can&#x27;t unify U1 electrodynamics with general relativity they diabolically opposed one says a flat the space time is flat the other one says no it ain&#x27;t it&#x27;s curve you can&#x27;t put put two things like that together they don&#x27;t fit so you know in country boy language that&#x27;s stupid to try to fit them they don&#x27;t fit and Nature&#x27;s unified nature doesn&#x27;t have it separated where they never get together and never operate at the same time that&#x27;s not true nature has them always operating so what you&#x27;re doing as far as I&#x27;m concerned is magnificent but you&#x27;re advancing chemistry out of a flat SpaceTime no vacuum interaction model into a nonavalent model where you have a curve space a unified field theory model where you have both a curve SpaceTime and you have an active vacuum interacting with that system itself with that chemical system itself with those molecules himself if you manipulate the charges baby and change the engine they using you can change what molecule they will form and be stable and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing can all be described with good theory it will not fit the chemical model in most of those chemist heads it never will cuz you&#x27;re not doing that you&#x27;re outside there model working it&#x27;s okay that&#x27;s what advancing science is calleda and in the scientific method we&#x27;re supposed to do precisely that if the experiments are replicable and done well if they continue to be replicated and give results that refute the present model all they&#x27;re telling us is we&#x27;ve got to change our model nature Works its way and not go model it this way that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re telling us that&#x27;s scientific method that&#x27;s the advance of science so that&#x27;s what ought to be done</p>
