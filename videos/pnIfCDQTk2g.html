            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>According to several different kinds of infrared LAR devices, there is a gigantic invisible sphere or bubble that is centered at the triangle and has a radius of about 2,000 ft. That means it covers a huge area of the ranch where we&#x27;ve encountered all kinds of phenomena like UAPs, a mysterious cloudy blob, and other anomalies in the air that we can only see with thermal cameras. And its boundaries have actually appeared to stop drones and rockets from entering it. Last year, before we knew about the bubble, we launched a rocket in this area where we had detected a strange radio frequency signal coming from somewhere up above the ranch. And on its way down, the rocket froze at a few hundred feet high for several seconds.</p>
<p>It looks like it&#x27;s stuck there. Look. Yeah. So, was that somehow related to the western boundary of the bubble?</p>
