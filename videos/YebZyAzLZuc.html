            <p>the jurogan experience the 2017 new york times article uh in my mind made that was a big shift because when the new york times is reporting about it and saying that this is major news and this is real and there&#x27;s video evidence that they can&#x27;t ignore when you talk to high-level people at the government and people like commander david fravor who had that infamous spotting off of the coast of san diego when you hear about people like that that are very reputable it starts to change the conversation in a lot of people&#x27;s eyes right it used to be that one person would see something in the sky and say look martha look there&#x27;s something up there now things have changed now we have multiple sightings by multiple modes that is the gold standard the gold standard for looking for these objects not just one person but several people that are reputable not just radar but visual sighting infrared sensors telescopic evidence now we have multiple sightings by multiple modes and so the burden of proof has shifted it used to be the burden of proof was on the people who believed in ufos they saw something prove it now the burden of proof has shifted to the pentagon to the military now they have to prove that these aren&#x27;t extraterrestrial and so i think there&#x27;s been a sea change a sea change in the last uh just several years you know 50 years ago there was a congressional hearing and it was coming out of project blue book and there was a lot of laughter and a lot of jokes about things little green men in outer space 50 years ago that&#x27;s the way it was now things have changed now people are looking at looking at are they a threat militarily what kinds of sensors do we have what kind of metrics do we have we now have frame by frame an analysis of these objects these objects travel between mach 5 and mach 20 that&#x27;s 20 times the speed of sound these objects can zigzag and we can measure the g-force inside the this object the g-forces are several hundred times the force of gravity in other words any living person&#x27;s bones would be crushed by these objects so they&#x27;re probably drones of some sort these objects can drop seventy thousand feet in a few seconds think about that it can drop a tremendous distance in just a few seconds and they can go underwater this is something that we didn&#x27;t realize before but yes they could actually go underwater and they also move without creating an exhaust or breaking the sound barrier so these are things that we can now document frame by frame looking at these videotapes so for yourself what was the shift and how did you feel about ufos say like 10 15 years ago well there is this giggle factor and it&#x27;s the third rail of course of your scientific reputation if you believe in these things but the evidence is accumulating over the last several years now when i was first approached by caroline corey the producer of this film a tear in the sky i was skeptical i said to myself come on i mean five days five days you&#x27;re going to look for flying saucers in the sky what happens if the aliens are camera shy and they don&#x27;t show up in five days so i was pleasantly surprised when they actually found something they actually have photographic evidence of objects that can gyrate just the way the pentagon has said and so we now have a sea change a center of gravity has changed with regards to looking at these objects we no longer simply look at one individual seeing something in the sky no we demand hours of videotape multiple sightings by multiple modes that&#x27;s the gold standard now so what do you think is happening do you think that this is something that maybe another government from another country has created that far surpasses our abilities or do you think that this is coming from somewhere else well the pentagon has listed i think five different options uh one option of course is that they&#x27;re weather balloons or something that&#x27;s an artifact of our space program maybe a piece of rocket that is is plunging back into the earth&#x27;s atmosphere uh that&#x27;s one category another category is anomalous weather events they happen and they have to be looked at very carefully but the last option the last option is other that is not just the russians or the chinese because these objects apparently can generate faster than what the chinese and the russians can muster but it opened the door to the possibility of other they didn&#x27;t specify what other was but you can fill in the dots yourself now one possibility for other is hypersonic drones we see that in warfare now the russians in the battle of ukraine is actually using hypersonic drones to hit targets inside ukraine to be hypersonic you have to go faster than mach 5 anything faster than five times the speed of sound is called hypersonic and so the russians are now fielding hypersonic drones in warfare but you see this is something just in the last few months these sightings they go back decades into the past with objects executing these gyrations decades ago and that&#x27;s why you have to take them seriously so the commander david fravor event that we talked about off the nimitz that was 2004. do we have an accurate understanding about military capability in terms of like drones and propulsion systems from 2004 or are there things that are classified that we are not going to have access to like is it possible that you know 18 years ago they had the capability to have a vehicle or a drone move this way that just that information has just not been released well two years ago the united states military admitted that it stopped working on these hypersonic drones why they&#x27;re unstable they zigzag and that&#x27;s why the russians have put a premium on this technology to evade our star wars program the russians wanted a rocket that can maneuver and therefore outwit a stationary star wars system designed to shoot down these drones right so that&#x27;s why the russians have put a priority on this and they&#x27;ve now fielding in warfare we actually see them as a military weapon two years ago the united states military stopped its program they&#x27;re too unstable they they were not reliable and it was not worth the amount of money to put into it because the military was invested in the star wars program not the anti-star wars program but because vladimir putin announced the hypersonic drones that the united states military said oops nope we have to get into the game too so now the united states is also working on hypersonic drones as well as the chinese so the chinese the russians and americans are all working on these things but you can see how primitive they are we&#x27;re talking about objects that define the known laws of aerodynamics with the technology beyond what we have today and so that&#x27;s why people are scratching their heads whose are these things if they&#x27;re not the chinese the russians or the united states so one of the main points of contention is the lack of visible propulsion method right there&#x27;s no it essentially there&#x27;s no heat signature there&#x27;s nothing that we understand to be present that normally exists when something is going at a tremendous rate of speed that&#x27;s right not only that these objects create no sonic booms when you exceed the sound barrier uh you create a gigantic boom that is then shatters windows and can be heard miles around these objects can effortlessly break the sound barrier and not create a sonic boom and they don&#x27;t create any exhaust we don&#x27;t see any exhaust trail from these objects so either they&#x27;re an optical illusion of some sort or they have a set of laws of physics beyond what we what we can muster now if they are a optical illusion if an object were to move in front of your eyes traveling at a very slow velocity but you don&#x27;t know how far they are away you may think that object is very far away from you traveling at enormous velocities so a weather balloon drifting in front of your eyes can simulate an object traveling at hypersonic velocities if you think that weather balloon is far away from you so how do you tell the difference well you look at wind patterns it turns out that many of these sightings these objects defy the direction of the wind if they are weather balloons that you confuse with a flying saucer then they would be moving with the direction of the wind but these objects do not do that these objects can go against the direction of the wind not only that but we have multiple sidings if an object is very very far away and if an object is close to you but you think it&#x27;s far away then it then is traveling at an enormous velocity while it&#x27;s actually just drifting in front of your eyes how do you tell the difference by having multiple sensors radar infrared sensors visual sighting then you can tell how far this object is away from you and then you can say that no it&#x27;s an optical illusion well we do that now we have multiple sightings of these objects by radar we know how the velocity the distance each time it comes out to be real and so that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re scratching our heads who has this capability and the answer is we don&#x27;t know is there anything that&#x27;s theoretical that you&#x27;re aware of that could be applied like some from some other planet or some other galaxy or whatever that something that maybe we have theorized that could be responsible for the way these things are able to move well you know when i talk to my friends who are physicists like myself about these things they sort of like laugh giggle their eyes roll up to the heavens and they say something very simple that a rocket using conventional means would take seventy thousand years to reach us from the nearest star therefore these objects cannot exist seventy 000 years for a saturn rocket traveling at 25 000 miles per hour to go from a nearest star to the planet earth that&#x27;s why most scientists disregard these sightings because they defy the laws of einstein but isn&#x27;t that kind of silly isn&#x27;t that kind of like saying like you can&#x27;t you know how long it would take you to get a horse from los angeles to sydney australia isn&#x27;t that kind of like saying that exactly and that&#x27;s why i say that that assumes that these aliens or whatever are maybe a hundred years more advanced than us but open your mind to the possibility that they are a thousand years more advanced than us a thousand years is nothing compared to the age of the universe right the universe is about 13 uh 13 billion plus years old that&#x27;s how the age of the universe and so the age of a civilization just a few thousand years ahead of us that is just a blink of an eye to the universe itself and once you go to higher energies the laws of physics begin to break down the laws of einstein and the laws of the quantum theory break down as something called the planck energy why is that important that&#x27;s what i do for a living i work on something called string theory which lives at the planck energy the plunk energy is 10 to the 19 billion electron volts that is a quadrillion times more powerful than our most powerful atom smasher outside geneva switzerland any civilization that can harness the planck energy would be able to become masters of space and time space and time as we know it become unstable at the planck energy which is far beyond anything that we can muster here on the planet earth so we physicists theorize how advanced do you have to be to access the planck energy well we rank them the kardashev scale says that there could be type 1 type 2 or type 3 civilizations a type 1 civilization is maybe 100 years more advanced than us to maybe a thousand years sort of like buck rogers or flash gordon they control the weather volcanoes earthquakes anything planetary they control that&#x27;s type one then this type 2 type 2 is stellar they harness the power of an entire star like star trek star trek would be a typical type 2 civilization where they manipulate entire stars then there&#x27;s type three type three is galactic they roam the galactic space lanes they play with black holes like like uh the empire of the star wars series would be a typical type 3 civilization then the next question is what type do you have to be to harness the planck energy the energy at which space and time become unstable where wormholes may develop gateways through space and time portals through empty space you have to be type 2 or most likely type 3. then the next question is how long will it take before you become type 3 well we are maybe a hundred years away from being type one we&#x27;re maybe a few thousand years from being from type two and we&#x27;re maybe a hundred thousand years being from being type three and a hundred thousand years is nothing nothing on a galactic scale the age of the universe is as i said over 13 billion years old and so once a civilization reaches the planck energy that is a type 3 civilization space and time become your playground</p>
