            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] like when they first like you&#x27;re driving and then um I think she just like hey man how&#x27;s my driving and he&#x27;s like I think we&#x27;re parked man because it&#x27;s like just all hot boxed yeah it&#x27;s like what happened here oh but I&#x27;m ready let&#x27;s I&#x27;m so excited this is the season one finale oh my God ladies and gentlemen you have come across the journey with us and we thank you for that you you&#x27;ve been with us in the beginning of Roswell there is so much [ __ ] so much [ __ ] through Project Blue Book [ __ ] Majestic 12. 12 [ __ ] through Kennedy [ __ ] NASA [ __ ] NASA we made it through the Forbidden Dome forbidden oh you did make it through the we made it through that all the way up through Bob Lazar oh whiskey Bob Bob who worked with aliens and well he didn&#x27;t work with aliens reverse engineered technology yes yes and he was a pimp at the honeysuckle with the honeysuckle you loved it sounds it straight outside oh you ain&#x27;t getting sucked off better at Groom Lake by any other place nope eat on the Janet flight to literally and on the big blue bus big blue bus and then next thing you know you&#x27;re with Janet yes um it&#x27;s a real jamming and then and then we learned uh that the New York Times wrote an article it said that the [ __ ] government was like guess what we think they&#x27;re legit now yeah and uh we took 22 million of your tax dollars uh through black budgets and we created a secret program called atep yes run by Olu Lou Elizondo and they did all that investigating and and whatnot and we left that episode with hey what if this is all kind of [ __ ] this whole article is just sort of [ __ ] sort of um and then you tuned in the following week and we [ __ ] played the old Switcheroo we talked about skin walker Ranch we [ __ ] did the switcheroo oh and talk about skin walker Ranch and then everybody was like when the dino beavers no Beaver it&#x27;s a real I told you we looked it up after the show they did and Dino beavers I know there yeah Dino beavers yeah yeah and um if you go back to that episode you can hear about the dino beavers it&#x27;s just the last one and uh look up the notes there&#x27;ll be a link about the dino members in them in the show notes um yeah and then so here we are well I guess the question is then where do we go from here I don&#x27;t know so many places well we left everybody on a cliffhanger about that [ __ ] article yes yes we need to clear that up we need to clear that up well the government did take 22 million dollars and they really did put it into a black program a black budget program black file to study UFOs but it wasn&#x27;t called atip what was it it was actually called [Music] oh snap oh snap awesome the advanced Aerospace weapon system applications program that is a mouthful [ __ ] mouthful uh and what they did but what&#x27;s even crazier is they did more than just look at UFOs what else did they look at ghosts ooh fun paranormal Dino beavers Mothman Mothman oh I love the Mothman lizard people Shadow Man Richard Gere Richard do you see that movie Oh I thought you were listening in the Mothman Prophecies yeah yeah I thought this was gonna go a different way and I was waiting for like a uh like a gerbil to get brought up or something oh no because didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t he that was the rumor yeah is that true I don&#x27;t know who anything&#x27;s possible that&#x27;s true that&#x27;s true foreign [Laughter] so there was this awesome program right and uh and it was shocker had nothing to do with Lou Elizondo no Lou no Lou so like first off it&#x27;s like wait what yeah had nothing to do with that so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s go back okay there&#x27;s a reason there&#x27;s a reason that we made people wait an entire week to find out what the [ __ ] is going on with this New York Times article and why it&#x27;s [ __ ] and why we had to interject a little bit of skin walker Ranch into it and the reason is there&#x27;s a couple reasons actually because we had to learn who Robert Bigelow was yeah you know the billionaire who ran bass and nids and investigated that bought it up bought it up and then we learned about our dear friend uh George Knapp great investigative journalist George Knapp and how he wrote a book about Skinwalker Ranch and that&#x27;s where things get a little interesting because while we think well we thought 22 million atip UFOs the military yeah what really happened was and this is where [ __ ] gets strange oh so George Knapp writes this book right this is about the Skinwalker Ranch and then there&#x27;s this guy okay uh his name Dr lakotsky lakotsky lakotsky yeah okay Dr lakotsky okay uh [Music] James lakotsky James lacroski a career intelligence analyst and rocket scientist he spent much of his career uh working for the defense warning office within the DIA that sounds intense yeah that sounds important yeah like you need a guy in there you can trust yeah career intelligence analyst and rocket scientist damn like like you can&#x27;t even be like oh what do you think you&#x27;re some kind of rocket scientist he can be like yeah I am yeah yeah yeah winner Fisherman&#x27;s Platter you you&#x27;ve just won the Fisherman&#x27;s Platter so so this guy right is James Dr James I&#x27;m [ __ ] his name sounds like some detective lakotsky you badging your gun on my desk you imagine your gun on my desk so lakatsuki um this is where [ __ ] gets a little you gotta follow some of these lines okay I&#x27;m trying so lakotsky happens to be friends with George Knapp oh my oh my oh my well he reads this book about skin walking around the ranch and he says is this for real like because this could be like if this is like legitimate this could be a problem yeah like we should be someone should pay attention to this and and so he&#x27;s like he asked George nap because he knew George Knapp knew Robert Bigelow yes if he could arrange does Robert Bigelow kept that place on lockdown right like he didn&#x27;t let he didn&#x27;t even let does anybody come in there and start looking for [ __ ] no like nids was in there he was the uh that group that he put together with all the smart scientists to study the place but like it was not open to the public not like now that that new [ __ ] owner Brandon fugel Brendan Brendan Frugal he with his stupid Netflix hold on we&#x27;re gonna stop this music well I told you last time like it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like if you watch like a documentary you know on uh on like something great like a history history of the world or something right and then you watch like a Saturday Night Live skit of like Cleopatra that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the difference between like legitimate Skinwalker and then what this [ __ ] guy&#x27;s doing okay it&#x27;s just go watch the show on Netflix and try to take it seriously you can&#x27;t a little dramatized yeah and like I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s a whole series on on YouTube from the New York Post which [ __ ] [ __ ] New York Post but but he does some interesting he does some interesting things and he goes out to Skinwalker Ranch currently and like calls them out on this stuff and it&#x27;s really funny he points out something that I thought was really strange he&#x27;s like and I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a connection but he tried to draw a line to like is all of this weird paranormal [ __ ] happening because every member of your team is a Mormon what yeah I don&#x27;t get it but he was trying to draw that line and I&#x27;m like that can&#x27;t no you&#x27;re stretching it&#x27;s just that just happened to be Mormon but I guess yeah that&#x27;s a weird thing I don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s a yeah I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a stretch yeah I wonder if Robert Bigelow was Mormon I have no idea oh I wonder if he was hold on what&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a good question was Robert Bigelow Mormon and the answer is I mean Utah there&#x27;s a lot of Mormons it&#x27;s a lot yeah yeah Mormon well it&#x27;s not not as according to his Wikipedia it&#x27;s not on there so okay but who knows maybe he is I don&#x27;t know that&#x27;d be weird but um anyways so this dude look at ski hey like catsky lukatsuki lakotsky read this like I said about this book bug George now said Georgian God I gotta check this place out now mind you at this point George had gone out to Skinwalker Ranch for the book and and they put him in a chair in the middle of nowhere at night and he sat there and nothing happened nothing he saw nothing happen all right so lakotsky goes out there and literally within minutes he&#x27;s experiencing [ __ ] really yeah he says he&#x27;s seen like orbs or black things he says he has an experience is how he describes it um so real real crazy right um yeah so he immediately is like there&#x27;s something to this okay so he goes back and he talks to his friend Senator Harry Reid readster this is all connected it&#x27;s so connected it&#x27;s all connected and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s crazy about all this stuff is the fact that if it was like one off here one off there one off here one off there yeah but like I mean it&#x27;s The Usual Suspects and they are all connected it&#x27;s too much of a coincidence it is too much of a coincidence called up Harry Reid and said you need to look into this right I&#x27;m here to read looks into this wherever it thinks yeah there&#x27;s something going on here and we need to be on top of it but it it wasn&#x27;t UFOs just in the military like that&#x27;s the thing right so and said okay right right up uh a proposal so lakotsky wrote up a proposal didn&#x27;t say anything about UFOs or aliens or anything left it completely out wrote The Proposal as if it was for a black budget fund operation for advanced Weaponry studying hmm hence the name it&#x27;s whether this is weapons yeah so the people so in the line item and when you read it in the bill there&#x27;s like oh it&#x27;s a good it&#x27;s a Department of Defense weapon thing they&#x27;re just studying some weapons they&#x27;re just that&#x27;s all they&#x27;re doing that&#x27;s it yeah I don&#x27;t know Dino beavers I mean come on like so so it&#x27;s kind of it&#x27;s kind of interesting because like you have this New York Times article and so when you learn the truth you have to ask yourself how do they get it so wrong like it&#x27;s really wrong um where would you say they&#x27;re most wrong uh I don&#x27;t know the whole well I&#x27;ll tell you where they&#x27;re right okay I can tell you where they&#x27;re right like the stories that they wrote in there about like the Tic Tac incident the gimbal video commander David fravor and all that those are right but like the fact that the 22 million dollars was to start ASAP or just our atip wrong wrong um it does sort of in the article say that like when it was started Lou Elizondo was not the director and then he became the director yeah but that was but that&#x27;s not either no because it was a whole different program like when ASAP was the mother program and then eventually it spawned off into a tip okay which Lou did sort of you know that he was that he ran that but it&#x27;s just interesting how like they left all of this out of that article that this whole thing this whole thing this whole thing is based on George Knapp&#x27;s book yeah off the Skinwalker Ranch book that was written about Skinwalker Ranch who at the time was owned by Robert Bigelow are we keeping up with all these names are we keeping track this is important because because we&#x27;re we&#x27;re gonna go another level deep oh no so so now we have an organization that has 22 million dollars and like most government things what what they did is they put out their place your bits place your bids they put out a call for bid and how it works is companies different companies can look at the proposal and they put in their bid and whoever bids the lowest while still maintaining what the goal is then they generally win right now this is like an advanced Aerospace weapon I mean you have people from the energy field you have weapons manufacturers I mean they&#x27;re all taking a look I mean you got like what you hit like you know Northland Grumman or whatever that is you have Lockheed Martin looking at this you know I&#x27;m sure you know space so you gotta have [ __ ] like Ula you know SpaceX maybe you would look at something like this you know there there&#x27;s all that [ __ ] walking penis blue origin Jeff Bezos could be looking at this it looks like his head lazy eye and all you ever noticed his lazy eye I try not to look at him it&#x27;s like um hold on I can&#x27;t make fun of Jeff Bezos while there&#x27;s serious music behind me I I can&#x27;t I read a thing that like a lot of his Engineers came forward and was like I wouldn&#x27;t ride on our Rockets oh my God also you know like have you seen the videos of like the different people that have gone up and they&#x27;re like William Shatner and [ __ ] yeah you know they gotta pay no yeah I didn&#x27;t know that charging them like a million dollars Oh I thought he was just like hey Shatner come take a ride nope Captain Kirk paid a million that was I felt so sad it [ __ ] him up walking him walking out of there and him trying to muster like the correct words to express how he was feeling in that great moment and then you have all these people popping champagne in the background oh and like it&#x27;s so sad well he was trying to yeah like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really interesting if you&#x27;re noticed in the video go look it up the uncut version you got to look at the the like raw video not the version that they they made into like a little TV show yeah it was they did some [ __ ] at crafty cutting little music well not even just music like The Cutting because like they completely cut out the part where like shattner&#x27;s trying to explain to Jeff Bezos about how it&#x27;s like the blackest he&#x27;s ever seen into the cold of of space it really messed them up like he kind of depressed him and he&#x27;s like he&#x27;s like everybody needs to see this and this is important and oh my God meanwhile Bezos is there with some hot chick trying to spray champagne everywhere yeah just like looking over what was that Captain Kirk yeah it does not even really giving him the time of day it was just it was so poor Captain Kirk&#x27;s just sitting there just like please put down the champagne and listen to me you know and bass was just like look at my eye and my bow I can&#x27;t get out of the harbor I know you&#x27;re about the boat into Harbor do you hear about that no he had a super yacht built right holy [ __ ] have you seen this thing no this [ __ ] boat has a boat and a helicopter his boat has a boat probably uh uh yacht so he had the [ __ ] this stupid ginormous super yacht built right and it&#x27;s so big that they can&#x27;t get it out of the shipyard to the ocean without dismantling some ancient Old Bridge what yeah and I guess it didn&#x27;t like happen but um so he&#x27;s landlocked I don&#x27;t know they eventually figured something out but uh there&#x27;s like a little picture of it Jesus Christ how many feet is that I don&#x27;t know Arkansas 127 meters in Christ it&#x27;s really big so 50 million dollar super yacht nothing says I don&#x27;t think I have a small dick like a super yacht the problem is you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s down or up you know what sucks though is like Jeff Bezos was like he started Amazon like as a hard-working guy you know yeah oh no he yeah like he didn&#x27;t want to spend money all he had was like a shitty Banner Over like head that said Amazon oh yeah I&#x27;ve seen that picture in his desk he didn&#x27;t want to buy it like spend money on a desk so he took his door off the hinges and put it over two saw horses and that&#x27;s still his desk like or that was until he left Amazon crazy wow but he became obsessed and jealous of Elon and started his literally got in shape that&#x27;s for sure India yeah you&#x27;ve really gotten shape he really was like Jesus dude yeah you&#x27;re not wrong you&#x27;re not wrong a complete transformation so you have to imagine how many different companies put in a bid to work on this thing I mean it&#x27;s 22 million free dollars yeah to help you develop cool things that means take a guess take a guess how many how many umpteen companies if you were to just throw I would say at least a dozen one one there it is the one at the door one one just one just one so obviously that one got it right now this wouldn&#x27;t be that strange this wouldn&#x27;t be that much of a like a coincidence or like a strange part of the story um if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that that one company [Music] was goddamn Robert Bigelow&#x27;s bass what Robert Bigelow Robert Bigelow so he [ __ ] put in a pit to be like well my company will study this [ __ ] like wait wait hold on hold on hold the [ __ ] on if I hope you&#x27;re keeping I hope people have a pad and a [ __ ] piece of paper and a pencil and [ __ ] and they&#x27;re writing down this how this goes so in case you&#x27;re not let me recap for you okay you got [ __ ] crazy skin walker Ranch you got UFO obsessed Robert Bigelow who creates a team called nids years before any of this [ __ ] happens and they study paranormal weird [ __ ] okay so he buys this Skinwalker Ranch [ __ ] studies weird paranormal [ __ ] in Skinwalker Ranch okay and then you got George Knapp who comes to Skinwalker Ranch with his friend Robert Bigelow and who is also friends with Senator Reed yes and he writes a [ __ ] book about Skinwalker Ranch well skin so that that book gets in the hands of like cats the catsky the catsky [ __ ] so it gets in the hands of the [ __ ] katsuki the book comes special delivery that sound effect is new for this episode so I&#x27;m really trying to get its mileage um so [ __ ] lakotsky gets the book by George Knapp who is friends with Robert Bigelow and also friends with Senator Harry Reid yes reads it and says there&#x27;s something going on here we should we offer some money we should study this we should offer some money and goes to [ __ ] Senator Reid and says hey what do you think oh that&#x27;s a good idea and then so [ __ ] he writes a proposal and submits it and only one company bids and gets it weird Robert [ __ ] Bigelow Robert [ __ ] Bigelow the guy who owns the place that the [ __ ] book is written about in the first [ __ ] place now mind you they didn&#x27;t just study Skinwalker Ranch as a part of awesome right they studied a lot of different things and actually one of the UFO things that they originally studied that came out and came to light was the Tic Tac issue okay so that actually came out of OSAP so when that video was released that was released through OSAP channels whereas the other two were released through through that [ __ ] Tom Delong oh yeah that guy yeah [Laughter] it&#x27;s like uh it&#x27;s like a hey Tom belongs here I just want to use that again anyways uh so they did a lot of studying I studied a lot of [ __ ] uh and they they put together 11 separate databases of UAP or UFO cases from around the world in the United States alone they had all these massive massive databases right um several hundreds of different cases from all over the world and encountered different things that had physiological effects pathological effects medical effects and some of the medical effects apparently were quite quite serious really yeah uh it&#x27;s so it&#x27;s really interesting but like where are these files at where&#x27;s this database I I guess it probably because it probably made its way through atip a tip shut down made its way to the UAP Task Force if you&#x27;re keeping track this is the government entities you would pay task force just this year became the office of Arrow the all domain anonymously resolution office sorry anomaly anomaly anomaly anomaly resolution office all domain anomaly resolution office arrow and arrow is their own so again for those of you keeping track this is [ __ ] serious you can Google this and it&#x27;ll have a dot gov domain there there is an office within our government right now publicly admitting that their sole purpose is to figure out what the [ __ ] these things are to figure out what the [ __ ] these things are and to look at UFOs we you our tax money is literally paying for this so for those of you who are listening to this or probably more so the people that aren&#x27;t listening to this [Music] that you know are like I don&#x27;t believe in [ __ ] UFOs well listen the government does the government does and they&#x27;re spending your money to study them yes literally your tax dollars at work so like like the stigma needs to go away right because I mean [Music] I just wish we had a little more progress [Music] floorboards [Music] so they I mean it&#x27;s kind of crazy uh the different things that that ASAP actually did I guess one of the things is they proposed that there&#x27;s an infectious agent model for the transmission of anomalies from person to person is that [ __ ] zombies no damn it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s ghosts uh okay basically ghosts what what they were proposed is and they a lot of us get back to Skinwalker Ranch they said that whatever the phenomenon was they called The Hitchhiker phenomena okay it would attach itself to you and follow you home and then [ __ ] with your family at home too and what a dick such a [ __ ] dick just like you know you&#x27;re like chilling at home and it&#x27;s like hey uh Skinwalker here who ordered the pizza in possession right uh extra sauce and extra screams uh right on bro you guys got some Tasties uh coming your way or uh do you like pineapple any pizza I only do in one condition and it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not really relevant because it&#x27;s one of those local pizza places so if you happen to be where we are there&#x27;s a place called Alfredo&#x27;s Pizza oh yeah and that good stuff their sauce has a little is a little spicy it is a little spicy spicy it&#x27;s got a little spice to it so my go-to is I do uh pepperoni um green olive for the salty and then a little pineapple a little sweetness a little sweetness and then they have the spicy and the salty just balances everything out it&#x27;s really good it&#x27;s a really good combo it&#x27;s like that uh did you see uh Tom hanks&#x27;s combo thing that he&#x27;s preaching his new drink no diet cocaine wait why yeah diet cocaine what Tank&#x27;s up to now he takes he went on he went on uh uh Corbin core bone core what&#x27;s his name Stephen Colbert Colbert yeah hello hello bear hello mother hello father um and he made some and they tried it what is it what is it mixing it&#x27;s Diet Coke okay and champagne whoa that&#x27;s quite the combo Diet Coke and champagne now huh yeah I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d do that the other combo that I saw uh recently was um Oreo this one&#x27;s gross Oreos and sour cream no I saw a couple people doing that on social media and I&#x27;m like I have no interest I don&#x27;t care how good you say it tastes I&#x27;m not trying it yeah it sounds awful it sounds disgusting I don&#x27;t even like sour cream really oh yeah I&#x27;m not a big milk person no it&#x27;s that&#x27;s it&#x27;s just a lot yeah I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s gross so these guys put this database together who knows what happened to it but after that that article it&#x27;s like did the article do good yes because it blew this [ __ ] wide open okay we wouldn&#x27;t have the office of Arrow public the other nice thing is this office of Arrow office has said that one of their main directives is to be very as transparent with the public as they can so there&#x27;s no more secret balloons no more yeah secret balloons nope so what they said they&#x27;re gonna do is they&#x27;re working on a system right now to be able to be as transparent as they can and show like their findings in like how the slide the process the science behind their findings which I think is a good start oh yeah I think it&#x27;s a good start I think it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s being ran like it is out of the DIA um is a part of that I&#x27;m really happy it&#x27;s not a part of the Air Force It was supposed they tried to be and they got circumvented the airports got kicked out because they were Air Force ladies and gentlemen [Laughter] uh uh I&#x27;m here to tell you that the people holding all the secrets are the [ __ ] Air Force oh yeah no they know lots of shoes in space force now too because space force is the Air Force for all intents and purposes yes and it&#x27;s some people still like make straight up make fun of space force and I&#x27;m like no it&#x27;s gonna be a really legit thing it&#x27;s already legit yeah I&#x27;m like it&#x27;s not a joke anymore it&#x27;s um I want to let you in on a secret um space force was not Trump&#x27;s idea oh really I&#x27;m here to tell you I&#x27;m here to tell you that space force was in the world the name might have been his [ __ ] idea okay it&#x27;s it&#x27;s fun he was like peaceful you know we gotta have a space for us you know and then he he it&#x27;s fantastic name he&#x27;s great he&#x27;s the best name space voice um but he like um uh I&#x27;m gonna say that thing was also the idea to rip off the Star Trek logo oh yeah I bet that was his idea too I saw something about that yeah did you ever see the logo did you see what it is like it it&#x27;s a straight up Star Trek logo rip-off yeah yeah no I love Star Trek you know just it&#x27;s a fantastic show it&#x27;s great it&#x27;s fantastic um I have the worst Trump uh it works it doesn&#x27;t work I don&#x27;t think it does even the bad ones work it works as hard as he did so um but yeah no it they they&#x27;re holding all the cards because do you know who&#x27;s [ __ ] a friend to the UFO movement and the thing is the Navy the Navy is like we don&#x27;t know what the [ __ ] is going on yeah but we want to know will they see them they see them they see them all over the place a lot um because they fly a lot of planes a lot of people think Navy ocean fun fact ladies and gentlemen the largest Air Force in the world is the United States Air Force do you know what the second largest Air Force in the world is the United States Navy that is true um and so but the Navy is like they&#x27;re like concerned right they&#x27;re like listen we&#x27;re almost hitting these things like we don&#x27;t [ __ ] we don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re aliens or you know we just need to know what they are how they&#x27;re flying they&#x27;re literally in our restricted airspace yeah and we don&#x27;t know how they got there we don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re from where they&#x27;re going and they&#x27;re doing Maneuvers that like defy physics we don&#x27;t have planes or drones or anything because that&#x27;s a big thing right drones drones are huge drones drones it&#x27;s drones drones drones here&#x27;s the problem very popular I can&#x27;t find a drone 60 [ __ ] miles without it like going somewhere yeah and these things are like these ocean you know these these [ __ ] battle Cruisers in the middle of the ocean you know 60 miles out from Coastline where are they launching from yeah Coastline you&#x27;re telling me this is gonna go 120 miles get the [ __ ] out of here hi I&#x27;m your clue take it like yeah like so um you&#x27;re an idiot if you think it&#x27;s [ __ ] drones that&#x27;s it&#x27;s just dumb the other thing is too you don&#x27;t think the [ __ ] that they can tell these pilots who we spend millions of dollars per pilot training them to be uh professional [ __ ] observers you tell me that with all the equipment and all the different Radars and scanners and sensors and just on the job training in all their experience they&#x27;re they they can&#x27;t tell the difference between a [ __ ] balloon and uh uh you know a seagull yeah and in a potential aircraft like what if what what last last I checked a drone also can&#x27;t go [ __ ] Mach 20. and stop on a dime yeah uh I I I have a drone license I have fly drones yeah I don&#x27;t know that much about drones well I can tell you one thing but it doesn&#x27;t sound like a drone could do that oh speaking of sound these things have none there there&#x27;s incidences where people are on these ships talk about standing on the [ __ ] deck and these things are so close that they could throw and hit it with a basement but they&#x27;re making no noise no noise and let me tell you what drones make noise fun story I was in Rhode Island one time and I was at a beach like uh Motel okay actually I think you&#x27;re laughing because you think of a different story than what I&#x27;m going to tell you okay but um I was staying in one of these places and I had a little uh DJI drone and these things if you&#x27;ve never been around a drone guys they&#x27;re loud they&#x27;re very loud they&#x27;re loud and they have a very specific sound and this is where this is funny because I it&#x27;s like a buzzing it&#x27;s a buzzing so I I&#x27;m standing outside you know it&#x27;s like a motel so there&#x27;s not like hallways right every door is to outside right so it&#x27;s just all the rooms and stuff outside and so I&#x27;m flying this thing in a guy I swear to God kicks open his door runs outside and goes holy [ __ ] be he thought my drone was a swarm of bees and he was allergic holy [ __ ] and so he thought there was a swarm of bees and he went he was running for his life he was running for his life and I&#x27;m just sitting there like do I chase him but yeah that&#x27;s a true story it buzzes like bees it sounds like bees yeah yeah oh my God in case you were wondering the story she was laughing at is a few years prior to that I also went out to Rhode Island um same place actually same place and uh I had a drone that I was up over the ocean filming some beautiful things it was it looked amazing it was nice I was live streaming it too injury and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m pretty because I don&#x27;t know 100 but I&#x27;m pretty sure there was a fisherman there who cast out and got his line caught in my rotor causing it to go straight down to the ocean and I never saw it again and now it disappeared it was gone I was sad but so I don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s a fun sad story a poor drone so Arrow exists today and they&#x27;re collecting hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of reports like guys it&#x27;s only getting more and more it&#x27;s getting more and more intense and people are demanding more and more answers it I mean there&#x27;s a yeah there&#x27;s a lot of things out there that you may think are more important you know I mean there&#x27;s famine there&#x27;s war there&#x27;s the Kardashians you know people are taking out their Buckle fat now what&#x27;s getting their Buckle fat sucked down what they&#x27;re sucking up the Buckle fat suck it out the book I&#x27;ve never heard of this it&#x27;s like the fact like right here like the king king in your face to jowls it&#x27;s in your face like on either side of your mouth and they&#x27;re getting it sucked out so you have like that sucked in you know like very defined that&#x27;s called The Buckle fat the Buckle fat I&#x27;m not gonna lie to you as you said that I imagined like a fat Texan with a huge belt buckle and like them taking it off and then like just lipoing behind where the belt is so the Buckle will like recede into the beer belly so it&#x27;s like flush flush so you don&#x27;t have the hangover you don&#x27;t have the hangover it&#x27;s flush yeah yeah that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s what I imagine when you said the Buckle suck in the Buckle I didn&#x27;t think face not once no but it&#x27;s the new fad face thing A lot of people are getting it done yeah so it&#x27;s [ __ ] like that it&#x27;s important you know so they say I mean and a lot of this is important right like I mean war is important we shouldn&#x27;t have it and you know poverty it&#x27;s very important people need to eat but I mean think about this let&#x27;s just say humor me for a minute let&#x27;s just say this stuff is real let&#x27;s just say that there are other life forms in the universe that are coming down and watching us think about what the implications of that mean I mean Beyond yourself right one we&#x27;re no longer alone two we&#x27;re definitely not the smartest creatures alive nope three what does this mean for religion good question four how much has the government known this whole time and have been straight up lying to us five is this where the microwave came from pretty sure came from somewhere came from somewhere there&#x27;s a lot of questions and we&#x27;re not here to really give you the answers but we&#x27;re here to help you think about the questions you know and it&#x27;s really important if if aliens were real and UFOs are real then this stuff is real this is the biggest news story in the history of the human race there is nothing bigger nothing and the alternative is boring it&#x27;s true but there is literally nothing bigger out there than this and that&#x27;s why it really boggles my mind when people dismiss this so easily and they&#x27;re like oh whatever it&#x27;s funny and like right now someone will listen to this and they&#x27;ll be like you know this is really moving and you got the music behind you and you&#x27;re I can hear the passion in your voice that&#x27;s all cute in games but you know [ __ ] whatever what&#x27;s going on RuPaul&#x27;s drag show tonight like like I I just ask you to take it just for 30 seconds is just serious and think about it think about the world think about how big the universe is think about how small we are we&#x27;re so tiny and in the grand scheme of things it&#x27;s pretty ignorant to think we are the only living smart thing out there it&#x27;s pretty ignorant it&#x27;s a pretty big world out there it&#x27;s an even bigger Universe ladies and gentlemen and we&#x27;re only scratching the surface barely begun a gun and we have some really really great stories coming up for you about how this phenomenon has affected people way more intensely than you or me I mean this has changed people&#x27;s lives it&#x27;s just rocked them for us it&#x27;s fun and games to think about aliens and signs and Men In Black and you know Fire in the Sky Fire in the Sky is different isn&#x27;t it What Men In Black and signs and Independence Day have that&#x27;s different is those are those are just made up stories those are just people telling fun stories Fire in the Sky is based on a gentleman named Travis Walton who had an encounter ladies and gentlemen one of the most intense encounters ever and we&#x27;re gonna get to them we have them scheduled well not him but we have his story scheduled that&#x27;s the one I&#x27;m looking forward to because that movie has one of the most terrifying alien abduction scenes yeah so to people like Travis Walton this is a [ __ ] serious thing you know so maybe when you&#x27;re just out and about you know you&#x27;re out partying or whatever and you&#x27;re
