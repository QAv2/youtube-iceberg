            <p>you see quantum mechanics is incomplete right because it doesn&#x27;t explain the collapse of the wave function the Shing equation is a a smooth continuous evolution of the state but it&#x27;s not what you get when you make a measurement when you make a measurement which are broadening the system a bit to include the measuring apparatus and all that why doesn&#x27;t it follow the Schrodinger equation and that worried Schrodinger very much and um it seems to me this is the is the gap that&#x27;s not present in all the other theories see all the other theories right up to the point even including the Shing equation or the evolution unitary evolution in quantum mechanics they are all things you could put on a computer so where is there something that you couldn&#x27;t maybe put on the computer and the argument I was making here is that it&#x27;s in the collapse of the wave function</p>
