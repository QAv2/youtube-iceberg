            <p>what about the double slit experiment that experiment is widely misunderstood this whole idea is the observer effect where if you&#x27;re not looking at it you get one result but if you look at it you get another result as though your Consciousness is affecting the experiment and Consciousness right now is not a fully understood construct so here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on we are illuminated by lights in this space the light is coming from the bulb reflecting off of you entering my retina going to my brain let&#x27;s say you were smaller let&#x27;s keep making you smaller and smaller smaller and smaller and smaller there is a size below which when I turn on that light you will absorb that light and jump to another state of existence but if you&#x27;re an electron I turn on the lights the photon hits the electron the electron jumps to a different state I cannot know what the electron is doing unless I illuminate it and if I illuminate it it&#x27;s doing something different from what it was before I illuminated and has nothing to do with Consciousness it has to do with interacting with the object in order to make a measurement</p>
