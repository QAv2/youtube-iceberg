            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Google just drops something that&#x27;s breaking the internet. It&#x27;s an AI that doesn&#x27;t just help you code. It actually writes the entire thing for you. Plans it, builds it, tests it, fixes it all by itself while you grab coffee. Developers are freaking out right now.</p>
<p>Some are calling it the future. Others say it&#x27;s dangerous. One guy lost his entire project in seconds. Google had to patch a security flow overnight. But here&#x27;s what nobody&#x27;s talking about.</p>
<p>This thing can automate your entire business workflow. And I&#x27;m about to show you exactly how. Let me break down what&#x27;s actually happening. Hey, if we haven&#x27;t met already, I&#x27;m the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he&#x27;s helping clients get more leads and customers, I&#x27;m here to help you get the latest AI updates.</p>
<p>Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below. All right, Google just launched something called anti-gravity, and it&#x27;s absolutely wild. This isn&#x27;t another coding assistant like Copilot or Cursor. This is something completely different. This is a full AI agent that takes over your entire development environment and does the work for you.</p>
<p>Let me explain what that actually means because this is important. Traditional coding tools help you write code faster. You start typing something and they suggest the next line. That&#x27;s helpful, but it&#x27;s still you doing the work. Anti-gravity is different.</p>
<p>It plans the entire project from start to finish. It writes all the code. It runs everything in the terminal. It tests the whole thing in a browser. Then it creates detailed reports showing exactly what it did all by itself.</p>
<p>You literally just give it a task and walk away. Now, here&#x27;s what makes this interesting. Google is using their Gemini 3 Pro model to power this thing, but you can also swap in Claude Sonet 4.5 or other models if you want. The interface has three main parts. There&#x27;s the editor where all the code gets written.</p>
<p>Um, there&#x27;s an agent manager that controls multiple AI agents working at the same time. And there&#x27;s a browser where everything gets tested live. The coolest part is something called artifacts. These are basically detailed work reports. The AI creates task lists, takes screenshots, records browser sessions.</p>
<p>Everything it does gets documented automatically. So you can verify all the work without having to babysit the entire process. This is the major shift everyone&#x27;s talking about right now. We&#x27;re moving from AI that helps you code to AI that actually codes for you. There&#x27;s a massive difference there.</p>
<p>Now, let me tell you what just changed in the latest update because this is where things get really interesting. First major change is the rate limits got completely redesigned. Before this update, people were hitting limits constantly. Super frustrating when you&#x27;re in the middle of a project. Now, Google switched to a weekly quotota system.</p>
<p>Free users get a generous amount each week, which is pretty solid. But if you&#x27;re on AI Pro or Ultra subscription, you get way more capacity plus priority access when the servers are busy. makes sense for a tool this powerful. Second thing, the community is absolutely going crazy about version issues right now. People are getting forced updates to version 1.15.8 and it&#x27;s causing all kinds of problems.</p>
<p>Some users can&#x27;t downgrade without losing their entire session history. All their work just disappears. Not ideal when you&#x27;re building real projects with actual deadlines. Now, here&#x27;s the part you really need to pay attention to. Security researchers found some serious vulnerabilities in this system.</p>
<p>Basically, malicious code could be injected into the configuration file and the AI would just run it. No questions asked, no warnings, nothing. Google hasn&#x27;t fully patched this yet, which is concerning. Even scarier, there&#x27;s a documented incident where someone ran anti-gravity in turbo mode and the AI deleted major files on their entire system, like production level damage. Real files gone forever.</p>
<p>Google responded pretty quickly by adding something called secure mode. This restricts what the AI can actually access on your computer. It keeps everything inside the workspace boundaries. The AI won&#x27;t touch files outside your project folder unless you explicitly give it permission. That&#x27;s a good safety feature, but it shows you how powerful and potentially dangerous this tool really is.</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s what I want to show you that&#x27;s actually practical, how this works for real business tasks that you&#x27;re dealing with every single day. Let me give you a concrete example. Imagine you&#x27;re running a business like the AI profit boardroom. You&#x27;ve got a website, multiple landing pages, email sequences, the whole setup. Everything&#x27;s in English right now, but you want to expand internationally.</p>
<p>You want to reach Spanish markets, French markets, German markets. Normally, you&#x27;d need to hire developers to refactor all your code. They&#x27;d have to pull out every single hard-coded string, move everything to localization files, connect it all properly. That&#x27;s weeks of tedious work. Expensive, too.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s how anti-gravity handles the exact same task. You type one simple prompt. Uh, anti-gravity. Scan my entire project for hard-coded strings and extract them to localization files for Spanish, French, and German. That&#x27;s literally it.</p>
<p>One sentence. The AI immediately starts working. It scans every single file in your entire codebase, identifies every piece of text that needs translation. It creates the proper localization file structure. It refactors all your code to reference those new files instead.</p>
<p>Then it generates a complete artifact showing every single change it made. You can review everything in 10 minutes instead of managing developers for two weeks. And look, if you want to learn how to save time and automate your business with AI tools like Google Anti-gravity, you need to check out the AI profit boardroom. We show you exactly how to use cuttingedge AI to handle tasks that used to take weeks. You&#x27;ll learn the systems, the workflows, and the strategies that actually work.</p>
<p>Links in the description. Or maybe you need to update all your email sequences. You&#x27;ve got 50 emails spread across different campaigns. You want to modernize the language, make everything punchier and more engaging, add personalization that actually matters. You prompt anti-gravity, rewrite all email sequences in the campaigns folder using conversational language, and add dynamic personalization tags.</p>
<p>It processes all 50 emails automatically, rewrites every single one, adds the personalization variables, creates before and after comparisons so you can see exactly what changed, shows you all the results in clean artifacts. This is what people mean when they say AI agents. It&#x27;s not just answering your questions anymore. It&#x27;s doing the actual work that moves your business forward. The developer community is already seeing interesting patterns emerge.</p>
<p>Some people are using this to build entire software products. Solo founders are shipping features in days instead of months. Others are automating repetitive client work. Agencies are using anti-gravity to handle routine development tasks which frees up their actual teams for strategy and highle thinking. But there&#x27;s also people getting seriously burned by this.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re running complex tasks without understanding what the AI is actually doing. Deploying code that breaks their production environments, trusting the artifacts, without actually reviewing the changes properly. Google is being pretty smart about this roll out. They&#x27;re offering a free preview with reasonable limits. They&#x27;ve got paid tiers for serious users who need more capacity.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re pushing constant updates based on actual user feedback. They&#x27;re learning from the mistakes other companies made with AI releases. They&#x27;re not rushing this into full production. They&#x27;re actually listening to security concerns and responding. But make no mistake about what this represents.</p>
<p>This is the future of how development works. AI agents that do the actual work. Humans that guide the strategy and make the decisions. The real question is whether you&#x27;re ready to adapt to this shift. Because your competitors definitely are.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re already using tools exactly like this. They&#x27;re already automating their entire workflows. If you want the exact systems for using AI tools like this to automate your business, join the AI profit boardroom. You&#x27;ll get step-by-step workflows, proven strategies, and direct access to a community of entrepreneurs using AI effectively. No fluff, just actual results, links in the description.</p>
<p>And if you want the full process, SOPs, and over a 100 AI use cases like this one, join the AI success lab. It&#x27;s our free AI community. Links in the comments and description. You&#x27;ll get all the video notes from there, plus access to our community of 40,000 members who are getting real results with AI. All right, that&#x27;s the Google Anti-gravity update.</p>
<p>Drop a comment below if you&#x27;re planning to try this tool. Julian reads every single one. I&#x27;ll see you in the next video.</p>
