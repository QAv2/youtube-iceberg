            <p>all right welcome back for another installment of rotating superconductors and gravity control and gravity impulses and all that good stuff i&#x27;m just going to quickly explain this new setup i have here so as in the last video i&#x27;m going to use the same rotating device [Music] and in here though i have a new not a new but a different uh i have the ybco super conducting puck and it&#x27;s a lot thicker it&#x27;s about a centimeter thick and about uh two inches diameter so i&#x27;m going to spin that up and go through a range of of speeds and watch for try and keep an eye on the rpm and what i&#x27;m going to do is just as it&#x27;s spinning up i&#x27;m going to place it underneath this setup here so this is a lot closer the test mass which is just some water in that little beaker down there is going to be a lot closer to the superconductor compared to the last experiment and according to some of those claims uh that indicate that there was some sort of a shielding effect from gravity or a slight reduction of up to two percent of the weight of anything above the rotating superconductor so yeah so this should be a lot more evident given its greater proximity so this beaker here is actually it&#x27;s sitting on this tray which is suspended just above this glass plate here which is about a centimeter thick or for those who prefer inches that&#x27;s about a half about a half an inch roughly a little under so this uh this charade here which is just uh was an ice cream bucket keeps any air currents away from this helps to shield it from any air currents and this coil here is kind of a makeshift rf coil and what i got going in here is this uh range of frequencies i have set from 1 to 10 megahertz and so it&#x27;s just going to keep sweeping through those frequencies so what&#x27;s what it&#x27;s displaying right now is uh 2 volts 4 volts peak to peak and what what i have my scope hooked up to is uh well there&#x27;s three conductors in these in this sleeve here this is household wiring uh so the scope is hooked up to one of these conductors in here so there&#x27;s kind of a straight you know ordinary transformer type action going on here so that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeing on the screen uh so it&#x27;s just being fed and the waveform is being fed in here from this signal generator so i&#x27;m not sure kind of what the rf power density is here in the center i&#x27;m not sure how to measure that or if i have the right equipment at the moment what i can tell you is that i&#x27;m feeding a 10 volt i believe it&#x27;s 10 volts peak to peak coming out of here going into this into this coil and now there&#x27;s a fair bit of guesswork going on here because i don&#x27;t have i don&#x27;t have specifications at the moment but what i was told by glenn robertson on the last apec conference was that apparently podconoff used a three megahertz rf field while he was rotating the superconductor so i&#x27;m gonna just that&#x27;s that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m scanning from 1 to 10 megahertz maybe i&#x27;ll hit a a resonant point and so uh like the last experiment what i have is this mechanical balance here this laser pointer is set up here to to indicate any slight change in weight down there or any forces that might be developed on that on that water down there and this is the laser point here and it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s quite sensitive the whole balance setup and i&#x27;ll have another camera on this when i do the experiment i just want to point out about this laser dot here it&#x27;s uh the camera&#x27;s not focusing very well so sorry about that but this is uh it&#x27;s right at 20 it&#x27;s reading 20 centimeters here or 30 centimeters here so it&#x27;s about in between 20 and 30. on the bottom here is just at the one inch mark of this over here so i&#x27;m going to now proceed with the experiment dum dee dee i might actually need some more let&#x27;s see if it&#x27;s super conducting here nope four need four oh i feel i feel the meissner thingy i feel the meisner effect coming on here but i want to show you skepta skepticis skepticians it&#x27;s super conductive okay so this will be hard to show on camera but uh these magnets here are floating i wish i had something non-ferrous see these magnets here see that there right there see the magnets are levitating okay so and much much better than that other disc i was using so yeah we are in super conductivity mode commencing with experiment commencement beginning now all right up to one volt on the motor two volts i&#x27;m going to take an rpm reading here 3 000 to 24 87 25 2600 rpm okay i&#x27;m going to shoot it up um 4 000 rpm try and get it up higher it is a little top heavy and i just nicked the glass plate there momentarily so okay speeding up four volts on the motor 4.3 volts 7 watts 4 600 rpm slowing down okay just a little bit more nitrogen here we&#x27;ll try this again quick test for i think it lost it got to cool it down again cooling down oh there it is lost its cool there for a moment probably gonna have to repeat this a couple times because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s tricky tricky to do this like all anti-gravity experiments or gravity experiments all right i&#x27;m feeling the magnetic repulsion here so it tells me it&#x27;s super conducting i&#x27;m going to give this another another shot here in three two one speeding up one volt on the motor accelerating accelerating now hard five volts on the motor i&#x27;m just going to hold it steady here because the rf field is changing too it&#x27;s uh going from 1 to 10 megahertz over a period of 120 seconds holding steady 5 volts on the motor which is uh 4 300 4800 rpm 4 900 rpm [Music] okay the rf just reset to one megahertz [Music] [Music] just holding it steady here under the beaker or under the glass plate i mean rf is still increasing i think my motor&#x27;s burning out okay in this test i have it set up to the same water being supported here on this digital scale okay and how much does it weigh weighs 84.64 grams okay ready to start rotation here okay starting at one megahertz spinning up here too um 3400 or 2280 rpm sorry 3256 rpm i don&#x27;t know if anything&#x27;s changing at the scale at the moment so i&#x27;m just holding everything steady here under the under the water and frequency is increasing soon it will reset soon let&#x27;s see if it&#x27;s still super conducting i actually don&#x27;t think it is let me add a bit more nitrogen 84.62 grams i&#x27;m going to turn the sweep off here and just dial it into three megahertz so showing uh good signal there three megahertz super conducting let&#x27;s give her um scale turned off better turn that back on okay here we go 3.4 volts on the motor 3 megahertz rf rpm is 3450 or 3500 i mean 36.48 37 32 37 31 speed it up a bit more here it would go faster if there wasn&#x27;t vibration 4067 just under 4 100 rpm and now i&#x27;m going to cut it down shut it off here already see if we&#x27;re still super conducting super conducting anymore here&#x27;s a little bonus feature it&#x27;s just a weak ceramic disc magnet it&#x27;s levitating quite well here actually</p>
