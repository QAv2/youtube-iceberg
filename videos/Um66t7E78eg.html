            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Former US national security official Matthew Brown describes but does not provide several videos that he says were gathered by the program called Immaculate Constellation. Brown claims that one video in particular stood out to him. He says he saw video of a UFO that looked like a large disc flying over what appears to be an ocean. Jeremy, first of all, did you see these videos yourself or is he just describing them to you? Actually, very interesting. A lot of people have seen these videos within the intelligence community.</p>
<p>You have to remember that Matthew Brown is a whistleblower and he&#x27;s talking about IM Con, immaculate constellation, which is the first thing that he got exposed to. However, I can tell you that with my investigations with George Knap over the last decade, we&#x27;ve been exposed to a lot of military film footage where we have seen some of the footage that Matthew describes. Matthew Brown was exposed to the reality of UAP in official capacity. He was also directly exposed to elements of UAP cover up including even to Congress. He is a firsthand direct whistleblower to these facts.</p>
<p>He did pre-publication. He testified behind closed doors. He has done everything right. He is exemplary. He is a patriot.</p>
