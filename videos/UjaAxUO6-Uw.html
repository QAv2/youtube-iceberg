            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger is one of the founders of quantum mechanics, but he&#x27;s most famous for something he never actually did: a thought experiment involving a cat. He imagined taking a cat and placing it in a sealed box with a device that had a 50% chance</p>
<p>of killing the cat in the next hour. At the end of that hour, he asked, &quot;What is the state of the cat?&quot; Common sense suggests that the cat is either alive or dead, but Schrödinger pointed out that according to quantum physics, at the instant before the box is opened,</p>
<p>the cat is equal parts alive and dead, at the same time. It&#x27;s only when the box is opened that we see a single definite state. Until then, the cat is  a blur of probability, half one thing and half the other.</p>
<p>This seems absurd,  which was Schrödinger&#x27;s point. He found quantum physics so  philosophically disturbing, that he abandoned the theory he had helped make and turned to writing about biology.</p>
<p>As absurd as it may seem, though, Schrödinger&#x27;s cat is very real. In fact, it&#x27;s essential. If it weren&#x27;t possible for quantum objects to be in two states at once, the computer you&#x27;re using to watch this</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t exist. The quantum phenomenon of  superposition is a consequence of the dual particle and wave nature of everything. In order for an object to have</p>
<p>a wavelength, it must extend over some region of space, which means it occupies many positions at the same time. The wavelength of an object limited to a small region of space can&#x27;t be perfectly defined, though. So it exists in many different wavelengths</p>
<p>at the same time. We don&#x27;t see these wave properties for everyday objects because the wavelength decreases as the momentum increases. And a cat is relatively big and heavy.</p>
<p>If we took a single atom and blew it up to the size of the Solar System, the wavelength of a cat  running from a physicist would be as small as an atom  within that Solar System. That&#x27;s far too small to detect, so we&#x27;ll</p>
<p>never see wave behavior from a cat. A tiny particle, like an electron, though, can show dramatic evidence of its dual nature. If we shoot electrons one at a time at a set of two narrow slits cut in a barrier, each electron on the far side is detected</p>
<p>at a single place at a specific instant, like a particle. But if you repeat this  experiment many times, keeping track of all the  individual detections, you&#x27;ll see them trace out a pattern that&#x27;s characteristic of wave behavior: a set of stripes - regions with many</p>
<p>electrons separated by regions where there are none at all. Block one of the slits  and the stripes go away. This shows that the pattern is a result of</p>
<p>each electron going through both slits at the same time. A single electron isn&#x27;t choosing  to go left or right but left and right simultaneously. This superposition of states also leads to modern technology.</p>
<p>An electron near the nucleus of an atom exists in a spread out, wave-like orbit. Bring two atoms close together, and the electrons don&#x27;t need to  choose just one atom but are shared between them. This is how some chemical bonds form.</p>
<p>An electron in a molecule isn&#x27;t on just atom A or atom B, but A+ B. As you add more atoms, the electrons spread out more, shared between vast numbers of atoms at the same time.</p>
<p>The electrons in a solid aren&#x27;t  bound to a particular atom but shared among all of them, extending over a large range of space. This gigantic superposition of states determines the ways electrons move through the material, whether it&#x27;s a conductor or an insulator</p>
<p>or a semiconductor. Understanding how electrons are shared among atoms allows us to precisely control the properties of semiconductor materials, like silicon. Combining different semiconductors</p>
<p>in the right way allows us to make transistors  on a tiny scale, millions on a single computer chip. Those chips and their spread out electrons power the computer you&#x27;re using to watch this video. An old joke says that the Internet </p>
<p>exists to allow the sharing of cat videos. At a very deep level, though, the Internet owes its existance to an Austrian physicist and his imaginary cat.</p>
