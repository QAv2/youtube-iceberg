            <p>Luis alzando is at the center of another controversy and in today&#x27;s video we&#x27;re going to be jumping in on that because the controversy is did Luis alzando run a program called atip right or ASAP and in today&#x27;s video we&#x27;re going to look at what is atip and what is ASAP and some of the comments from the community about this because Eric Davis just posted on Facebook some quite controversial comments about Luis Alando and his involvement with this Pentagon run UFO program so let&#x27;s jump in y&#x27;all now before we begin let&#x27;s explain what atip and ASAP is atip is the advanced Aerospace threat identification program ASAP is Advanced Aerospace weapon systems applications program there we go now that we have that figured out now we can move forward when you know those are mentioned let&#x27;s go over everyone&#x27;s different comments about Lou alzando and his connection to both of these programs let&#x27;s start with Eric Davis Lou never worked for the atim nickname assap actual name he was also not in a support role to the DIA program manager Jim latsky j Stratton did Provide support to latky while Lou provided some support to the uaf when Jay was its director then Eric Davis is asked so is he lying or just embellishing Eric Davis embellishing I will be talking to Lou next week to clear up what role he had post oap and preap and during the uaf laty was the DIA program manager for the oap whose nickname was atip Lou confirmed to me that he was not involved Lou apparently had his own a tip but has to clarify to me next week what that program was doing and how he came to call it a tip and no my Facebook profile timeline and feed have not been hacked become informed by reading L new book in which my name appears many times become informed by reading skinwalkers at the Pentagon by kellerer and nap in which my name appears several times then become informed by reading J stratton&#x27;s forthcoming book I&#x27;m not sure how many times he mentions me because I haven&#x27;t asked him and separately take note of the letter that Senator Reed once wrote wherein he named Lou in the context of the atip then report back to all of us in this Facebook group on whether you can keep the opposing claims made about L&#x27;s role in a tip by these books straight because he addressed it in his new book Harry Reid addressed it in his letter and Jay Stratton addresses it to set the record straight in his forthcoming book i&#x27; forgotten whether kellerer and naps book even mentioned Lou and what he did at the o usdi i I had no interactions with Lou during the oap atip O usdi is a policy office not an intelligence agency therefore Lou&#x27;s role with uaps is murky only because he was back then a Counter Intelligence and security official and I really have no idea what role the UAP topic had in his portfolio even though how put off and I communicated with him after the oap and before the uaf estimation after Lou resigned from his in late 2017 the good news is that Lou and I will be having a conversation about my confusion next week so he can give me more info that he says I&#x27;m not aware of per his version of the atip at o usdi one more note Travis Taylor told viewers in an episode he didn&#x27;t say which season and episode number that he was referring to of Ancient Aliens on the History Channel that Lou didn&#x27;t run any a tip follow on to the AAP which is what J Stratton is going to say in his book this doesn&#x27;t make Lou a liar this means that there&#x27;s a fundamental misunderstanding and a fundamental disagreement over what over this means that there&#x27;s a fundamental misunderstanding and a fundamental disagreement over whether Lou ran a follow-on a tip the real Liars in frauds grifters felons loons are Dan burish Bob Lazar Ed fou Richard boand Dr Steven Greer Ral Tim Cooper Etc and remember this bit of Eric Davis talking with Steven Green Street this is what he said about Lou back then when they came out and said that Luis elzando had nothing to do with atip whatsoever the Pentagon said this that was a horrible wrong piece of public relations that was absolutely incorrect they did not know what they were talking about my boss went to report to Lou at the Pentagon in the O usdi offices during the atip era so that&#x27;s you know who my boss is Hal put off right Dr Hal put off now of course Eric Davis is saying all kinds of things right he&#x27;s a little bit all over the place with this if I&#x27;m being honest um I don&#x27;t know what to make of it so let me know in the comments what you think now let&#x27;s move to what John Greenwall Jr has said about this from The Black Vault I have zero idea what to make of this and won&#x27;t use it in my personal research for squat I&#x27;ve personally seen Dr Eric Davis relay factually wrong and provably false information to Facebook groups about declassification processes and Foya firsthand that said I find it hilarious that the same people who have long trashed Davis for various reasons are now rolling this out as irrefutable proof of something because it confirms their doubts about Lando for me it does nothing but again it&#x27;s hilarious to see what it does for others in other words tread carefully with what everyone says something ain&#x27;t right he has been looking into this and I&#x27;m going to put a link in the description to a live stream he did really diving deep about all of this and all of his foyer connections and documents it&#x27;s a whole another level to this so please please check that out and here&#x27;s a short clip from that stream anyway that&#x27;s the uh the oap a tip thing going back to atip to Lis Alando this was different this was something that operated out of O usdi this was separate from the original oap contract this was something that he wanted to pass to Neil Tipton and again this memo would essentially make Tipton&#x27;s desk the central point for all things UAP and UFO related that is if I think it was Patrick Shanahan uh then de se def at the time would issue that memo there&#x27;s no evidence that the memo was issued obviously or you know we&#x27;d be having a different conversation at this point now let&#x27;s move to James latsky what has latsky said about all of this in response latky told newsnation I was the sole program manager for the complete duration of Dia&#x27;s oap September 2008 to December 2010 and worked along alongside DHS in the followon Kona Blue program through 2011 Lou alzando was not involved in either oap or kona blue but what&#x27;s unusual is Lansky has said other things in the past especially on the weaponized podcast that&#x27;s where the name atip came from atip was something that was necessary to be uh proceeded with on Military cas Lou handled that I was not privileged because it was mainly spun up as I was getting ready to retire I will say this though that when I left all of our reference so we&#x27;ve heard from Eric Davis John Greenwall Jr James latky now let&#x27;s hear from Jeremy Corbell what does he have to say about this I&#x27;ve been reading a bunch of the conversations here on and I&#x27;m pump for tonight&#x27;s Coast to Coast AM show with George knp interviewing Lis Alando at 10 p.m. Pacific Standard time I suspect much of the misunderstandings and statements online that appear to be conflicting regarding assap atip are more about semantics and anything else the details on how things were done and when and who was led on what Etc it&#x27;s really not all that complicated and it will be great to help clarify that so we can move towards the more valuable UAP dialogue I kind of agree with Jeremy here to from being honest you know the bigger question in all of this does any of this matter now let&#x27;s hear from the man himself Luis alzando and here he is with George knp on Coast to Coast here&#x27;s one I think is could be constructive and as recently as today this is floating around all over the place you and I have exchanged some information about it Dr jamat James aaski answered an email some a news organization asked him for a photo and along the way they said something about aw app that he corrected that it seemed like the questioner uh got it wrong and he just corrected him but he didn&#x27;t want to give a comment they used his comments anyway and it sounds like he&#x27;s coming after you I&#x27;m telling you he he was not coming after you he was not he was just pointing out you weren&#x27;t really a big part of ASAP you were invited to be part of it and if it had survived you would have been part of it but he was just clarifying that and it sounds I was not part of I made it very clear in my book in fact you know Jim Jim was Jim was was of the founders and creators of that you know he he the guy deserves uh enormous credit for that he really does uh he he we would not there would not be an a tip had there not been Jim laty or an assap and I don&#x27;t look I I I don&#x27;t take anything personally I know Jim very well he&#x27;s a highly intelligent man um you know I don&#x27;t know the nuances of what happened but you know like I said man it&#x27;s it&#x27;s I don&#x27;t pay attention to the drama anyways you Jim Jim Jim&#x27;s a great guy I I&#x27;m sure if you had a problem he&#x27;d probably let me know so just okay with him let&#x27;s talk a tip versus assap so you know the New York Times story was very important but it got a couple things wrong uh you know the $22 million that that that was supposedly went to ATP was was assap money and there&#x27;s a lot of blurring of the lines in part because some of the people who worked for oap that contractor effort under DIA also helped you in what became a tip a lot of confusion there including even just as recently as today about who did what and what happened and and whether or not there&#x27;s all this competition between the guys who had different jobs you Jim laty uh Jay Stratton can you sort of help us sort separate wheat from chaff on all that confusion George the these guys are all great guys you know U Jim ly is is again he&#x27;s a national hero what what he was able to do uh was was incredible you know and and and Jay Straton to was able to do I mean he became the first UAP task force director you know so these these men have done great things for their countries and both ASAP and atip owe their existence to them um but there are you know it is it is a blurry line because elements of alsap later transformed into atip the formal program that was run out of not out of DIA but out of the Pentagon where I was at and and there is where things get blurry because not everybody in ASAP was part of that that formalized effort later on and so it&#x27;s understood it&#x27;s understandable to me that there&#x27;s some confusion um look the the reality here is we&#x27;re all working towards the same thing man it&#x27;s all about disclosure right and and put egos aside and all that that that nonsense because at the end of the day we&#x27;re we&#x27;re one team one fight and and it&#x27;s about getting the job done getting Congress informed getting the American people the information they they deserve right and getting the government to work as it&#x27;s supposed to work um I don&#x27;t like to get into the trenches of the he said she said it&#x27;s it&#x27;s silly it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s constructive and at the end of the day you everybody deserves credit everybody has done a tremendous job the folks at assap uh you know the scientists there and the folks over with Bigalow they did an incredible job Bigalow paid for a lot of this stuff himself people don&#x27;t know that I mean this guy&#x27;s a patriot I mean he he spent his own money fronting a lot of the bill for for the government&#x27;s effort you know there there&#x27;s a lot of good people colum kellerer jacqu valet I mean all these folks did incredible work for the government so you know I I don&#x27;t like to get into the he said she said because I I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s necessarily constructive well here&#x27;s the thing I want to give a huge shout out to red panda koala put links in the description please go check it out he provided um the videos there that had all the text over it and everything that was him so thank you to him shout out to him thank you um and as well let&#x27;s look at some other documents that are out there that may help support Lis Alando because I found this one from Vinnie Adams to be quite interesting apparently Luis alzando is listed as an agent on this bigot list right for assap so I mean to be honest with you y&#x27;all at the end of the day I don&#x27;t know what to make of it because when you look at what ASAP is it&#x27;s just a program right ASAP was started as as a as a contract right anybody could bid on it ASAP was put forth as this program to study technological stuff right and I&#x27;ll put links in the description you can look at these documents right here that I&#x27;m showing on the screen right so I don&#x27;t know right anybody could have bid on it and if you look at the Wikipedia for a tip you see that it was started in 20 7 which doesn&#x27;t make any sense because ASAP wasn&#x27;t even started till 2008 right so I look I don&#x27;t know and do these Details Matter but there is a lot of discrepancies here between the names you got Eric Davis saying it&#x27;s Lou alzando started a new a tip another a tip he&#x27;s got his own a tip I I I just I don&#x27;t know they all make conflicting statements is this all part of the plan is this just to mess with us I don&#x27;t know you know we&#x27;re focusing on this are we missing the ball somewhere else is this a magic trick is there something else going on while we&#x27;re focusing on this I don&#x27;t know should we be focusing on this I thought it was important because everyone&#x27;s talking about right and I want to ask you do you think we should focus on this so look seen everything that I showed you today there&#x27;s a lot out there please go check out that John Greenwall Jr live stream well worth the watch so with without further Ado again I said it again I don&#x27;t know why I say that every time uh we&#x27;re ending the video&#x27;s over okay okay y&#x27;all thank y&#x27;all so much for watching we&#x27;ll see you guys on tomorrow&#x27;s video remember everyday is a gift y&#x27;all peace world of M Bel kids screaming in the crad profanities I see the world through ice covered in ink cross the ones who H My Cries and watch me weep</p>
