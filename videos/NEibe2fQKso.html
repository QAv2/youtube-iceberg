            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh we are an educational channel here and um today is the 129th video on the reciprocal system of theory the reciprocal system of theory is a Theory of Everything derived by Dewey B Larson and then um refined by several other people uh in the 21st century up until today uh unfortunately uh there are some people following it but it is a very obscure and nobody really knows about the reciprocal system which is a shame and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying to change it here um the reciprocal system is a very powerful tool that we can use ourselves to really free us from the dependency on the scientific establishment also the religious establishment uh we can figure these things out for ourselves in a logical and systematic Manner and uh if we understand the reciprocal system we get answers to our questions regardless of what area they come from it is a theory of everything it allows you it&#x27;s a system you understand the system and then you can plug it into any subject that you like um you know you have to do so carefully and conscientiously but um it allows you a disciplined thinker to um arrive at answers to any questions that they have and it&#x27;s not mystical it&#x27;s not uh there&#x27;s no mumbo jumbo it&#x27;s just uh some basic principles that you have to learn and then you have to learn how to apply them and uh the first person that uh the person who derived the theory uh did did just that and he made a few mistakes the theory itself is correct as he said but whether I&#x27;ve applied it correctly in every instance is another matter he didn&#x27;t make a few mistakes and so we&#x27;re trying to you know brush those um you know um clarify those correct those um but um he really pointed the way to you know to unlock the potential of the reciprocal system so today is I think about the 12th video that we&#x27;ve done going over this interview that he did in 1984 with a guy named Jan Sommer and I think uh we will finish that today the um so the basic gist of the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe of motion it&#x27;s not a universe of matter not a universe of energy uh like uh you know the classical Legacy scientists would tell you but a universe of motion matter and energy are merely uh two different kinds of motion there are many other kinds of motion all the basic scientific phenomena that you understand are are strictly kinds of motion emotion is the relationship between space and time so all these quantities can be defined specifically and uniquely and exclusively in terms of space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other um so when you&#x27;re talking about a relationship between space and time you&#x27;re talking about a ratio or fraction with space being the the numerator time being the denominator or vice versa and then the inversion of that that&#x27;s the reciprocal so that&#x27;s where the reciprocal system comes in and um like all reciprocals they all they both both reciprocals space and time have the same quantities um same qualities I&#x27;m sorry they have the same qualities such as space being multi-dimensional three or more Dimensions therefore time is also three or more dimensional and time being progress progressing always getting later and later space therefore is also progressing flowing or getting late later and later the Hubble telescope uh observed that in the recession of the distant galaxies that&#x27;s the progression of space or what Larson calls clock space and clock time and then uh what we were talking about earlier the multi-dimensionality is coordinate space and coordinate time these uh both take place in their various contexts in the universe and there are basically two sectors of the universe um well of the physical universe and Larson calls them sector one and sector two sector one is the material sector that we&#x27;re uh familiar with and this is the sector that is moving uh where just like Einstein says the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe well what he actually meant was the speed of light is the maximum speed of sector one and sector two is the section of the universe that is actually moving faster than the speed of light and uh this is where things such as uh life and intelligence come from and uh there is a boundary between them that is the speed of light and the speed of light is actually one unit of time one unit of space in one unit of time and that shows the discrete nature of the universe time and space only come in discrete units in chunks there&#x27;s not a Continuum they&#x27;re very small chunks and so it looks like a Continuum but it isn&#x27;t it&#x27;s kind of like a cartoon uh you know when you watch a cartoon you&#x27;re seeing uh individual frames flashing by you at a very fast speed you know 50 per second or 100 per second or something and it gives the illusion of uh you know continuous motion well in this universe uh we really it&#x27;s like a cartoon but there are uh six quadrillion of those frames going by per second okay that is the uh unit of time is this one uh six quadrillionth of a second um but they but but it is again it is a um non-continuous thing it is frames you know but they&#x27;re just going by so fast that uh we can&#x27;t really resolve them okay we&#x27;re gonna take over this talk here uh with the question from John Sommer could you clarify a couple of points for me one of the difficulties I&#x27;m having is that the unit of electricity is the electron there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any unit of magnetism atoms one could say are the units of gravitation they are the smallest units that gravitate but in magnetic phenomena there&#x27;s nothing of the kind Larson well the electron is not actually a unit of electricity it happens to be a physical unit that can take an electric charge question of course atoms can also take electric charges Larson but the electron as a physical unit without the electric charge has no properties except insofar as it is a unit of space it&#x27;s essentially a rotating unit of space and it acts as a unit of space rather than as a unit of something corresponding to charge it really has no relation to charge they&#x27;re really two different electrical phenomena there so in Larson&#x27;s system there&#x27;s electric an electron which is the cause of electric current and this is uncharged electricity the electron has to be vibrating before it gains a charge so that vibration is the charge not the electron the vibration a charge is a rotational vibration there are four kinds of emotion a translational motion a vibrational motion a rotational motion and a rotational vibration and they can come in one two or three dimensions and so a charge is a rotational vibration um you know but uh an electron is just a rotating unit of space again this is where the uh discrete unit postulate comes in it&#x27;s a unit it&#x27;s not uh there&#x27;s not a Continuum the electrons are all the same they&#x27;re rotating units of space so they uh you know that is defining them as a unit of space the unit of space is 4.56 times 10 to the minus eight meters okay very small but not nearly as small as the unit of time the unit of space is very small but it&#x27;s very large compared to the size of an atom okay now getting back to the questioner my attempt here has been to find out what are the areas open for future research so magnetism is one of them Larson well I would put it in a little different way what I have done in this deductive phase of the operation is to start from the postulates and work downward toward more detailed applications the principles and applications applying to smaller areas and actually we haven&#x27;t gone very far in any but a few selected areas in astronomy for instance this book will carry us pretty well along most astronomical Fields as I explained in the book are attempting to study the individual objects a particular star for instance but I was interested in the general principles the only area I have not gone into in any great detail is spectroscopic work simply because it&#x27;s too big a subject and would take too much time outside of that we&#x27;ve gone into astronomy fairly thoroughly here but there are very few areas that we have done that um areas that we have done that I would say a thing like solid compression there isn&#x27;t a lot of work that&#x27;s necessary there and the inter-atomic distance relations we did them pretty well but by and large almost every physical area is open to a lot more development of the details if I compare for instance the amount of material that is in this new book The astronomy book with the astronomical pages I had in the structure of the physical Universe I probably had about 30 pages there on astronomy wet well I expanded that up to 450 and all of that is new information it isn&#x27;t that I have been any more wordy on the thing I probably I have probably been as condensed in the 450 Pages as I was in the 30. it&#x27;s additional material questions so the other areas could be extended in some way Larson people are continually saying well what does your theory give us in this area of course I haven&#x27;t necessarily gotten to that area yet my answer to them is I&#x27;ve given you the Clue the handle that you can work with and it&#x27;s up to you to go ahead and carry it on and those are the last words of Larson on this interview so um those are good last words as if he recognized that he was going to die fairly soon he did about six years later at age 92 I believe and um he&#x27;s left it up to us to go ahead and carry it on to develop the details of the theory the theory is there and it&#x27;s set and the theory is correct now whether you are we are able to kind of understand the theory well enough so that we can apply it to our own situations he&#x27;s not even just talking about physical Theory he&#x27;s not just talking about electrons and magnetism and solid compression and astronomy he&#x27;s talking about you know uh every subject nutrition um you know um music theory uh you know whatever subject floats your boat you can plug the reciprocal system into it and that&#x27;s why I believe it needs to be taught because uh you know you can take your passion and you can break it down in terms of the reciprocal system it&#x27;s a theory of everything and that&#x27;s uh those are the kind of subjects that I teach here and that&#x27;s why I spent so much time I have spent so much time and I will spend a lot more time on the reciprocal system and why I spent so much time on the tree of life the tree of life is also a theory of everything that you can use to provide answers to any question that you have so these are and they these two theories both dovetail uh they they agree in many many important respects and they can be used in conjunction with each other um and so uh it&#x27;s a powerful combination but it&#x27;s you have to put in a fair amount of work before you can get to that point and so um it but it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not like an insurmountable amount of work it&#x27;s like your high school chemistry class you know it&#x27;s uh the you have to apply yourself a few you know for uh five days a week for 45 minutes a day for a year and then you would really really understand the reciprocal system and the tree of life and you would be able to start applying it to your own subjects so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not an insurmountable uh obstacle it&#x27;s just that there is no infrastructure built up for any of these subjects and so you have to kind of do it on your own on your own initiative um now I&#x27;m trying to put together some initiatives of my own to uh including this YouTube channel uh or you know YouTube and other channel and um trying to get this out there and get people uh you know in a place where they can make these kind of studies and so that they can um apply it to their subjects of Interest so um I think that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what it takes is just a little bit of infrastructure to kind of uh make it a little bit easier for people to um to to become fluent in the reciprocal system and you know my disclaimer is that I&#x27;m not necessarily fluent in the reciprocal system either I understand quite a bit of it just from sheer time um but it is it is challenging and there are certain aspects of it that I&#x27;m still trying to wrap my head around um and there are again it&#x27;s sloppy because there are areas where uh he made a few mistakes and so uh those mistakes are being corrected but then there are people that are Orthodox larsonians who thought that he didn&#x27;t make any mistakes and that all these revisions are unnecessary and leading the theory in the wrong direction and so there&#x27;s a minor little civil war going on within the people that are that are actually you know involved in studying this stuff um I think that&#x27;s mostly just noise and that we can bypass that and that you know what we just have to do is figure out what Larson is talking about and then look carefully at the corrections that have been made and you know make the make your decision themselves but you know Larson um you know learn Larson&#x27;s Theory and then learn where other people have said that he made mistakes and then check those mistakes out and and the answers will eventually come uh you know come to the fore because uh the theory is a check on itself okay now the next thing that we&#x27;re gonna do um on this channel is we&#x27;re gonna go over we&#x27;re gonna start to go over Larsen&#x27;s magnum opus that is called the structure of the physical universe and this is the volume two of the structure of the physical Universe um the first volume came out in 1959 and a lot of it is kind of like um a little bit fragmented there&#x27;s he went in just like he said in the interview he he just had those 30 pages on the astronomy stuff and some of the other stuff that he has in there is um hard to hard to break down I mean if you read his first volume it&#x27;s written in in typewriter um and there&#x27;s all kinds of parenthetical comments written in cursive you know there&#x27;s things whole pages that are crossed off um and then there&#x27;s a few chapters that are just missing so luckily Larson revised this and came up with the structure of the physical universe that includes three separate books uh the first book is called Nothing But motion that is primarily on um physics and then the second and some chemistry and then the second book is primarily on chemistry it&#x27;s called basic properties of matter um and then the third volume is on astronomy it&#x27;s called the universe of motion now those books uh didn&#x27;t come out chronologically the first book nothing but motion came out in 1979 the second book of basic properties of matter uh he finished up in 1987 and the third book he finished in 1984. uh this universe of motion so uh he was kind of working on all these books or just put them out when he did this interview that we just went through but I&#x27;m just gonna read uh nothing but motion read the table of contents to get into the idea of where he&#x27;s going with this Theory before we start it up okay so there&#x27;s uh 21 chapters and um there&#x27;s a preface chapter one background chapter 2 a universe of motion chapter 3 reference systems chapter 4 radiation chapter five gravitation chapter six the reciprocal relation chapter seven high speed motion chapter 8 Motion in Time chapter nine rotational combinations chapter 10 Adams chapter 11 subatomic particles chapter 12 basic mathematical relations chapter 13 physical constants chapter 14 Cosmic elements that&#x27;s referring to the cosmic sector or sector two chapter 15 cosmic ray decay chapter 16 Cosmic atom building chapter 17 some speculations chapter 18 simple compounds chapter 19 complex compounds chapter 20 chain compounds in chapter 21 ring compounds so there&#x27;s a lot of organic chemistry there at the end and a lot of physics there at the beginning and then you know things on atoms and sub atoms and so on so there&#x27;s a lot of stuff there we&#x27;re going to dig in uh with the preface starting uh right away and uh we&#x27;ll work from there so thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
