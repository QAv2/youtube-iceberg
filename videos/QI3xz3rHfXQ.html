            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>So Chelsea ordered an 8 inch round chocolate cake buttercream frosting. Welcome baby Frenchie with 36 roses on an 8 inch round. So it&#x27;s obviously for a baby shower cuz welcome baby Frenchie with the pink and the blue roses. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a gender reveal or at least I hope not cuz the cake is definitely chocolate. Uh it&#x27;s not dead pink or blue.</p>
<p>So hopefully that&#x27;s good. Either way, how the hell am I going to fit 36 roses on this cake? But I&#x27;m I&#x27;m just also confused on what this cake actually is supposed to be since they want so many roses on this goddamn cake. I I&#x27;m just going to start with the writing first. So, they wanted welcome baby Frenchie. And usually I do some like cute fufu la baby shower font all these hoes find on Pinterest nowadays, but it might clash with the horde of roses I&#x27;m about to do.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;re just going to keep the font, keep it simple, stupid cute. All right, I&#x27;m like already overwhelmed. So, I&#x27;m just going to start with this one. I mean, I don&#x27;t know how in the devil&#x27;s advocate 36 roses are going to fit in here, but we got to try. I&#x27;m going to do them a little smaller than usual, but I I have so many questions.</p>
<p>Like, I&#x27;m so confused. Like, why 36 roses? I feel like if they just wanted the entire cake covered in roses, they would have just said like cover the entire cake with roses. But 36 is so specific. I&#x27;m like, is she 36 weeks pregnant? Like, I don&#x27;t know how long people are pregnant for. I mean, the only thing I&#x27;ve been pregnant with is a food baby, so I only half count.</p>
<p>Like, is it the mom&#x27;s 36th birthday? Is she craving a little attention since Miss Baby French Kiss is hogging all the attention now? Like, is Frenchie the 36th kid, cousin, favorite number? What? Also, I&#x27;m writing whoever took this freaking order up cuz they only charged $10 for this BS. Like, this is an art charge, color charge, emotional distress charge, carpal tunnel charge, and you&#x27;re welcome charge. Like, it actually looks a lot better than it did in my head. So, either way, I have no idea. Frenchie, if you&#x27;re having a baby shower, a gender reveal, or like why your mom is obsessed with the number 36 instead of just saying, &quot;Put the roses on the cake.&quot; But you can tell me when you&#x27;re older, babe.</p>
<p>All right, time for me to go on my 15-minute break and never come</p>
