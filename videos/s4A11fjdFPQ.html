            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Imagine a device that could pull limitless clean energy right out of the air, making electricity free for everyone. Picture a car that could travel hundreds of miles on a single gallon of ordinary water. Think about a simple beam of light that could reportedly shatter any disease-causing organism without harming healthy tissue. These aren&#x27;t just dreams. They are claims linked to inventions that for one reason or another never quite made it to your everyday life.</p>
<p>Here are some stories that will make you wonder what our world might look like today. Number nine, T. Henry Mor&#x27;s radiant energy device. Imagine powering your home with a box that draws energy from the cosmos. Thomas Henry Morray, an inventor from Salt Lake City, Utah, claimed he did just that in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1920s, Moray demonstrated a device he called the Moray valve, which he said could tap into a limitless source of energy from the universe, which he termed radiant energy. This wasn&#x27;t energy from burning fuel or harnessing water. It was supposedly all around us, waiting to be collected. Witnesses, including scientists and engineers at the time, reported seeing Moray&#x27;s device power a bank of light bulbs and an electric motor. One demonstration allegedly showed the device producing 50,000 watts of power for an extended period.</p>
<p>Think about that. 50,000 watts continuously from a box that according to Moray had no conventional power source. He claimed his device was cool to the touch while operating and produced no waste. The implications were staggering, decentralized power, an end to energy scarcity and a revolution in how civilization obtained its energy. Marray sought a patent for his invention, but the US patent office was skeptical.</p>
<p>They required him to identify the source of the energy, something Morray struggled to explain in terms that satisfied the prevailing scientific understanding of the time. He believed the energy was akin to the oscillations of the universe itself, a concept that was difficult to prove or categorize. He reportedly faced intense opposition. Mor claimed his lab was repeatedly attacked, his research stolen, and that he and his family received threats. On one occasion, he was shot at in his own car.</p>
<p>His device, he said, was eventually smashed by an asalent. Despite numerous demonstrations and affidavit from observers, Morray never received a US patent for the core of his radiant energy device. He wrote a book, The Sea of Energy, in which the Earth Floats, detailing his theories and experiences. But the device itself, capable of generating substantial power seemingly from nothing, vanished from public view. The knowledge of how to build a fully functional version that could power communities, if it ever truly existed, is claimed, seems to have been lost, or at least driven deep underground.</p>
<p>Question lingers. Was Mo on the verge of an energy revolution? Or was it all an elaborate, misunderstood phenomenon? The reported power outputs and the violent opposition he described paint a picture of something truly disruptive. Number eight, cold fusion by Pon and Fleshman. March 23rd, 1989. It was a date that sent shock waves through the scientific world.</p>
<p>Two respected chemists, Martin Fleshman from the University of Southampton and Stanley Pon from the University of Utah, held a press conference to announce something incredible. They claimed to have achieved nuclear fusion, the same process that powers the sun, not in a giant billiondoll reactor, but in a simple glass jar on a laboratory tabletop at room temperature. They called it cold fusion. Their setup was surprisingly basic. A palladium electrode wrapped in platinum wire submerged in heavy water.</p>
<p>Water enriched with dutarium, an isotope of hydrogen. When they passed an electric current through it, they reported that the palladium electrode produced an extraordinary amount of excess heat, far more than could be explained by any known chemical reaction. They also detected neutrons and tritium, byproducts typically associated with nuclear fusion. If true, this meant a virtually limitless, clean, and cheap source of energy. Imagine power plants that could run on water producing little to no radioactive waste.</p>
<p>It sounded like the answer to the world&#x27;s energy problems. The initial reaction was a frenzy of excitement. Laboratories around the globe scrambled to reperticate the pawns and fleshmen experiment. The media hailed it as a potential breakthrough of monumental proportions. Governments allocated emergency funding for research.</p>
<p>But then the tide began to turn. Many labs reported they couldn&#x27;t reproduce the excess heat or the nuclear byproducts consistently, if at all. Some prominent physicists publicly attacked the claims, pointing to potential errors in measurement and a lack of understanding of nuclear physics on the part of the chemists. The scientific establishment, particularly the hot fusion community, which had been working for decades on massive complex machines, was largely dismissive and even hostile. Within months, cold fusion was widely declared junk science by many.</p>
<p>Pon and Fleshman faced intense criticism and their reputations suffered. They eventually left the United States to continue their research in France with Toyota funding, but their work largely faded from mainstream scientific view. However, a dedicated, though smaller, community of researchers around the world continued to investigate what they now often call low energy nuclear reactions, LNR. They have reported numerous instances of excess heat and other anomalous effects in experiments similar to the original Pon Flechman setup. Some argue that the initial rush to debunk was premature and that the phenomenon, while perhaps not fully understood, is real.</p>
<p>The story of cold fusion became a cautionary tale about scientific discovery, peer review, and the powerful forces that can shape scientific consensus. Was it a fleeting mirage or a glimpse of a suppressed energy future? The debate in some circles quietly continues. Number seven, starlight, the super material that vanished. Imagine a paint-like substance so incredibly heatresistant that you could coat an egg with it, blast it with a blowtorrch hot enough to melt steel, and then crack it open to find the yolk still runny. This wasn&#x27;t science fiction.</p>
<p>It was a material called starite invented by an amateur chemist and hairdresser from Yorkshire, England named Maurice Ward during the 1980s. Ward claimed starlight could withstand temperatures of 10,000° C, 18,000° F, and insulate against them. Fias show him holding a starlight coated egg under an oxy acetylene torch for minutes on end. the shell barely warm. He demonstrated its properties to stunned scientists and defense organizations in the UK and the US, including NASA and the atomic weapons establishment.</p>
<p>It reportedly resisted simulated nuclear flashes with ease. The material was lightweight, could be sprayed or painted on, and its recipe was a closely guarded secret known only to Ward and a few family members. Potential applications were almost endless. Imagine fireproof buildings, planes that could survive catastrophic fires, safer spacecraft, and protective gear for firefighters that would make them virtually impervious to flames. Companies like Boeing, NASA, and various defense contractors were reportedly very interested.</p>
<p>Ward, however, was extremely cautious, perhaps even paranoid about his formula. E was wary of big corporations stealing his invention. He insisted on retaining at least 51% ownership of the formula and was reluctant to hand over samples without stringent controls, fearing reverse engineering. Negotiations with various entities reportedly occurred over many years, but no deal was ever finalized to bring Starlight to the mass market board claimed that some organizations wanted the formula without giving him what he considered fair control or compensation. He was even said to have turned down incredibly lucrative offers because the terms weren&#x27;t right for him.</p>
<p>Tragically, Maurice Ward passed away in May 2011 without, it seems, ever fully disclosing the complete formulation or manufacturing process for Starlight to the wider world. His family members were said to hold parts of the secret, but whether the full reproducible recipe still exists or can be pieced together is unknown. A material that could have revolutionized safety in countless industries demonstrated on television and before top scientists simply faded away because its inventor was perhaps rightly too protective of his creation. The world saw what Starlight could do, but it seems no one knows how to make it anymore. Number six, the electric car, the GME one story.</p>
<p>Long before today&#x27;s sleek electric vehicles became a common sight, there was the General Motors EV1. Launched in 1996, it wasn&#x27;t just a concept car. It was a real drivable futuristic vehicle that you could lease. Was aerodynamic, quick, quiet, and produced zero tailpipe emissions. For a time, it felt like the future of transportation had arrived.</p>
<p>The EV1 was born partly out of a mandate from the California Air Resources Board, CRB, in the early 1990s, which required automakers to produce and sell a certain percentage of zero emission vehicles if they wanted to continue selling cars in California. GM invested heavily, reportedly around a billion dollar in developing the EV1. It featured advanced technologies for its time, including lead acid batteries in early models, later upgraded to nickel metal hydride, NIM, in the Genenna second versions, which offered a greater range. Leesis of the EV1 were often passionate advocates for the car. They loved its performance, its environmental benefits, and the feeling of driving something revolutionary.</p>
<p>Waiting lists grew for the car. However, the story took a strange turn. Despite its popularity among users and its technological promise, GM began to express concerns about the EV1&#x27;s commercial viability. They argued that the car was too expensive to produce, that the range was too limited for most consumers, though many lees disputed this for their daily use, and that there wasn&#x27;t a broad enough market for electric cars. Then between 2003 and 2004 as the leases expired, GM systematically recalled all EV1s.</p>
<p>Leis were not given the option to buy their cars, even though many offered to do so, sometimes for significant sums. What happened next shocked and angered EV1 enthusiasts and environmental advocates. EM along with other automakers who had also produced limitedrun electric vehicles to meet the CB mandate rounded up these cars. The vast majority of the KV1s were crushed and shredded. Only a few disabled units were donated to museums or universities.</p>
<p>The official reasons given by GM revolved around the cost of maintaining parts and service for a discontinued low volume vehicle and liability concerns. However, critics and former EV1 drivers pointed to other factors. They suggested pressure from oil companies, a reluctance from automakers to shift away from their profitable gasoline engine business, and a successful lobbying effort to weaken a CB0 emission mandate, which was indeed significantly altered. documentary, Who Killed the Electric Car, released in 2006, explored these theories and painted a picture of a promising technology deliberately halted. While GM and other car manufacturers eventually rembbraced electric vehicle technology years later, the tale of the EV1 remains a poignant example for many of how a potentially eat invention could be introduced, loved, and then abruptly removed from the world, leaving behind a legion of disappointed fans and a lot of unanswered questions about what might have been.</p>
<p>Number five, Wilhelm Reich and Orone Energy. Wilhelm Reich was a controversial figure, a psychoanalyst and student of Sigman Freud, who later diverged dramatically into his own unique and often bewildering areas of research. In the late 1930s and 1940s, Reich claimed to have discovered a fundamental cosmic energy, a life force he called orgon energy. He believed this energy was present everywhere, responsible for biological vitality, atmospheric phenomena, and even the color of the sky. To harness this orone energy, Reich designed and built orgon accumulators.</p>
<p>These were boxes typically made of alternating layers of organic material like wood or cotton and metallic material like sheet iron. Reich claimed that these accumulators could draw in and concentrate orone energy from the atmosphere. He asserted that sitting inside an organ accumulator could have various health benefits, including treating cancer, though he was careful to state it was not a cure all but a way to bolster the body&#x27;s own life energy to fight disease. Many people who used the accumulators reported feeling sensations of tingling, warmth, and a general sense of well-being. Reich&#x27;s work extended beyond health.</p>
<p>He also developed a device called a cloud buster, which looked like a set of hollow metal tubes connected by hoses to water. Reich claimed this device could influence weather patterns by drawing orone energy out of the atmosphere or directing its flow. conducted experiments, notably the Rangely Lakes experiment in Maine in 1953, where he and his team reportedly used the Cloud Buster to end a drought, an event documented by some local observers and newspapers, though mainstream science remained deeply skeptical. However, Reich&#x27;s theories and devices brought him into direct conflict with the US Food and Drug Administration, FDA. The FDA viewed his claims about Orone Energy and its medical benefits as fraudulent and unproven.</p>
<p>In 1954, after Reich refused to appear in court, a federal judge issued an injunction ordering that all Orgon accumulators and their parts be destroyed and that all of Reich&#x27;s books mentioning Orgon energy be banned and burned. This led to one of the most notorious instances of book burning in American history. Reich was eventually charged with contempt of court for violating the injunction. He was convicted and sentenced to 2 years in federal prison. Wilhelm Reich died of heart failure in Lewisburg Penitentiary in November 1957, just days before he was due to apply for parole.</p>
<p>His research, deemed quackery by the authorities, was largely suppressed. Yet to this day, a dedicated group of followers continues to study his work, build orone devices, and believe that Ry had tapped into a profound, misunderstood natural force with revolutionary potential for health and the environment. Number four, Thomas Ogle&#x27;s superficient carburetor. In the late 1970s, at a time when the world was grappling with an oil crisis and soaring gasoline prices, a young mechanic from El Paso, Texas named Thomas Ogle made a startling claim. He said he had invented a new type of carburetor, or rather a fuel system that could allow a standard V8 powered car to achieve over 100 m per gallon of gasoline.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. Over 100 m per gallon from a large, heavy American car of that era, Ogle demonstrated his invention to journalists and observers. He reportedly drove a Ford Galaxi, a car that normally got around 12 to 15 m per gallon for 200 m on just 2 gall of gasoline in one test. Instead of a conventional carburetor that mixed liquid fuel with air, Ogle&#x27;s system involved a special tank that heated the gasoline, turning it into a vapor. This vapor was then fed directly into the engine&#x27;s cylinders.</p>
<p>He claimed his system burned fuel so efficiently that there were virtually no harmful emissions coming out of the exhaust. Some reports even stated that you could hold the handkerchief over the tailpipe while the engine was running and it would come away clean. And Finey, the invention, dubbed the Ogal gas saver, generated significant media attention. If his claims were true, it would have revolutionized the automotive industry and drastically reduced global oil consumption. Ogle received a patent for his vapor fuel system, US patent 4,177,779 in 1979.</p>
<p>He spoke of plans to manufacture and sell the device. He reportedly received offers, some quite substantial, for his invention, but he was apparently hesitant to sell out too quickly or to the wrong people. Then the story takes a darker, more mysterious turn. According to various accounts, Ogle began to face pressure. He allegedly told people he was being threatened.</p>
<p>In August 1981, Thomas Ogle died. The official cause of death was reported as an overdose of Darvin, a painkiller, and alcohol ruled by some as a suicide. Though friends and family reportedly disputed this, suspecting foul play, he was only 26 years old. After his death, his revolutionary fuel system technology largely disappeared from public view. Plans for his specific design became difficult to find.</p>
<p>While the concept of vapor carburetors wasn&#x27;t entirely new, Ogle&#x27;s reported success in achieving such dramatic fuel efficiency with a working drivable car remains a tantalizing what if. Could a simple mechanical device have freed us from such heavy reliance on gasoline? The world never got to find out for sure. Number three, Royal Raymond Rice universal microscope and beam ray machine. [Music] Dr. Royal Raymond Reich was a brilliant American scientist and inventor.</p>
<p>Active in the early to mid 20th century, he developed a series of incredibly powerful optical microscopes that he claimed could achieve magnifications and resolutions far beyond what was thought possible with light microscopy at the time. His universal microscope, completed in the early 1930s, was an extremely complex instrument with thousands of parts. Ry asserted it could magnify objects up to 60,000 times their original size. What made Reife&#x27;s microscope particularly extraordinary was its reported ability to allow observation of living microorganisms, including bacteria and crucially, viruses. in their natural state, something electron microscopes, which kill specimens cannot do.</p>
<p>Claimed he could see these tiny life forms, stain them with light frequencies, and study their behavior. Through these observations, he proposed a theory that cancer was caused by a specific microorganism. He called it the BX virus. Building on this rife then developed another device often called a beamray machine or rife frequency gurander. He claimed that every microorganism had a unique electromagnetic frequency its mortal oscalatory rate m by exposing a diseased organism or cell to its own specific M amplified by his beamray device.</p>
<p>He said he could shatter or devitalize the pathogen much like an opera singer can shatter a crystal glass by hitting the right note. Importantly, he claimed this process was harmless to surrounding healthy tissues because their moors were different. In 1934, the University of Southern California reportedly appointed a special medical research committee to evaluate Reife&#x27;s cancer therapy at the Scripps Ranch in Legola. According to accounts from Reich&#x27;s supporters, this committee observed the treatment of 16 terminally ill cancer patients, after 3 months, the committee allegedly concluded that 14 of these hopeless cases were clinically cured by Riv&#x27;s frequency therapy. The other two were reportedly cured after a further 4 weeks of treatment.</p>
<p>This would have been a medical breakthrough of unparalleled magnitude. Several doctors began using Reife&#x27;s frequency devices in their practices, reportedly with great success. However, the story of Refe&#x27;s work takes a dramatic and unfortunate turn. Despite the initial reported successes and interest from some medical professionals, Rice&#x27;s theories and his machines faced increasing opposition from the established medical community, particularly the American Medical Association, AMA. The AMA under figures like Dr.</p>
<p>Morris Fishbine was working to standardize medical practice and eliminate what it considered quackery. Rice work which challenged conventional medical treatments like surgery and radiation for cancer and offered a non-farmaceutical approach came under intense scrutiny. It is alleged that Reife was offered buyouts to suppress his work which he refused. Doctors who used his methods reportedly faced harassment, loss of licenses, and legal troubles. Reich&#x27;s own laboratory in San Diego was supposedly raided, and parts of his research and equipment were destroyed or confiscated.</p>
<p>Crucial documents and photographic evidence of his work allegedly vanished. Key figures who had initially supported him either backed away, fell silent, or died under circumstances some found suspicious. By the 1940s, Reich&#x27;s work had been largely discredited and driven underground. He himself became increasingly isolated and died in 1971, a broken man. Today, while mainstream medicine does not recognize Reife&#x27;s theories or his frequency therapy, there is a persistent undercurrent of interest with many alternative health practitioners and individuals building and using modern versions of rice machines.</p>
<p>Believing in their lost potential, number two, Stanley Meyers&#x27;s water pied car. Stanley Meyer, an inventor from Grove City, Ohio, made a claim in the 1980s and 1990s that could have fundamentally altered our relationship with energy and transportation. He said he had developed a water fuel cell that could split ordinary tap water, into its elemental components, hydrogen and oxygen, using far less energy than conventional electrolysis. This hydrogen gas could then be burned in a conventional internal combustion engine to power a car. Essentially, he claimed his car ran on water.</p>
<p>Meyer demonstrated his invention with a red dune buggy. He would fill its fuel tank with water, sometimes sourced directly from a local well or even a rain puddle, and drive it. He claimed his buggy could travel from Los Angeles to New York on just 22 gall of water. News reports and television segments showed the buggy in action with Meyer explaining his technology. He insisted his process was not traditional electrolysis which requires more energy to split water than can be recovered by burning the resulting hydrogen.</p>
<p>Instead, Meyer spoke of a process involving voltage intensification and resonance using specific electrical pulses to break the water molecules bonds efficiently. His patents described a water fuel cell and a hydrogen gas burner. The implications were enormous. An end to dependence on fossil fuels, zero polluting emissions, the only byproduct of burning hydrogen is water vapor and an almost limitless fuel source. Naturally, Meyer&#x27;s claims attracted significant attention, both positive and negative.</p>
<p>He reported that he was approached by various organizations, including Arab oil interests, who allegedly offered him a billion dollars to shove his technology. Meer said he refused, wanting the technology to benefit everyone. However, Meyer also faced skepticism and legal challenges. In 1996, he was sued by two investors who claimed he had sold them dealerships for his technology that didn&#x27;t actually work. An Ohio court ruled against Meyer, finding him guilty of gross and egregious fraud and ordering him to repay the investors.</p>
<p>The court&#x27;s expert witness examined the cell and concluded it was nothing more than conventional electrolysis. The story took a tragic and mysterious turn on March 20th, 1998. Meyer was meeting with two Belgian investors at a restaurant. After taking a sip of cranberry juice, he suddenly grabbed his neck, rushed outside, and collapsed. His reported last words, according to his brother, Steven, were, &quot;They poisoned me.&quot; The official coroner&#x27;s report concluded that Stanley Meyer died of a cerebral aneurysm.</p>
<p>However, his family and supporters believed he was murdered to suppress his invention, pointing to the alleged threats and the immense financial interests that would have been disrupted by a viable waterpowered car. After his death, his patents became publicly available, but no one has yet demonstrabably retrobate his claims of a car running for hundreds of miles on a few gallons of water using his specific methods. At least not in a way that has been widely accepted or commercialized. The mystery of Stanley Meyer&#x27;s water fuel cell. Was it a revolutionary breakthrough or a misunderstood experiment continues to fuel debate and intrigue? Number one, Nicola Tesla&#x27;s warden tower and wireless world power.</p>
<p>Nicola Tesla. The name itself conjures images of genius, lightning bolts, and inventions that were decades, even a century ahead of their time. Among his most ambitious and ultimately tragic projects was the Warden Cliff Tower in Shorum, Long Island, New York. This wasn&#x27;t just a tall structure. It was intended to be the heart of a world wireless system that Tesla envisioned would transmit not only messages but also electrical power wirelessly across the globe.</p>
<p>Imagine a world without power lines. Imagine electricity being broadcast through the earth and atmosphere available to anyone anywhere with a simple receiver. This was Tesla&#x27;s dream and Wardenliff, a massive 187 ft tower with a 68 ft diameter copper dome, was to be the first of many. Construction began in 1901. Primarily funded by the powerful financier JP Morgan.</p>
<p>Tesla believed he could use the Earth&#x27;s own resonant frequency to transmit energy. He had already demonstrated wireless lighting and power transmission on a smaller scale. With Warden Sliff, he aimed to do it globally. Tesla&#x27;s vision was breathtaking. Beyond free or very cheap electricity for all he foresaw worldwide broadcasting of news, music, stock market information, secure private communications, and even image transmission.</p>
<p>He was essentially laying the groundwork for the internet and global mobile communication combined with wireless power at the turn of the 20th century. Potential to uplift humanity to provide energy to remote regions and to connect the world was immense. However, the project ran into trouble. Building Wardeniff was more expensive than anticipated. Tesla&#x27;s rival Goodielmo Maronei, backed by Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Edison, was making rapid progress in transatlantic radio communication using different, less ambitious, but more immediately profitable methods.</p>
<p>In December 1901, Maronei successfully sent a wireless telegraph signal across the Atlantic. This success using simpler technology made investors wary of Tesla&#x27;s grander, more complex, and perhaps less understood vision of transmitting actual power. JP Morgan, who had initially invested $150,000, a huge sum at the time, reportedly became concerned when he realized Tesla&#x27;s primary aim was wireless power for everyone, which could disrupt existing energy monopolies and make it difficult to meter and charge for electricity. When Tesla asked for more funding to complete the tower and make it fully operational for power transmission, Morgan refused. Without Morgan&#x27;s backing, other investors shied away.</p>
<p>Tesla&#x27;s funds dried up. Panic of 1907 further crippled his financial situation. Tesla was forced to abandon Warden Cliffe. He mortgaged the property and by 1915 he lost it to foreclosure. In 1917, during World War I, the tower was dynamited and sold for scrap by the new owners.</p>
<p>With the US government reportedly concerned that German spies could use it as a landmark or for communication, Tesla was devastated. He continued to invent and theorize for decades, but he never again had the resources to attempt a project of Warden and Sliff scale. The dream of a wirelessly powered world with energy available like the air we breathe died with the demolition of that strange magnificent tower on Long Island. One can only speculate how different our 20th and 21st centuries might have been if Tesla&#x27;s world wireless system had become a reality. The secrets of its full potential and whether it could have truly worked as he envisioned remain one of history&#x27;s most tantalizing technological mysteries.</p>
