            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>by no accident Tesla&#x27;s Grand project was to be financed by the Devil Himself JP Morgan you&#x27;re a strange man indeed Tesla after the papers are signed you may draw upon the house of Morgan but it&#x27;s important that I remain a silent partner you do understand what that means don&#x27;t you Mr Tesla but Nicola had a secret the system could also Electrify the world Warden Cliffe would provide Limitless free energy everywhere for everybody when JP Morgan found out about this leap of Technology he wouldn&#x27;t tolerate it he knew Tesla could deliver and the banker Overlord couldn&#x27;t put a meter on it a man always has two reasons for doing anything a good reason and the real reason mid construction Morgan would cancel the contract and blackball Tesla that&#x27;s excluding him from any other investor Mr Morgan are you going to leave me in a hole I&#x27;ve made a thousand powerful enemies on your account in a 100 years from now this country would give me much for the first honor of transmitting power without wires Warden Cliff faltered and Marone sent his transatlantic signal Tesla was suff for his second nervous breakdown and never again would he regain his momentum as [Music] before but despite his cruel fate Nicholas stayed the course decade after decade would pass and he would bring forth new Fantastic inventions in transportation airflight and even Warfare his death beam as he intended would bring an end to all Warfare an inventor to the end all all he ever wanted was to uplift the condition of humanity but now in his hotel room time was drawing short he&#x27;d finger newspaper clippings and recall some of the smaller moments of his life his table for one walking the streets of New York haunting Grand Central Station or feeding his many pigeons no one could begin to imagine what great secrets this mad scientist kept locked inside his head no no one except Jay Ed G Hoover and his gmen they waited patiently for the great man to pass and were ready to take everything that Nicola Left [Music] Behind the story is about a man whose powerful ideas live on as much of his work is still classified and used in the most esoteric projects imaginable today Nicola Tesla singlehandedly changed the world for the benefit of mankind yet has been rewarded with obsc urity it&#x27;s time to bring his story out of the shadows and into the light with his last breath Nicola gently smiled let the future tell the truth and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments the present is theirs the future for which I have really worked is mine would they only have listened [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and the top our news here at 6:00 an age-old dream becoming a reality a local inventor has discovered a way hear this to use water to run your car it&#x27;s a major breakthrough that will no doubt make motorists happy and as Ral Robinson explains the Pentagon is also showing lots of interest in this project water has always been considered a precious commodity but Stan my&#x27;s invention may make it even more valuable he has developed what&#x27;s called a water fuel cell it has taken the place of his old gas tank the water fuel cell breaks down water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen the hydrogen is used to run his Doom buggy I don&#x27;t care if you use rain water well water city water water ocean water if you don&#x27;t have any fresh water go ahead and use snow if you don&#x27;t have any snow available to you then use salt water because there&#x27;s no adverse effect to the fuel cell Myers started working on this project four years ago he&#x27;s not a scientist he isn&#x27;t even a chemist in fact he never graduated from college Myers was determined he says to design something to protect this country from oil embargos and we have calculated that if we take the dune buggy from Los Angeles to New York we would roughly use 22 gallons of water the Pentagon flew a lieutenant colonel in last week to look at Myers&#x27;s invention there&#x27;s talk of possibly using it in the Star Wars defense program and to run army tanks Myers is currently perfecting a water fuel cell for cars it will cost about $1,500 he says it won&#x27;t need any maintenance and you won&#x27;t have to replace it it&#x27;ll be at least 2 years before the fuel system goes into mass production the day happens will be one the fuel industry hates but it&#x27;ll put a smile on the face of those who had to say at one time or another fill her up I&#x27;m problems as you can see many pads have already been received and many more are forthcoming car that runs on water instead of gasoline can it be true well inventor Stanley Meyer made an announcement today in Colorado Springs he says he&#x27;s come up with a device that will hook up to any engine and allow it to run on Good Old H2O news 13&#x27;s Kurt GF tonight on the possible impact of the water fuel cell thetion Stanley Meers says the answer to dependence on foreign oil lies all around us in Sea waterer tap water and rainwater any kind of H2O he says can power just about every type of engine how with the water fuel cell it fits in the palm of his hand but it could revolutionize the world you&#x27;re talking about a pollution free totally new source of energy the voltage disassociation of water the fuel cell converts water into a gas hydrogen oxygen which is released in the form of thermo explosive energy so the water fuel injector simply replaces the spark plug we hook it to a hydro computer system which regulates and meters the flow going into the injector it processes the water and sets away to release its thermal explosive energy the man who invented an engine that can run on water says he&#x27;s been offered a billion dollars in cash by oil producing countries to sell his patent so far he hasn&#x27;t sold Environmental Specialist Jan Porter talked to the inventor who thinks that the US Auto industry could produce cars that run on water now if they wanted to industrial base of the world is based on the utilization Stan Meyer has a car that runs on water and that&#x27;s drawing crows at this year&#x27;s extraordinary science conference in Colorado Springs Myers has developed what is called the water fuel cell injector the injector breaks down the water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen and the hydrogen is what powers the car basically all we do is replace the the spark plug and replace it with the water fuel cell injectors you see right here we simply feed ordinary nonpr water or process water in here and as the water goes into the injector uh it hits a very high pulse will frequency which instantly converts it into thermal explosive energy and as a result we can run this car down the road on water Myer&#x27;s invention was introduced in Britain earlier this month and now the Brits have followed him here that we recently took a scientific delegation to witness Stan&#x27;s work to really evaluate it and came back saying this is one of the most important inventions of the century for 15 years Ma has been fighting to get his inventions taken seriously most inventors have to be a loner you have to be somewhat F skinn and don&#x27;t rely on other people to support you because they will not more times than not uh invention is really stolen from the inventors even in my prior development of high technology I&#x27;ve had patents taken from me I learned from the School of Hard marks to be very cautious M has always stood out against the crowd he has no formal qualifications as a scientist because he didn&#x27;t wait to graduate from high school leaving early he go straight into research at the high powered battel Institute in his native Ohio now he works full-time as a private inventor his go to device with potentially revolutionary implications there is nothing startling about a machine that can extract the hydrogen from water what is highly unusual is that it should do so with ordinary tap water conventional method is called electrolysis M has turned that process on its head unlike electrolysis his device doesn&#x27;t use up large amounts of electric current nor does it produce an enormous amount of waste [Music] heat for 20 years he has been refining a method to fracture water it produces vast amounts of hydrogen on demand this is not his latest apparatus he was unwilling to let us point a camera at that this is the simple device he used to convince a reluctant patent office that his revolutionary concept actually works alloy rods acting as electrodes are housed in a perspec container that&#x27;s filled with water normal Main&#x27;s voltage is fed in through a Transformer but critically there is virtually no current consumed less than half an amp the result is dramatic hydrogen pours off with a flick of a switch my claims the key is his electronics which pulses electricity rapidly across the rods up to 20,000 cycles per second in a way that&#x27;s not readily apparent this process transforms the equation whereas in conventional electrolysis three times as much energy is consumed as is produced in the form of hydrogen fuel in Mars apparatus the reverse is true it appears to produce several 100% more energy when it consumes</p>
