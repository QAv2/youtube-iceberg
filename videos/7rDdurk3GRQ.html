            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>A young electrical engineering student at University of Chicago, T. Galen Heronomous, was brought in to help assemble machines and he began doing further research into this area, doing things like growing green plants underground with no visible light. They still turned green. And what he maintained was the energy that he and Dr. Abrams had worked in was what he called eloptic energy.</p>
<p>He said it was the most fundamental energy that made up the building blocks of matter. And more than that, these energies could be run through wires. Therefore, we could modify those energies with resistors and capacitors. And it could also be focused and split like it was light. So, it was electrical optic energy.</p>
<p>So, it was elotic energy.</p>
