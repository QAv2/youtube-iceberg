            <p>okay so here we have aluminum pendulum thing that&#x27;s suspended by a string in there it looks straight down okay yes you can&#x27;t see the through the bottom very much I have aluminum mesh Faraday cage all the way around this thing and I have my high voltage generator and I&#x27;m seeing deflections and and huh looks like for some reason we&#x27;re getting major deflections in there it seems to be following the electrostatic field even though I have it in a shielded Faraday cage how about that Oh seems like more strongly attracted to the positive than the negative but still it should be completely shielded shouldn&#x27;t should that be shielded Oh very strange okay anyway definitely is aluminum should be a good conductor should be shielding the electrostatic fields I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s very strange okay I was just going to make some comments on this guy here this torsion field thing so um it&#x27;s kind of thick class one theory that I have I know tellenson Brown is working on electro of gravity and that maybe the electric field is of creating a capacitive effect between the inner Faraday cage which is inside of here and the outer one and producing a stress field and in the in the glass out here and that stress field is creating an artificial electro gravity field which is uh penetrating the Faraday cage and causing the submitter to to rotate this one theory that I have it&#x27;s very strange because Maxwell&#x27;s equations predict that the field should be completely shielded electric fields should be completely shielded on the inside and of course there is no magnetic fields because these are electrostatic fields so anyway I&#x27;ll keep on looking into this effect seems very interesting and Gaussian and uh ideal product is to be able to build a spaceship using artificial gravitational fields so anyway keep on looking into this and this is dr. James and thanks for watching you you</p>
