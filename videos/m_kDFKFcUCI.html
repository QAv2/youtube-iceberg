            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>It&#x27;s the age-old question that has fascinated humans for centuries and continues to. Are we alone in the universe or even on our own planet? My next guest says, &quot;Not only are UFOs or now they&#x27;re called UAPs, unidentified anomalous phenomena, that&#x27;s hard to remember, but UAPs real. But the government has allegedly been aware of them for decades and running a disinformation campaign to make you feel like an idiot if you believe reports about them. David Grush is a former US Air Force intelligence officer and senior intelligence official. He was his AY&#x27;s co-lead in UAP investigation and quote transmedium object analysis and reporting was reporting to the Pentagon&#x27;s UAP task force as well.</p>
<p>In 2023, Gush filed a whistleblower complaint asserting that the United States has been operating a quote multi-deade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program. meaning we&#x27;re taking what we find vehicles and trying to figure out how they operated and that Congress has been kept in the dark about large portions of the program. He later testified under oath before the House Oversight Committee, drawing national attention when he made this claim here. Watch. &gt;&gt; If you believe we have crashed craft uh stated earlier, do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? As I&#x27;ve stated publicly already in my NewsNation interview, uh, biologics came with some of these recoveries.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; Were they, I guess, human or non-human biologics? &gt;&gt; Non-human. And that was the assessment of people, uh, with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program. So, he&#x27;s alleging that we have crafts and we have nonhuman biologics from those crafts and that the American people are being kept in the dark about it. And he is not alone.</p>
<p>He is not alone. Now, Pentagon officials have publicly denied that there&#x27;s any verified evidence of non-human intelligence or secret programs of this kind. They&#x27;ve been denying it for 80 years. But now, a new documentary called The Age of Disclosure is taking center stage. It&#x27;s extraordinary, examining decades of this alleged secrecy, and they have everyone in this film.</p>
<p>The film features interviews with 34 former and current government officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Representative Anna Paulina Luna, who is also coming on in just a moment, who claim the US has long been concealing evidence of nonhuman [snorts] intelligence and UAPs. Here&#x27;s a part of the trailer. &gt;&gt; Humanity is not the only intelligence in the universe. &gt;&gt; Humanity is not the only intelligent species. We are absolutely not alone.</p>
<p>Non-human intelligence exists. &gt;&gt; UAPs are real. They&#x27;re here and they&#x27;re not human. &gt;&gt; I have seen with my own eyes non-human [music] craft and non-human beings. &gt;&gt; This is so secret.</p>
<p>Very, very few people in our entire government have been allowed access to it. &gt;&gt; Even presidents have been operating on a need to- know basis. But that begins [music] to ramp out of control. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not acceptable to have secret parts of government that no one ever sees. &gt;&gt; You better be careful about a government that doesn&#x27;t trust its people cuz there&#x27;s no telling what they&#x27;ll pull on you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s extraordinary. Let&#x27;s get into it. David joins me now. David, thank you so much for your service and for being here. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Melanie.</p>
<p>Thanks. Thanks, Megan. Thank you for having me on. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; No worries. uh this is like a crazy story and a stunning story and disturbing and I have to tell you I&#x27;ve always been sort of open-minded to this issue but more skeptical and I my skepticism is gone having watched the age of disclosure it&#x27;s incredibly well done &gt;&gt; and they&#x27;ve got everybody I mean all of the like astrophysicists and extremely well educated and accomplished scientists who have been investigating this from the start.</p>
<p>Well, not the start because it was 80 years ago, but in in recent decades on camera, on the record, saying as much as they can. And the director of the film has been making the rounds saying the only reason he was able to get so many people to participate is because they felt there was safety in numbers and that they couldn&#x27;t either fire everyone or worse because a lot of these guys, these are distinguished guys served in the Air Force like yourself or served the Pentagon, served all over the armed forces. A lot of these guys are actually worried not just about their careers getting killed but about them themselves getting killed. I mean, set it up for us on the stakes of the number of people who went on camera and actually started saying as much as they could without violating classified uh restrictions. &gt;&gt; Certainly, that&#x27;s a real fear and we we can certainly get into that.</p>
<p>Uh, agent disclosure was u, you know, a project I didn&#x27;t fully participate in. However, do I do applaud the effort uh in these individuals for at least uh coming forward and speaking and like you, I was a very skeptical person. Um, I was certainly open to the topic. Um I was interested in space and science in a very precocious way as a child. I ended up studying physics and the Air Force gave me a full ride scholarship and I was um obvious obviously open to the topic, but I was in positions of high trust in the government uh at the the most extreme levels uh having walked the halls of the West Wing uh personally handled the presidential daily intelligence brief and had some of the same broad accesses uh that the president and his cabinet has had over the years even as a as a young man across multiple uh administrations.</p>
<p>I figured um when I was eventually brought into this topic uh working for the UAP task force, oh I would know uh this exists. Somebody would have slipped and said something to me. At the time I was briefed to over 90% of all black programs in the Department of Defense um and uh also the intelligence community. And I had an arrogant opinion of the of the topic. I was certainly open to the idea, but I figured I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence and and uh I would have been briefed into those kind of things because I had a a need to know at the time.</p>
<p>So, I came into it very similar to you uh but open-minded. And then what what specifically were you assigned to where you started to see actual evidence that we&#x27;ve been researching this for 80 years that we do have crafts recovered that we have not that we have quote biologics recovered which include some sort of other being. And what was your reaction when you started to learn this? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was very skeptical. I was in my my military capacity. had a parallel civilian uh intelligence career as well.</p>
<p>Uh but in my my military reserve capacity, I was the backup intelligence director uh for the National Reconnaissance Offic&#x27;s uh operations center. I briefed uh the NRO director. That&#x27;s where I handled the PDB and I handled essentially all sensitive activities daily brief &gt;&gt; and and all that stuff. And so uh the UAP task force was looking for a representative from that organization. And I came in uh as a skeptical eye, haven&#x27;t briefed to a lot of um US programs and I was thinking, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll figure out what this is.</p>
<p>This might be some kind of US program, some prosaic natural phenomenon, some kind of adversarial program, some strategic technical surprise.&quot; Um but eventually uh as I started pulsing my networks uh digging into archives where we&#x27;ll just say certain programs forgot to fully clean out safe drawers and uh finding both audiovisisual uh documentation and then interviewing over 40 people all the way up to uh I&#x27;ll just say the cabinet level over the course of four years. Uh so a combination of oral testimony, audiovisisual evidence and documentation. uh I became convinced uh at a high confidence level uh that the US has engaged in a crash retrieval and reverse engineering operation of like the trailer you just played said uh non-human crafts and uh recovering you know the biologics as well. &gt;&gt; A new year means new financial goals like making sure your savings are secure and diversified.
