            <p>something comes into the frame and chasing and fires that what the hell could do that this time unexplained mysteries undercover UFOs will investigate important clues that prove the government is engaged in a massive UFO cover-up our government has flat-out lied to us for 40 years or more will show you the government&#x27;s distortion of the truth this is that&#x27;s lying through your teeth to the American people the military&#x27;s mysterious black projects based on alien technology it is this otherworldly technology that&#x27;s being applied to Air Force black projects the scientist who is ordered to study an alien UFO our group basically was to bec engineer them and see how it was fabricated and try and duplicate some of that technology with earthly materials the military cover-up of a dangerous UFO threat to our nuclear air bases whatever this one&#x27;s flying around could just penetrate all these defenses at will and the government&#x27;s use of threats and fear to suppress the truth the powers of being knew I was tired to use it would be a high price for me to pay you&#x27;ll find out why the government is reluctant to admit the possible existence of life on other planets the reason being that it could cause widespread social unrest and possible deterioration of government control we&#x27;ll hear from witnesses of saucer-shaped craft that might have been designed and built by the Air Force my gosh those are flying saucers those things really do exist you are final analysis in our products report as people who live off the government UFO conspiracy on unexplained mysteries undercover UFOs since the first sighting of a UFO evidence suggests the US government has lied to the American public to cover up the existence of alien spacecraft our government has flat-out lied tools for 40 years or more they&#x27;ve threatened people and intimidated people they&#x27;ve spied on UFO groups infiltrated UFO groups spied on researchers compiled dossiers their response is bordered on paranoia the CIA says that it does not collect information on UFOs and it hasn&#x27;t since the fifties there are reams of documents squeezed out of the CIA that indicate that they have on staff CIA UFO experts agency personnel monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis a lie the Air Force studied UFOs closely a squadron of pilots had a unique mission find and photograph UFOs pilot guy Kirkwood witnessed an amazing scene 16 unidentified objects two miles away they broke rank and started moving all over they were below as they were above us they were out in front of us and accelerating literally at lightning speed and a dot in the distance may be several miles away from you at that point maybe a pencil point all of a sudden closing on you at the rate of several thousand miles an hour and a 36-foot object which is basically almost the same size as our aircraft and 36 foot wingspan but all of a sudden this thing is just closing on you faster than you&#x27;re able to thing the Air Force suddenly terminated the UFO search squadrons years leader Kirkwood&#x27;s started talking about what he saw and two government agents accosted him and they said well the government doesn&#x27;t like the information being released and to continue could be detrimental to your help UFO experts maintain that the US government conducts research at a top-secret base in Nevada known as area 51 an aerospace engineer who worked there could not believe what he saw got out of the bus I was told to walk directly through the hangar and immediately even before entering the hangar you can see the edge of a disk this is your classic flying-saucer 2 inverted pie plates if you wish with a segmented larger area dome on top within minutes of that I finally realized that this had nothing to do was something the government was producing and that was quite shocking because everything inside was small this is a full-size craft 30 35 feet diameter maybe 40 but you&#x27;re looking at it seats that are you know 18 inches off the ground obviously made a purse for something smaller and certainly wasn&#x27;t made for children to play in the US government denies working on alien spacecraft they also deny that Robert Lazarre ever worked for them records of lazarz employment have vanished but two important items of information offers solid proof a w-2 form stating that he worked for Naval Intelligence and a listing of his name in a government lab phone book after Lazar came forward he was threatened by government agents many others suffered the same fate one after another had had visits from from government personnel who basically intimidated or told them to back off followed a morale I&#x27;ve been covering organized crime in Las Vegas for ten years dealing with the mob hit men and mob informants people who have been in the witness protection program the fear that is generated by this UFO subject for people who really know about it far outweighs the kind of fear that the mob inspires I mean people are more afraid of our government than they are of organized crime despite the risk Lazar maintains his conviction I am exactly sure of what I saw I know what mainstream science is like I know it where physic stands I know all of that and this is an extraterrestrial craft this technology has hundreds and hundreds of years in advance of us and that&#x27;s the end of that story the US government has a history of withholding secrets from the public LSD experiments on human subjects radiation tests over cities the stealth player project and the u-2 spy plane the government has a name for their policy of systemic line to the public it&#x27;s called disk information our government does it all the time there are even printed guidelines for how cover stories disinformation are supposed to work while serving in NATO headquarters Bob Dean saw super secret documents dealing with UFO sightings called the assessment I have to be honest with you and tell you that that information literally changed my life because I knew for the first time that this the subject was not fantasy it wasn&#x27;t myth wasn&#x27;t legend it was real it was true one of the reasons I&#x27;m violating my national security both is that I believe that the American people are losing their constitution because of the secrecy and the cover-up officially the government investigated ufos under the name Project Blue Book now I look upon Lou book the egg itself as a little bit of disinformation to tell the people yes we&#x27;re doing something when in reality blue book as we understood it was simply a public relations front many experts feel the government will go to any lengths to conceal the truth to give you an example of the most recent example of absurd disinformation was this incident involving the Roswell incident first the Air Force says it was a wettable and fifty years later they said gee guys were sorry it really wasn&#x27;t a weather balloon it was much more than that but it was a balloon project mogul well I&#x27;m tempted to use terms it you&#x27;ll have to bleep out this is that&#x27;s disinformation that&#x27;s lying through your teeth to the American people and if that isn&#x27;t this information I don&#x27;t know what is coming up the frightening UFO threat on our nuclear arsenal the classic flying-saucer and it shot a beam of something at our warhead find out about the military&#x27;s top-secret black projects area 51 is the most tightly secured installation in this country saw the object exhibit entirely unconventional flight characteristics the government search for extraterrestrial intelligence which was abruptly terminated the government would never make that leap of faith of the public would be able to handle the fact that we are receiving intelligent signals from somewhere else eyewitnesses who saw UFOs parked on an airbase and my intrest paper cup instantly when I begin to see literally hundreds of photographs of all types proton-proton sausage and the government conspiracy to crush the truth about UFOs I don&#x27;t think the military has any credibility with the public in terms of its denials of this program or that program and we&#x27;ll give you our ultimate account with our on x report stay tuned unexplored mysteries [Applause] unexplained mysteries undercover UFOs the longtime US policy of lies and disinformation may have put the public in danger security at several US nuclear missile bases was breached when I witnesses reported bright lights just 200 feet from the missile silos the speed it took off with I&#x27;d seen f-16s fly high rates of speed this was here and gone from a dead still hover wordsmith Air Force Base Oscoda Michigan shuddered now it was an important part of Strategic Air commands northern tier nuclear bomber retaliation force an alarm sounded when several unidentified objects showed up on radar and they were headed straight for the airbase stop Brock with an expedite scramble authentication time is 1906 scramble as UFOs flew towards the nuclear weapons storage areas jets tried to intercept them but by the time the pilots got there they were gone or at least a dozen US and Canadian military bases that were overblown during a three-week period air force personnel reported numerous sightings and radar contact of the UFOs in official documents all of the incidents took place near nuclear weapons facilities when one object came low over a weapon storage area that appeared to demonstrate a clear intent over this area meaning it seemed to have intelligence I was waking in the morning by a bright glowing orange colored light looked out over the creek there was a large glowing Orange Bowl shape object it hovered over there for I&#x27;d say good three to four minutes it sped off at a high rate of speed heading away from the airbase I was scared there&#x27;s fear run and throw me in their Public Accounts the Air Force officially denied all the reports it&#x27;s very difficult my military witnesses because they&#x27;re at the time covered by regulations I decided along with several other researchers the file Freedom of Information requests with the Pentagon the Air Force documents stated quote penetration of sensitive areas during the hours of darkness have prompted the implementation of security option three at our northern tier basis unquote the reason this is so significant and interesting is that they seem to be focused on atomic weapons these bases because of what things before there are massive retaliation capability therefore they were very high security basis whatever this one&#x27;s flying around who dis penetrate all these defenses at will the important question did the UFOs affect the missiles ability to launch Malmstrom Air Force Base had several intrusions near missile silos one involving an object which according to one witness hovered over the silo and somehow managed to change the tracking numbers on the missile according to the witness the missile had to be removed and retooled to make it work again and to see this not in UFO books but in government military messages was a real eye-opener and I think that if the public had known that at the time it would have been great a lot about ten years before air force lieutenant Robert clips witnessed something remarkable hairs went up on the back of my neck right now thinking about it just remembering that day I saw something that was so strange that it changed my life Jacobs was in charge of a special unit that filmed Minuteman and Atlas missiles during mulch tests from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California my job was to provide photographic documentation from 30 or 40 different camera positions for each launch the walk down to the missile we saw all three stages of powered flight the camera followed the missile through its successful flight what we didn&#x27;t know is what else we had got besides the missile soon after project director of the wrens management called Jacobs into his office there were two guys and gray suits in their civilian clothes and we&#x27;re not in the Air Force they were from somewhere else they never identified themselves they could have been CIA OSI OSS all four of the man watched the film of the missile flight the nose cone spread out the warhead was quite plainly visible something flew into the frame what I saw was a circular object of the classic flying-saucer and it shot a beam of something at our warhead f2 imagine this thing is flying along at several thousand miles an hour this stuff is fun long and something comes into the frame and chasing it and comes in like this and fires at it and goes around like this and fire that and goes around like this and fire that it requires that I like this then goes back out that way what the hell could do that suddenly Jacobs was in the hot seat and he said what was that I said it looks to me like we got a UFO he said you are never to say that as far as you&#x27;re concerned lieutenant Jacobs this never happened and I was sworn to silence reminded of a security of the severity of a security breach and told to leave the room after keeping silent for many years Jacobs went public the Air Force responded with complete denial the Air Force deny that I was ever there despite the existence of the film the Air Force denied the Jacobs was in charge of the special photo unit they even denied he was in the Air Force at the time they denied everything records reveal that Jacobs was in the Air Force that he was in charge of the photo unit and that he was filming that day major mannesmann his commanding officer who screened the film with him wrote a letter confirming Jacobs account of the UFO the Air Force is probably not going to like this film but there&#x27;s nothing they can do about it it exists it documents the telescope the people who were there including me and if there are any ramifications about it I guess I just don&#x27;t care anymore next on unexplained mysteries is there a connection between top-secret black projects and UFO sightings certainly some of these things are going to look very strange very unlike aircraft of which people are familiar is the military using alien technology in its black projects I think the technology at area 51 originally came from somewhere else and what happens to people who want to get close to area 51 I think that could be the biggest and perhaps the last mistake they are going to make in her life we&#x27;ll show you why Meza terminated its own probe that was getting information to running on Mars they said that NASA or the government might want to consider keeping information from the public and the government abruptly stopped its search for extraterrestrial life for certain people that&#x27;s not something that they want to either believe in or allow anybody to know that they believe will expose what the government does to military officers who report UFOs I got letters from high-ranking officers that they had no record of such an aircraft ever existed and will sum up the UFO conspiracy in our on extra it&#x27;s much more to come on unexplained mysteries recovery UFOs black projects that&#x27;s the name for secret military development efforts certainly some of these things are going to look very strange that very unlike aircraft with which people are familiar there seems to be a connection between black projects and UFO sightings well certainly the history of the flying saucer phenomena suggests that in the past classified programs resulted in a lot of reports of flying saucers and if you see all of the instances where conventional aircraft have been misinterpreted as flying saucers it&#x27;s quite easy to understand how unconventional aircraft could receive a similar misinterpretation the Nevada desert we have things out there that are literally out of this world Groom Lake Nevada also known as area 51 where experts believe the military is working on top secret projects they have a hangar in the south end of the ramp that appears have doors that are almost 200 feet tall 400 feet why you put anything in there one of the problems associated Groom Lake is the fact that is a place if that does not officially exist area 51 is the most tightly secured installation in this country it&#x27;s guarded both over the air and on the ground by elite Air Force security police and Department of Energy Special Response Teams if someone came to me and said there&#x27;s just absolutely nothing that secret and they decided they were going to hike into area 51 I think that could be the biggest and perhaps the last mistake they are going to make in their life there are rumors of a secret project called Aurora in which the Air Force is said to be inventing a craft using highly advanced technology I think there&#x27;s a strong possibility that we have recovered some sort of alien technology and are trying to incorporate that into military programs are they really hiding something that&#x27;s this totally alien it is this otherworldly technology that&#x27;s being applied to Air Force black projects sonic booms have been reported in Los Angeles evidence of high-speed unidentified craft they&#x27;ve been traced back to Groom Lake Nevada we really can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s moving the only thing we see is there&#x27;s a sonic boom that&#x27;s telling us that something is moving faster than speed of sound so actually we can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s an airplane the military maintains its position of denial every time that there&#x27;s a story about Aurora or the TR 38 Black Manta in the popular science or the New York Times or something else Congress calls the Pentagon on the carpet and says what&#x27;s the deal they want to know if these planes exist and every time they&#x27;ve asked about those planes they&#x27;ve been told there is no such thing the military&#x27;s established a pattern of denial concerning these highly capricious wild aircraft beginning in the late 50s and continuing to this day to UFO experts investigated area 51 up close they saw several red orange objects in the sky they started at great height seemed to descend and then flared out I was startling then a series of silver pewter flashes went directly across the horizon at terrific speed one of these silver flashes went directly up into the air the bottom one seemed nearly to hug the ground when they tried to leave the base they were stopped by security boom headlights come on that was an m16 pointed at us and here we were faced with life in that situation but we also knew that we across the line back in the public domain and therefore we were safe three months later mark farmers saw the same way orange flying objects I saw the object exhibit entirely unconventional flight characteristics at times it would wobble around in the sky and appear very unstable at other times it would be in a rock-hard hover it was a braided sphere multicolored crimson on bottom blue green on top much brighter than anything else in the sky Robert Lazarre the aerospace engineer who worked at area 51 is convinced that these objects were experimental air force craft developed from alien technology he claims there are at least nine flying saucers steward there I was part of a back engineering group and our job was basically to look at these recovered discs and I say recovered because I don&#x27;t know really where they came from with her given to us we found I&#x27;m John him down who knows what but our group basically was to Beck engineering which means to start with a finished product and go backward and see how it was fabricated and try and duplicate some of that technology with earthly materials Judy Bob Lazar is credible over the past couple of years I&#x27;ve spoken to literally dozens of people who have worked at that facility out there in Nevada I think the technology at area 51 originally came from somewhere else the military disavows any knowledge of the alien technology program I don&#x27;t think the military has any credibility with the public in terms of its denials of this program or that program they&#x27;ve denied the you to exist that they deny the sr-71 existed they denied working on stealth all of those programs suddenly were unveiled coming up on unexplained mysteries the destruction of one of NASA&#x27;s most valuable space probes was an intentional not lose transmission they turned it off the promising search for extraterrestrial intelligence that the government ended abruptly if our government knew that we got signal from outer space they clamp a lid on it the mysterious UFO sightings on the ground at MacDill Air Force Base there was nearly a hundred feet across the military headquarters for a secret UFO intelligence team wright-patterson had something unique to our government and that was the technical intelligence organization and the government&#x27;s refusal to divulge UFO secrets a lot of people say well how can something be kept secret the f-117 stealth fighter was kept secret for approximately ten year and you&#x27;ll get the ultimate run down without on X report more secrets revelations next on unexplained mysteries unexplained mysteries undercover UFOs the government&#x27;s cover-up of alien life extends to other planets the unmanned Mars Observer was packed with sensitive data gathering equipment but it never completed its mission NASA blamed the failure on technical malfunction but experts think there&#x27;s more to NASA&#x27;s story it starts with a strange area on the red planet known as Cydonia it&#x27;s quite possible that NASA knows more about anomalous structures on Mars possible extraterrestrial even structures on our moon that they&#x27;re not telling us about there is sufficient evidence to indicate that some of the objects on Mars may possibly be artificial Nexus is the objects on Mars are just light and shadow but 3d imaging reveals something startling oh it&#x27;s quite interested with the first photos and release and face on Mars but particularly I thought was interesting the pyramidal structures some of these pyramids appear to have even a central stairway running up and down them the more we look at these structures the more we can see that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s something amazing here did NASA create a convenient malfunction to hide archaeological evidence of alien life yep some people want to go far beyond the edge of what&#x27;s accepted in terms of imagery see patterns on the rocks of Mars or on the moon in the rings of Saturn my view to that is Mazel Tov go ahead do it try it out make the proposals these objects if you major carefully from the tops of the five that surround the city square one you find an almost perfectly symmetrical Pentagon the Brookings Institution prepared a report for NASA it contains a shocking recommendation there is a section on what might occur if evidence of extraterrestrial existence was found on other planets they said that NASA or the government might want to consider keeping information from the public the reason being that it could cause widespread social unrest and possible deterioration of government control NASA claims the observer had an electrical failure it did not lose transmission they turned it off and they turn it off after the instructions for going into orbit had been uploaded to the spacecraft it was possible then that spacecraft would go ahead follow out those instructions and go into orbit before we start saying how these rocket scientists messed up and they did mess up we have to keep realizing just how tough projects are that we&#x27;re doing things out there in space every time we do it that no one even thought was possible deck two years in decades ago the search for extraterrestrial intelligence huge radio telescopes aimed at the sky their purpose to capture radio signals from alien civilizations but the program is shrouded in secrecy I think if our government knew that we got signals a dedicated signal from outer space somewhere they&#x27;d clamp a lid on it our source a space program at Geneva knew the risks The Powers That Be knew I was talking you there would be a high price for me to pay after years of denying the existence of UFOs the government abruptly decides to spend millions on searching for aliens but there&#x27;s a catch it&#x27;s very hard to believe that the government would allow something this extraordinary to be released the general public without scrutiny and censorship in the Mojave Desert the government set up Goldstone station on a military base it&#x27;s RF quiet which means there&#x27;s not a lot of background noise when they&#x27;re looking for signals it&#x27;s really ideal for this type of search soon after coming online the telescopes picked up signals called hits there were hits that we&#x27;re taken seriously there were three four hits to my knowledge that were strong and it could potentially be a signal from an extraterrestrial intelligence then the government suddenly shut down the program it was a cheap shot for the budget posers when they were so called the deficit hawks it&#x27;s always easy easier to make fun of something that you are or enough your constituents don&#x27;t understand but some experts take issue with that explanation if they embrace the concept of looking for alien signals they also have to acknowledge the fact that the alien signals are coming from an extraterrestrial intelligence somewhere and for certain people that&#x27;s not something that they want to either believe in or allow anybody to know that they believe in some people believe the National Security Agency killed City because it feared the public would panic their history in action in the past is a good warning of what they would do if something like this happened SETI was resurrected by several major corporations and renamed project Phoenix but the government maintained a strong though unpublicized presence if the hits do come down they will be suppressed I don&#x27;t think anybody will take a chance the government would never make that leap of faith that the public would be able to handle the fact that we are receiving intelligent signals from another race creature something from somewhere else next pot unexplained mysteries the air force officer who saw a number of UFO my gosh those are flying saucers those things really do exist or were the experimental military planes a lot of people say they&#x27;re from deep space they can just as easily be around this world find out how the military dealt with questions about the aircraft had no record of such an aircraft ever existed if we get to the truth about the UFO conspiracy in the unexplored next on unexplained mysteries unexplained mysteries undercover UFOs reports are increasing of ufos spotted at air bases but with a striking difference these craft are on the ground macdill air force base florida 1967 an officer witnesses an inconceivable site we were near a restricted area of the base and all the sudden we saw four aircraft parked out there and our immediate reaction to each other was my gosh those are flying saucers those things really do exist Pickett published the Air Force Base newspaper he wanted to do an article about the craft he&#x27;d seen including photos I was called up to the adjutant general&#x27;s office he went over to a file cabinet and got out a whole bunch of photographs and he proceeded to lay these photographs out on a large table so that I could look at them well of course I my interest payer perked up instantly when I begin to see literally hundreds of photographs of all types of quote-unquote flying saucers the Air Force refused to allow Pickett to publish the article that night eyewitnesses in Miami reported a large number of UFO sightings at the air base the next day the flying saucers were gone the images have haunted Pickett for years desperate for some kind of explanation he recently contacted former Air Force intelligence officer George filer a lot of people say well how can something be kept secret for 50 years well I point out that the f-117 stealth fighter was kept secret for approximately 10 years and most of us didn&#x27;t know that existed until the government released the information I pointedly asked him not only are these where the flying saucers stories came from is this what they were anything yes well I was awestruck I couldn&#x27;t really believe I was seeing what I was saying some of those photographs had many many aircraft in them and they were all easily identifiable as Air Force photographs are and I asked him well how high and how fast could these things go you hear all these story and he said well this particular aircraft could go fast enough and high enough to actually achieve space flight and I had no idea when he was telling me this story that wouldn&#x27;t be too long before they were declared non existent to this day Pickett is determined to prove what he saw was real this is a illustration of one of the largest ones part down in fact it was the largest there was nearly a hundred feet across but when Pickett tried recently to get the photographs and documentation of the craft the Air Force said no when I initially wrote I begin to get answers back they&#x27;d had been didn&#x27;t have the faintest idea of what I was talking about I got letters from high-ranking officers that they had no record of such an aircraft ever existed so I knew that it was top-secret yet many UFO experts believe the technology for the saucer shaped aircraft came from an alien spaceship that crashed near roswell new mexico in 1947 at that time if the military had recovered a downed UFO they would have transported it to wright-patterson Air Base in Ohio wright-patterson had something unique to our government and that was the technical intelligence organization so-called p2 or what became the foreign technology division this is the sort of division that would have been appropriate to use for the investigation of UFO research three former wright-patterson employees filed aircraft patent requests the designs looked suspiciously like flying saucers some people think their inspiration was the extraterrestrial craft that crashed near Roswell so there&#x27;s something out there that people are saying the question of course is who do they belong to a lot of people say they&#x27;re from deep space you know but they could just as easily be from this world next the onyx report the answers you want to hear about UFOs are they alien spacecraft military aircraft or advanced Air Force vehicles based on harvested alien technology you&#x27;ll hear the final word on the possible UFO threat and military cover-up and we&#x27;ll take one last look at the military&#x27;s intimidation of innocent UFO witnesses we&#x27;ll wrap it all up for you with our uh next report with unexplained mysteries returns [Applause] and now for the unexpected experts believe the US government is conducting a massive conspiracy to keep evidence about UFOs and aliens from the public the military&#x27;s established a pattern of denial concerning these highly capricious wild aircraft beginning in the late 50s and continuing to this day thousands of witnesses have reported seeing unknown flying craft with similar details a 36-foot object which is basically almost the same size as our aircraft including ship but we&#x27;ve been is a full-size craft 30 35 feet diameter this is your classic flying-saucer if something comes into the frame and chasing it and comes in like this and fires at it and goes around like this and fire that and goes around like this and fires that it fires it I like isn&#x27;t goes back out that way what the hell could do that the government UFO conspiracy begins with denial and he said what was that and I said it looks to me like we got a UFO and he said you are never to say that again as far as you&#x27;re concerned lieutenant Jacobs this never happened the government even has a word for its systematic pattern of Lies disinformation our government does it all the time there are even printed guidelines for how cover stories disinformation are supposed to work this is that&#x27;s disinformation that&#x27;s lying through your teeth to the American people the conspiracy uses threats and intimidation even targeting military personnel the powers of being knew I was parked you do with the high price we need to pay they&#x27;ve threatened people and intimidated people they&#x27;ve spied on UFO groups infiltrated UFO groups spied on researchers compiled dossiers their response is bordered on paranoia and they said well the government doesn&#x27;t like the information being released and to continue could be detrimental to the military cover-up conceals UFO regions of national security that in one object blow over or weapon storage area that appeared to demonstrate a clear and end over this area meaning it seemed to have intelligence the conspiracy withholds reports of radio signals from outer space that confirm the existence of alien life it&#x27;s very hard to believe that the government would allow something this extraordinary to be released the general public without scrutiny and censorship and the government denies the reverse engineering of their infamous black projects I think there&#x27;s a strong possibility that we have recovered some sort of alien technology and are trying to incorporate that into military program I got letters from high-ranking officers that they had no record of such an aircraft ever industry secrets can be kept secrets are kept and every time they&#x27;ve asked about those planes they&#x27;ve been pwned there is no such thing what does our government hide information on extraterrestrial life from us the reason being that it could cause widespread social unrest and possible deterioration of government control howdy proof of government cover-up when their tools are denial and disinformation only facts made public will verify the conspiracy until then it will remain an unexplained mystery our government has flat-out lied to for 40 years or more [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] they are going to make in their life there are rumors of a secret project called Aurora in which the Air Force is said to be inventing a craft using highly advanced technology I think there&#x27;s a strong possibility that we have recovered some sort of alien technology and are trying to incorporate that into military programs are they really hiding something that&#x27;s this totally alien it is this otherworldly technology that&#x27;s being applied to Air Force black projects sonic booms have been

wasn&#x27;t myth wasn&#x27;t legend it was real it was true one of the reasons I&#x27;m violating my national security oh is that I believe that the American people are losing their constitution because of the secrecy and the cover-up officially the government investigated ufos under the name Project Blue Book now I look upon Blue Book Day itself as a little bit of this information to tell the people yes we&#x27;re doing something when in reality blue book as we understood it was simply a public relations front many experts feel the government will go to any lengths to conceal the truth to give you an example of the most recent example of absurd this information was this incident involving the Roswell incident unexplained mysteries undercover UFOs the government&#x27;s cover-up of alien life extends to other planets the unmanned Mars Observer was packed with sensitive data gathering equipment but it never completed its mission NASA blamed the failure on technical malfunction but experts think there&#x27;s more to NASA&#x27;s story it starts with a strange area on the red planet known as Cydonia it&#x27;s quite possible that NASA knows more about anomalous structures on Mars possible extra fresh build even structures on our Moon that they&#x27;re not telling us about there is sufficient evidence to indicate that some of the objects on Mars may possibly be artificial nASA says the objects on Mars are just light and shadow but 3d imaging reveal something startling oh it&#x27;s quite interested with and most of us didn&#x27;t know that existed until the government released the information I pointedly asked him not only are these where the flying saucers stories came from is this what they were and he said yes well I was awestruck I couldn&#x27;t really believe I was seeing what I was saying some of those photographs had many many aircraft in the and they were all easily identifiable as Air Force photographs are and i asked him well how high and how fast could these things go you hear all these stories and he said well this particular aircraft could go fast enough and high enough to actually achieve space flight and I had no idea when he was telling me this story that wouldn&#x27;t be too long before they were declared non-existent to this day Pickett is determined to prove what he saw was real this is a illustration of one of the largest ones Park down in fact it was the largest it was nearly our warhead find out about the military&#x27;s top-secret black projects area 51 is the most tightly secured installation in this country saw the object exhibit entirely unconventional like characteristics the government search for extraterrestrial intelligence which was abruptly terminated the government would never make that leap of faith of the public would be able to handle the fact that we are receiving intelligent signals from somewhere else eyewitnesses who saw UFOs parked on an airbase my interest peppered up instantly when I begin to see literally hundreds of photographs of all types of unquote flying saucers and the government conspiracy to crush the truth about UFOs I don&#x27;t think the military has any credibility with the public in terms of its denials of this program or that program and we&#x27;ll give you our ultimate account with our on x report stay tuned the reason this is so significant and interesting is that there seem to be focused on atomic weapons these bases because of what things good for there are massive retaliation capability therefore there were very high security bases whatever this one&#x27;s flying around who dis penetrate all these defenses at will the important question did the UFOs effect the missiles ability to launch Malmstrom Air Force Base had several intrusions near missile silos one involving an object which according to one witness hovered over the silo and somehow managed to change the tracking numbers on the missile according to the witness the missile had to be removed and retooled to make it work again and to see this not in UFO books but in government military messages was a real eye-opener and I think that if the public had known that at the time it would have been great a lot sure though but 3d imaging reveals something startling oh it&#x27;s quite interested with the first photos and relieves some face on art but particularly I thought was interesting the pyramidal structures some of these pyramids appear to have even a central stairway running up and down them the more we look at these structures the more we can see that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s something amazing here did NASA create a convenient malfunction to hide archaeological evidence of alien life yep some people want to go far beyond the edge or what&#x27;s accepted in terms of imagery see patterns on the rocks of Mars or on the moon or in the rings of Saturn my view to that is Mazel Tov go ahead do it try it out make the proposals these objects if you measure carefully from the tops of the five that surround the they are going to make in their life we&#x27;ll show you why Mensa terminated its own probe that was getting information to running on Mars they said that NASA or the government might want to consider keeping information from the public and the government abruptly stopped its search for extraterrestrial life we&#x27;re certain people that&#x27;s not something that they want to either believe in or allow anybody to know that they believe will expose what the government does to military officers who report UFOs I got letters from high-ranking officers that they had no record of such an aircraft ever officially and will sum up the UFO conspiracy in our on extra Wars there&#x27;s much more to come on unexplained mysteries recover UFOs black projects that&#x27;s the name for secret military development efforts certainly some of these things are going to look very strange that very unlike aircraft with which people are familiar there seems to be a connection between black projects and UFO sightings well certainly the history of the flying saucer phenomena suggests that in the past classified programs resulted in a lot of reports of flying saucers and if you see all of the instances where conventional aircraft have been misinterpreted as flying saucers it&#x27;s quite easy to understand how unconventional aircraft could receive a similar misinterpretation the Nevada desert we have things out there that they&#x27;re literally out of this world Groom Lake Nevada also known as area 51 we&#x27;re experts believe the military is working on top secret projects they have a hangar in the south end of the ramp that appears have doors that are almost 200 feet tall 400 feet why you put anything in there one of the problems so I say with groom Lake is the fact that is a place if that does not officially exist area 51 is the most tightly secured installation in this country it&#x27;s guarded both over the air and on the ground by elite Air Force security police and Department of Energy Special Response Teams if someone came to me and said there&#x27;s just absolutely nothing that secret and they decided they were going to hike into area 51 I think that could be the biggest and perhaps the last mistake they are going to make in their life there are rumors of a secret project called Aurora in which the Air Force is said to be inventing a craft using highly advanced technology I think there&#x27;s a strong possibility that we have recovered some sort of alien technology and are trying to incorporate that into military programs are they really hiding something that&#x27;s that&#x27;s told the alien it is this otherworldly technology that&#x27;s being applied to Air Force black projects sonic booms have been reported in Los Angeles evidence of high-speed unidentified craft they&#x27;ve been traced back to Groom Lake Nevada we really can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s moving the only thing we see is there&#x27;s a sonic boom and that&#x27;s telling us that something is moving faster than speed of sound so actually we can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s an airplane the military maintains its position of denial every time that there&#x27;s a story about Aurora or the TR 38 Black Manta in the popular science or the New York Times or something else Congress calls the Pentagon on the carpet and says what&#x27;s the deal they want to know if these planes exist and every time they&#x27;ve asked about those planes they&#x27;ve been told there is no such thing the military&#x27;s established a pattern of denial concerning these highly capricious wild aircraft beginning in the late 50s and continuing to this day to UFO experts investigated area 51 up close they saw several red orange objects in the sky they started at great height seemed to descend and then flared out I was startling then a series of silver pewter flashes went directly across the horizon at terrific speed one of these silver flashes went directly up into the air the bottom one seemed nearly to hug the ground when they tried to leave the base they were stopped by security boom I&#x27;d like to come on that was an m16 pointed at us and here we were faced with life in that situation but we also knew that we had crossed the line back in the public domain and therefore we were said three months later mark farmers saw the same way flying objects I saw the object exhibit entirely unconventional flight characteristics at times it would wobble around in the sky and appear very unstable at other times it would be in a rock-hard hover it was a breaded sphere multicolored crimson on bottom blue green on top much brighter than anything else in the sky Robert Lazarre the aerospace engineer who worked at area 51 is convinced that these objects were experimental Air Force craft developed from alien technology he claims there are at least nine flying saucers steward there I was part of a back engineering group and our job was basically to look at these recovered discs and I say recovered because I don&#x27;t know really where they came from well they&#x27;re given to us we found I&#x27;m John him down who knows what but our group basically was to Beck engineering which means to start with a finished product and go backward and see how it was fabricated and try and duplicate some of that technology with earthly materials to be Bob Lazar is credible over the past couple of years I&#x27;ve spoken to literally dozens of people who have worked at that facility out there in Nevada I think the technology at area 51 originally came from somewhere else the military disavows any knowledge of the alien technology program I don&#x27;t think the military has any credibility with the public in terms of its denials of this program or that program they&#x27;ve denied the you to exist that they deny the sr-71 existed they denied working on stealth all of those programs suddenly were unveiled coming up on unexplained mysteries the destruction of one of NASA&#x27;s most valuable space probes was an intentional did not lose transmission they turned it off the promising search for extraterrestrial intelligence that the government ended abruptly if our government knew that we got signal from outer space they plant a lid on it the mysterious UFO sightings on the grill at MacDill Air Force Base there was nearly a hundred feet at Prague the military headquarters for a secret UFO intelligence team wright-patterson had something unique to our government and that was the technical intelligence organization and the government&#x27;s refusal to divulge UFO secrets a lot of people say well how can something be kept secret the f-117 stealth fighter was kept secret for approximately ten year and you&#x27;ll get the ultimate rundown more secrets more revelations next on unexplained mysteries unexplained mysteries undercover UFOs the government&#x27;s cover-up of alien life extends to other planets the unmanned Mars Observer was packed with sensitive data gathering equipment but it never completed its mission NASA blamed the failure on technical malfunction but experts think there&#x27;s more to NASA&#x27;s story it starts with a strange area on the red planet known as Cydonia quite possible that NASA knows more about anomalous structures on Mars possibly</p>
