            <p>What if the greatest scientific discovery in human history has already been made? A technology so powerful its very existence was buried, deemed too dangerous for the wrong hands, then hit inside their most advanced aircraft. What if the men who built the impossible confessed they&#x27;d unlocked the secrets to the stars and no one was listening? In the 1950s, the world was promised gravitydefying engines. Then the topic went dark. Imagine a time when defying gravity wasn&#x27;t just science fiction, but front page news. The November 1956 issue of Young Men boldly proclaimed, &quot;The G engines are coming.&quot; Aerospace giants like Martin, Convair, and Lear proudly announced they were funding research into anti-gravity propulsion.</p>
<p>It was hailed as the next great leap for mankind. Nick Cook wrote in his book, The Hunt for Zero Point. The evidence was suggesting that in the mid 1950s, there had been some kind of breakthrough in the anti-gravity field. And for a small window in time, people had talked about it freely and openly, believing they were witnessing the dawn of a new era, one that would benefit the whole of mankind. Then in 1957, everyone had stopped talking about it.</p>
<p>Had the military woken up to what was happening, bringing the clams down, it would only be if it were the case that in fact we have mastered anti-gravity and they&#x27;re being built by aerospace corporations. Then new physics would have to be involved.</p>
