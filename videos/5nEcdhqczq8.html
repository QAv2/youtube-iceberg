            <p>anti-gravity propulsion systems things that can operate without igniting Fuel and pushing something out that they operate in some completely different way that utilizes gravity and almost can instantaneously transport to new places essentially fold space time um I don&#x27;t know so there there&#x27;s there&#x27;s things that the government does where they have these programs and the people that are sworn into these programs whether they&#x27;re the physicists or you know the metallurgists or whoever these people are that are working on these programs they don&#x27;t tell anybody</p>
