            <p>can you afford a $300,000 home if you make $75,000 a year well let&#x27;s go through the numbers if you buy a $300,000 home let&#x27;s say you put down a 3% down payment plus 3% of closing cost is going to be $118,000 cash upfront then you get a 7% interest rate would put your principal and interest payment at $1,936 plus 550 a month for taxes and insurances bringing you to a grand total of $2,486 a month now let&#x27;s look and see what you can qualify for $75,000 the lender is typically going to use about a 40% debt to income ratio meaning that you would have a $30,000 allowance divided by 12 putting you at $2500 a month so you barely qualify by 14 bucks but you do qualify that&#x27;s if you have no debt now here&#x27;s the next step can you afford it cuz if you make $75,000 a year your take-home pay after taxes 401k and health insurance is going to sit around 4,300 so this 2486 payment would take up 57% of your take-home pay so make sure you sit down with your lender and your family to make sure you can qualify and comfortably afford the payment so you don&#x27;t end up house pouring</p>
