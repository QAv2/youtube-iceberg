            <p>all right hello everyone I am Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos uh we are uh about to do the 56th um video on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson that&#x27;s a Theory of Everything uh that he arrived at uh in the 20th century up until his death in 1990 and uh the basic gist of it is that the uh unlike the Greeks who thought that the Universe was made out of atoms or matter and or Einstein who uh revised that and uh said that it was made out of energy uh look like matter but made out of energy Larson said that the Universe was made out of motion emotion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other they have the same qualities um otherwise meaning that they have three dimensions or three or four dimensions and they have uh they both progress they both are progressing time is always getting later space is always getting further apart and they are both quantized they both have a minimum unit one unit of time and there&#x27;s a minimum one unit of space and one unit of space per one unit of time is the speed of light and uh the speed of light is not the maximum speed of the universe as Einstein said but it is the midpoint of the universe of the neutral point that uh half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light half is moving slower than the speed of light a half that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light is what we&#x27;re familiar with he calls it the material sector or sector one and in this material sector there are chemical chemist atoms and molecules and these atoms and molecules grow by aggregation by just glimming onto each other and they grow up to their most complex form which is DNA billions of atoms per molecule and at that point they become eligible to be taken under the control of a cosmic unit a unit that is moving faster than the speed of light um from the cosmic sector or sector two and so sector two is a control unit it takes control over the sector one unit and um when a sector one and sector two unit are combined Larson calls that the life unit and so the life unit is uh kind of what we&#x27;re talking about um and then it can also become under the general control of the region that is independent of space and time it calls sector three uh which is uh you know another word for uh the spirit or God and that um he calls it sector three Bruce Perrette one of his um you know followers uh divided that sector 3 up into many different sectors as well um and that you might also look at my videos on Tree of Life for that um you know the whole um upper part of the tree is like a division divisions of the spirit and but the spiritual aspect is brought into uh this through sector three but right now we&#x27;re looking at chapter 14 of his book beyond space and time his final book that came out after he died which is on metaphysical matters unlike um most of his earlier books that are on hard science astronomy and physics and chemistry this one is on psychology and religion and um philosophy and we&#x27;re looking at chapter 14 that&#x27;s called thinking and memory and right now he just had was talking about memory a little bit and I&#x27;m just keep in mind that the thinking and the memory is really a sector two um component uh set the Hallmark of sector 2 once sector two becomes its most complex then it can become under the control of sector three but it&#x27;s most complex is the intelligent human being so uh gaining memory is a step in sector two toward becoming this intelligent human being so it&#x27;s not eligible um yet for uh sector three control okay so now he&#x27;s talking about memory and how it operates on the association process and that uh Association um can be uh just a general Association or it can be close uh there can be closer associations um you know depending on how specific the association is right so we&#x27;ll take over here at the beginning of chapter 14. not the very beginning but a couple pages in from the memory standpoint an idea and it&#x27;s direct opposites are very closely associated whereas our thought process places them far apart likewise memory makes little or no distinction between an event in the past and a simpler event in the future whereas there is a very clear line of demarcation between past and future in rational thinking the difference between thought and action is often disregarded by memory but to our Consciousness it is very important memory identifies some persons as individuals but tends to group The Others the first result of an attempt to recall one member of the group will often be a memory of another members of large families frequently call each other by the wrong names usually but not always correcting it immediately in these cases memory accepts the first of the names as being close enough but catches thought quickly rejects it so memory kind of is is more based on close enough uh and Consciousness uh or thoughts conscious thought is uh too specific for that to be accepting of close enough a type of recall from the memory storage that is widely used in clinical and investigative work is called free association free association consists of letting the mind wander in a completely free and apparently aimless manner actually however completely free recall cannot be obtained as long as the subject is conscious his thinking mechanism always retains enough control to keep the memory recall rational to censor objectionable items and so on in this present work we will have occasion to deal with Association processes which are free of from all control and which call up memories without the intervention of any thought process this is the pure memory mechanism the process which must exist in the lower animals that do not have the ability to think in order to avoid confusion with the psychologist&#x27;s free association we will refer to this completely free association process as uncontrolled Association if goal-oriented thinking is suspended for any significant length of time the result is daydreaming or fantasy rather than uncontrolled Association momentary relaxation of the controls does however occur frequently these are the intervals in which sensory or other stimuli of which one may not even be aware trigger unexpected and in some cases surprising recollections in the ordinary Affairs of Life the memories called up by association during these interim periods are usually no more than distractions however in some kinds of uh in those kinds of reasoning or problem solving where some thinking along unconventional lines may be Advent advantageous a partial relaxation of the controls is often helpful in as much as it gives the association process more leeway the number and variety of memories called up during such processes are as free association or daydreaming is mainly due to the fact that the memory mechanism has some special Provisions for handling what we may call a working supply of information this transient aspect of memory is not given much if any attention in current work in this area and the information that we need for present purposes is not available from the memory studies that have heretofore been made we can however deduce that in view of the continual Interruption of one&#x27;s Thinking by the stream of messages coming in through the senses it would not be feasible to carry on any extended program of activity unless there were some special memory mechanism in operation to bring the thought processes back to the task that was underway when an interruption occurred otherwise the first foreign thought would divert attention to different channels and there would be no way of getting back except by accident furthermore human activities are usually too complex to permit giving undivided attention to one specific line of thought for any extended period of time almost always the task to which thought is being applied has features which require special consideration safety precautions for example and there are always other aspects of life that must be given attention from time to time personal needs responsibilities commitments to other persons Etc in order to receive attention these items must have representation in the working memory experience indicates that this memory is so organized that each of the items in the working stock returns to the cons to the Consciousness periodically for example if a person has an appointment at a certain time his working memory periodically reminds him to look at a clock meanwhile this memory will from time to time break in upon his goal-oriented thinking to remind him of other matters that need his attention either in thought or in action this observed memory pattern can most appropriately be described as calling it a circulating memory system okay so he&#x27;s talking about working memory this is the memory that reminds you every so often periodically of certain things that you need to take care of um you know whether it&#x27;s the time or whether uh you know whether it&#x27;s time for an appointment or whether there&#x27;s another matter that uh you know there are things that we do on a daily basis that um you know it it kind of reminds you that you&#x27;re supposed to attend to this um because if you can get into the goal-oriented thinking um and you lose track of that you become you know somewhat what you call absent-minded or like the absent-minded Professor who&#x27;s so focused on their goal-oriented thinking of their their research project that they forget to you know uh brush their teeth or they forget to um you know do take out the garbage or whatever the the most basic uh things that they&#x27;re they have to um do on a daily basis so he&#x27;s saying that this circulating memory or this working memory is there to periodically remind you that uh there are certain uh things that you need to take care of uh and so it interrupts our goal and goal-oriented thinking we often hear someone say that he has several things on his mind this does not mean that he is continually thinking about all of them indeed he cannot think about any of them while he is actually engaged in disposing of the minute by minute items that demand his attention what he is really expressing by his statement is that his circulating memory system is in interrupting his thought processes periodically to remind him that these matters are still outstanding most of those who have occasion to deal with complex problems requiring intensive study and Analysis tend to develop an ability to shut out sounds and other sense stimuli so that they can concentrate their full attention on their current task when this preoccupation with the primary thought objective is carried to an extreme it results in blocking out some or all of the circulating memory as well as the sense signals producing the condition known as absent-mindedness the circulating memory system is no doubt a later evolutionary development than the Primitive memory storage but it must have been present in very early animals first requirement for the survival of the small and weak is Vigilance and to be vigilant while keeping one&#x27;s primary attention on the serious business of getting enough to eat requires constant reminding nothing complicated is needed all that is necessary is to call attention periodically to the general idea of danger once a system capable of accomplishing this uh purpose was in operation it was available for extension to other memory items and in the human mind the circulating memories cover a wide range of subjects the evidence which we will examine indicates however that the non-specific nature of the circulating memories has been retained and unlike the memory input into storage which consists mainly of detailed experiences most of the circulating memories are merely General ideas or Impressions with only a minimum of detail if any the aspects of the thinking and memory process that we now want to examine are sleep and the most conspicuous feature of the Sleep phenomenon dreaming unlike thinking and memory storage the functions of which are reasonably well understood even though many of the details of their operation are still obscure neither the purpose nor the mechanism of either sleep or dreaming has heretofore been explained on a scientific basis where knowledge is lacking conjecture has free reign and the number and variety of theories and speculations that have been offered as possible explanations of one or the other of these phenomena have been limited only by the scope of the human imagination some of the most widely accepted of these speculative ideas have direct or indirect relevance to the metaphysical subject matter of this volume um and he he cites some questions from some of the uh the experts out there uh is there a supernatural element that determines what we dream about and uh this issue and related questions such as the possibility of the existence of a prophetic significance in dreams have been matters of concern to the human race from the earliest days from which we have knowledge since they are clearly germane to our present inquiry they must have some attention at this point before we can answer these questions we must have a reasonably good understanding of the way in which the two major components of the mental mechanism thinking and memory either into the Sleep situation or enter into the Sleep situation but this is something that is not available from the work of previous investigators examination of the literature in this area will show that The Works dealing with memory make little reference to sleep while those on sleep and dreaming contains no significant information on memory it will therefore be necessary to blaze our own trail in the investigation this involves giving what may seem a disproportionate amount of attention to some of the less important components of the human information handling processes but the allocation of space in this work necessarily has to be based on the relevance or possible relevance of the various items to the general subject of the work together with whatever additional emphasis may be warranted where the findings of this investigation are entirely new to the branch of thought involved the physiological condition known as sleep is a result of the fact that the information storage and processing equipment of the higher forms of life memory and thinking is not capable of continuous operation it must be periodically taken out of service for an interval which in human individual character in the human individual characteristically extends for about half of the time of the previous operating period when this mental equipment is in operation and in contact with the outside world the individual is conscious the regular and normal period of unconsciousness in which the mental contact with the environment is inoperative is sleep no satisfactory explanation of the need for Sleep has ever been derived from conventional Theory and then he cites a couple of different authors who attest to that that they&#x27;re confused about the need for sleep why we need sleep and so on um okay now um just to to make a few things clear uh before we before we quit for today is that um uh I will Point Larson will uh come to some conclusions that will surprise you in this uh analysis of dreams and I will point out that Dr Bruce paret one of his followers uh strongly strongly disagrees with Larson on this matter and uh oh but I also do want to point out that when he&#x27;s talking about the circulating memory process we&#x27;re thinking about an analogies physical analogies we had talked earlier about the electron the electron is a rotating unit of space moving through time well when it&#x27;s in matter it&#x27;s moving through time okay that is kind of how you want to be thinking when you now uh analyze things like that okay we&#x27;ll go to the next thing next time have a great day</p>
