            <p>illuminate this often misused explanation for the observer effect so I&#x27;m looking at you the only reason why I can see you is because there&#x27;s light reflecting off of your face your body into my eyes now let&#x27;s make you tinier let&#x27;s make you mini me I turn on the lights you&#x27;re still there cuz if the lights are not on I can&#x27;t see you I don&#x27;t know where you are when you start becoming the size of molecules right on down to the size of an atom and I ask the question where is Joe Rogan the atom and I turn on the light to see you there the light the photon comes in hits your atom and Pops you into another location the very Act of trying to measure your position prevents me from measuring your position and it has have jack to do with your Consciousness or your mind or your eyes</p>
