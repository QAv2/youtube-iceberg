            <p>okay one of the discoveries that emerged out of uh modern quantum theory is that uh so-called empty space isn&#x27;t really empty at all it&#x27;s actually full of energy so instead of being like kind of a quiet empty Lake it&#x27;s more like the froth at the base of a waterfall or something and this energy is basically electromagnetic in nature and uh the energy density is uh quite high in fact it&#x27;s so high that when it was first discovered mathematically it was thought to be some kind of kind of artifact of the mathematics but then as time went on there were even Nobel prize winning experiments that showed that this energy in so-called empty space was really there we don&#x27;t usually notice it because um it&#x27;s so homogeneously distributed it sort of be like sitting in a bathtub with uh at exactly your body temperature you might not notice notice the water but under certain circumstances it can be um Disturbed or perturbed and then it has has has effects as I mentioned some some effects on atomic emission for example is what eventually ended up in a Nobel Prize for Willis lamb of Y University it&#x27;s called the lamb shift and this is a recognition that in fact uh this energy disturbs atoms so atoms aren&#x27;t sitting in a void they&#x27;re sitting in the sea of energy so once uh Quantum theorists realized that energy was there the next question was well is there any way to tap it and it was thought uh originally that probably not it might be like trying to tap the heat energy around us and uh you can quickly prove for thermodynamic reasons that uh it&#x27;ll take more energy to tap it than you&#x27;d get out of it so you don&#x27;t come out ahead but back in about 1984 a researcher a huge laboratory the name of Robert forward uh showed that there was a particular Effect called the Casmir effect which demonstrated that in fact this energy could be tapped well when you go to look at the numbers you find out that there&#x27;s enough energy in the volume of a coffee cup to say evaporate all the world&#x27;s oceans if you could get it all of it so this raised the issue among uh theorists well can we manipulate this energy uh could we attap it for space flight application for example and um there are a couple ways to go could we get propulsion out of it could we use it as is an energy source and so these are the areas that modern theorists are looking at but one of the more interesting aspects is that if in fact it does look like there&#x27;s a route from here to there then you know we consider the possibility that well maybe there are other civilizations who&#x27;ve been down this track ahead of us and so it opens up the possibility that you can&#x27;t reject the possibility of for example ET visitation out of hand</p>
