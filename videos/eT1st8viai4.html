            <p>it&#x27;s long been said that there would be many inventions that could have changed the world in a positive way yet were denied from the public or worse the inventor mysteriously died making you wonder if someone didn&#x27;t want their inventions getting out and in kites in the way people live their lives it all comes down to the thoughts that owners of the world&#x27;s largest oil energy banking and tobacco corporations do not have the public&#x27;s interest at heart and are in if agreed and control over the population now we cannot say that is true when you hear about the inventions that could well have changed the way we do things in particular be cheaper and more efficient for the mass population and the environment it does make you think whether these huge companies have us and the planet in mind because from the invention of a harmless cigarette that was created many years ago to the countless free energy generators here are five inventions that were suppressed with most of their inventors suffering from mysterious and untimely deaths Tom ogle in 1978 at the age of 19 a young man called Tom ogle stumbled upon an invention by pure luck I could have changed the automotive industry it all started when he was fiddling around with his lawn mower and accidentally punctured a hole in its fuel tank as opposed to patching it up he used a vacuum line and ran it from the tank straight into the carburetor inland ogle was amazed when the mower kept running but the fuel level hardly moved and they continued to take over for 96 hours straight on half a tank of fuel over the next five years oh girl made hundreds of experiments on his own Ford Galaxie but removed the carburetor and fuel pump and replaced there were a secret box he called a filter and the car went from over 20 miles per gallon to a hundred oval maintained he was able to achieve this due to his secret pressurized and vaporized fuel system that injected fumes directly into the engines firing chamber meaning the device would not only get incredible mileage but exhaust emissions were also practically non-existent now at age 24 he notified the press of his invention and claimed he was going to showcase it by driving from El Paso Texas to Deming New Mexico aiming to completes the 200-mile trip on just two gallons of gas reporters an expert turned up to witness this fiend and inspected his car for hidden fuel tanks and when they were unable to find any discrepancies and ogle made the journey he was hailed as the inventor of an energy-saving device that also cleaned the permissions however despite the initial excitement and funding there were rumors that other people had similar patents including General Motors who had patented a similar device several years earlier all of a sudden everyone who shared a girl&#x27;s passion for his fuel and a mission saving process started to wipe their hands with him and suggested it would never work his royalties and payments storms and the man who was once offered twenty five million dollars by Shell Oil was broke his marriage ended and he became dependent on drink and drugs then in 1981 Tom was shot outside of a bar in El Paso and died late that night at a friend&#x27;s apartment his death was recorded as a suicide after autopsy reports indicated he had overdosed on drugs and alcohol although many of his friends said he would never have killed himself despite his current struggles and that he had been saying for a while but he thought someone was putting drug his drink the person who shot him was never found many questions still remain about Tom ogle like who shot him why were no cars ever fitted with his invention and what happened to the so called patents for similar fuel-saving devices in Toms own words when asked if he was afraid of oil companies or the Arabs coming after him he responded with no not anymore I&#x27;ve had too much publicity if I kept my invention a secret I might be worrying but there&#x27;s nothing to worry about anymore the question is was Tom right and was his invention that well-known or is this the first time you&#x27;ve heard about it Stanley Meyer Stanley Meyer and his twin Stefan were born in Columbus East Side on August 24th 1940 and from an early age both were building things and coming up with their own inventions as an adult Stanley gained some impressive credentials attending Ohio State University working for NASA and being involved in the development of the Gemini and the star wars project but during all of this Stanley and his engineer brother built of a multi-million dollar transport and spare parts business and Stanley was the author of over 42 patents including inventions in oceanology cardiac monitoring and banking systems but his most famous was the water fuel cell which he claimed could allow an automobile to run on water rather than gasoline the water fuel cell supposedly split water into its two elements hydrogen and oxygen then burned the hydrogen to generate energy Stanley claimed the device required less energy to perform electrolysis than the minimum energy requirements measured by conventional science he demonstrated his invention to Professor Michael Lawton Dean of engineering at Mary College in London Admiral Sir Anthony Griffin a former controller of the British Navy and dr. Keith Hindley a UK research chemist they were all in agreement that the South produced far more hydrogen oxygen mixture than could have been expected by simple electrolysis making the impossible possible by turning ordinary tap water into hydrogen fuel efficiently enough to power his dune buggy despite some hailing Stanley as a genius and visionary there were others who believed he was a fraud and still do to this day you see his water fuel cell was later examined by three experts in corns who found that there was nothing revolutionary about this at all and I was simply using conventional electrolysis the court found Meyer had committed gross fraud and ordered him to repay to investors their twenty five thousand dollars after this nothing more came about it then nearly 20 years after researching and perfecting the concept of his water fuel system Stanley and his brother dined out with their latest Belgian investors in The Grove City Cracker Barrel on March the 20th 1998 Stanley took one sip of his cranberry juice he had just ordered before grabbing his neck and running out the door dropping to his knees and vomiting violently he died there and then and his last words were they poisoned me at the age of 57 Stanley Meyers the man who once claimed he could have ended reliance on fossil fuels was dead many of the key elements of his invention died with him as the water fuel Sal was never fully completed and never released despite a detailed investigation by police the eventual cause of death was listed as a brain aneurysm his brother Stefan who is the only one who knows the way forward with Stanley&#x27;s invention has refused to have anything to do with it or complete his brother&#x27;s work after watching what he went through convinced the invention would have changed the automotive world forever and for this reason his brother was killed the question is was he really a fraud because no vehicle manufacturer has incorporated Maya&#x27;s work despite the patent expiring and his inventions going into the public domain available for all to use without restriction or royalty payment Lester Hendershot Lester Jennings Hendershot was born in 1898 in West Elizabeth Pennsylvania and grew up to be an inventor of many practical items his most significant was a groundbreaking generator that was powered by nothing for the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field that was able to power several appliances in his home needless to say top scientists were unable to explain it and knew that if it could be perfected it could eliminate the need for conventional electricity in every household around the planet it&#x27;s all came about in 1925 when Lester was taking flying lessons and realized the need for a 100% reliable compass while trying to produce one he realized the power of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and it gave him the idea to produce a motor utilizing this free energy as work progressed on the motor he began to realize that ethically powered motor may not work as well as a magnetically powered generator so he concentrated on making one soon he was making news headlines and even Colonel Lindenberg and the military began showing interest however the initial flurry of excitement worn off as many started to claim Hendershot was a fake even going to the length of displaying a supposed generator of his in front of the public and proving that it did not work after this it became apparent those who supported Hendershot but there were people who were set on discrediting the invention Hendershot still continued for many years with his free energy generator and in the late 1960s he was convinced he had an opportunity to present his invention to the US Navy he produced two models and he 56-page proposal but there was little interest then a year later in April 1961 Hendershot son returned from school and found his father dead his death was recorded as suicide although no investigation was ever carried out many including his family believed he was killed as he was a threats the large energy companies after he continued to progress with his invention it was also reported that Henry Shaw had been approached by a large corporation who he refused to name but apparently told him to stop all activity in connection with his motor or generator all Hendershot would say was that if he was successful with his generator it would be a serious threat their multi-million dollar industry his thought he accepted $25,000 on the condition that he did not build another unit for 20 years he also told his family at times that he feared for his life it&#x27;s wrong to blame someone for being responsible for hendershot&#x27;s death but given the fact he was convinced his generator did produce power and perfected could be revolutionary it seems no one was interested in what he&#x27;d come up with and you can&#x27;t help but wonder why the Palladium cigarette every year around five million smokers and over half a million non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke die from tobacco-related deaths but what if in the 1950s one scientist came up with a cigarette without the carcinogenic chemicals his name was dr. James D mold and he worked for the North Carolina tobacco company Liggett &amp; Myers his role is to test the harmful effects of tobacco on lab mice and through his studies he was able to isolate the materials in cigarettes that caused skin cancer armed with his knowledge he started a project and produce a safer cigarette that would eliminate or at least minimize the harmful ingredients molds project became known as project XA and at first he had the backing of Liggett &amp; Myers it took James 25 years to produce a cigarette that relied on use of palladium and magnesium nitrate to destroy the substances in cigarette smoke that caused cancer he called it the Palladium cigarette however after talks with lawyers Liggett &amp; Myers withdrew their backing it&#x27;s hard to believe but lawyers had advised that by launching a safer product would lead to lawsuits from customers of their original product as it would be admitting they were unsafe don&#x27;t forget this was around the time where was fashionable and in fact deemed healthy to smoke cigarettes unable to continue with his work James was requested by Liggett &amp; Myers not to publish anything about his findings and 25 years of work was abandoned at this time Liggett and other tobacco companies continue to sell cancer-causing cigarettes with the general public unaware of the harm they were causing dr. mold had effectively been gagged by the company he died in 2002 knowing he could have saved the lives of countless people if it were not for the tobacco companies and their refusal to admit that they knew how dangerous smoking was what&#x27;s even more upsetting is that now tobacco companies have to state how dangerous smoking is but nothing seems to have come about from dr. moulds work and this could have happened many years ago potentially preventing an untold number of lives Dmitry Petrov this next person is the most mysterious in this video but the information on him is seriously lacking we do know he definitely existed and that he definitely died under suspicious circumstances his name was Dmitry Petrov and he was born in Kiev in 1952 but went on to study at the best engineering school in Berlin and later worked for an aviation company for over 20 years in his spare time Petra knov invented things his first being a very bright LED flashlight that gained some interest although was considered expensive he then created a plasma battery which he maintained could operate for three years without being recharged he went on to news one to apparently power his entire house now Dimitri admitted the battery was technically nuclear but only emitted the same levels of radiation as a mobile phone as word got around in 2009 Dimitri was invited to visit a military lab in Moscow to demonstrate his device in front of generals Petrov was gone for a week and took a duplicate device with him which the military camped when he returned his sister said he was very excited and although he said he couldn&#x27;t talk about the details of the meeting he told her the military had agreed to fund him as long as the battery was only used in Russia then just a week after the meeting Dmitri had a visit from a smartly dressed man who introduced himself as Vladimir after the visit according to his sister Dmitri seemed different just a few months later on February 13th 2010 Dmitri went out for a coffee as he usually did on a Saturday morning then picked up some bread from a bakery and that was the last time he was seen or heard from when his sister returned from the police station after reporting him missing there was no electricity in the house and it turns out that neighbors saw two military men entering her and her brother&#x27;s property and leaving with dimitra&#x27;s plasma battery two weeks later are no closer to finding out what happened to her brother his sister received a parcel containing Dimitri&#x27;s watch now what happened next I cannot be certain off but over a year after his disappearance a decomposing body was pulled from Russia&#x27;s Volga River but their teeth and hands were missing making identification impossible there is speculation that this was Dmitri Petrov the man who apparently powered his entire house on a single homemade plasma battery because if this wasn&#x27;t his body then where has he gone soulless five inventions that could have changed the way we live either in health or finances or by the effect that we have on the planet thanks for watching and I&#x27;ll see you again in the next video you [Music]</p>
