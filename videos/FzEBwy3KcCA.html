            <p>all right hello out there and welcome to my channel uh this channel is for educational purposes and not quite ready here but uh here I am okay and um we look at usually theories of everything and go deep into them and uh you know try to dig out what you can uh benefit yourself um you know how you can benefit your yourself uh by learning these different theories of everything I guess you just have to remember that it&#x27;s a theory of everything so uh it has wide application um even though like in this case it&#x27;s being applied to a very narrow topic um but if you get the concepts then you can learn to apply it to every topic and so that&#x27;s why we try to give broad coverage of you know um coverage of several different topics and so you can kind of see how it how it uh applies today is our 460th video on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and uh Larson was an American engineer who lived in the 20th century in 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates uh just two sentences about how he believed the universe operated and then from those postulates he derived a theoretical Universe about what the universe would look like if it uh operated the way he said it did and then he uh wrote A Few books where he compared his theoretical Universe with the measured universe of the Legacy scientists uh that they have uh compiled in their scientific tables you know astronomical charts and uh scientific tables uh chemistry and so on so today we are looking at uh his one of his books on chemistry called basic properties of matter and this book looks at just what it says the basic properties of matter like the melting point and the specific heat and the compressibility and he com comes up with uh expressions or equations for uh his various these various properties plugs in the uh atoms or compounds and uh Compares them with the tables and uh we&#x27;re looking at chapter 7 in this book called um right now uh we&#x27;re right in the middle of chapter 7 that&#x27;s called temperature relations um and so he&#x27;s kind of looking at the formation of the temperature scale in Larson system every atom or really every molecule has its own temperature and so the temperature of the aggregate is really just an average of all of the temperatures of all of the different molecules and um each molecule or atom has a uh heat curve a specific heat curve that it follows the specific heat is how much heat you have to add to something to raise it by a certain uh temperature and um so it&#x27;s kind of like your heat efficiency and every atom has its own specific heat curve and uh they are basically quantized and so he in this chapter he comes up with the kind of the overall curve uh that kind of um harmonizes all of the different elements um by puts it on a scale as opposed to just uh Quant quantize numbers okay um now Larson&#x27;s two postulates uh the first is by far the most important the second is just um kind of window dressing he basically is explaining how he&#x27;s going about his deductive process of derivation uh that he&#x27;s going to use um math uh probability logic um geometrical considerations in order to figure out you know his process of if this then that uh when from what he from really from the first postulate okay so the first postulate um is that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so that&#x27;s why they call it the reciprocal system because it is based on the reciprocal relationship between space and time time that they have in motion now when Larson is so Larson is building his Universe on motion not matter or not energy or Force but motion and um there&#x27;s a couple kind of conceptual leaps that you have to make to be able to kind of get with this idea the first is that you have in a universe of motion motion precedes everything else so you have to be able to conceive of motion without anything moving motion precedes the thing that&#x27;s moving and then uh also you have to kind of be able to um get rid of the idea of space and time as your background of the universe or at least not get rid of it but put it in the background uh space and time uh for thousands of years have been considered to be the container of the universe that we are in a an environment of space that&#x27;s you know not moving and we are uh events are unfolding in time but you know these are really the stage that we um go through our trama and um you know they&#x27;re kind of this passive background that we move through but in Larson system space and time are the very contents of the universe this is what the universe is made out of the universe is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time basically uh space and time are a fraction uh motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator and um this works for something like speed you know the the bike is going 10 miles an hour 10 miles of space in 1 hour of time space over time and that is a reciprocal relationship if you want to double the speed you can say the bike is going 20 M an hour or you can say the bike is going 10 m per half hour that shows a reciprocal relationship between space and time but Larson extrapolates from that and spreads it out to all of our scientific phenomena all uh matter energy force pressure um electric charge these are all um forms of motion and they all can be expressed in space and time terms only now when Larson is referring to motion he&#x27;s referring specifically to a kind of motion he calls scalar motion and a scalar motion is a more generalized kind of motion uh that um has no Direction no specific Direction it has a magnitude but has no specific Direction uh picture a balloon that you put um dots on with a uh magic marker if you blow up the balloon all the dots will be moving away from each other the DOT are moving in every direction um not any specific Direction each dot is moving away from each other Dot and this you know is not really a fictitious kind of motion this is the motion that has been observed uh by all the way back to Hubble in the 20s 1920s uh who observed that all of our distant galaxies are moving away from each other now that was used in order to justify the concept of the Big Bang uh or I would say that was abused to use the concept to identify the concept of the Big Bang but what it uh unless you&#x27;re willing to uh say that our galaxy is at the center of the universe and that we are not participating in that then you would have to accept the fact that our galaxy is also moving away from all of the other galaxies um so uh we are all all the galaxies are basically on the surface of an expanding balloon um now with some caveats uh the again the the second prong of Larson&#x27;s first postulate is that um motion and space and time all come in three dimensions so this this outward motion of that balloon what Larson calls the progression is in three dimensions and uh if you suck in the balloon and move it inward that is what Larson refers to as gravitation so this outward movement is really the source of everything everything comes from that outward movement mement which is omnipresent and eternal it is occurring at all times in all places um this expansion uh and um that is the source that motion is the source but it has to be harnessed by reversing it and turning it into an inward motion which is done first with the photon the photon basically reverses it in one or the other of space or time so that uh you know the thing is progressing uh this this brings in this discrete unit postulate space and time uh come only in discrete units as as does motion um one unit and and the progression goes one unit of space per one unit of time and that is that&#x27;s uh the speed of the progression everywhere in the universe at all times it&#x27;s constant one unit of space per one unit of time and um the photon basically reverses the progression in um either space or time so um it continues to progress say it reverses it in time it continues to progress in space but now it is basically oscillating in time so that it is um not moving as it&#x27;s stationary from a stationary uh Viewpoint uh in time but it is still progressing in space and that accounts for the wav like motion of the photon and uh there&#x27;s some dispute among large Associates whether that is really how the photon got started or whether it&#x27;s from um more of a combining two different rotational motions but regardless the idea is that it is a sine wave and a simple harmonic motion and that it is the um building block uh where you start once you start once you have the photon then you can start rotating that photon backwards and overcoming the progression uh so you have to rotate it in three dimensions which is done with two two-dimensional rotations and then there can also be a one-dimensional um rotation in the opposite direction which is more like um filling in the spaces on the periodic table so larsson&#x27;s periodic table every element contains three numbers uh the fir first is a primary two-dimensional rotation the second is a secondary two-dimensional rotation they alternate you know first one then the other then the other then the other and then this optional one-dimensional uh reverse rotation which is zero in the noble gases and then it&#x27;s positive in the electr positives and negative in the electro negatives um and um so uh a lot of things boil down to the reference point so when you have this progression outward at one unit of space in one unit of time every unit of time uh at all locations in space uh this uh this one unit of that&#x27;s one unit of speed one unit unit of space and one unit of time is speed that is also known as the speed of light so this these progression is occurring at the speed of light outward in all directions at all times in all places and that is what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system so Larson has a natural reference system which is moving a moving reference system that he says that&#x27;s what the universe operates upon um that&#x27;s where the universe makes its measurements from that um progression of the natural reference system but as humans we use what he calls a spatial reference system and this is this is really your container Universe this is your three dimensions of space in a still frame XYZ coordinates and time is progressing time is always getting later and later and later so uh this is the result of establishing a gravitational system so once you&#x27;ve rolled back that Photon enough times and once that mass becomes uh a big enough aggregate then you basically establish this spatial reference system um you can do it abstractly if you you know take one of the dots on your balloon and you assign it as a reference point and you basically arbitrarily say that this particular dot is motionless and then you&#x27;ll be able to perceive that all of the other dots will be attracted by that first dot or if it&#x27;s um if it&#x27;s an outward motion then repelled by this first dot it will look as if there&#x27;s a force field there um but there isn&#x27;t every dot is pursuing its own course and and uh so that is what Larson calls an as if Force um and so you have this spatial reference system uh three dimensions of space coordinate space and clock time the time is still scaler the the space is stationary but you also have a realm of the UN and we are accustomed to that that&#x27;s our normal environment but in another environment by the reciprocal postulate we would also have uh three dimensions of time in a still frame and progressing space space will always be getting farther and farther and farther apart that occurs in what Larson calls the cosmic sector and the difference there is the speed of light boundary there is a speed of light boundary this Spa the the speed of the progression that is the midpoint of the universe or the zero point and so the reference point the natural reference point and half the universe is moving slower than that because that the material sector and that&#x27;s where you got your coordinate space and clock time and half of it is moving faster than that uh and that&#x27;s where you have your uh Cosmic sector and you have Cosmic atoms and Cosmic molecules and you have coordinate time and clock space Cosmic atoms and molecules or none of this Cosmic sector has really been identified by the Legacy scientists U they&#x27;ve noted some of these things but they don&#x27;t understand their origin or their meaning um they call a lot of them antimatter or Masons um and uh the these two sectors are reciprocals of one another so this gives the reciprocal system a great deal of power because what we observe in our sector of the universe we can extrapolate it over to the cosmic sector so even though we don&#x27;t have a good glimpse of the cosmic sector we can we can tell it uh exactly what&#x27;s in it at least on a general level not down to the individuals but on a general level okay then we also have a boundary within both the material and Cosmic sectors where you have um the unit of time in the cosmic sector and the unit of space in the material sector where if you don&#x27;t have a full unit you don&#x27;t have space in the material sector and so if two atoms approach each other to one unit they can&#x27;t get any closer because there is no such thing and so instead of continuing to move closer in space they actually move farther apart in time because time is the reciprocal of space so moving outward in time is the equivalent of moving inward in space Larsson calls this the time region in the cosmic sector he calls it the space region and that&#x27;s where they move close the cosmic atoms move so close together in time that they can&#x27;t move into time anymore and they have to move in space and so and also when you cross that boundary the rules in invert and now the progression is moving inward in equivalent space and gravitation is moving outward and this creates an uh interatomic equilibrium because the progression is constant and omnipresent and eternal whereas gravitation is based on an uh inverse Square law and so there is a point at which they become equal and that&#x27;s where the interatomic equilibrium is established and that&#x27;s uh what&#x27;s known as the interatomic distance um but Larson doesn&#x27;t believe in the nucleus of the atom the atom is one thing it it&#x27;s a combination of motions it&#x27;s not uh a combination of particles it&#x27;s just one thing that can be given many different kinds of motion like a curveball you know a curveball is moving through space but it&#x27;s also spinning um maybe even in more than one dimension okay so um you know the atom doesn&#x27;t have a nucleus it&#x27;s just an atom and so the sizes of the atoms in Legacy science are much bigger than they are for Larson for Larson the nucle is really the entire atom and the distance between the atoms is much larger uh in LaRon system that is their you know their geometrical bonding okay let&#x27;s um let&#x27;s get into this temperature relations and see if we can pick up a few breadcrumbs and maybe make a few connections a lot of this will probably be foreign to most people um who don&#x27;t know the basic concepts there&#x27;s so many different concepts that you have to be able to pick up on the reciprocal system but the thing is that it&#x27;s much simpler than regular science and or uh liberal arts and everything because once you figure out how the concepts work you can apply them to every subject so you don&#x27;t have to learn a whole new nomenclature and um con you know conceptual map for every subject you just learn one and then you can figure out how to make it a apply to the others Larson has books on economics he&#x27;s got uh a book on metaphysics uh that has chapters on religion and philosophy ethics Free Will memory you know uh lot of psychology in there um dream interpretation you know so Larson uh attempts to apply his subject uh his reciprocal system to many many many subjects and when you can see that he does that you can try to figure out how to apply it to your subject whatever it is that you&#x27;re um passionate about okay but right here he&#x27;s talking about temperature relations within chemistry it might be expected that this would result in a net effective specific heat of 8 9ths of a unit or 2.23 R here he&#x27;s talking about the specific heat at the transition Point instead of the 79ths unit 2 and 1/3 are that exist when the initial negative level is 2 9ths of a unit here we&#x27;re talking about a solid um specific heat curve now the solid does everything that it possibly can to avoid becoming a liquid um and so it uses these machinations of switching to uh a second um rotational level so that the slope of the specific heat curve is uh reduced by a factor of eight this um was uh covered in the last couple chapters that we went through here but the basic idea is that um is Larson deres this from probability uh it&#x27;s more probable to be in a low energy condition in this sector of the univers wor than um a high energy condition and so the the uh atom or molecule is going to want to stay in the solid state as long as possible and is going to do everything that it possibly can to avoid transitioning into a liquid but it is quite clear from the measured specific heat values that this is not true the first transition point in the specific heat curves uh and um the specific heat curves have several different transition points or inflection points where the slope changes either as a result of a first order transition which is a change of the actual geometrical structure of the you know Atomic grouping or as a result of it picking up this changing to a second rotational unit for you know um the heat um because uh you know when you are in this interatomic equilibrium you&#x27;re beset with two different major factors again the progression and gravitation the progression is moving Inward and so this uh manifests as internal pressure or pre pressure compression and then there&#x27;s an outward movement uh which corresponds to gravitation which is also heat and um so those are the two forces that the time region uh the two major forces that the time region or the solid state has to uh has to negotiate and uh it does it through these various transitions the first transition point in the specific heat of Curves of the electromagnetic elements is 2 and 1/3 R just as it is in the curves with the 29th unit and the 29th unit comes from the two photons that are at the center there&#x27;s one Photon um and that combines with a second Photon usually when two um subatomic particles combine and then they combine Photon so all atoms have two photons in them whereas subatomic particles have one Photon and so um this two nths unit refers to two photons uh a one nth unit would refer to one Photon and this comes into play where we&#x27;re talking about something like called the inter Regional ratio which is really what you um it&#x27;s a fraction that you have to reduce your observation by uh because it&#x27;s the amount that you lose in the translation when you are viewing into a different sector or a different region of the universe where you&#x27;re looking into the time region you have to reduce things by the uh interatomic distance I I&#x27;m Sorry by the inter Regional ratio apparent so again this is all extremely complicated uh but again compared to Legacy science is very simple um just think you didn&#x27;t complain when you know well maybe you did but when you were learning Legacy science when you were in high school you weren&#x27;t like this is so complicated um cuz they were shoving it down your throat and you had to you had to learn it but now now this is really complicated but you only have to learn it once you don&#x27;t have to learn it for every subject and so the payoff is huge if you actually can become fluent in this stuff okay apparently the uh restriction that prevents the existence of the more negative initial level in the specific heat of these elements is gradually eliminated as the temperature rises so that at the transition point the effective negative component of the specific heat is the normal 29s unit the thermal factors of the higher inert gases Crypton and Xenon which have no rotation in the electric Dimension are 1 0 0 rather than 111 uh and these factors are uh somewhat related to the three factors that Larson uses for periodic table for every element as in compressibility this is a peculiarity of the mathematics and has no physical significance in both cases the meaning of the symbols is that the effective magnitude is determined entirely by the factors A and Z in multiplication this requires a unit value in the Y position whereas in addition the zero is re required for the same purpose now the main thing that you you just kind of have to know about this is when he&#x27;s figuring out the compression he uses these three numbers a slightly modified version of these three numbers and he multiplies them together and that kind of determines the factors that he uh uses in his compression equation but when he&#x27;s figuring out temperature he takes those three numbers often the same numbers and he add adds them together okay normally the adding together is kind of uh that&#x27;s really more of a scaler thing where you can&#x27;t um you can&#x27;t multiply scalar Dimensions um I didn&#x27;t mention it earlier but when you have this coordinate space and clock time or coordinate time and clock space you have this three dimensions of space well it only requires one dimension of motion one dimension of scalar motion to account for three dimensions of space but there are three dimensions of motion as well as space and time so no reference system um no stationary reference system can account for three dimensions of scalar motion um and so um the scalar motions are independent of each other um and so we that&#x27;s why you have to add them together in as opposed to multiplying them together and so the compressibility numbers are much more like um multiplying the dimensions whereas the temperature numbers are much more like scalar Dimensions that you&#x27;re adding together okay just uh I guess I don&#x27;t really have time to continue here I don&#x27;t even think I read a whole paragraph uh this is an incredibly long paragraph by the way Larson is a great writer but he&#x27;s a terrible teacher and or he was he died back in 1990 and I&#x27;m not complaining about it because you take what you can get and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s incredible work that he did um and he didn&#x27;t know all the different factors that he was facing he was writing for more of a scientific audience where in hindsight he might have written for more of a lay audience once you recognize that the scientific audiences were not really receptive to anything that went against what they already you know had already invested their time and energy into learning um but as a result he gets out into the week needs like he is here where he&#x27;s just talking about something that if you don&#x27;t if you&#x27;re not a master of the reciprocal system none of this really means that much to you anyway thanks for tuning in</p>
