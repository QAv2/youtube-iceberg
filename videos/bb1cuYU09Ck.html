            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>you&#x27;ve talked to people that uh told stories of ufo encounters what is the most fascinating to you about the stories of these ufo encounters that uh that you&#x27;ve heard that people have told you the similarity of them uh the uniformity of the of the stories now i just want to say up front a lot of people think that when i speculate i believe something that&#x27;s not true right speculation is just creativity speculation is the beginning of hypothesis none of what i hear in terms of the anecdotes do i necessarily believe are they true but i still find them fascinating to listen to because at some level they&#x27;re still raw data and you have to listen and once you start to hear the same story again and again then you have to say well there might be something to it i mean maybe it&#x27;s some kind of a jungian uh background in the human mind and human consciousness that creates these stories again and again as coming out of the dna it&#x27;s coming out of that pre-programmed something and young talked quite a bit about this kind of thing uh the collective unconscious but actually one of the most interesting ones i find is this constant uh message that you&#x27;re not taking care of your world and this came long before climate change it came long before uh many kinds of you know let&#x27;s say current day memes uh around uh you know taking care of our planet uh pollution etc and so you know for instance perhaps the best example of this the one that i find the most fascinating is a story out of zimbabwe uh 50 or 60 children one afternoon in zimbabwe it&#x27;s a it was a well-educated group of white and black children uh who and lunchtime and the playground saw a craft uh and they saw little men and they all ran into the teachers and they told the same story and they drew the same pictures and the message several of them got was you are not taking care of your planet and they&#x27;ve got you know there&#x27;s actually a movie coming out uh on this uh episode and 30 years later now the people who are there the children who&#x27;ve now grown up say it it happened to us now did it happen was it some sort of hallucination or was it a an imposed hallucination by something was it material i i don&#x27;t know but these kids were seven to ten years old you see them on video seven to ten year olds can&#x27;t lie like that and so you know whether it&#x27;s real or not i don&#x27;t know but i find that fascinating data and again it&#x27;s the it&#x27;s these unconnected stories of individuals with the same with the same story that is worthy of further inquiry yeah so here we are humans with limited cognitive capacities trying to make sense of the world trying to understand what is real and not we have this dna that somehow in complex ways is interacting with the environment and then we get these uh novel ideas that come from the populace and then they make us wonder about what it all means and so how to interpret it if you think from an alien perspective how would you communicate with other lifelike organisms you perhaps have to find in points on this interaction between the the dna and its manifestations in terms of the the the human mind and the how it interacts with the environment so get some kind of all right what is this dna what does this environment have to get in somehow right to like interact with it to get to perturb the system to where these little ants human like ants get like excited and figure and see stuff out yeah yes and then and then somehow steer them uh first of all for investigative purposes understand like oftentimes to understand the system you have to perturb it exactly yeah it&#x27;s like poke at it they get they get excited or not and then the the the other ways you want to if you worry about them you can steer in one direction or another and this kind of idea of that we&#x27;re not taking care of our world um that&#x27;s interesting i mean that&#x27;s comforting that&#x27;s hopeful because that means the greater intelligence which is what i would hope would want to take care of us like we want to take care of the guerrillas in the national parks in africa yeah but we don&#x27;t want to take care of cockroaches so there&#x27;s a line we draw so you have to hope that right now we&#x27;re a bunch of angry monkeys and you know maybe whatever these intelligences are are also keeping an eye on us you know that you don&#x27;t want a bunch of you know you don&#x27;t want the angry monkey troop stomping around the local galactic arm do you think these folks are telling the truth do you think they saw what they say they saw i think they saw what they said they saw but i also think they saw what they were shown i mean if you go back to the whole notion of okay how long has this been around it didn&#x27;t just start showing up in 1947. right there are stories going back uh you know into the 1800s of people who saw things in their farming in their farm fields in the u.s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in it&#x27;s in local newspapers from the 1800s it&#x27;s fascinating but if you can go even further back you know so to your point of how are how would you as a higher intelligence represent yourself to a lesser intelligence well let&#x27;s go back to pre-civilization maybe you show yourself as the spirits in the forest and you give messages through that once you get a little bit more civilized civilized then you show yourself as the gods and then you&#x27;re god well we don&#x27;t believe in god anymore necessarily not everybody does so what do we believe in we believe in technology so you show yourself as a form of technology right but the common thread is you&#x27;re not alone and there&#x27;s something else here with you and there&#x27;s something that&#x27;s as you said watching you and at least watching over your shoulder but i i think that like any good parent you don&#x27;t tell your student everything you make them learn and learning requires mistakes because if you tell them everything then they get lazy you</p>
