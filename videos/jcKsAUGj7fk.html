            <p>I have one question for you regarding you know we always think about day one right of of meeting these non non entities of meaning nonhuman entities that what happens day one you know like you said the stock market crashes everything goes Havoc maybe we won&#x27;t have a presidential election you know all just the reality just drastically drastically changes and you also hinted previously on how should we prepare for for an encounter or how or a confirmation because I I know this is a topic that you you also grasp on because in terms of governmental information why if they have it already why haven&#x27;t they disclosed it but let&#x27;s say that day two comes how do you envision humans really engaging with with this new reality and also how do you think we should change or how we would change pragmatic I I think day two is let&#x27;s call it a more sober reflection on the matter um and the hysterics are gone um I think day two the majority of the world goes back to living its life and wondering about where its food comes from where who&#x27;s going to put you know dinner on the table oh it&#x27;s tomorrow I have to take the trash out um you know I think that&#x27;s day two because for most people it will mean nothing it will mean nothing you know I mean the people that it matters to are the are the ones who look to take advantage of it right so I don&#x27;t mean that in a negative sense I mean that in a positive sense that okay there&#x27;s something here what&#x27;s in it for me what&#x27;s in it for the country what&#x27;s in it for my family what&#x27;s in it for the planet so that&#x27;s the conversation and so actually it ends up looping right back to what humans have been dealing with every day for all of reality is how do I invest in potential right and um and that means okay if there&#x27;s a technology that we can take advantage of can I convince them to give it to me do do any of our monetary conse quences mean anything to them I&#x27;ll give you a trillion dollars all right yeah well if we do the conversion rate you know from our point of view it&#x27;s a point of a it&#x27;s one tenth of a penny your many means nothing to us so you know what what&#x27;s the currency of the discussion um and so uh I mean that&#x27;s the first thing you have to ask and so I think at at best we have nothing to give them nothing and so you know what&#x27;s in it for them then to give us anything other than Goodwill and the hope that there is Goodwill right and so I think that that&#x27;s kind of where you have to start this discussion um and I think then at best we take advantage only by Mim by seeing what it is that they can do if they can show us what they can do maybe we can figure out how they do it knowing that somebody can move faster than light if that&#x27;s let&#x27;s say something that they have or saying that they have some way to negate gravity just the most extreme examples um tells any good scientist okay well it&#x27;s possible okay so if I can get a piece of one of their craft let&#x27;s say maybe I can find the principle within there that leads to the technology revolutions that eventually allow me to do it as well one day you know I mean um flight man flight was invented at least on paper as far back as Michelangelo on paper you know it took the right brothers and others another few hundred years to actually practical lie it but that was all based on the notion going back literally hundreds thousands of years to Icarus and you know I&#x27;m going to build uh I&#x27;m going to put feathers on my arms you know and Patch together with wax and I&#x27;m going to fly towards you know into the air until I get too close to the Sun and know that was it he dies right so I think we have a lot of dying between now and when we eventually let&#x27;s say replicate what they have the ability maybe to do alleged to do because I know tomorrow after or the day after this thing comes out I&#x27;ll be you know in the Daily Mail in England you know saying Stanford professor says you know no I never said that I speculated it but I know it makes a nice clickable headline I&#x27;m going to have to to to resist myself in in you know the the headline because with all what happened with with you mention with the grass tyon it&#x27;s going to be that&#x27;s that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s a whole I would love to host both of you just to have that discussion I don&#x27;t want to have a conversation with him it&#x27;s I I I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t want to raise him to my level to be quite honest because</p>
