            <p>Now we get into the really cool stuff. Look at the dates. 1919 [music] Pacowski frost experiment where they actually had high frequency systems where things levitated defying [music] gravity. And then T towns in Brown and he had very high voltage systems, electrogravidic they call it where high voltage would cause this lift effect and would actually create if you [music] will uh a bubble, an electromagnetic field that would allow an object to move [music] at enormous speeds and free of the forces of gravity. What&#x27;s called gravity control.</p>
<p>An office of naval research report on T Towns and Brown&#x27;s electrogravity device includes a transcript [music] of a conversation between Major General Vertrandius and Lieutenant General Ha Craig. Bertrandius remarks, &quot;It sounds terribly screwy, [music] but Friday I went down to a place called the Towns and Brown Foundation, and believe it or not, I saw a model of a flying saucer.&quot; Thompson Brown was an independent experimentter and he actually [music] worked on as as you can see very large replications of saucers that he believed were vital for [music] a different type of propulsion. The big question is can I prove</p>
