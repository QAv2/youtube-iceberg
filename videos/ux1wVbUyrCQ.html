            <p>here&#x27;s our 16-bit computer working well it&#x27;s actually not a computer it&#x27;s a manually operated memory register this is an interactive display of how memory gets loaded we have three buttons and two switches this is our data bit we can set it to either zero or one this is the clock button one push of the clock loads the state of our data bit to the memory buffer the memory buffer can store up to 16 bits this is our latch button when the latch button is pushed the memory bits in the buffer are pushed to the main memory so there&#x27;s two ways to load memory we can do serial loading or parallel loading serial loading is when we send bits one by one to fill up all 16 bits parallel loading is when we load two or more bits at the same time and this is the reset button this button clears the memory cache on the next clock cycle</p>
