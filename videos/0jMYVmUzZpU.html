            <p>New Mexico is the most secret state in the Union historically its deserts and skies have been the center for more highly classified and secret scientific projects than any other place on Earth the suspicion is that some strange top secret military experiment could lie behind the Roswell mystery 50 years ago the first atomic bomb was detonated in the Trinity test near White [Music] Sands this summer stealth warplanes were still on test flights in the skies above New [Music] Mexico and almost half a century earlier their predecessor the Flying Wing was also seen in these [Music] [Applause] [Music] skies in 1947 White Sands was the location where America developed its early missile technology with V2 Rockets captured from the Nazis Nazi scientists had been secretly relocated at the end of the war to develop the first stage of America&#x27;s Space Program Veron Brown the inventor of the V2 was in charge of the oper I uh studied physics at Johns Hopkins for my ba degree and then I got a MERS in Business Administration at University of sh Chicago uh I got my PhD after that at uh Portland State University in system science which was a interdisciplinary program and my interest in electrogravitics which is talson Brown&#x27;s work uh began in 1985 um I was interested because the physics theory I had been working on predicted a coupling between electricity and gravitation which is pretty much what Brown was illustrating experimentally uh in particular let&#x27;s say in the standard physics theory with like general relativity which is our current theory of gravitation you have only one polarity to gravity so masses can only attract and there&#x27;s no possibility for gravitational repulsion or anti-gravity anything the physicist comes up with that is sort of speculating uh outside of that framework um there physicists have proposed that there might be some coupling between electricity and gravitation at very high energies and that&#x27;s one of their reasons for building these huge particle colliders as they&#x27;re hoping to find this connection uh if if they just look before their eyes the experimental evidence there is a connection but it just normal laboratory voltages that you can generate brown head kind of a mapole that he built with two discs that he would charge the discs and uh the Leading Edge of each disc had a wire that would emit positive ions and the body of the disc was negatively charged can you see that does it show up well and uh he would charge an initial experiment this type that you see here you charged it with 50,000 volts about 50 watts of power and this would spin around around 12 miles per hour in this circuit and then he is reported to have done a similar thing but larger on a 50t course charging to 150,000 volts and these were going several hundred milph so if you can picture about like model airplane speed model airplanes can go several hundred miles an hour and uh this was uh done something around 1953 in Pearl Harbor it demonstrated to some top brass from the military and uh the subject is reported to have become classified after that they were were so impressed with the results some people have said well this is due to ion propulsion that the ions coming off of the uh front of the craft somehow blow the craft and cause it to move and there have been experiments done to show this is not the case in fact Brown uh tested his uh idea in a vacuum and uh so there was eliminating the idea of ions and um it&#x27;s actually went worked better in a vacuum and uh now with I I was interested because I I could explain this with my theory basically uh that the uh positive charges would create gravitational Wells just like our our current concept of a gravitational well around a massive object whereas electrons would would do the opposite they create gravity hills which in effect you&#x27;d say is a gravitational repulsion effect and so if you look at Brown&#x27;s disc according to my theory um you get a g a gravity potential Hill G Hill towards the negative charged end of The Craft and a g well towards the positive and so there be an effect of gravitational gradient created across that which would tend to propel It Forward well I know that in uh 52 he put on a demonstration to the uh Office of Naval Research it&#x27;s kind of interesting that why would end up classifying the whole project uh his whole concept year later if there wasn&#x27;t this uh Syria take it&#x27;s approach to take him seriously okay well I believe that there are many ways to create a gravitational effects uh or at least the approaches I&#x27;ve seen I&#x27;ve heard of are quite different there like various uh ways to skin the cat I guess uh now brown was using high voltage charge and it appears that that technology is used on the B2 it it involves using a merer in this case this is a this would be a different approach than what brown was doing this is using microwaves to create pushes uh to be able to push on a distant surface retracing the path of the incoming waves this is a a very well-known technology in area of Optics and it&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a lot of literature on it in uh for use in with lasers but you find nothing in the a of microwaves and I believe the reason is it&#x27;s very highly classified because of its ability to be used for UFO propulsion and the beauty of this is that the microwaves stay in the beam they don&#x27;t scatter out that&#x27;s the nature of it so you uh pump up your beam affect with energy energy and it&#x27;s not lost it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re putting your energy into a tube it&#x27;s a resonator and so in effect you could create a craft that&#x27;s standing on poles they in fact become like solid poles between the craft and the ground and uh this this is how the for example the tr3b there&#x27;s some talk about this using anti-gravity technology and it has three uh thrusters on the bottom well this is what the thrusters would be there have been triangular UFOs uh the tr3b is one of the triangular shaped UFOs uh that we&#x27;ve heard about the the UFOs that may be of alien origin disc-shaped and some of them may be some that we have created ourselves uh probably use this technology uh you often see three Dome uh domes underneath I believe these are are actually microwave transmitters for the beams I think Robert Lazar has spoken about uh his experience with few of these uh devices at Area 51 uh my first uh exposure to the discovery that this anti-gravity research was quite a big area not talked about very much uh but it that it was a major Endeavor by Major Aerospace corporations this uh came from this report electrogravitic systems which I found very revealing this is a photocopy uh the way I came about this report I was at the Library of Congress uh looking under gravitation to see if there was anything closely remotely uh touching on the subject of electrogravitics which I had at that time in 1985 just become acquainted with its existence through some articles about Townson Brown and there was only one card in the whole catalog uh which came close to this and this was about this report and it interestingly it was missing from the stacks and they had to do a uh search computer search to see where could there be another one and uh the fellow said this must be a very rare report says it&#x27;s only one other library in the whole us and I said where is that said write Patterson Air Force Base so I went ahead and uh ordered it through an inter Library loan request and I was surprised that they actually sent the copy to me it&#x27;s actually a red this is red uh</p>
