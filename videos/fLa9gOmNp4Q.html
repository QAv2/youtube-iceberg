            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What&#x27;s up, veters? Patrick here with Vetted. Dr. Gary Nolan recently went on Dr. Jordan Peterson&#x27;s podcast, and I&#x27;ve got some highlights to share with you because Dr. Gary Nolan said some things that even I found to be alarming.</p>
<p>For one, he was threatened from someone at the White House for speaking on the UAP topic. Um, and threatened with lethal force, as Dr. Gary Nolan put it. And amongst other things, Dr. Gary Nolan talked about his work with Skywatcher.</p>
<p>And he also let Dr. Jordan Peterson know exactly what he makes of the phenomena. And basically, he states they&#x27;ve been here on Earth for a long time. And when he says they, he means aliens, non-human intelligence. Right? So, let&#x27;s jump into this.</p>
<p>This is a great interview from Dr. Gary Nolan. And please veters hit that like button. that really helps out the videos. And of course, if you&#x27;re not already subscribed, hit that subscribe button.</p>
<p>I put out new videos every week about the UFO phenomena. And I&#x27;m trying to get to 100,000 subscribers before the end of the year. Now, this first highlight we&#x27;re going to watch from the interview is Dr. Gary Nolan talking about Skyatcher. Actually, I&#x27;m involved with another group that&#x27;s uh funded privately um called Skywatcher.</p>
<p>And what we&#x27;re doing is we&#x27;ve been setting up sensor systems uh in what we call cleared areas where we know that there&#x27;s no overflight. And we do sometimes work in concert uh with the FAA and others to make sure where we&#x27;re setting up for repeatable measurements and sensor systems to see things. And we&#x27;re seeing stuff that doesn&#x27;t make sense. And so we&#x27;re not coming to conclusions, but we&#x27;re collecting the data. And because I&#x27;m a scientist, I&#x27;m like their principal adviser to this group.</p>
<p>Uh, and we&#x27;re setting up and doing the kinds of measurements that I think are necessary cuz I&#x27;m not going to wait for the government, you know? I&#x27;m not going to wait for daddy government to tell me what&#x27;s right. I&#x27;m just going to I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a scientist. I&#x27;m going to go out and do it myself. &gt;&gt; Daddy government. [Laughter] Love that term.</p>
<p>And part of what we&#x27;re doing is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s two purposes. One, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s basically aerial surveillance partially just for drones because we&#x27;ve seen what drones can do in wars. So, and we knew and you know about the drone incidents in New Jersey, right? And all of the hubbhub that that caused. Well, we were actually there. We were actually measuring things.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What was that? What was that? &gt;&gt; Some of them were simply drones. Some of them though were moving in ways that would be hard to explain by drones. But all the stuff that we observed close to shore was clearly uh human activity. But so we&#x27;re setting up we&#x27;re setting up Skywatcher as sort of a dual purpose. One is to work with the government to uh hopefully or defense contractors or anybody who wants to pay for our services to uh collect aerial data uh basically as rapidly as possible because often you can&#x27;t deploy the necessary equipment on site quickly enough to collect the data when there&#x27;s an anomaly that shows up.</p>
<p>I mean our principal goal is protection of the United States. But if in so doing we happen to collect other information about some let&#x27;s say anomalous objects, we will have the tracking data necessary to say hey well this is we don&#x27;t understand this. And you know, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, and maybe I clearly am, but I remember Skywatcher coming out and it being about, you know, their only goal was to bring UFO disclosure, working with the American government to the people. But, um, it sounds like things have changed a little bit, you know, with SkyWatcher potentially, which is fine. That happens with any venture you take on.</p>
<p>Uh, it&#x27;s you start to adapt um what you do. I in fact I think that&#x27;s the right way to go about things right it may not be what you initially planned um you know from where you actually end up um that&#x27;s pretty common to be honest with you with any sort of business venture or creative venture or financial venture things change right so it sounds like they&#x27;re adding more things to what they&#x27;re doing or the services they&#x27;re offing offering let&#x27;s just say they&#x27;re quote expanding the menu if you will right and offering ing um different things, right, to eat, if you will. I just hope they don&#x27;t forget about the first thing they came out with, right, which is just that, you know, to bring UFO disclosure to the American people in 12 months, right? That was in January and we&#x27;re well over the halfway mark here at 7 months. So, they&#x27;ve, you know, um maybe that timeline will change. I&#x27;m not entirely sure.</p>
<p>And just for full transparency, I am still trying to work um on getting an interview um with Jake Barber from Skywatcher and or someone from Skywatcher for my Psionics documentary. I am in contact um with them right now, especially um uh with their CEO and I&#x27;m trying to work something out. So that&#x27;s still in development and you know we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see for the documentary if if that actually comes to uh fruition, right? So I don&#x27;t want anybody to come at me with that. You know I I was invited out over the summer or you know earlier before the summer to come out sometime during the summer to go visit Sky Watchers facilities. Uh but that was always tentative and I knew that.</p>
<p>So uh but as of right now I have not made that trip. There&#x27;s no current plans for that to happen. So, you know, let&#x27;s just hope at bare minimum I can at least get an interview or something to include because I do want to talk about Skywatcher in um the Psionics documentary. Um you know, and we are going to talk about him in the documentary, but hopefully it&#x27;s with their comments or input as well. If not, it&#x27;s you know, just me talking about it.</p>
<p>And you know, anyway, let&#x27;s get back to the interview. The thing about Skywatcher is um is that we uh at least in a limited sense have a signal that can be released that sometimes it seems to attract these objects. And so that&#x27;s where the repeatability attempt is coming in. Um &gt;&gt; explain that a bit more. So there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a um I because it&#x27;s a company and I and I&#x27;m not the official spokesperson for it.</p>
<p>The and this is public information that&#x27;s out there is that there&#x27;s a signal that an individual as part of Skywatcher had determined when he was working with the military not as it wasn&#x27;t his purpose to develop it. So he didn&#x27;t take anything out. It was sort of a he noticed something and then he refined the technique and now he knows that he has let&#x27;s say an electromagnetic um sequence that he can release that somehow seems to have these things objects show up and I was there when it happened. We go out on these um these uh week-long uh events in like the middle of nowhere uh and stuff shows up and uh you know some of it&#x27;s been on it&#x27;s some of it&#x27;s you know you can go find it on Twitter but the stuff that&#x27;s on Twitter isn&#x27;t good enough in my opinion. Uh, I&#x27;m more interested in the data data that we&#x27;re more recently collecting with better cameras and better sensor systems because the idea is just to do the science.</p>
<p>Now, don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;re getting to the part where Dr. Gary Nolan brings up that he was threatened with lethal force by the White House um for talking about UAPs. And we&#x27;ll get to that in just a moment. But I wanted to share a little bit more information about Skywatcher dog whistle. See, a couple months ago, I made a a video about it, and here&#x27;s a short clip from that, and I&#x27;ll put a link in the description so you can learn a little bit more about SkyWatcher&#x27;s dog whistling technology.</p>
<p>Just to follow up on the two methods, I&#x27;m curious to know how you determined that these two methods were worthy of experimenting with, is there a history of military use of these methods? And are there any other methods that you are aware of that you haven&#x27;t yet integrated into your into your um field um experiments? &gt;&gt; Yeah, good question. So, we we got here because there is a history with it. So, members of our team that we put together under Skywatcher, like my um my partner James Fowler, who&#x27;s been uh making his way out there as of late um telling his story. He was featured in episode two of Skywatcher and he&#x27;s out there doing podcasts now. James is the is the uh is the engineer of our dog whistle system that was uh originally it&#x27;s where our name SkyWatcher comes from.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a skyatcher system that he put together um in his past life, if you will, and has been deploying the the dog whistle system, which we did call Skywatcher, and has been conducting operations for a number of entities uh in the government and outside of the government um for years now. It&#x27;s been a system that&#x27;s been developed, I would say, mostly over the last six years and um has proven itself to be uh unique in the in in the form that nobody else seems to be able to mimic its its results, let alone the method. And I do have to say like we are we do keep the the dog whistle configuration and how we do it. you know, we we keep that pretty close to our chest and that&#x27;s not because we&#x27;re being um unreasonably secretive. It&#x27;s, you know, it&#x27;s our secret sauce and it&#x27;s something we&#x27;re very proud of and a lot of time and energy has been invested in developing that system and uh we aren&#x27;t sure exactly uh how serious the implications are of of of running this equipment.</p>
<p>So I think there&#x27;s there&#x27;s as much responsibility in keeping this private and trying to get as many um government agencies involved who have the responsibility when it comes to national defense and also uh air domain awareness. And so we&#x27;re trying to work with them to make sure that because there there&#x27;s a potential there&#x27;s a Pandora&#x27;s box here that uh could be opened and if we aren&#x27;t prepared to deal with that um that could pose a number of problems. &gt;&gt; Again, I&#x27;ll put a link in the description to that previous video I made a couple months ago if you want to learn more about Skyatchers dog whistle technology. Now let&#x27;s move on to Dr. Gary Nolan talking about what he thinks the phenomena is and even mentioning that he was threatened by the White House for speaking about the UAP topic.</p>
<p>To close up here, I think it would be useful for you to let us know if you would &gt;&gt; what the hell you think is going on and and and what this has done what this has done to you too. this I mean this has got to kind of come out of left field so to speak in a severe way and so I imagine it&#x27;s put a bit of a bump into your life I mean maybe one that&#x27;s mostly interesting but still you know it&#x27;s to call it strange is to barely scrape the surface so &gt;&gt; what what are what are you what do you make of this that there&#x27;s something nonhuman here and it&#x27;s been here for a long time is my provisional conclusion um and you know The question is not and that people should ask is not is there something here. You have to ask the question first can there something be here and the short answer is of course there can because the universe is 14 billion years old. You could have gotten from one side of the galaxy to the other in our galaxy in Elon Musk&#x27;s Tesla if it were traveling at 10,000 m an hour. Right.</p>
<p>But what got on in the first place doesn&#x27;t mean the same thing as what gets off on the other side. So, um, yes, the short answer is something can be here. What it is, I&#x27;m not 100% sure. And I feel very uncomfortable with the sightings of biological beings, if only because they they just look a little too much like us. And I just can&#x27;t see from a genetics point of view how why the human form is so or even you know two legs and two arms is necessarily biologically the most uh you know successful shape.</p>
<p>So I I think there&#x27;s something here. I think the data the evidence of the hypothesis there&#x27;s more than enough evidence to say that it&#x27;s worth investigating. So I would ask my colleagues to just hold their you know hold their sarcasm for a while. uh because how do you deny thousands of reports like this? And uh you know, I don&#x27;t want to sound conspiratorial, but I mean, I did get a phone call from somebody representing the White House cuz I was talking about something that they felt was a little too on the edge. Uh they said, &quot;You need to just shut up, Gary.&quot; Now, after doing some research, I realized that um I had actually covered this before and didn&#x27;t remember it uh because it was a while ago, but Gary Nolan talked about this threat from the White House and gave a lot more details in a previous interview.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s a clip. I mean, I&#x27;ve said this publicly, so I&#x27;ll say it again. Uh here, I was personally threatened because I knew of a conversation that happened somewhere. Um, and I alluded to it in the most elliptical fashion uh on a public broadcast. Literally a couple of days later, I get a phone call from a friend saying, &quot;XYZ at the White House is really pissed at you and you should not ever say anything like that again because Title 18 applies.&quot; I said, &quot;What does that mean?&quot; Lethal force is operable.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not kidding you. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. I put down the phone and I I I honestly I I I I nearly broke down in tears and I called a reporter friend of mine and to just basically report it &gt;&gt; to them to say this just happened to me. I was just threatened &gt;&gt; be &gt;&gt; because they knew what I was saying. Nobody else would have known what it was I was what I was alluding to.</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not it&#x27;s aliens. U if you&#x27;re if you if they think you&#x27;re disclosing their secure information, you might not be &gt;&gt; Well, I wasn&#x27;t supposed to know it because I heard it from a friend who wasn&#x27;t supposed to tell me in the first place, &gt;&gt; but &gt;&gt; All right. So, let me know what you think in the comments about this. I&#x27;ve got one more clip to share. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve briefed Canadian Parliament.</p>
<p>I went to your parliament in Toronto and I briefed all three parties on it. Um I don&#x27;t even the only ones who didn&#x27;t want to hear anything were the separatists. Um so interestingly but no I I spent two days there on that. Um and we&#x27;ve briefed the European Parliament as well on it and and they&#x27;re aware of what their own some of their own military are talking about. So that I I conclude that there&#x27;s definitely something here.</p>
<p>But I think the more interesting conclusion is if they are if something is here, it&#x27;s likely been here longer than humans have even been civilized. So it really opens the question uh and actually it&#x27;s something that I think Charles Fort actually said is, you know, Earth is probably somebody else&#x27;s property. &gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s a hell of a place to end. So I think we will end there. Now, something I&#x27;m going to be experimenting with is uh responding to some of your YouTube comments at the end of some of my videos.</p>
<p>So, here we go. Ray Carter Y7U says, &quot;How do we know if Patrick isn&#x27;t a convenient planted distraction to deflect Ross&#x27;s narrative?&quot; We don&#x27;t. Just saying. Well, let&#x27;s break that down. Ray, are you saying that uh I was literally put in place to start vetted two years ago just to get to this point where I would distract from Ross&#x27;s narrative right now.</p>
<p>Think about that for just a second. That makes zero sense, y&#x27;all. I had no idea he was going to talk about this stuff. So, uh interesting comment, but uh nice try. Snafu Z6Z says, &quot;Exactly as you say.&quot; Why did Ross feel the need to say this all? What&#x27;s the point of making these statements? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Just confused about it all. I totally hear you, Safu. And that&#x27;s what my biggest question is. Why now? Why is Ross Colt bringing up that the Tic Tac is Loheed Martin technology now? What is the point? Especially with uh UAP hearing happening in Congress. um well was supposed to happen in July but now it&#x27;s being pushed to September with firsthand whistleblowers.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the point in bringing that up now? That&#x27;s the biggest question. So great question. All right y&#x27;all, we&#x27;ll see you on the next video. Please leave your comments down below and I may be answering them on a future video. We&#x27;ll see you on the next one.</p>
<p>Remember, everyday is a gift y&#x27;all. Peace. [Music]</p>
