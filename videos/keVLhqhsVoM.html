            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the deep dive. You know, for decades, one of the uh the real holy grails in physics, something Einstein himself chased late in life, was this idea of a unified field theory. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The notion that electricity, magnetism, and gravity are all fundamentally linked. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. But today, we&#x27;re not starting with like complex equations. We&#x27;re starting with a high school student &gt;&gt; back in the 1920s, &gt;&gt; Thomas Townsen Brown. &gt;&gt; Right. An American inventor who claimed he actually saw that link.</p>
<p>think he saw it happening. &gt;&gt; Mhm. His experiments starting pretty small led him to claim this discovery he called electrogravitics, a force he thought that could maybe even defy gravity. &gt;&gt; And it escalated fast. I mean, from his parents&#x27; garage lab straight into well, the most secret levels of the US military.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, quite a trajectory. &gt;&gt; So, our mission today is to uh unpack this whole story. We need to try and cut through some of the noise here, understand the actual science behind his main discovery, the Bfield Brown effect, and figure out his really strange kind of secretive career, &gt;&gt; and why his name is now just completely tied up with anti-gravity, with classified tech, even UFOs. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How did that happen? Let&#x27;s dive in.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, so the start, 1920s, Brown, he came from a wealthy family, apparently. &gt;&gt; Lucky him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And they really indulged his fascination with electricity. They set him up with his own lab, fully equipped while he was still in high school.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s incredible. A teenager with his own proper lab messing around with, you know, pretty advanced stuff for the time. &gt;&gt; Definitely. And the key moment seems to involve a specific bit of kit, a Coolage X-ray vacuum tube. &gt;&gt; Ah, okay.</p>
<p>And those have asymmetrical electrodes, right? One big, one small. &gt;&gt; Precisely. So Brown hooks this thing up to high voltage DC power, puts it on a really sensitive scale, and he notices something odd. &gt;&gt; What was it? &gt;&gt; Well, depending on which way he pointed the tube, its weight seemed to change. Just a tiny bit, mind you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Tiny how? &gt;&gt; Like if the positive electrode, the smaller one, faced up, the tube registered as slightly lighter. If it faced down, it seemed a bit heavier. &gt;&gt; But even that tiny effect was enough for him. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. He was absolutely convinced.</p>
<p>He thought he&#x27;d done it influence gravity with electricity. And that&#x27;s where the name came from, electrogravidics. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what he coined it. And he started designing bigger devices he called gravitators. &gt;&gt; Gravitators.</p>
<p>Okay. So this leads us to the core idea, the bfail brown effect itself. What is that basically? &gt;&gt; Okay. Simply put, you take an asymmetric capacitor again, one electrode much smaller than the other, and you hit it with really high DC voltage. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>What happens is you get a net force, a push. And interestingly, the thrust is always generated at the negative terminal, pushing the whole thing towards the smaller positive electrode, &gt;&gt; towards the small end. Got it. And Brown&#x27;s ideas for this, &gt;&gt; they weren&#x27;t small at all, were they? &gt;&gt; Not even close. By 1929, he&#x27;s already publishing articles talking about like a revolutionary future.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What kind of future? &gt;&gt; He wasn&#x27;t just thinking lab toys. He envisioned multi-impulse gravitators powering ocean liners, uh, even fantastic space cars going to Mars. &gt;&gt; Oh, that&#x27;s audacious for 1929, decades before space travel was really a thing. &gt;&gt; It really shows you how fundamental he thought this discovery was. Maybe even the practical side of what Einstein was looking for theoretically.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now, about the name Befeld Brown, there&#x27;s a bit of controversy there. &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah, a little footnote. Brown claimed he co-enamed it after a professor Paul Alfred Befeld from Dennis University who he said was his mentor. &gt;&gt; But later on Dennison University basically said uh no they had no record of any joint experiments no formal link between them on this work. &gt;&gt; So Brown might have embellished his connections a bit.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It seems that way. He wasn&#x27;t always strictly factual about his credentials let&#x27;s say but the effect itself the force generated by the capacitor that was definitely real. people could reproduce that. &gt;&gt; Okay, so we have this real effect, maybe tiny but real. &gt;&gt; And Brown has these huge ambitions, but then conventional science steps in, &gt;&gt; right? And this is where the big debate really kicks off because later researchers looked at this thrust and said, &quot;Hang on, this isn&#x27;t new physics.</p>
<p>This is an anti-gravity.&quot; &gt;&gt; They had another explanation. &gt;&gt; They did. Generally, the force got attributed to something called electro-hydrodnamics, EHD. &gt;&gt; EHD. You mean like ionic wind? &gt;&gt; Exactly.</p>
<p>ionic wind or ion drift, it falls under that EHD umbrella. &gt;&gt; How does that work? Why would it look like anti-gravity? &gt;&gt; Okay, think of it like this. You apply that super high voltage, especially near the sharp, small electrode. It rips electrons off air molecules nearby, creates ions, &gt;&gt; right? Ionization. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Then those charged ions get yanked really hard towards the other bigger electrode. As they zoom across the gap, they smack into lots of neutral air molecules &gt;&gt; like microscopic billiard balls &gt;&gt; kind of. Yeah. They transfer momentum. All those collisions create a net flow of air pushing away from the sharp electrode.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s your ionic wind. &gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s propulsion, but it needs air like a tiny silent electric fan built into the device itself. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the conventional view. You&#x27;re essentially just pushing air around very efficiently with electricity. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>But Brown obviously didn&#x27;t buy that. He stuck to his guns saying he was a unique force electrogravidics. What was his counterargument? &gt;&gt; Well, he knew he had to show it wasn&#x27;t just about ionizing air. So, he laid out these five specific criteria for maximizing what he called the true be brown effect. &gt;&gt; What were they? Did they suggest something other than air? &gt;&gt; They heavily involved material science.</p>
<p>For instance, he insisted on using extremely high voltages like over 100,000 volts sometimes and crucially materials with very high dilectric strength. &gt;&gt; Dialectric that&#x27;s about insulation, right? Holding charge without breaking down. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Dialectrics are insulators. Brown&#x27;s point was if this was just EHD blowing air, you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need these super robust, expensive dilectric materials between the electrodes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Why not? Because he argued the high dialectric strength allowed the intense electric field to directly distort or grip spaceime itself. That was his gravity connection instead of just leaking charge into the air as corona discharge. &gt;&gt; So the specific materials and high voltages were for him proof it was something deeper than just air effects. &gt;&gt; That was his claim. He argued his optimal designs were actually bad for simple ion wind but good for his electrogravitic effect.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Which brings us to the obvious test. &gt;&gt; Get rid of the air. the vacuum chamber that became the battleground. &gt;&gt; Brown absolutely tried to prove his point here. He tested his devices, these solid brick-like gravitators submerged in insulating oil or crucially inside vacuum chambers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, what did he claim happened? &gt;&gt; He claimed performance actually improved in a vacuum because you eliminated the energy losses from ionizing the air. He even got a patent in 1965 claiming the force worked without any medium. &gt;&gt; This is where it gets really interesting. connecting his claims to well the military and classified world. He wasn&#x27;t just tinkering was he? &gt;&gt; No, not at all.</p>
<p>He had connections pretty early on. He joined the Navy Reserve in 1930, worked at the Naval Research Lab or NRL. &gt;&gt; Doing what? &gt;&gt; He was involved in things like a Navy Princeton gravity expedition in 32, a deep sea expedition in 33, often working with sensitive gear like sonar and radio. He was getting exposure to military research. &gt;&gt; But then things get murky.</p>
<p>There are claims his life sort of split in two. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some biographers suggest he spent maybe half his career in classified military projects and maybe the other half involved in let&#x27;s say managing the information around that work perhaps even covert intelligence &gt;&gt; and his Navy departure seemed to feed into that mystery. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s really strange. 1942 he suddenly requests to resign.</p>
<p>The record mentions it was to escape trial by general court marshal. &gt;&gt; A court marshal? &gt;&gt; What &gt;&gt; the official reason listed is just no comment. Very cryptic. whatever it was, it cut his formal Navy ties, &gt;&gt; but it didn&#x27;t cut his ties to Advanced Tech because right after that, &gt;&gt; he ends up working as a radar consultant for Loheed Vega Aircraft Corporation. &gt;&gt; Lheed Vega.</p>
<p>That was the precursor to the skunk works, wasn&#x27;t it? &gt;&gt; Exactly. The legendary skunk works, famous for the U2, the SR71, top secret aircraft development. So, he was right there in that lineage of highly classified aerospace work. &gt;&gt; So, he&#x27;s connected. Then jump forward to the mid1 1950s.</p>
<p>Suddenly, electrogravetics is a hot topic. A very hot topic for a short while. Brown was demonstrating his devices to military brass to scientists. It seems like there was a real surge of interest. &gt;&gt; Is there evidence of that interest beyond just Brown&#x27;s demos? &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.</p>
<p>You see aerospace giants like the Glenn L. Martin Company placing these big prominent ads in scientific journals. &gt;&gt; As for what? &gt;&gt; Not for standard engineers. They were explicitly looking for scientists interested in new concepts in propulsion, specifically mentioning gravity research and the link between gravity and electricity. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>So, the big players were seriously looking into this anti-gravity angle. &gt;&gt; It really seems like it. The whole aerospace industry seemed captivated for a moment by the idea of propulsion without rockets or jets &gt;&gt; and then silence &gt;&gt; pretty much just as quickly as it flared up. The public research seemed to die down. The uh conventional story is that electrogravitics rapidly declined in popularity.</p>
<p>Basically, it hit a dead end. &gt;&gt; But there&#x27;s another theory, isn&#x27;t there? The one that connects to his classified background. &gt;&gt; Exactly. The alternative explanation, especially popular in UFO and conspiracy circles, is that the research didn&#x27;t die. It just went black.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Meaning it became highly classified. &gt;&gt; Right? The idea is that it actually did get somewhere. Maybe it worked too well. And so it was pulled completely into the secret world probably around the early 1960s. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s the link.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why TT Brown is such a huge figure for people interested in UFOs and secret government tech. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. If the military was chasing anti-gravity in the &#x27; 50s and then suddenly went quiet, well, the conclusion many draw is that they succeeded and hid it. &gt;&gt; So electrogravitics becomes the go-to explanation for well, for things people see flying that they can&#x27;t explain. &gt;&gt; Precisely.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s often cited as the homegrown terrestrial technology behind UFO sightings. And not just general UFOs, but specific claims, too. &gt;&gt; Like what? &gt;&gt; You hear claims that Brown&#x27;s electrogravetics powers the B2 stealth bomber, explaining its supposedly strange flight characteristics and radar invisibility. It&#x27;s become a key piece of lore. &gt;&gt; And didn&#x27;t it even feature in books about things like the Philadelphia experiment? &gt;&gt; It did.</p>
<p>William Moore and Charles Burlitz in their famous book, The Philadelphia Experiment, devoted a whole chapter to Brown. strongly implying his effect was the kind of advanced physics used by UFOs or in secret projects. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a really compelling narrative. &gt;&gt; But as you said, it all comes back to that core scientific question. Does it work without air? &gt;&gt; Exactly.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the lynch pin. If it only works with air, it&#x27;s just EHD. If it works in a vacuum, it&#x27;s something else, something potentially revolutionary. &gt;&gt; So, we have to look at the official test done in a vacuum, right? To see if Brown&#x27;s claims held up under rigorous conditions. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>And the results from places like the US Air Force and NASA trying to replicate it in a true vacuum have been pretty consistent. &gt;&gt; What do they find? &gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s take two key examples. In 1990, an Air Force researcher RL Thally tested a Befeld Brown type capacitor. He took the pressure way down to about 10 or &gt;&gt; Okay, 10 to how good a vacuum is that? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a pretty serious vacuum. Standard air pressure is 76 to this is 1 millionth of a tour.</p>
<p>getting close to space conditions and the result. &gt;&gt; Tally found no measurable thrust, nothing. &gt;&gt; Okay, what about the other test? &gt;&gt; In 2003, NASA scientist Jonathan Campbell went even further. He tested a similar device, sometimes called a lifter, down to 10 or $7 tour. That&#x27;s an even better vacuum, very much like deep space using up to 50,000 volts.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Same result, no detectable movement. &gt;&gt; So, from the perspective of mainstream verifiable science, the conclusion seems pretty clear. The mainstream conclusion is yes, that Brown, while maybe a clever inventor, fundamentally misinterpreted Corona wind effects. The thrust requires air.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s EHD. &gt;&gt; And yet, the story persists. Brown&#x27;s legacy is still incredibly potent. &gt;&gt; It really is. You&#x27;ve got this duality.</p>
<p>On one hand, there&#x27;s a real verifiable phenomenon, EHD propulsion. We see it in small ionographs, experimental stuff. It works. &gt;&gt; But on the other hand, &gt;&gt; you have this powerful unproven claim of actual anti-gravity. A claim that absolutely captivated the military-industrial complex in the 50s, led to intense research, and then vanished, fueling decades of speculation about classified breakthroughs in UFO tech.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It feels like the truth is caught somewhere between a physics textbook explanation and a top secret government file. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a good way to put it. So, the final question, maybe for you, the listener, to chew on is this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Was Brown really chasing Einstein&#x27;s dream? Maybe finding a physical key to the unified field theory, the secret to anti-gravity flight.</p>
<p>Did those later vacuum tests fail just because, well, the effect wasn&#x27;t real in a vacuum. Or &gt;&gt; or did that potentially worldchanging physics actually work and get snapped up going black back in the early60s, leaving us today with only the public air dependent EHD effect, the easily demonstrated toy version, while the real revolutionary discovery remains hidden deep inside some classified physics black box. What might still be locked</p>
