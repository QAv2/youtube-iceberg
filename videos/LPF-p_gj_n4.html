            <p>space-time metric engineering is a mouthful but it accounts for the physics of the amazing performance seen with ufos in this video dr hal puthoff explains how based upon textbook physics not fringe physics but there&#x27;s a catch watch this video and find out what holds us back let me pick another one space time metric engineering this is a mouthful this happens to be the area that i personally was the leader on the question is can you account for what we&#x27;re seeing based on known physics and of course all the pilots get back and say oh my god i can&#x27;t believe these things and they&#x27;re violating the laws of physics they&#x27;re standing still they&#x27;re taking off instantly [Music] like they don&#x27;t have any inertial mass there&#x27;s this you know we don&#x27;t know how that could even be possible in principle well that&#x27;s fine for the pundits and the media and even the pilots to say but the truth of the matter is we can account for them we can&#x27;t account for them by taking an engineering approach to general relativity einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity so what does that mean well all of our electronic devices you know this device i&#x27;m holding your cell phones the lights whatever you want to say are all using equations using electromagnetism electromagnetism has its foundational equations and everything that we have is really built on the what the equations predict and that that&#x27;s a completely mined area of science and technology when it comes to general relativity einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity that&#x27;s mostly been in the purview of astrophysicists are trying to figure out what happens when black holes emerge or whatever no one ever thought of taking the equations of general relativity just like we have the equations for electromagnetism maxwell&#x27;s equation and say well suppose we could engineer those equations suppose we could build something based on those equations this is textbook physics we&#x27;re talking about not not fringe physics so one of my jobs was then to make a list of all the weird anomalies uh reported about these objects actually from my standpoint the weirder the better because if somebody is making up something and that&#x27;s fraudulent in the hoax they&#x27;re going to try to say something that&#x27;s you know kind of could sell makes sense when somebody comes up and says well you know i was outside the craft and it was only that big but when i got inside it was a football field and size i mean you know so we list all the weird aspects that have been reported and list all what would be the weird things you would find if you could engineer general relativity equations and they matched up hand and glove i&#x27;ll give you some examples for example warp drive how about zipping across the universe and you always hear we you can&#x27;t do that it&#x27;s uh you know you can&#x27;t beat the speed of light and so on well that whole thing about not beating the speed of light has to do with einstein&#x27;s special theory relativity but it turns out that in general theory of relativity there&#x27;s a way to do that here&#x27;s a very famous astrophysicist by the name of alcubierre he was a star trek fan and so he said you know i wonder if i could find solutions in general relativity that would let me make warp drive and i have a lot of constraints on that you know i want to leave it breakfast time have breakfast time at home go to alpha centauri for lunch come back and have dinner with my family and i want them still to be the same age i am and on the trip i don&#x27;t want to be turned into salsa on the back of the spaceship with giant accelerations in fact i&#x27;d like to just be feel like normal kind of things and so he worked through that solution and developed what&#x27;s now called the alcubierre warp drive he published this in an absolutely tier one physics journal that deals with general relativity and so it was very sort of famous picture of what his warp drive solution looked like where he sort of depress space-time metric as we call it in front of the ship and build it up behind and and let space-time metric push you through and so on so there&#x27;s a whole cottage industry of general relativity theorists who are working on various forms of warp drive and so on what about the velocity of light constraint again in general relativity you can solve the equation and come up with something called for example wormhole and again i&#x27;m talking about fringe physics this is a textbook material matt visser is one of the great general relativity theorists and if there are any engineers in the crowd for the engineers in the crowd i would point out that well what do you mean by velocity of light velocity of light is given by a little equation here one over the square root of the magnetic permeability and the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum so if you want to go fast the speed of light you just simply arrange to reduce the value of those constants and now the effective speed of light in your engineered region is much higher and so even though you&#x27;re zipping through a fastened speed of light as far as anyone on the ground is concerned actually within your engineered space you&#x27;re not actually beating the speed of light but it works in principle so the take-home message here is reduced time interstellar travel either by e.t or ourselves in the future is not as naive consideration might hold fundamentally constrained by physical principles and it can be addressed the exotic physics and engineering terms metric engineering so you might well ask okay well then why aren&#x27;t we zipping around the universe and well unfortunately when you solve the equation you say oh yeah all these things could be done what would be the engineering required to do it well in our solution so far it&#x27;s oh my gosh we have to have so much energy density compactified in such a small volume there&#x27;s no way we can get here get there with our present engineering smarts so it&#x27;s going to be far future for us unless we happen to find some kind of back door that lets us through so in fact that was one of the papers fact is the paper that i published so it was one of the defense intelligence reference documents one of the 38 that went up on the special website but by the way as i mentioned we didn&#x27;t tell these authors that we got through what about going into matter well it just turns out that one of the outcomes in the list of weird things from space diametric engineering is that materials under those conditions are so hardened that they&#x27;re like made out of diamond or better and the rest of the world looks like butter so even going into matter going high velocity into the water or whatever is one of the predictions of the modeling so i haven&#x27;t talked about it specifically i mean there have been some reported cases but you know they came from the public so you don&#x27;t know whether to believe it or not of craft going into mountains and stuff like that no explosion no so anyway those that&#x27;s all just debris intellectual debris on the table that we&#x27;re trying to put together like a jigsaw puzzle and um so there hasn&#x27;t been any particular reason not to talk about it or to talk about it i mean the data we have and performing the data that&#x27;s what we want to concentrate uh we don&#x27;t have good data on that so i&#x27;m happy to be personally interested because it&#x27;s one of the predictions of the modeling but so many that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where that stands so anyway is there anything you can learn from this that can help us in terms of evaluating observations in the world associated with unidentified aerial phenomena i&#x27;ll just give you one example and i have about a thousand i could give but that would take a week or so in this room most of the electromagnetic energy you can&#x27;t see why because it&#x27;s in the infrared in the form of heat and there&#x27;s a very narrow band in the electromagnetic spectrum that you can see and that&#x27;s what we call you know the visible spectrum and then there are higher frequencies into the ultraviolet and beyond that we that we don&#x27;t see now it turns out that one of the side effects of engineering space time metric to get this kind of flight performance is that it we call it blue shifts the frequencies all the frequencies that are involved get moved to a higher frequency that&#x27;s just built into what the equations say when you generate these anomalous effects so what that means then and has significance for us is the infrared we don&#x27;t ordinarily see gets blue shifted up into the visible so when we hear that these craft are so bright and so luminous when you see them it&#x27;s not not a surprise and then what was in the visible spectrum gets shifted up into let&#x27;s say the ultraviolet and so if you get too close to one of these things that are powered up you&#x27;ll get a sunburn often reported by people who claim to have gotten close to a craft and if you get too close you might actually pick up some of the blue shifted radiation from the visible that&#x27;s now blue shifted up into the soft x-ray region and get radiation poisoning and there have been cases where that&#x27;s been reported so having this set of equations and seeing what they predict and then going out and matching against real data i mean that&#x27;s really a really a boon i&#x27;ll give you one example clarisse island in brazil 1977 1978 they had a massive wave that lasted for many days of like a scene from close encounters is the third kind or whatever hundreds of advanced aerospace vehicles were observed by civilians and the brazilian air force investigative team they set up a whole operation called operation plate by the brazilian air force more than a thousand pages of documents logs sketches and maps more than 500 photographs 15 hours of motion film physiological effects and medical injuries and so in our atip program all this information was compiled into a big database and we did our best to analyze the implications so part of what led to the engineering space time metric engineering as we call it is when you see all these injuries you say well what could have caused that well this blue shifting would cause it but where do you get blue shifty oh from einstein&#x27;s equations if you were able to generate the space-time metric engineering thanks for
