            <p>You know, &gt;&gt; so aliens are real. &gt;&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that. &gt;&gt; He made He made a big mistake.</p>
<p>He took it out of classified information. No, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Do you believe it, Peter? &gt;&gt; Well, the president can declassify anything that he wants to. Maybe I&#x27;ll get him out of trouble. I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. &gt;&gt; November 2026. A date, a warning, and [music] now a political twist.</p>
<p>For decades, the name Baba Vanga has floated between folklore and fear. The blind Bulgarian mystic, often dubbed the Nostradamus [music] of the Balkans, made chilling predictions that believers say foresaw events from 9/11 to [music] Brexit. But it&#x27;s one prophecy that&#x27;s suddenly roaring back into headlines. Vonga claimed that in [music] November 2026, a massive spacecraft would enter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, delivering undeniable proof [music] that we are not alone. She never clarified whether this arrival would [music] be peaceful.</p>
<p>Some interpretations go further, suggesting it could spark [music] global conflict, even World War II. And now with Washington reopening the alien debate, many believe the countdown has begun. It all started when President Donald Trump announced he was ordering his administration [music] to open public access to classified records related to aliens [music] and UFOs. Trump said the files would be made accessible, though the timing and details remain unclear. Trump&#x27;s move followed fresh remarks from former President Barack Obama, who during a conversation with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen appeared to validate the existence of extraterrestrials.</p>
<p>The internet [music] exploded, but Obama later clarified on Instagram he was speaking about mathematical probability, not secret alien encounters. Still, the stage was set. [music] Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump accused Obama of revealing classified information, saying he made a big mistake. &gt;&gt; He made a big mistake. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s [music] exactly why Baba Vanga&#x27;s words are resurfacing.</p>
<p>Now, Baba Vanga&#x27;s prediction described a giant spacecraft breaking into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. [music] Her believers argue that government disclosure always precedes revelation, but probability [music] is not proof. unidentified is not extraterrestrial and prophecy is not evidence. The Pentagon investigated UAP [music] sightings for years with no confirmed proof of extraterrestrial technology. A 2024 [music] Pentagon report said most sightings were likely natural or man-made objects, not alien craft.</p>
<p>Scientists and federal agencies remain clear. Acknowledging unidentified aerial phenomena is not the same as confirming alien visitation. NASA and Pentagon investigators have found [music] no verifiable extraterrestrial evidence so far. Despite rising public fascination and now Trump&#x27;s renewed [music] attention, White House press secretary Carolene Levit laughed off a question about [music] President Obama&#x27;s alien claims on the podcast. &gt;&gt; President Barack Obama Caroline was recently asked if aliens are real.</p>
<p>He says they&#x27;re real, but he hasn&#x27;t seen them. President&#x27;s daughter-in-law Laura Trump told Miranda Devine of the New York Post that the president has a prepared speech on this issue that he prepares to deliver at the right time. Is that [clears throat] true? And does [laughter] the Trump administration believe aliens are real? &gt;&gt; Well, a speech on aliens would be news to me. That sounds very exciting, though. I&#x27;ll have to check in with our speech writing team.</p>
<p>Uh, and that would be of great interest to me personally, and I&#x27;m sure all of you in this room. &gt;&gt; Will Trump&#x27;s [music] disclosure lead to historic revelations or just more questions? Can declassified UFO files finally satisfy a curious [music] public? Stay tuned to find out.</p>
