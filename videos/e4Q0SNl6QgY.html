            <p>[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] 66 go [Music] This means greater coverage and analysis of international news. For it is no longer far away and foreign, but close at hand and local. very first to the knee. need for far greater public information and second to the need for far greater official secrecy. The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically.</p>
<p>Even today there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. Heat. Heat. that I do not intend to commit extended in my control.</p>
<p>No official of my administration whether his rank is high or low. civilian or military should interpret my words here tonight. to send the news, stifle descent, to cover up our mistakes or with friends and public the facts they deserve to know. But I do ask every publisher, every editor, every newsman of the nation to reexamine his own standards and to recognize the nature of our country&#x27;s peril. In time of war, the government and the press have customarily joined in an effort based largely on selfisipline to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy.</p>
<p>In times of clear and present danger, courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public&#x27;s need for national security. Today, no war has been declared. And however fierce the struggle may be, it may never be declared in the traditional fashion. Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe.</p>
<p>Our friends is in danger. And yet no war has been declared. No borders have been no missiles have been fired. I know they ask. [Music]</p>
