            <p>if you believe we have crashed craft uh stated earlier do we have the bodies of the pilots as I&#x27;ve stated publicly already in my news Nation interview biologics came recoveries um were they I guess human or non-human biologics non-human and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program and was this documentary references video photos eyewitness like how would that be determined specific documentation I would have to talk to you in a skiff about um okay so and you may or may not be able to answer my last question and maybe we get into a skiff at the next hearing that we have but who in the government either what agency sub-agency who should be called into the next hearing about uaps et cetera do we need to call in to get these questions answered whether it&#x27;s about funding what programs are happening and what&#x27;s out there I can give you a specific cooperative and hostile witness list of specific individuals uh that were in those and how soon can we get that list to provide that to you after the hearing super thank you and I yield back with that being said you have mentioned that there&#x27;s interdimensional potential could you expound on that in terms of uh multi-dimensionality that kind of thing the the framework that I&#x27;m familiar with for example is something called the holographic principle uh both uh it&#x27;s it derives itself from general relativity and quantum mechanics and that is if you want to imagine uh 3D objects such as yourself casting a shadow onto a 2d surface uh that&#x27;s the holographic principle so you can be projected quasi-projected from higher dimensional space to lower dimensional it&#x27;s a scientific Trope that you can actually cross literally as far as I understand but there&#x27;s probably guys with phds that we could probably argue about that but you have not seen any documentation that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s occurring uh only a theoretical framework discussion said that the US has intact spacecraft said that the government has alien bodies or alien species have you seen could you have you seen the spacecraft I have to be careful to describe what I&#x27;ve seen firsthand and not in this environment but I could answer that question like behind closed doors and have you seen any of the bodies that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve not witnessed myself there are common characteristics to the uaps that have been cited by different Pilots certainly we were primarily seeing dark gray or black cubes inside of a clear sphere I&#x27;m sorry dark gray or black cubes yes inside of a clear sphere believe it or not all right [Music] let&#x27;s have uaps yes or no I don&#x27;t have an answer to that as previewed previously stated publicly yes previously with like Project Blue Book yes but currently I don&#x27;t speak for the United States government um what percentage of UAP sightings in your belief go unreported by our Pilots this is an approximation based off of my personal experience speaking with a number of Pilots but I would estimate we&#x27;re somewhere near five percent reporting perhaps so like 95 basically don&#x27;t report seeing UAP now is it true that you saw in your words a 40-foot flying Tick Tock shaped object that&#x27;s correct or for some people that can&#x27;t know what a Tic Tac is it&#x27;s a giant flying propane tank there been any has there been an active U.S government disinformation campaign to deny the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena and if so why it can&#x27;t go beyond what I&#x27;ve already exposed publicly about that</p>
