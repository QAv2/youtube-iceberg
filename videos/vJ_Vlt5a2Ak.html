            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this channel is for the purposes of education and uh we generally look at theories of everything uh in depth and uh today is the 335th video that we&#x27;ve done on Dewey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory uh the reciprocal system of theory was uh something that Larson uh first had an inkling of back in about 1930 took about 25 30 years to kind of work out the Kinks of his ideas and to uh put it into very concise form of his two fundamental postulates which are only you know basically like two sentences and um then he took those two postulates and through a period of deduction uh came up with a theoretical Universe How the Universe would work if uh his postulates were true and then from there he um wrote books based on those uh that theoretical universe that kind of compared his Universe with the theoretical with the uh un The observed and articulated Universe of Legacy science in most cases his theories really agree very closely with uh the Legacy scientists the Newtonian worldview but like Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity in those areas on the margins of the very fast the very small and the very large um Larson&#x27;s theories diverged from the Newtonian um worldview those are kind of like what would be called the relativistic areas same areas that Einstein was trying to correct in many cases uh the corrections that Larson made were mathematically the same as kind of what Einstein made but conceptually very very different Einstein many times did not have the concepts Pro the proper Concepts behind the things that he was doing and a lot of times he was just borrowing uh math from somebody else um and was using a lot of fudge factors and things that uh uh you know weren&#x27;t uh not just Einstein but like kind of the einsteinian Revolution um and so but Larsson has the concepts he he can tell you why this doesn&#x27;t work why we need why why we have this math the way that we have it in some cases in many cases uh for the einsteinian uh the math was just the math and they did it didn&#x27;t mean anything for for example for Heisenberg Heisenberg uh you know thought that the there was nothing behind the math it&#x27;s just math it it has no meaning conceptually um and so that&#x27;s what Larson is kind of uh I I think that&#x27;s one of the far reaching consequences of his theory now the basic idea in larsson&#x27;s system is that we live in a universe that is made entirely out of motion not matter not energy not force but in fact all three of those things are just just specific kinds of motion and for lson uh motion was the relationship between space and time which creates a reciprocal relationship between space and time uh motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator time or space as the denominator and space or time are the same except that they are reciprocals of one another and so they have the same general qualities one of which is that they are both three-dimensional uh whatever one uh whatever quality one has the other also has and so Larson refers to this as coordinate space space and coordinate time three dimensions of space XYZ coordinates three dimensions of time you might think of that as I JY coordinates or i j k coordinates and um space and time are also have their clock aspects clock space and clock time this is what is referred to as a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction Direction the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but in no specific Direction and so to the um space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no specific direction and you can Envision this using a balloon with dots on it you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other and and uh that is a scalar motion they&#x27;re not moving in any particular direction not until you identify a reference point when you identify one of those dots as being stationary then you can see the motion away from that particular um you can see the direction of the motion away from that particular dot but um that is actually a property of the reference system not a property of the motion itself the motion itself has no Direction it doesn&#x27;t have a direction until you assign the reference point uh and then the last thing uh in Larson&#x27;s first postulate is that space and time uh only come in discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time below that you have no space and you have no time um and so uh and if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light the speed of light is what Larsson calls unit speed 1 over 1 equals 1 and um that basically uh is the Crux of the reciprocal system one is the center so half of the universe is moving moving faster than one or half uh faster than the speed of light and half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light that&#x27;s the key uh one of the key differences between Larson system and the Legacy system the Legacy system its background or its zero point is actually zero meaning that plus one plus 2 plus 3 + 4 + 5 on one side and -1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 on the other side side but in LaRon system one is at the center uh you could think of that uh if you want to call it the zero point you would think of one to the 0o one to the 0o or anything to the 0o is one so you would think of it as to the zero power um instead of the zero point you might want to call it the zero power and on the on one side of the balance you would would have 2 3 4 and five but on the other side of the balance you would have 1/2 1 1/3 1/4 and 1/5 so they multiply to one as opposed to adding to zero and so if you have unit speed as your zero power or your zero point then um half of the universe is actually moving at speeds faster than the speed of light Larson calls that the cosmic sector and then half is moving slower than the speed of light Larson calls that the material sector the material sector is really the only sector that Legacy science knows about hence uh Einstein&#x27;s dictum that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe in larsson&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is the midpoint meaning that Einstein is missing half of the universe in his formulations and um but it&#x27;s not necessarily fatal because whatever is going on in the material sector is exactly the same as what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector as they are reciprocals of one another the only thing that you have to do is invert the roles of space and time as you cross that unit speed boundary so uh in the COS in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and you have clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later but in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time three dimensions of time and you have clock space the clock uh the uh space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart Allah a um expanding balloon with dots on it also measured and observed by the Hubble telescope that determined that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other um so this scalar motion is at a fundamental to Larson&#x27;s system whereas in the Legacy science they recognize the existence of scalar motion but they have never really investigated the properties of scalar motion and consider it just a sideshow for Larson is it&#x27;s at the center now today we are on I believe the fourth episode of uh going over larsson&#x27;s paper that is called the mechanism of the universe and uh in this paper he&#x27;s talking mainly about cosmology looking at uh the macro Universe like the astronomical uh he went over uh the major models of of cosmology uh this the big Big Bang the uh oscillating theory of the universe and the um steady state theory of the universe these are three different models of how the universe formed and he more or less rejected all three or at least at least parts of all three and um eventually he&#x27;s going to be kind of proposing how he sees the mechanism of the universe uh with his idea of the universe made out of um three dimensions of scalar Motion in discrete units and um so we&#x27;re going to start here with larsson&#x27;s paper and uh we&#x27;ll see where we go here in these immediate consequences of the concept of a universe of motion we have an explanation of the recession of the galaxies that comes directly out of basic Theory and requires no ad hoc assumptions the universe is moving outward at the speed of light in all directions that is the zero point or the zero power of this universe so that uh explains the recession of the distant galaxies right out of the Chute but it should now be evident why I raised the question with respect to the current belief that the answer to the galactic recession is the answer to the whole cosmological problem the explanation of the recession at which we have arrived does not solve the problem it merely rules out the ad hoc assumptions that have been made and thereby deepens the mystery the ultimate fate of the receding galaxies is still a wide openen question and the origin of the galaxies is more of a problem than before continuous creation is inconsistent with the basic elements of the new Theory and the Big Bang concept is eliminated from consideration as the recession has been identified as due to a different cause but the galaxies that formerly occupied the regions just beyond the gravitational limits have moved away and yet there is no additional vacant space where did the present occupants of these regions come from we can approach this question most conveniently in a sort of roundabout way another line of deductions from the basic postulates an extension of the deductive chain from which we arrived at the nature of the atomic structure discloses that this atom is subject to an age limit now this comes from his string of deductions uh from the fundamental postulates that he from which he created his theoretical Universe now if you go way back in the archives uh and some of the First episodes uh of these 335 episodes I&#x27;ve done about larsson&#x27;s Theory uh I did about 15 episodes on Larson&#x27;s uh outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so he has 100 65 or so steps that he takes to go from his fundamental postulates to his theoretical universe and within those steps he covers uh the at you know where the atom comes from the atom is a combination of different rotational motions everything is made out of motion and an atom is a a combination of a few different rotational motions and uh it is also subject to an age limit meaning that as it gets older and older as time goes by uh it builds itself up more and more to the point where eventually it becomes unstable and so as it gets older and older and older the chances of it becoming unstable and there therefore radioactive uh become higher and higher and higher so he calls that the age limit of matter and that the age limit of matter is what eventually causes stars in galaxies to explode um uh or maybe implode as they become radioactive um when an atom of matter arrives at the limiting age its rotational motion reverts to the translational status which would be radiation or or light so it it uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s goes from matter to energy that is the atomic mass is converted to energy a further line of deductions leads to the conclusion that most of the oldest matter accumulates in the Interiors of the largest galaxies the attainment of the age limit on a massive scale in one of these giant galaxies results in a tremendous explosion which accelerates portions of the remaining mass of the galaxies to a speed in excess of the speed of light the question then becomes what happens to this fast moving matter for an answer to this question we need to return to the fact previously deduced that space and time are the two reciprocal aspects of motion and nothing else this means that the reciprocal relation is a general relation that is effective throughout the Universe an immediate consequence is that for every physical entity or phenomenon there necessarily exists another entity or phenomenon that is similar in all respects except that space and time are interchanged the inversion may be only partial appying to only one of the Motions involved the translational motion for example or it may apply to all of these motions all of the familiar entities of our material Universe are therefore duplicated in the inverse manner which leads to the conclusion that what we have been regarding as the physical universe is actually only 1/ half of the physical universe as a whole there also exists an exact duplicate the cosmic sector differing only in that where whenever space is involved in any of the phenomena of our material sector the inverse or Cosmic sector as we will call it substitutes time where we have time it has space the cosmic sector where we have in the material sector where we have time the cosmic sector has space and vice versa where we have space the cosmic sector has time the next question that naturally arises is where is this Cosmic sector of the universe here we need to look at the speed magnitudes as already brought out the natural reference system is moving at unit speed which we can easily identify as as the speed of light in our material sector the prevailing speeds are less than unity and the result is motion in space now I&#x27;m admittedly a little bit dense and sometimes it takes me a while to get things um but Larson does have a tendency to sometimes gloss over things by using terms like of course and um you know no doubt and easily and obvious um when he makes a a kind of a jump and a lot of times when he does that it&#x27;s not obvious to me and it&#x27;s not of course to me it&#x27;s like huh uh I wish you would explain that a little more and you know so here he says is here we need to look uh where is this Cosmic sector here we need to look at it at the speed magnitudes as already brought out the material reference system is moving at unit speed and then he says which we can easily identify as the speed of light now to me that isn&#x27;t obvious and it&#x27;s not an easy identification I really wish that Larsson would go slowly over that point to kind of try to uh explain to me why unit speed is necessarily the speed of light now that I&#x27;ve studied the reciprocal system for many years I think I can kind of figure it out and knowing that Einstein has the dictum that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the Universe I can kind of uh think that okay well that makes sense that Lars uh that Einstein is saying that the speed of light is the speed limit and that um that that then easily explains why he doesn&#x27;t know anything about the cosmic sector and that the there&#x27;s this entire half of the universe that he&#x27;s missing out on I can kind of piece it together once I have a a lot of other background information and it makes sense to me that the speed of light unit speed is unit speed but um I just feel a little bit offut when he says that we can easily identify this as the speed of light um maybe if I were a a Droid theoretician or if I was a um a PhD level scientist or something like that but just as a lay person that isn&#x27;t obvious to me and um so I I feel a bit uh uneasy about accepting it uh I&#x27;m okay with accepting it because I believe that you need to do that with larsson&#x27;s Theory you have to accept it h as is and then debunk it later you can&#x27;t because if if you just uh are are skeptical about everything he says you won&#x27;t even get past page one you know uh because he&#x27;s going to say a lot of things that fly in the face of things that you currently already believe um if you&#x27;re kind of a legacy scientist and so I do believe that you have to kind of like accept uh what Larson says and then you you can marinate it in your mind and and see if it adds up as opposed to just rejecting it out of hand and um so I will accept that what he&#x27;s saying is that unit speed can be easily identified as the speed of light but I still feel a little bit uh you know skeptical because uh uh mainly just the way that he says it we can easily identify this well if it if it&#x27;s so easy why isn&#x27;t it obvious to me so just my uh two cents there in our material sector the prevailing speeds are less than unity and the result is motion in space in the cosmic sector where space and time are interchanged the speed is greater than unity and the result is motion in time a change of location in threedimensional time that is analogous to the changes of location in threedimensional space that resulted or that result from motion at speeds less than Unity thus each of the structures of the cosmic sector the cosmic Stars Cosmic galaxies Etc is separated from us by a certain amount of time just as there are spatial separations between our location and the various structures of the material sector we receive the same kinds of information from the cosmic sector that reach us from the distant regions of the material sector one radiation and two individual particles of matter but gravitation in the material sector is a motion in space and it produces Aggregates in which the constituent atoms are contiguous in space but widely dispersed in time the radiation received from such an aggregate is therefore highly concentrated in space and since we are a proximately at rest in space relative to the emitting aggregate we can recognize the radiation as coming from a discrete object however gravitation in the cosmic sector is a motion in time and it produces Aggregates in which the constituent atoms are contiguous in time but widely dispersed in Space the radiation from these Aggregates reaches us from the widely dispersed spatial locations and instead of being concentrated in the manner of radiation from a material star or Galaxy it is space facially isotropic this is the background radiation that has been interpreted as evidence in favor of The Big Bang Theory we likewise encounter Cosmic stars and galaxies from time to time but because of the way in which their constituents are dispersed in in space we encounter them as occasional single Cosmic atoms rather than EG aggates so when things come over from the cosmic sector we see them as widely dispersed and we see them as um individual atoms not as Aggregates and so that explains what what we call the Three Degree Cosmic ra background radiation um okay uh that I&#x27;m glad he doesn&#x27;t say that that&#x27;s obvious because uh it&#x27;s far from obvious uh and it is you know you have to think abstractly about that before it makes sense but um it does make sense to me at this point so anyway I&#x27;m going to stop it off here before I get up on my Soap Box again and U we will take over at this point here in uh the next episode thank you for tuning in and have a beautiful day</p>
