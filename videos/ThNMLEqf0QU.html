            <p>thank you all I okay I can hear me so I guess you can hear me I am something of an outlier at this conference because I don&#x27;t have anything about ancient civilizations catastrophic impacts sacred geometries or magic plasmoids what I have is the deeply personal story of a strange Odyssey that has taken me through some of the science of the 20th century so by the way of a first step to bring you all along on this journey with me I&#x27;m going to share with you something I stumbled on about 20 years ago from a dean of early science fiction named Eden Philpot who said the universe is filled with magical things patiently waiting for our wits to get sharper this has been a beacon for me that has at times guided me through what seemed like a dark and forboding landscape and I&#x27;m reasonably certain that all of you can sympathize with this sentiment otherwise why would we be here at the cosmic Summit and I want to thank George here for including me the in these proceedings it&#x27;s really an honor to be here and I especially want to thank Stephanie Mark for holding my hand when I turned into a four-year-old when I learned that I had to turn the presentation I had created with keynote into PowerPoint so by way of a preamble to what I&#x27;m going to share with you today I I&#x27;m going to show you the way that modern culture can predict the future in 1905 a French magician by the name of George mes used the magic of a new medium called Cinema to imagine what a trip to the moon might be like one day and then just 64 years later 2 and up some on back we cop down e here the eagle has landed Roger Tranquility we copy you on the ground you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue we&#x27;re breathing again thanks a lot all right I&#x27;m sharing you that with you because for 40 years now I&#x27;ve been obsessed with a scene from another movie from the 1980s and wondering ing if it has similar predictive qualities Mary you&#x27;ve got to come back with me where Back to the Future wait a minute what are you doing doc I need fuel go ahead quick get in the car hey Doc we better back up we don&#x27;t have enough road to get up to 88 roads well we&#x27;re going we don&#x27;t need roads [Music] all right to my sensibilities there are at least three things in that scene that could be harbingers of things to come and quite possibly lost Technologies from the 20th century when he returns from the future doc Brown&#x27;s DeLorean is powered by Mr Fusion rather than the fision plutonium reactor that was a focus of the early part of the movie and if you&#x27;re familiar with the movie then you know that something called the flux capacitor is Central to the story and finally there is the Curious Coincidence of Doc Brown&#x27;s name and now you&#x27;re probably wondering who is this guy standing before you and I am this guy I grew up in Springsteen country Monmouth County New Jersey I was a mostly mediocre student but I had bizarre affinity for a wide range of auor reservation ideas and by the way that&#x27;s me right after I finished the first draft of this presentation in keynote and that&#x27;s me doing the conversion to PowerPoint but I digress what are my credentials well I have a ba in Communications I am not uh an MS or a PhD I may be add or OCD but I don&#x27;t think they award Advanced degrees for that but the reason I&#x27;m standing here today is because of something that happened to me and a story that I heard on this Hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean in the late summer of 1973 what happened that day planted the seed that later produced these two books which are the biographies of these two obscure 20th century scientists their work I firmly believe is alluded to in that last scene that I just showed you from Back to the Future in the summer of 73 I had just graduated with my BA in Communications from Antioch college and as a citizen of the 60s counterculture I was interested in the alternative uses of the new portable video technology the lug it on your shoulder version of what we all have in our pockets today my primary guide for this work was a magazine called video software uh yeah radical software that was originally published out of New York but that Summer&#x27;s Edition came out of San Francisco because I would learn that is where video was invented in the 1920s within the pages of this video City Edition I found a poem the electromagnetic Spectrum blues and I saw photos of television from the 1920s and 30s that I&#x27;d never seen before and the poem it turned out was an elegy to a man I had never heard of before Pho T Farnsworth who I would come to learn found the key to electronic video and singlehandedly delivered television to the planet in the 1920s by the time forworth had reached his teens it seemed only a matter of time before Motion Pictures would somehow be merged with radio and Magic P moving pictures would magically fly through the air the earliest attempts at this miracle relied on Electro Mechanical Devices employing spinning discs and mirrors to achieve the effect of tearing an image down into its component elements and converting that into a stream of electricity this is John loie bar a Scotsman operating one of those early Contraptions in the mid 1920s you can practically see the wheel spinning and this is as good as mechanical television ever got then in the late 1920s scientists across the globe including Scottish inventor John Loi bad finally developed a technique to send moving pictures through the air as they said at the time we have lit a candle that will never go out that light still Burns today and it is shining ever brighter well if that light shines ever brighter it is not and I&#x27;m sorry to say this for any of the Brits here it&#x27;s not because of anything that John loie Barett invented how we got from that to what we have today begins in 1905 with this guy in 1905 Albert Einstein published four papers that altered the course of human understanding the first paper Einstein published in 1905 described the photo El electric effect explaining how photons become electrons or more precisely how light becomes electricity the second paper explained the behavior of particles in a fluid proving some somehow the existence of atoms and molecules the third paper introduced one of Einstein&#x27;s most famous theories special relativity which fundamentally altered our understanding of space and time and the fourth paper introduced the most famous equation of all time eal mc^2 explaining the relationship between mass and gravity this is the cosmological soup that nures Nur Ed many of the technological innovations of the 20th century all right now we come to the audience participation of today&#x27;s program I&#x27;m going to ask a question I&#x27;d like to see a show of hands if you know the answer but please don&#x27;t blur it out does anybody know for which of these four papers from 1905 Albert Einstein was awarded his Nobel Prize all right for those of you who didn&#x27;t raise your hands how many of you think it was number three special relativity how many think it was number four eal mc^2 not getting a lot of hands here well that&#x27;s okay because those are both trick questions because in 1921 Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect his suggestion that light is composed of discrete packets of energy what Max plank had called quanta fixed the foundation of all the quantum mechanics that came after and I&#x27;m going to draw a straight line from the photoelectric effect through eal mc² to what Doc Brown came back from the future with that trajectory Begins the year after Einstein&#x27;s miracle year when the boy with the unlikely name arrived on the planet and though he was born in this crude Log Cabin pho forns withth arrived on the planet at a time when relativity and quantum mechanics had not had already arrived and that is an accident of faith that uniquely prepared him when he confided in his father his heart&#x27;s desire that he might have been born an inventor and television he thought might be a good thing to invent to launch a career as an inventor to that end K learned all he could about electrons and how they could be deflected by electromagnets in something called a cathode ray tube it&#x27;s important to note here that turning electricity into light as you see in these illustrations that&#x27;s the easy part of the equation turning light into electricity was always the missing piece of the puzzle and how that finally happened is described in chapter one of the boy who invented television which I&#x27;m going to read for you now here we go while the great minds of science financed by the biggest companies in the world wrestled with 19th century answers to a 20th century problem the summer of 1921 found Pho T Farnsworth age 14 strapped to a horsedrawn disc Arrow cultivating a field row by row turning the soil and dreaming about television to relieve the monotony as the open Summer Sun blazed down on him he stopped for a moment and turned around to survey the afternoon&#x27;s work in one Vivid moment everything he had been thinking about synthesized in a novel way and a daring idea crystallized in this boy brain as he surveyed the field he had just plowed one row at a time he imagined trapping light in an empty jar and transmitting it one line at a time on a magnetically deflected beam of electrons in the spring of 1922 Farnsworth Drew this sketch for his high school science teacher this is the image dissector the first camera tube and while we take video entirely for granted today this was a breakthrough of Epic Proportions at its time it was a breakthrough in what humans could do to focus and steer Quantum forces and particles and every video screen on the planet can trace its Origins to this sketch in 1926 he obtained some seed funding what would call Angel Capital today from a group of financiers associated with the crocker Bank in San Francisco they set him up in this Loft at the foot of Telegraph Hill in San Francisco and in 1927 video as we know it finally arrived on the planet with a single line of light being beamed into an electronic dissecting tube and from another tube a cathode ray tube the simple image the straight line being hazily reproduced the world&#x27;s first all electronic transmission of television and while it may not look like much what is lost to history is this is the first practical application of Einstein&#x27;s cosmological soup and perhaps a lasting gift from that Universe of magical things the many patent that Farnsworth was awarded during the 1930s were indispensable to the art of video and he was famous for a while commercial television was introduced to the world it&#x27;s something of a stunt that David saroff the president of the radio Corporation of America pulled at the New York Fair New York World&#x27;s Fair in 1939 later that year RCA began selling televisions to an eager public and introduced the revisionist history that RCA had delivered television to the world and where is Pho Farnsworth while all that was happening by 1939 Farnsworth was pretty well burned out from having singlehandedly delivered television to the world and the stress of having to defend his patents against monopolies like RCA so by the time RCA finally agreed to pay par Farnsworth for the use of his patents he had retreated to a farm in Maine where he essentially sat out World War II now after last Summer&#x27;s Blockbuster movie about Robert Oppenheimer we all know what happened in the first half of the 1940s so you might be interested to learn who was the most renowned scientist of the day who did not participate in the Manhattan Project in fact early in the war Farnsworth was invited to participate in enrio fairy&#x27;s Atomic pile project in Chicago but he had grave suspicions about what the secret project entailed and he confided in his wife that he wanted nothing to do with building an atomic bomb instead FS were focused his unique firsthand Knowledge from years of experience messing with Cosmic with Quantum forces to think of something that the assembled Geniuses at Los Alamos could scarcely imagine and that was the story that I heard on that bluff in Santa Cruz California in 1973 which eventually led to this so fast forward to the summer of 2012 as I was putting the finishing touches on this the first edition of the boy who invented television I was at a turning point in my life and wondering what I might do next I was wondering if there might be another obscure but worthwhile inventor that I might write about went out of the blue an unsolicited Anonymous email showed up introducing me to T Townsen Brown another inventor the message said whose work is forgotten and swept under the rug some science in the late 1950s said that what he did defied physics but the government classified his work where did it all go if you go into the Nevada desert at night you&#x27;ll see an object flying around in a blue haze that&#x27;s where it went and then there was something about The Sharper Image air purifier so so I Googled and I found a website sponsored by a friend of the family and read Thomas Townsen Brown was a leader in the quest to find the link between the electromagnetic and gravitational fields as first suggested by Albert Einstein he Advanced from Theory to practice with the development of solid discs that generated temporary localized gravitational fields Brown&#x27;s work became controversial due to its similarity with what is believed to be the propulsion method of some UFOs and I read that and I thought oh my God UFOs I had just finished writing the definitive biography of one of the most important unheralded scientists of the 20th century and now I&#x27;m going to get into UFOs well against my better judgment I sent a message to the host of the website and about a month later I got an answer back that said I spoke with Brown&#x27;s daughter and she thinks it might be fun she was his primary research assistant building prototypes in what not in the 1960s let me know if you want to pursue it and that dear Alice is how rabbit holes are opened Brown&#x27;s daughter Linda and I spent six very difficult years trying to make sense of her father&#x27;s life an experience I have often likened to trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle when there&#x27;s no Co photo on the cover of the Box these days when I&#x27;m asked to provide a summary of Brown&#x27;s life I usually start by asking do you remember the Ionic Breeze Air Purifier well it turns out the Ionic Breeze air purifier is based on an anomalous electrical effect that Townsen Brown discovered coincidentally as a teenager in the 1920s just like pho Farnsworth but there are are some who believe that that anomalous electrical effect when applied in a different Manner and with much higher voltages produces an artificial gravitational field or what is more commonly called anti-gravity though Brown himself never particularly cared for that terminology in other words there was some evidence that Townsen Brown had found the physical manifestation for what Albert Einstein spent the latter years of his life trying to formulate theoretically the unified field inferring some kind of coupling between electromagnetism and gravitation a few months ago a YouTube producer named Jesse Michaels did a documentary about towns and brown based largely on my book so I&#x27;ll share with you now the thumbnail sketch of Brown&#x27;s life that opened that nearly 2hour documentary Thomas Townsen Brown was born in Zanesville Ohio in 1905 to a wealthy family as a child he would electrocute the soil with charged rods so worms would come to the surface true counted as zanesville&#x27;s second Edison by the local papers when he made his first Wireless Telegraph at 12 years old and like Edison and Einstein he did poorly in school earning mediocre grades in all subjects except physics and history where he effortlessly earned A&#x27;s from a young age Brown dreamed of interstellar travel and alien contact Paul shatkin documents an intimate exchange townzen had on a sailboat with his soon to-be wife Josephine someday men will travel in space just as easily as we are sailing now great ships will silently push away from Earth just as easy as the sailboat pushed away from the dock so after nearly six years of trying to get to the bottom of this strange story I was kind of forced to the conclusion that Townsen Brown spent one half of his life engaged in some kind of classified military research and the other half engaged in covert intelligence operations much of that to cover up the classified military research that forced me to the conclusion that I was trying to write the biography of a man whose story cannot be told that untellable story actually begins with the tube that you see the teenage Brown holding in this photo from a newspaper in Los Angeles in about 1924 this is a coolage x-ray tube and we are talking about Townsen Brown today because he noticed that when the tube was suspended in a harness rather than hard mounted in a chassis it seemed to Lurch in One Direction when a voltage was applied as Jesse inferred in the video you just saw Brown did not farewell in the Orthodox AC academic environment of Caltech so he continued his studies at Dennis University in Granville Ohio which among other things was home to one of the finest academic astronomical observatories in the world and there he found a sympathetic ear in the director of The sey Observatory Dr Paul Alfred beld who shared Brown&#x27;s curiosity about gravitation and Einstein&#x27;s recently verified theory of general relativity about which I&#x27;ll say a little more later they were both aware of Einstein&#x27;s ensuing quest to find the unified field and they wondered how such a theory might be applied in practice a pivotal Exchange took place when Brown asked beld if a coupling did exist what instrument might it resemble and without hesitation beld said a capacitor can you see where I&#x27;m going with this now just as Pho forworth had used a vacuum tube to harness Einstein&#x27;s photoelectric effect beld and mostly towns in brown proposed to use a capacitor to harness general relativity in its basic configuration a capacitor is a device that can store an electric charge but it&#x27;s really the unheralded Workhorse of all electronic circuit among the capacitors many functions are storing filtering timing coupling decoupling single processing and beld and brown would have us believe generating an artificial gravitational field once again I&#x27;ll let Jesse Michaels explain it all for you the Byfield Brown effect is an anomalous physics principle at the heart of this story and it also invites the most controversy the basic experiment involves placing a neutral insulator or dialectric between two metal plates one positively charged and the other negative for greater thrust the positive plate should be smaller than the negative plate so the whole system is called an asymmetric capacitor because of the different plate sizes when a high direct current in The megga Volt range is applied to the system the negative plate starts to chase the positive plate this happens even if the positive plate is placed skywards in other words the negative to positive thrust seems to beat Gravity by 1929 Brown was writing about what he could do with the beld brown effect he called the coupling effect electrogravitics and the devices he built he called gravitator in 1930 Brown joined the Navy and by 1932 he was developing project projects for the Naval Research Labs not the least among them a marine propulsion system that sounds strangely like something that Tom Clancy later used as the pivotal plot device in a movie called The Hunt for Red October but again I digress Brown was still working with the NRL in 1933 when he was recruited to join a marine expedition to the Caribbean sponsored by the Smithsonian instit tion board this large private vessel owned by Eldridge Reeves Johnson Johnson was the founder of the Victor talking machines company and one of the richest men in the world now anybody who&#x27;s familiar with a hoax called The Philadelphia Experiment will make note of the name eldrich but you are not going there today or ever if I have anything to say about it but this is where the towns and Brown story starts getting really weird because according to my sources it was during this Voyage the towns of brown was recruited into a private intelligence cartel that Eldred Drees Johnson formed with William S Stevenson who is the man that Winston Churchill later tapped to form all the Allied intelligence operations during World War II and was given given by Churchill the code name Intrepid Brown continued to serve the Navy with distinction until his abrupt resignation in 1942 which has never been thoroughly explained but within weeks this highly skilled newly minted civilian was driving across the country to Burbank California where he went to work at the Vega aircraft division of Lockheed and literal a place that was literally covered with a canopy of camouflage and fake palm trees it&#x27;s worth noting that the Vega division of Lockheed was actually the precursor to lockheed&#x27;s famous Skunk Works so we have kind of arrived at the point in the towns and Brown story where we can pull back the curtain and oh damn it&#x27;s still black long story short towns and Browns start showing up in the mid-50s experimenting with flying saucers his story at this point becomes a tangled web of unorthodox science and deliberate misdirection a concerted effort to test his own controversial ideas while simultaneously trying to throw others off the trail it&#x27;s about this time that the whole idea of anti-gravity starts to get Traction in both the scientific and popular press gravity was a Hot Topic in the 1950s not only among aerospace companies but in Academia as well in 1957 physicists from all over the world gathered not far from here in Chapel Hill North Carolina for the conference on the role of gravitation in physics the conference has been described as a pivotal event in the history of gravitational physics and was instrumental in initiating the search for gravitational waves it also initiated the Quest for quantum gravity and according to some accounts also planted the seed for what later became String Theory one of the sponsors of the Chapel Hill conference was an industrialist from nearby Winston Salem agnu bonson who heard about towns and brown at the conference in Chapel Hill and invited him to experiment at his private lab laboratory in Winston Salem so what became of all that interest in gravity and anti-gravity in the 1950s we&#x27;re going to ask a man named Hal POF a man who had his fingers in so many pies over the last six decades I wish he&#x27;d open a bakery uh there there&#x27;s a famous uh series came out in Miami Herold and other newspapers in um probably the &#x27; 50s the author it was Talbert and he did a series where he found out that a number of aerospace engineering companies were suddenly interested in anti-gravity it all sort of quieted down and I could take two implications of that and that is it quieted it down because nobody ever got anywhere or it quieted it down because they did get somewhere and it went black all right what I&#x27;ve shared with you up to this point are sort of the thumbnail sketch summaries of the two stories that I have been focused on for pretty much my adult life now I&#x27;m going to attempt to tie those two stories into Oh wrong button there we go that last scene and Back to the Future about an hour into that YouTube documentary I showed you pieces of about Townsen Brown Jesse Michaels addresses the same themes that I&#x27;ve been pondering for all these years and touches briefly on The Coincidence of Doc Brown&#x27;s name don&#x27;t blink or you&#x27;ll miss it was Hollywood dropping some breadcrumbs and naming the wacky scientist in the movie Doc Brown his flux capacitor makes time travel possible back to the 50s the moment physics went astray what what Jesse&#x27;s alluding to here is a recurring theme that theoretical physics has reached some kind of an impass after World War II and that while countless new gadgets gim cracks and gizmos have been introduced into the world there really have not been the kind of Epic breakthroughs that Einstein and others brought to the world over a hundred years ago so stay with me now because now I&#x27;m going out on the metaphysical limb to introduce what I call my theory of the missing forths we&#x27;re going to look at a pair of potential breakthroughs that have not happened since the end of World War II and see how these two ideas still relegated to the realm of Science Fiction pull a Common Thread through Philo Farnsworth Townsen Brown Marty McFly and Doc Brown here we go modern science tells us that there are four fundamental forces in the universe electromagnetism the weak nuclear force the strong nuclear force and gravitation here we should stop to remember particularly in this environment that humans have walked the Earth for over a 100,000 years but we have only gained any Mastery of these fundamental forces in the last three 100 years and the hell of it is we&#x27;ve only gained any Mastery of three of them it wasn&#x27;t until the late 18th and 19th centuries that scientist began to understand and harness electromagnetism without which we might still be living in some semblance of the 17th century over the course of the next 100 years the line of inquiry that started with electricity LED subsequent generations of scientists to identify First the weak nuclear force which finds utility in medical imaging or the radiological treatment of cancer and finally we mastered the strong nuclear force that&#x27;s your nuclear reactors and bombs that leaves gravitation and whatever happened to the research in the 1950s there&#x27;s no denying that here on the civilian level we don&#x27;t know much to do with gravity besides fall down and drop things so some sort of gravity control is what I&#x27;m calling the first missing forth to find the second missing forth we&#x27;re going to back up for a moment and look at the third of those fundamental forces the strong nuclear force this is the force that overcomes the natural tendency of like charged particles to repel each other it&#x27;s what holds Atomic nuclei together and it&#x27;s what Einstein defined when he said that E equals MC^2 just as there are four fundamental forces conveniently there are four ways to release the power that binds Atomic nuclei two involve fision that&#x27;s splitting heavy atoms and two involve Fusion that&#x27;s combining light atoms two are explosive and two are controlled the first to be harnessed was controlled Fusion as Illustrated here with the atomic pile en rco FY built in 1942 as part of the Manhattan Project that led three years later to the first atomic bombs so those are your fision processes your controlled and your explosive when it comes to Fusion we figure out how to explode a fusion device with the first Hydrogen Bomb in 1952 now it&#x27;s 72 years later and we have yet to cont to close the circle by finding a way of controlling nuclear fusion that&#x27;s the other missing fourth controlled Fusion and the irony is that Fusion is the most abundant force in the entire universe it burns at the heart of our sun and every Star in the heavens if it can ever be harnessed on Earth Fusion offers the prospect of a relatively clean safe and abundant source of energy but the insurmountable challenge of fusion is the riddle that asks how do you bottle a star what kind of container can you build where the heat doesn&#x27;t destroy the container nor the container extinguish the star okay that&#x27;s the Riddle That I heard on that hillsite in Santa Cruz in 1973 which planted the seed from for all the work that I&#x27;ve done now and the stories that I&#x27;m sharing with you now I spent that afternoon in the company of somebody who knew the family of phot T Farnsworth we&#x27;ll just call him Johnny and Johnny shared with me a story that he had heard from Philo T farmsworth III which I&#x27;m going to attempt to share with you now and to facilitate that sharing I&#x27;m going to ask you all to close your eyes I want you to close your eyes so that you can imagine in your mind&#x27;s eye what happened in my mind&#x27;s eye when I heard that story in 1973 and if you don&#x27;t want to close your eyes you can just stare at this dark screen and imagine a small basement laboratory where Pho Farnsworth now in his late 50s works alone in a laboratory with something glowing under a bell jar while his young son stands just outside the door and watches as as his father throttles up the impossible madade thermonuclear star in a jar together Father and Son watch the vibrant shimmering light and when he is satisfied that he has seen what he needs to see the father shuts off the machine and begins to dismantle it he removes a critical piece and places it somewhere nobody will ever find it all right you can open your eyes now and I will show you what I learned in the years that followed after I heard that story imagine this small basement laboratory where Pho Farnsworth works alone his young son stands outside the door and watches as his father throttles up the impossible man-made thermonuclear star in a jar together Father and Son watch the vibrant shimmering light and when he is satisfied that he has seen what he needs to see the father shuts off the machine and begins to dismantle it removes a critical piece hides it somewhere nobody will ever find it and takes the secret to his grave while his contemporaries we&#x27;re making a bomb out of e equal SMC squared Pho farnworth applied everything he had learned in decades of perfecting television toward using Einstein&#x27;s formula to create a clean safe and virtually inexhaustible source of industrial energy from controlled nuclear fusion a quest that seemingly eludes modern science to this day so yes that story is an oversimplification but not I eventually learned without some foundation in actual facts one of the great privileges of my life is the friendship that I enjoyed between 1975 and 1987 with Pho T Farnsworth III over the course of the time that this Pho and I spent together he taught me the real meaning of invention and he told me ah some of you can see the bottom of the thir he told me that the story that I heard on that Hillside was apocryphal at best but he also told me the detail that underscores the essence of that story The patents Pho III told me are incomplete a patent should serve as an instruction manual written in such a way that anybody knowled knowledgeable in the art should be able to build the dis the device disclosed therein but if something is deliberately left out of the patent then the device will not work as intended something critical was left out of this patent now we&#x27;re left to wonder did forworth crack the riddle of controlled nuclear fusion or did the riddle crack him remember he died just 3 years after this patent was issued at the age of 64 so no it&#x27;s not exactly Mr Fusion but that was from some time in a fictional future and this is from 60 years in the actual past according to one of farnsworth&#x27;s colleagues that I spoke with a model similar to this was capable of producing over a trillion Fusion reactions per second not quite Break Even he said but we were very close four years ago several people with a strong interest in the Farnsworth approach diffusion gathered in the Los Angeles home of Phil savic that&#x27;s Phil on the right here where the Farnsworth family archives are stored and we hope at this point just temporarily there we found all of farms wor lab notes and several early models of the fuser including the remains of this very first prototype but what surprised us the most was a journal none of us had ever seen before which must have been buried somewhere in a box for over 50 years the journal was labeled simply notes and when we opened the bound Journal we were surprised to find that six or seven pages had been torn out and you don&#x27;t do that with bound laboratory journals you don&#x27;t tear Pages out all that was left was one page that had any writing on it and all it said in pem farnsworth&#x27;s own hand the ideas his last ideas he considered too confidential to leave a record of he felt the world of humanity was not ready for his last gift and maybe not worthy of it I believe the farer fuser foretells the first element of that last scene in Back to the Future pulled from the ACT ual past and projected into the fictional future so what about the other element of that last scene The Time Machine driven by a flux capacitor okay this is a little more of a stretch so bear with me remember what Dr beld said when towns and brown asked him what instrument might demonstrate the link between electricity and gravity a capacitor H with that in mind we&#x27;ll take a closer look at Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity in general relativity Einstein unified the three dimensions of space with the fourth dimension of time and redefined the fabric of the cosmos as the space-time Continuum and what we know as gravity Einstein told us is a curvature in SpaceTime caused by the presence of mass of objects like planets and stars so if space and time are the unified fabric of the cosmos and gravity is induced by a curvature of space doesn&#x27;t that curvature of space Also infer the curvature of time and if as brown and beld surmised you can create an artificial gravitational field with a highly charged asymmetric capacitor wouldn&#x27;t that also imply a temporary localized bending of time like I said I know it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch to get from this to this but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an accident that capacitor was the term chosen for this fictional contrivance I think it&#x27;s an unwitting prediction based on towns and Brown&#x27;s discoveries just like Mr Fusion has some basis in the secrets that pho fsw wrestled with near the end of his life so the now the second obvious and unanswered question is did towns and brown find a way to generate synthetic gravity and with that some way of bending both space and time and if he did then what became of those discoveries what did HAL POF say he quieted down because nobody ever got anywhere or it quieted it down because it did get somewhere and it went black to further Focus this vision of the future based on these ideas from the past I&#x27;m going to show you another way that I think Farnsworth and brown were looking through the same crystal ball remember what Townsen said to Josephine when he took her sailing while he was courting her in 1926 Pho farnworth had what I can best describe as a corollary to the vision the towns and confided in Josephine when talking about the requirements of chemical Rockets Farnsworth used the analogy of the pineapple and the pee chemical Rockets he said require a launch vehicle the size of a pineapple in order to lift a payload the size of a pee towns and brown as you can plainly see here in the launch of Apollo 11 in 1969 where most of the fuel is burned just getting the rest of the fuel off the LaunchPad towns and brown called this brute and awkward Force say what you will about chemical Rockets but it did get us this but again I digress with Fusion foreign worth envisioned the ratios would be reversed and a power unit the size of a p would be able to lift a power mod a payload the size of a pineapple I don&#x27;t know that farer Earth with sinking specifically in terms of gravity control but it&#x27;s not hard to see the commonality in these two visions so here we are with these two ideas what I call the missing force that between them Express this shared Vision which seems to be within our reach but remains beyond our grasp everything I&#x27;ve learned in the five decades since I sat on that Hillside in Santa Cruz convinces me that with the fuser Farnsworth found the one missing forth in the form of a compact Atomic Dynamo capable of generating the megawatts towns in brown would need to achieve the other missing forth some kind of gravity control in the confines of a navigable vessel extend that scenario to The Logical conclusion expressed in general relativity and you arrive at that Universe of magical things still waiting for our wits to get sharper speaking of sharpening our wits I mentioned a few minutes ago that it&#x27;s only in the past 300 years that mankind has achieved any Mastery of these fundamental forces I thought about that the moment I saw this scene from the movie Oppenheimer that is something that Isidor Robbie actually said to Robert Oppenheimer but when I heard that in the movie theater I just wished that I could have whispered into Dr Robbie&#x27;s ear a more promising culmination to those three centuries of physics so I keep wondering why can&#x27;t we get the keys to the cosmic Ferrari or in Doc Brown&#x27;s case a stupid DeLorean and after all the time that I&#x27;ve spent thinking about this material it all comes for me it all comes down to something that Pho farnworth said just before he went on to that great laboratory in the sky I know that God exists foren said I know I have never invented anything I have been the medium by which these things were given to the culture as fast as the culture could earn them I think farnworth has put into words here something that he felt deeply and that we as humans with our ancient affinity for anthropomorphic deities can understand that despite our Abiding Faith in Humanity&#x27;s Cosmic Destiny there are forces at work here beyond what we can rationally perceive and while I hate that this makes me seem moralistic and utopian I believe the implication is clear that before humans can Ascend to the cosmos we&#x27;re going to have to earn it I don&#x27;t know maybe this is just all the output of an overactive imagination maybe I believe this stuff just because I think it&#x27;s cool and I want to believe it maybe I&#x27;ve been too long down the rabbit hole maybe I&#x27;m stuck somewhere on the on the Spectrum I could be a victim of the Dunning Krueger effect but after spending most of my adult life marinating in the these two stories that&#x27;s how it all adds up to me I began this presentation with the last scene from a movie from 1985 now I&#x27;m going to share with you the first scene from a movie from 1968 I&#x27;ll be it with a little bit of editorial commentator commentary [Music] the evolution of man with all due apologies to Stanley cubert from the [Music] alpha to the Omega [Music] this is why we can&#x27;t have nice things like Fusion Energy and gravity control [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you thank you very much so any questions we got I know a few minutes where do I buy the book oh I&#x27;m G to have a booth out here I have only brought I unfortunately I only brought two dozen copies of both of both books but I&#x27;ve brought lots of QR codes so you can get to Amazon very good presentation thank you I have one question okay how did the name tell a vision come about oh um there&#x27;s a um somebody said once um the word television it&#x27;s it&#x27;s part part Latin and part Greek no good can ever come of it and my understanding is that the origin of the term is there was a science fiction writer in in the 19s and 20s you&#x27;re all familiar with the hug go awards that are awarded for science fiction writing um they were named for a man named Hugo gernsbach and it&#x27;s my understanding that gernsback is the one who came up with the word television what you got you brought a lot up that uh made me think a lot um so the idea of earning it I definitely agree and I could see that we have a bit of a glass ceiling perhaps if this technology and these things have been going through the medium of somebody um we could have this technology and have a cap of some reason why we don&#x27;t have it yet but if you think about that force of lifting that rocket off we really forced we really forced our way H gravity to do that to kind of egotistically show that we can um but the link I really find the link between gravity and time time and space very interesting for anybody that deals in metaphysics and archetypes the limits of space and time and the 3D bounds of everything are Saturn and Saturn has this quality of societal the limit and we feel like there&#x27;s this Quantum level where we&#x27;re getting ready to break through that limit um the question would be could you see that the capacitor is also a human being you described it as something that stores an electric charge yeah and we&#x27;re going about finding it externally and you need that to travel a group or a collective in like a UFO or but that inner knowledge of a capacitor if we can figure out how we&#x27;re the capacitor so that we can move through time and space we&#x27;re storing an electric charge what are we doing with that charge that come well okay that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a little beyond anything I I like the idea but it&#x27;s a little bit beyond anything that I thought of but as you were talking about the four fundamental forces and the the the rocket power that that was also a force in that instant I wonder why didn&#x27;t I include that as one of the four fundamental forces and the thought that occurred to me is because that is not one of the four fundamental forces that we discovered in the 20th century that&#x27;s we&#x27;re you we&#x27;re going into space using the same Force that cavemen use to barbecue their will Beast it&#x27;s fire but my point is that one of the things that farnworth talked about was everything that we&#x27;ve had up until these last 100 years or so he thought of as the low energy epic and that once we figured out how to control Fusion we&#x27;re going into a higher energy epic we&#x27;re going to have much more energy at our disposal hence the the difference there but I I like the idea that humans are also capacitors that we have a lot of electricity going through our circuitry and maybe that&#x27;s uh maybe that&#x27;s you know the that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re here at the cosmic Summit to explore such ideas and besides time travel and space travel fision and fusion if we get that together maybe teleportation becomes a little bit more there you go hi hi thanks great talk um I know you said you weren&#x27;t much of an ancient history guy but I&#x27;m wondering if in your research the V came up at all or ideas of ancient Indian yeah actually it did I first I I have I have learned of the Vas uh during the time when I was doing all the brown research that came up and and I I have no particular perspective on that or knowledge to share on that subject other than oh there&#x27;s another interesting curiosity did you run into anything similar on um fion or Fusion or exotic power sources from ancient technology during those epics no thank you oh boy here&#x27;s Bob thank you Paul excellent speech uh I I could learn a lot from your go easy on me b okay so of course the the Farnsworth fuser is electrostatic confinement that&#x27;s right could you consider that doc Browns uh um Mr Fusion device was actually a magnetic flux capacitor rather than an electric flux capacitor if you&#x27;re asking me if it uses magnetic containment I will say categorically no magnet magnetic containment I think that what we&#x27;re talking about mostly when we&#x27;re talking about magnetic containment of nuclear fusion we&#x27;re talking about these giant monolith machines called tox which I like to call whirling Russ whirling hot Russian donuts and um they are always going to fail but there is work done in 1971 which has been replicated in 2021 where there&#x27;s some interesting connections with all that in the Farms were story but we&#x27;ll talk about that later maybe but somebody said that trying to confine a plasma with magnets is like trying to hold hot jello with rubber bands however if you confine plasma with plasma it&#x27;s a different story well yeah how do you define the plasma that&#x27;s confining the plasma come and see my talk at 11:00 I will yeah hi good morning uh how does the capacitor generate lift well you had to go back to the little video that um Jesse Jesse Michaels described there if it&#x27;s an asymmetric capacitor then there is more charge on the larger plate and and the phenomenon that we&#x27;re talking about the answer your question is the Bell Brown effect which is this anomalous electrical effect which causes the negative plate to chase the positive plate so the answer to your question is there&#x27;s an anomalous electrical effect that produces that but do they have to do it inside of a closed container or could they do that out can they do that outside without a container or they have to contain that capacitor inside of a a system so that it can generate its lift I I don&#x27;t know the answer to that one sorry no worries thank you okay guys thank you that was Paul everyone big round of applause for Paul thank you</p>
