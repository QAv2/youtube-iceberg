            <p>um all right hello everyone out there welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas and I do educational videos on many different subjects today we&#x27;re looking at um I think the 50 59th video on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson we&#x27;re examining his last book that came out after he died uh he died in 1990 and uh it&#x27;s called beyond space and time Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system is a theory of everything that uh is a system meaning that if you understand how the system works you can learn how to apply it yourself and you can derive everything from it you can do what he did and you can derive chemistry and physics and astronomy on economics from it or you can take it yourself and you like me I&#x27;m a historian I could learn how to apply it to history I could learn how to apply it to basketball you know I could learn how to apply it to music theory um it would take some doing I would probably have to Rack my mind and you know go through a long string of deductions after a long string of inductions which is what Larson did he first came up with the general idea in about 1930 where he was crossing the street and he had an epiphany he was working on a couple chemistry problems having to do with the inter-atomic distance of certain atoms and molecules and uh he had a voice uh or you know a feeling that told him why don&#x27;t you just assume for the sake of this problem that space and time are reciprocals of each other and he almost fellow fell over in the street but by the time he got home he uh remembered that and he attempted to apply it to his uh the problem that he was working on and the answer popped out and then later he was working on another problem he was like why don&#x27;t I try that space and time being reciprocal&#x27;s assumption again and the answer popped out and he did it a few more times and then he was like I think I should make a general study of this and it took him about 20 years but eventually he came up with his uh First Fundamental possibly two fundamental postulates the first of which is by far more important and uh the gist of it is that the universe is not made out of matter and the universe is not made out of energy but the universe is made out of motion and uh in particular something that&#x27;s called scalar motion emotion that has a magnitude but no Direction and which can be mapped by using a balloon and some magic markers at putting dots on the balloon blowing up the balloon those dots uh manifest the scalar motion they&#x27;re moving away from each other when you block the balloon but not in any particular direction or in all directions uh but uh so the universe is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time that motion as well as space and time are in three dimensions although I would say three or four dimensions using the cube as an example the star tetrahedron Cube and uh they are in discrete units meaning that there is a minimum unit of space and there is a minimum unit of time and in fact one unit of space per one unit of time is the speed of light and so in uh you know whereas in Einstein system the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe in Larson&#x27;s system the speed of light is actually the midpoint of the universe or the neutral point of the Universe um if we uh theoretically were to meditate and get ourselves into the most um silent quiet spot that we could total Stillness that would be the speed of light and uh so the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light and half of it is moving slower than the speed of light the half that we recognize is moving slower is uh the material sector what he calls sector one and this is chemistry and you know the other physical universe that you&#x27;re familiar with atoms and molecules but as atoms and molecules aggregate together they become more and more complex and when uh physical Aggregates get to their most complex that is the DNA molecule that contains several billion atoms per molecule at that point and not before that but at that point the um DNA molecule becomes subject to a sector two component and the sector 2 is the uh half of the universe that is moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls that the cosmic sector or sector two and when the cosmic sector or the control unit comes into control over the sector one unit that creates what Larson calls the life unit and so life is a combination of the material and a cosmic sector uh uh entity he goes further and says that as life becomes moves toward its most complex which he says is the intelligent human being then it also can become subject to control over by sector three and sector three is the generalized region that is not uh really part of the universe or not independent of the universe independent of space and time and he refers to this as sector three most people would refer to it as God or the spirit world and um it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s control unit is uh is targeted toward ethical Behavior whereas life is targeted toward survival and so at some points these work together and sometimes they work opposite um and at that point the human being has to decide whose input to go by sector two or sector 3. uh so that&#x27;s kind of uh the gist of it now in his final book we&#x27;re talking about beyond space and time we&#x27;re talking about how all of this uh life unit and sector three how all of these things affect human beings and he he had just done a few chapters here on communication from sector three uh which is variously known as ESP or Intuition or scientific Insight or religious Revelation those are all Communications from sector three then he backs up and he talks about emotions uh and then he talks about this chapter here which we&#x27;re on which is called thinking and memory and uh you know those are both sector two uh but they have sector three implications because thinking is the necessary prerequisite that is needed for uh sector three con uh for uh sector two on life unit to be eligible for sector three control and so now he&#x27;s talking about uh dreaming and sleeping and he says that uh both the thinking and the memory are not capable of continuous operation because they get out of sync with the um with the material unit the material unit is based on clock time where which is the scalar motion which is the progression of time that we&#x27;re familiar with but in the cosmic sector time and space are inverted uh so sector one&#x27;s relations are really more like space over time relations whereas sector two relations are more like time over space relations and so when you cross the speed of light you have to invert the um rolls of space and time and uh so basically in this sector two you don&#x27;t have scalar time you don&#x27;t have the progression of time instead you have this three-dimensional time that&#x27;s based on euclidean Geometry um in the same way that space is based on a three-dimensional I say three or four but three-dimensional time in um in space so that kind of time uh doesn&#x27;t follow the progression of time it&#x27;s different and so as a result the sector 2 component eventually gets out of sync with the sector one component and has to be basically disconnected and rewound to get back into into the proper synchronization with time and uh this rewinding uh is a variable process meaning that time uh meaning that memory and thinking rewind at basically different rates or memory doesn&#x27;t need as much rewinding as thinking does because memory is simpler and so uh when you&#x27;re when you&#x27;re rewinding both space and time then you have sleep um really what he calls non-rem sleep but when the memory gets done rewinding but the thinking still has to continue rewinding then you have dreaming REM sleep and so that&#x27;s kind of where he is right now we&#x27;re gonna pick up here in chapter 14. the last thing that he was talking about is uh basically how babies need a lot of REM sleep where animals don&#x27;t need very much at all and as we get older we need less REM sleep our like as we grow to be adults we need less REM sleep but now he&#x27;s connecting REM sleep and emotions so theoretical considerations indicate that emotional states have a significant effect on the REM sleep emotion and memory are both parts of the old mental equipment and it is probable that an increase in emotional activity has the same effect on the sleep requirements as more use of the memory this will have the effect of decreasing the need for REM sleep and may explain some of the results of drugs and other agencies that affect the emotions it may also explain why the deprivation of REM sleep under experimental conditions can be carried far beyond what seems to be the normal limit uh to lead one expert to say although there is a need for REM sleep apparently it is not absolute the REM sleep deprived individuals both human and animal are reported to exhibit undue brain excitement which may very well be the result of a forced increase in emotional and memory functions to offset the loss of REM sleep time during the REM period when the individual is asleep that is his thinking mechanism is out of service but his memory is still active both memory mechanisms which are circulating memory and storage memory are operating normally but have been disconnected from the motor control and the inflow of century stimuli from the environment is almost totally shut off in the absence of thought and environmental input the memory apparatus responds only to stimuli from the circulating memory and from internal Sensations if the originating stimulus is physiological it usually consists of what we may call a theme hunger for example without details as brought out earlier such abstract themes are not the kind of input with which the memory storage processes are equipped to deal in order to fit into these processes the themes must be for put into the form of experiences memories that are associated with Hunger that are already present in storage are therefore drawn upon and a synthetic hunger experience is built up the individual becomes aware of this synthetic experience in a manner similar to that which she becomes aware of real experiences and with certain qualifications we will consider later it appears to him that he&#x27;s undergoing a real experience this process is a dream so a dream is when memories uh that just really contain a theme uh have to be basically translated into a form of experience because that is the uh way that is the kind of input with which the memory storage processes are equipped to deal so in order to fit into these processes the themes must be put in the into the form of experiences and that&#x27;s a dream the second and most prolific source of dream stimuli is the circulating memory system and the circulating memory system is basically the rewind uh the reminding function um that um you know it&#x27;s telling you have a meeting at four o&#x27;clock uh you have to pick up your kids at 4 30. it&#x27;s reminding you that these things are happening uh so that you don&#x27;t become absent-minded uh even though you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you may be trying to think you know you&#x27;re sitting at work and you&#x27;re trying to think uh but you have uh every once in a while your mind comes around to reminding you that oh yeah in half an hour I&#x27;ve got to go pick up my kids or whatever this process is a okay the second most okay the system continues to bring one after another of the items that it contains into the position where it makes contact with both the memory storage and the thinking mechanism which is inactive in this REM sleep the same process is also in operation during the waking state but is subject to suppression by the thinking mechanism which serves as a sensor and in any event is overshadowed by the much greater flow of direct experiences to the memory storage as each of the items in the circulating memory makes the appropriate contact it acts in the same manner as a physiological stimulus that is it it is it initiates a dream these items from the circulating memory system contain only a minimum of detail as the functions of this system do not require a detailed elaboration in fact an excessive amount of detail would interfere with the primary purpose of this memory system the reminding function so like the sensory stimuli the circulating memories are mainly in the form of abstract themes although there is a certain amount of elaboration by means of which might be called subsidiary themes in a sense the content of the circulating memories is intermediate between that of a physiological Sensations which are simply hunger cold Etc and the detailed memories of experience that go into the memory storage we may compare the circulating memory to a language with a limited vocabulary and the detailed memory of the original experience to a versatile modern language such as such as English in the principal memory process the full account of the experience goes directly into storage meanwhile this account is translated into the limited language of the circulating memory for its purposes during sleep when no direct accounts of experience are coming in the memories of the circulating system are fed one by one into the stream going to storage and are translated back into the detailed form that is acceptable to the storage facilities a consideration of the language analogy shows what results can be expected if a statement made in English is translated into the language of some primitive tribe and then re-translated back into English by some purpose by some person who does not have access to the original text the general idea of the statement will be preserved but there will undoubtedly be significant differences in the details similarly a dream produced by a circulating memory theme will reproduce the theme of The Source from which the memory originated but may altered the details beyond recognition there&#x27;s also a fairly good chance that the details will be reproduced accurately in a certain percentage of the dreams a memory of the original experience exists in the memory storage and since uh this is usually perhaps always a very recent acquisition it is favorably suited for recall thus the association process may very well reach this memory rather than some other item in storage and in that case the result will be that the dream reproduces the original experience with no more than minor variations uh okay now he&#x27;s uh he&#x27;s gonna get into a little bit of more theoretical stuff on dreaming there&#x27;s been much discussion of what has been interpreted as a need to dream Freud called it a safety valve which relieves the mind uh of harmful material uh our findings are that what exists is a need for sleep in order to synchronize the processes of the mind with the structure of the brain again he is referring to the Mind as a sector two thing and the Brain as a sector one thing so we&#x27;re synchronizing the processes of the mind with the structure of the brain and a further need to separate the memory from the thinking mechanism during a portion of the synchronization process in order to allow the thinking mechanism to continue the adjustment process for a time after the synchronization of the memory is complete uh thus the only need for anything other than sleep the Sleep itself is for the correct proportion of REM sleep to Total Sleep the dreams occur not because they are needed but because they are part of the normal physiological</p>
