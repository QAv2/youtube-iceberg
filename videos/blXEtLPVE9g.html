            <p>I&#x27;m Tim Ventura from American anti-gravity tocom and I&#x27;m speaking today with Dr Eugene panoff the famous Russian chemist world-renowned for his research into superconductive anti-gravity and more recently collaborative efforts with Giovani modin and Dr ningle into gravity waves uh Eugene can you hear me okay uh yes I hear you perfectly thank you great well thanks again for taking the time to uh speak with us a little bit more about your research your research was pioneering in the field of superconductive anti-gravity a lot of the papers that I read online and a lot of the references State directly back to your research from the early 1990s and uh more recently some of your newer experiments with Giovani modin is there anything you can tell us about what you&#x27;ve been up to lately uh well first of all uh Frankly Speaking I am not an expert on gravity never was and never will be uh I&#x27;m a chemist my profession but I worked all my life in the field of physics so I have PhD degree in chemistry and second PhD degree in physics and uh I began to work with gravity it happened just by chance so I never planned but now I have about uh 15 years of uh very uh effective work in this field and I begin to understand something so it is uh a very difficult subject uh first of all because it is a pioneering research as this field of physics is practical unexplored and uh the attitude of official science to Gravity Research is uh let&#x27;s say honestly very unpleasant uh and uh people who deal with gravity they usually suffer a lot so if we refer to history uh well Jordana Bruno one of the itan scientist was uh burned uh by whole Inquisition because of his works and uh uh Galilee uh hardly escaped but now we have uh more or less good understanding of what is going on there uh so I uh based my research on superconducting materials because they give a very wide possibility to vary their physical properties especially magnetic properties so we can create uh magnetic fields of different configurations and uh uh my research is based uh on the idea that it is uh possible to uh change or to modify local gravity field and uh to create objects which are heavier than usual or lighter than usual and uh this all can be done uh when creating special conditions if we discuss these special conditions uh some people say that we deal with a polarization of space or polarization of physical vacuum that is uh everywhere and uh there are several uh waves uh several ways um to polarize space we can use uh high voltage uh we can use uh High uh magnetic fields we can use extremely high speed rotation of uh various objects and uh we can also use topological effects special uh uh gads and um surfaces with uh special topology and there are also other uh possibilities and uh we can also use the combination of all these parameters absolutely well oh I&#x27;m sorry I one of the things that that I was hoping to ask was um you&#x27;d mentioned in one of your papers a 20 lb or or approximately 20 lb beam of Force if I remember correctly um yes that&#x27;s that&#x27;s been capturing a lot of interest lately um you know the media was initially interested in the rotating superconductor and eventually it ran its course at least in the American Media and they weren&#x27;t sure where to go with with it but um you know this second experiment didn&#x27;t quite grab the media in the same way and I think the reason was they they just weren&#x27;t really prepared for it they weren&#x27;t looking for it but um the results were much more profound instead of a 2% reduction in weight um you would actually noticed a beam of force that was uh knocking over things in the lab right yes so we um are in fact discussing uh two types of experiments uh that I made during last 10 years the first experiment was with uh highs speeed rotating uh ceramic discs made of superconductors and uh uh at extremely high rotations I mean the speed closed to 30 or 40,000 rotations per minute and even higher uh we can get uh the reduction of weight uh up to 9% and in some cases even more but uh this process becomes uh uh uncontrollable so it&#x27;s uh difficult to deal with it so it&#x27;s one experiment and that experiment uh which was called U uh gravity impulse generator this is also a special uh super conducting material which is put into magnetic uh field and then we have a high voltage discharge of several million volts and then we can create uh a wave in the space uh uh the properties of these uh these waves are very close to gravity waves so we are practically uh sure that it is the same thing as uh gravity and uh these impulses can be uh forwarded to any direction in space and uh they are able to push different objects uh on their way on their way of propagation uh so uh if we speak about the detail mechanism of uh these events we are still working on it but at present we already have a possibility of uh semi-industrial and later commercial application of the first results and this is the most important oh absolutely well am I correct in the 20 PBS figure or have you been able to generate more force uh since then uh well um at extreme parameters we can uh create even uh bigger forces if we go to uh 5 million volts uh this information was not published yet so uh during last year year and a half I was uh with my team I was trying to investigate the uh interaction of uh this uh gravity impulse with different objects and the in interaction of uh this uh impulse with light and uh we were also trying to measure the speed of the propagation of this uh gravity waves and uh the results were extremely interesting the word interesting is forbidden in our laboratory I don&#x27;t know how to discuss it but um uh this is practically unbelievable because to some extent it contradicts um many aspects of modern physics but we have experimental proof and we&#x27;re going uh to develop all these experiments oh so these are so I&#x27;m sorry it is possible to use uh high voltage um discharges up to 5 million volts and specially prepared superconductors uh these impulses are very short in time uh uh we speak about um Millions uh 1 million of second something like this and even lower uh and uh they can be very powerful uh and can be used for um rocket propulsion in space at the same time they can be used uh for the uh for the correction of the orbits of several satellites and these can be done from Earth uh with minimum expenses so this is quite promising technology oh okay so this is this is probably well I I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s too far to venture but do you think for for at least a Nan&#x27;s worth of time um maybe 100 pounds of force or or perhaps even greater than even greater oh wow that that&#x27;s you know this is amazing it&#x27;s amazing to see you know I you&#x27;ve been getting results for years and I I&#x27;ve been following the work of uh Robert Baker Jr and Dr ningle and several others online you know and and one of the things that they&#x27;ve based a lot of their research on is your experimental results but in a way um you know it seems kind of humorous that they keep working on the mathematical theoretical side of things and yet you know day in and day out you&#x27;re coming up with these new more impressive demonstrations um you know I I think history is really going to record you as kind of the the discoverer or the founder of modern anti-gravity and I I think the reason is experiments like these uh well uh in fact uh if we use the term anti-gravity it is not quite correct so we can uh speak about uh experimental gravity and our research is called experimental Gravity Research uh if we speak about polarity I don&#x27;t think that gravity has polarity it simply has the direction of uh propagation uh but to speak about polarity uh this can be argued a lot and will get lost in it but anyway uh I&#x27;m very um very much um obliged to uh Dr ning Lee uh for her understanding and uh uh for different discussions with her as well as with Dr modan Who is an extremely talented guy in this field in and uh I keep U contact with uh Dr Harold POF and I know uh in details his U theory of uh zero point fluctuations of vacuum so uh it seems that uh my experiments combined all these theories and uh can be based uh on all these theories oh so this is important defin Ely now in terms of experimental setup cuz I I&#x27;ve actually been attempting to uh well I&#x27;m actually getting ready to buy parts but um it looks like from reading through your experimental setup essentially you&#x27;re discharging a high voltage onto a superconductor is that um that in the superconductor is in a magnetic field um it looks in some ways uh deceptively simplistic but but I understand that there&#x27;s a definite challenge involved with it um have you found any real tricks to testing with this uh yes this technology is uh there is nothing special but uh I work with a team of U experienced people who are experts in uh high voltage discharges who are experts in um ceramic materials and uh superconductors and who are experts in magnetic fields and only combining the knowledge of different fields and people from different countries we can uh breach something positive so this International coporation becomes uh inevitable and becomes a key uh to the success definitely the the international collaboration has picked up so greatly over the last two or three years even Alo um at least in the community that I&#x27;ve been working with um you know the lifter technology has given us incredible results but there have always been efficiency issues that have prevented it from going much farther than it has do you have any insights on uh lifter technology or um perhaps deo&#x27;s elf technology uh sorry could you repeat that just oh I I&#x27;m sorry I was just wondering if you might have any insights on the lifter technology or um Fran Dio&#x27;s elf technology from Brazil uh we exchanged a lot of uh letters with Professor deua from Brazil and um I respect his approach it&#x27;s also a bit unusual he uses uh extra low frequencies which is also possible also possible with uh ceramic superconductors and I&#x27;m trying to work on it uh also there is a very interesting uh effect uh uh called B drown effect and the famous lifters uh first uh developed by the engineers from NASA and then repeated all over the world so these are also uh the pieces of the puzzle which is called anti-gravity and uh every approach uh has uh is very useful and combining uh all this information together we can uh slowly but surely come to the understanding of the mechanism of gravity because if we speak about mechanism um well I studied in details uh the works of uh Sir Isaac Newton in the library of the British Museum and practically all the translated works of Dr Einstein and uh they give the interpretation of uh gravity forces but they never discuss the mechanism and nobody in the world still knows how it works and without the detailed understanding uh we can&#x27;t reach uh good progress so unfortunately in modern physics uh this direction uh experimental Gravity Research and theoretical Gravity Research is not a very popular one but it is becoming popular and I&#x27;m sure that in this Century uh in the period of 10 to 15 years we&#x27;ll have amazing discoveries in this field well absolutely I I think a lot of those will be based directly on your research you know you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve gotten results that no one has been able to get so far and I think that puts you you know decades ahead of um you know certainly decades ahead of mainstream science who who still seem to kind of be working on string theory but um you know also you&#x27;re farther ahead from most the experimenters I&#x27;ve seen also it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s really quite remarkable well in terms of uh commercial applications then do you think it&#x27;s possible we&#x27;ll see something like flying cars in the uh the near future uh I think it&#x27;s possible uh to speak about uh gravity platforms uh which will work like uh enormous um hijacks but uh late it will be possible uh to develop uh what what how can we call it not a flying Source exactly but a new type of vehicle that uh uses uh new physical phenomena and can be can be named as anti-gravity uh uh spaceship or something like this and of course uh some people especially uh professors of physics can be very skeptical about it but uh if we discuss uh quantum theory and the theory uh of Relativity of Einstein uh everybody will agree that there are very big contradictions between these two theories and they [Music] practically cannot be solved but that does not keep us from applying both theories uh for different uh practical applications in uh science and technology and uh still there is Big contradictions between this Theory and all physical world usually close uh the eyes on this and they think that it can be uh it can uh those both uh theories can coexist and I agree that it is of course possible and uh uh all the results all practical results that we got uh with uh gravity work uh they if we have a detailed analysis they don&#x27;t contradict any uh normal law because well sometimes uh people write to me that I go against Einstein but Einstein&#x27;s the the is a relativity Theory and uh usual motion uh is relative uh but uh if we speak about the rotation about uh around uh the axis the own axis of the object uh then we speak about absolute uh motion so the theory of relativity is not applicable to Absolute motion that&#x27;s why uh the the that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t go against Einstein and uh well there are many things in modern physics that uh cannot be explained not because they are incorrect simply our understanding is not yet overwhelming but I hope that uh uh with some efforts we can overcome all the obstacles and approach a very good uh stage of practical application I had some experience uh working uh and Consulting people from NASA but uh Frankly Speaking uh they have uh extremely big funding for normal projects like U International Space Station and uh shuttles and uh extremely low money for new propulsion systems and uh the only uh real uh uh gentleman and scientist and a man whom I respect greatly was John Glenn who always uh supported the idea of uh gravity vehicles and uh was always trying to organize something new uh in uh NASA and in their research plans but unfortunately not everybody is listening to him and that&#x27;s one of the mistakes that I think uh people from NASA headquarters are doing definitely it&#x27;s my personal opinion of course oh well you know it makes sense NASA is very invested in current Technologies and it&#x27;s in some ways it&#x27;s not really in their interest to pursue new technologies and that&#x27;s been kind of a frustration they they have these organizational hurdles that they have to overcome before they can even really think about new technologies and so in some ways that&#x27;s it&#x27;s easier for independent experimenters to do it although things like funding become major issues and I I&#x27;ve definitely been in the same boat with my research but um you know John Glenn hasn&#x27;t he hasn&#x27;t been the only person though um I I just saw a clip in fact I can email it to you from Arthur C Clark from the 1960s predicting that these uh you know these devices would become practical and Clark&#x27;s speculation was that you know despite the lack of support in in 196 60 science for these things that you know the the human race is far too creative to just let the opportunity pass by you know that and uh and then uh Nick cook was just talking about the krf interval and I I believe that relates to uh Transportation a 55 or 60e cycle between major breakthroughs and transportation and according to cook we have about 7 years left on this current interval that we&#x27;re in so uh you know um maybe you know within the decade we&#x27;ll be leaving the age of jet transportation and moving into something else uh well it&#x27;s my dream uh to work for The International Institute for Gravity Research and uh to get uh the practical application of all the experience that we had in Russia and in Finland in Italy in Canada in Britain in the United States because there is a big group of scientists I should say very talented very umic and uh uh if uh their forces are organized in a good way uh under the uh guidance of The International Institute for Gravity Research uh our planet uh will be um getting very good results and will progress immensely in this field oh absolutely well you know I&#x27;d like to continue this interview um at a later time I sincerely appreciate your time for today and this is definitely something where where I will put together a much better list of questions and uh then we can go over it topic by topic if that&#x27;s okay with you oh yes um it&#x27;s quite okay with me thank you okay well again I I sincerely appreciate your time and I will uh I will put this up on the website so that people can immediately uh you know begin to to listen to it um it&#x27;s wonderful to hear that you&#x27;re getting the kind of results that you are and there&#x27;s definitely an entire world of questions that we could go over in in the future but thanks again for your time and have a great day okay thank you very much thanks than to you</p>
