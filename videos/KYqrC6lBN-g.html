            <p>now I am blessing popular as David now today we&#x27;ll be looking at scalar and Vector quantities now what is different between the two we are saying scalar quantity scalar quantities are quantities that have only magnitude only magnitude with no Direction only magnitude with no direction or I should say only magnitude with no specific Direction that is they are the type of quties that have only size with no sense only size with no sense so if they ask you that what is the type of quantity that have size with no sense that&#x27;s still scalar quantity so some of you you have your roommates as a scalar quantity you should know that now that is if you&#x27;re are saying a quantity that process size with no sense then it is called scalar quantity or whenever the quantity process only magnitude with no Direction then it is called what it is called scalar quantity now next one is the vector quantities now what&#x27;s Vector quantities and the vector quantities are quantities that possess both magnitude and Direction the vector Co CS acques that possess both magnitude and direction that is they have both sides and what and S they have both size and SS these are the kind of quantities that have both size and S now in CBT exams we are going to be given different kind of quantities and in which they can ask you to differentiate or to tell if a quantity is scalar or vector now don&#x27;t forget we have a lot of quantities so because we have a lot of quantities no one can deduce this quantity is a scalar or vector now with that we have some rules and I call it rules that can guide you in order to know the ones that are scalar or what or vector now the first two says now the first one it says that all fundamental quantities all fundamental quantities are scalar all fundamental quantities are what are scalar now if we are talking about fundamental quantities don&#x27;t forget I told that the fundamental quantities we have the example we have it to be what will be LT met I told you we have seven fundamental quantities which is LT metal in our previous class I do that the L stand for what length the T stand for what time the m stand for what Mass the E stand for electric current the T stand for temperature the A stand for amount of substance and the L stand for what luminous intensity number two number two is that any form of energy any form of energy is scalar any form of energy is scalar now you can say we have the potential energy potential energy we have the kinetic energy we have the kinetic energy we have the mechanical energy any form of energy they are what they are scalar number three any form of force any form of force is Vector any form of force is Vector any form of force is Vector you can have trust trust is a force we can have up trust is a force we can have weight is also what is also a force ITC any form of force is what is Vector any form of force is Vector we can have frictional force we can have normal force any form of force is what is Vector number four most of the most of the quantity that has the suffix stands most of the quantity that has that have the suffix St most of this quantities that have the suffix stance are scalar what am I talking about now EG you have something like capacitance don&#x27;t forget that suffix means the attachment the m at the what at the at the end you can see that there stance here we can have inductance inductance this also T we can have resistance so most of these ques that have the suffix St they what they are scalar number five as you can see that we have we have distance distance is a scalar quantity distance is a scalar quantity but displacement is a vector quantity distance is a scalar quantity but displacement is a what is a vector quantity number six we have stress stress to be Vector stress is Vector but pressure is what is scalar pressure is scalar stress is Vector but pressure is what a scalar or you can have it to be pressure as a scalar quantity and stress is a what is a vector quantity number seven you have speed to be scalar quantity speed to be scalar quantity but velocity to be what to be Vector Co speed to be scalar but Vel velocity is result is Vector quty number eight you have any form of quantity that have feet or most of the quantities that have feet they Vector most of the quantities that have feet attached to them is what is Vector now when you&#x27;re talking about the quantities that have the surface or the have Fe attached to them is what is Vector now when you are talking about that you have electrical field electric or electric field intensity you have electric field intensity you have when you are talking about the electric field intensity you have magnetic field you have gravitational field Etc most of the quantities that have feed attached to them they are what they are vector most of this the Fe attached to them is what is Vector now number nine now before I proceed I hope you are following and you are getting all this number nine is that we have uh an example like let me give you a code all this they are vector we have it to be value weight my momentum value weight my momentum now all the are vector quantities now let me decode this this is a code but let us decode it now if you saying we have V to be velocity we have a here to be acceleration we have D here to be displacement we have I here to be impulse we have U here to be obus we have W to be weights we have e to be electric field intensity electric field intensity that&#x27;s our e then we have t we have t here the T there is what is trust that t is trust we have M here to be what to be moment don&#x27;t forget moment of a force we have y here to be young modular why to be young modul and don&#x27;t forget we have the old momentum to be momentum don&#x27;t forget again we have V to be velocity we have a to be acceleration we have D to be displacement we have I to be impulse we have U to be obus we have W to be weight we have e to be electric field intensity we have t to be trust and we have M to be moment that is moment of a force and we have y to be young modul now at the comment section but before I proceed let me give you one more to make it to be 10 now 10 is that don&#x27;t forget I said at the first law we have all the fundamental quantities to be what to be scalar now they can say now look up if you are talking about temperature temperature is a scalar quantity but temperature gradient but temperature gradient is temperature gradient is a vector quantity temperature is a scalar quantity but whenever you are saying temperature gradient it is now Vector what&#x27;s temperature gradient temperature gradient means temperature over length when you say something like gradient gradient means over length now if I say gavid gradient it means gavid over length if I say FIS gradient it means FIS over length I say Quantity gradient it means quantity over length now temperature on the Norms according to the first law it is scalar but temperature gradient now means it&#x27;s now add direction to it that means it now result it is now Vector now at the comment section I want you to tell me if this quantity is scalar or vector and the quantity is known as impedance impedance impedance impedance States if it is vect or scaler now let me know at the comment section like subscribe share for others and let them know about this shortcut don&#x27;t forget to subscribe and to what to like and comment so at the comment section let me know if impedance is a scalar of vector quantity don&#x27;t forget this is 10 laws that I&#x27;ve given to you in order to differentiate between the scal coy and what and the vector Coy the first says the fundamental quty are all scalar the second one says all forms of energy are scalar the third one says all forms of for all forms of force are scalar are vector rather all forms of force are vector next one says any quantity that has the suffix St like capacitance inductance resistance they what they scalar the next one says distance is scalar but displacement is what is Vector next one says stress is what h pressure is a scalar but stress is Vector pressure is scalar but stress is Vector next one see speed is scalar but velocity is what is Vector next one says uh any form of quantity that has feet attach it is Vector like electric field intensity magnetic field gravitational field they are what they vector and the last one says at the 9th one says value weight my momentum in which the V stand for velocity a stand for acceleration d stand for displacement I stand for impulse u stand for upus w stand for weight E stand for electric field intensity t stand for trust m stand for moment of a force y stand for young loss and you have the old momentum all these are vector and the 10th one the last one says if you can have temperature to be what to be scalar if they add gradient to it that is temperature gradient it not become a vector and lastly I ask you to let me know if impedance is a scalar or what or a vector quty thank you very much God bless you</p>
