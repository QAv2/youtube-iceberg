            <p>as much energy pouring out of the end of the generator you&#x27;re putting into the shaft now try to run that by an electrical engine it&#x27;s true but just try to run it byy one Lorent said well this other energy he never denied it existed it doesn&#x27;t do anything and he used a clever phrase he said it has no physical significance CU it doesn&#x27;t power anything that&#x27;s like saying I got a sailboat on the ocean big wind and all the wind misses my sails have no physical significance that&#x27;s true for my boat for those sails on my boat that&#x27;s true the rest of that wind doesn&#x27;t power my boat at all so he said has no physical significance he gave a little trick to integrate the whole energy flow Vector around the closed surface around any volume element of interest at all that throws away everything that goes in comes out with no diversion it throws away the heavy side component retains a pointing component now that&#x27;ll agree with your measurements on the circuit because energy that&#x27;s dissipated from the circuit which is what you got to measure has to enter the circuit and that&#x27;s the pointing compound has not the heavyside compound which does not enter the circuit the average electrical engineer it&#x27;s a rare one very rare I would say less than 10 in the United States even knows there is a heavy side component missing the circuit never looked at it has no nothing to do with it doesn&#x27;t believe it if you tell him never has read the original papers never has gone back to see what heavyside actually said in his papers or what pointing actually said in his or what said in his most of the professors have not read the original papers over 50% have not read them they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary anymore perfect job was done it wasn&#x27;t so in every area we look at there again was the broken symmetry of the dipole batteries and generators do not power circuits never have never will there&#x27;s not a battery there&#x27;s not a a generator ever made that added a single watt to the power line it&#x27;s very easy to prove that in particle physics it doesn&#x27;t even exist in electrical engineering in fact they&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re nuts let&#x27;s explain it from particle physics starting from the award of the Nobel Prize 1957 for the broken symmetry of opposite charges now dipole is two opposite charges very close to each other that&#x27;s what a dipole is so if I&#x27;ve got broken symmetry of opposite charges baby I got broken symmetry anytime I form a dipole I don&#x27;t have to prove that it&#x27;s been proven in physics if anybody doesn&#x27;t believe it go read why uh Lee and yang got the Nobel Prize in 1957 and read the papers read the literature that&#x27;s gotten unfashionable these days don&#x27;t read the literature read what somebody wrote about the literature no go to the original sources okay once I have this dipole the very definition of broken symmetry says whatever is virtual the virtual particle interaction coming in with those charges at least the good part of that is being changed over now and is reradiated back as not as virtual form but as observable form all that is is coming in the time domain which is virtual State structures of time and R radiating out by integrating by the Spin to real stuff just like an old for for first order analogy just like an old Spinning Wheel weaving threads together um fibers together into a thread you get them bigger they become observable but then they&#x27;re three space because you see them that means you catch them in three space so what happens is uh that&#x27;s what the charge is doing anyway and that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s coming from but we know that once we form that Source dipole now leave it alone don&#x27;t ever put another watt back into the circuit at all that dipole will sit there and pour out energy forever including both the heavy side component and the pointing component now clever Devils that we are we&#x27;ve been using 100 and something year old system we whatever we catch in that circuit we want to drive the electrons around in the circle we ignore the holes in the dra sea because they mostly interact with the lattice holes which are tied to big old Lions down in the nucleus for example and it&#x27;s so much heavier in electron they Rock a little bit while the electrons are going so what we do is we ignore a whole part of the electromagnetics going on usually in power engineering particularly and what we do whatever we catch potentializing these electrons we look at the back EMF between the source dipole every electron flow that&#x27;s potentialized and goes around this way down to the ground side we have to pump its equivalent right back up through that back EMF and knock the charger es apart so it takes precisely 1/ half the energy it does collect to destroy its own dipole that&#x27;s pulling the energy out of the vacuum to power the circuit the other half Powers the circuit it Powers the losses and loads which mean less than half in a real circuit will losses less than half is is actually developed as power in the load you got a half used to kill the dipole you got a less than half used power the load you got to put back in at least as much to work back on those charges and force them back apart to make the dipole again as it took to destroy it so you got to put more in and you get out to load that&#x27;s the only reason on God&#x27;s green earth we&#x27;re building cop less than one circuit universally closed current Loop circuit restores lent Symmetry and forces us into cop less than one force us into classical equilibrium thermodynamics forces us into the second law of thermo and baby you can&#x27;t beat it if you have an open system a common home heat pump for example has a on good conditions has a cop of about 4.0 theoretical maximum is 8.22 but the average one with this in efficiencies and all is about four it puts out about four times as much actual energy delivered in you know heating the air pumping the air or whatever or cooling the air as you have to physically put in in electromagnetic form it gets rest of it by compressing the air and taking out the energy out of the out of the out of its external environment it&#x27;s an open system perfectly permitted to do cop1 the only reason we don&#x27;t close loop heat pumps and self power our homes is because they diabolically designed so you can&#x27;t have a high efficiency uh process you got to have the low efficien they been high efficiencies when patented and they disappear because when it cools off out there bingo now you&#x27;re back on Resistance heating they lose so much efficiency you can&#x27;t get anything out of them you got to go to a resistor so now you burn power everything has been designed to keep that power meter on your house and keep that uh gas pump meter on your gas pump and keep you out of an electric car doesn&#x27;t have to be designed that way but it&#x27;s been designed that way deliberately now an electric Engineers don&#x27;t know it the electrical engineer doesn&#x27;t even know about the heavy side Theory it&#x27;s a very rare one that has ever read the original papers in the first place and he didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the fact there&#x27;s a hell of a lot more energy coming out of the the terminals of a battery or generator than what we&#x27;re putting in the shaft or the chemical energy we expended never registered now that&#x27;s appalling after 100 years over 100 1880s it&#x27;s appalling why is not the National Science Foundation reacting to this I don&#x27;t know why is not the National Academy of Science well for one thing you get it&#x27;s prestigious you get elected to the National Academy of Sciences and you&#x27;re not fixing to pull the rug out from under your prestige and and what you&#x27;ve done no way you&#x27;re going to see it&#x27;s done a little better commend the young guys on doing better research make a little more efficient but you&#x27;re not not going to go throw out the whole system and start a new one that&#x27;s the problem we have now really a it&#x27;s not diabolical it&#x27;s it&#x27;s honest but what it is is the whole scientific Community is you know the bulk of it is dedicated to maintaining the status quo and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with us we&#x27;re still using an archaic science we&#x27;re still affecting what the chemist is allowed to do because we&#x27;re giving them a U1 model and we&#x27;re teaching them U1 electr he never heard most of them of these higher Symmetry electromagnetics and there certainly I don&#x27;t know of any chemical textbooks using them there should be they&#x27;ve been around a long time why are we not funding deliberate research to get outside the box to get outside the present model so we can get new chemistry we can get marvelous advances in chemistry such as this thing why aren&#x27;t we doing that I don&#x27;t know because we upset somebody&#x27;s Rice Bowl when we do and they don&#x27;t want their rice bowls upset that&#x27;s basically what it&#x27;s all about yeah we&#x27;re getting it in droves I&#x27;ll give you one more thing and then this will be over when you deal with the super system you now have to understand engines I&#x27;m going to start in general relativity in general relativity if I change the local energy density of the vacuum in any form whether it&#x27;s mass or whatever any form of energy that I change change the energy density of this local space right here this little position I immediately have a curvature SpaceTime that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s modeled I&#x27;m talking about a model now curvet SpaceTime is not just an etheric kind of idea that&#x27;ll go away and not bite you it&#x27;s a very active Dynamic thing SpaceTime is considered to be the active thing and I&#x27;m glad it is because time is the part of it that&#x27;s really active giving us all the energy so they got it got it in there but they call it SpaceTime they call the part that isn&#x27;t changing really from the repeated observation but the part that is so but once I have a curvature of SpaceTime I now have a quot Wheeler&#x27;s principle if I change the mass energy they speak of the energy in the mass rather than the mass if I change the mass energy in density I change space time I affect space time I cannot avoid that interaction it&#x27;s absolutely automatic now if I</p>
