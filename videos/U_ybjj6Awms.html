            <p>as it turns out you get a flying craft that looks like a dome with three bumps on the bottom the three bumps are coils which carry three phases of Tesla&#x27;s rotating three-phase power [Music] welcome back I&#x27;m here again with Dr John Brandenburg Dr Brandenburg welcome my friend oh a pleasure and honor to be here talking to you Sean okay so today we&#x27;re going to talk about anti-gravidic propulsion yes so since I was 11 years old I was assigned the problem of continuing the unified field Theory effort of Einstein by my father as he was painting a fence he was painting a fence and I was talking to him and was sort of like son go off and think about this let me finish painting this fence and so I love my pop he was great guy he was a medical doctor but anyway Einstein spent the last 30 years of his life trying to unify the two long-range forces of nature electricity and magnetism or what you call electromagnetism and gravity now there are four fundamental forces in nature that they know of right now two of them are short range they hold like the nucleus together or the actually the charged particles uh the particles of the nucleus like the neutron they&#x27;re held together by the nucleus is held together it&#x27;s a bunch of positive charges all stuck together they repel each other but there&#x27;s a force that they call nuclear glue the strong force they call it the strong force because it&#x27;s stronger than electromagnetism electromagnetism is our standard yard state then there&#x27;s a force also called the weak Force it&#x27;s weaker to the electromagnetism and it holds the neutron together the the the three fundamentals of particles that make up everything we have around here is protons electrons and neutrons and if the neutron if it&#x27;s outside the nucleus it&#x27;s actually unstable after 10 minutes it pops like a firecracker you could say the neutron is radioactive and when it breaks up it breaks up into a little ghost particle called a neutrino but what flies out of the neutron is hydrogen a proton and an electron so protons and electrons attract each other you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d want to stay together but the weak Force tends to push them apart and they call it the weak Force because it&#x27;s weaker than electromagnetism it takes a long time but quantum mechanics so finally allows it to push these particles apart even though they would like to stick together so the proton and electrons stick together in the neutron but the weak Force pushes them apart and what&#x27;s left of the weak horse comes out is the neutrino so that&#x27;s the strong and the weak Force they&#x27;re very short range they&#x27;re called nuclear glue because they&#x27;re like sticky like two things sticking together but you pull them apart they don&#x27;t see each other anymore but when they&#x27;re close together they stick together okay now the strong force of weak Force hold the nucleus and that&#x27;s nuclear physics what runs the Universe on a large scale is electromagnetism and gravity the stars are held together by gravity they emit all this light that&#x27;s electromagnetism and anyone who&#x27;s tried to do laundry on a cold Winter&#x27;s day in Minnesota you know that when you open the dryer everything is charged up with static electricity in fact in New Mexico in the winter where it&#x27;s really dry in the winter I walk through the house just locking up the house at night you know before I went to sleep and I remember always checking the front door wiggling the doorknob to make sure it was locked and it would be this tremendous spark of static electricity because I walked across the carpet into my front room it&#x27;s got all the static electricity on on me so then I touched the doorknob and it lights up the entire living room even though the lights are out so I always remember that&#x27;s that&#x27;s electricity electricity is like lightning bolt and you can pick up pieces of paper with it now magnetism is what makes the compass needle work and you can pick up a paper clip with a magnet but you can&#x27;t pick up paper with a magnet to pick up paper you need static electricity you need electric field so those are the two distinct Fields now you can actually buy these things they&#x27;re called radiometers they look like a light bulb and they have a little turbine inside you can shine a flashlight on them and they&#x27;ll start to spin and they&#x27;re spinning because of electromagnetism the photons in the light beam carry radiation pressure they carry energy and momentum that&#x27;s what makes that turbine spin inside that glass sphere so there you have magnetic force pick up paper clips can&#x27;t pick up paper but then you pick up paper with static electricity there&#x27;s electricity magnetism then there&#x27;s electromagnetism that&#x27;s the third Force of electromagnetism the radiation pressure and it runs according to a mathematical combination of electric and magnetic fields called a pointing Vector named after a guy it points in the direction by the way the light propagates so it&#x27;s so strange that this guy came up his name was pointing it&#x27;s spelled with p-o-y-n-t-i-n-g is British name pointing but it actually points in the direction of radiation pressure out in space particles of dust see the light of the sun and the light of the sun pushes on them and it actually pushes them out of the solar system you could actually put up a giant laser and shine it on a big spacecraft with big solar sails and fly to Alpha Centauri using radiation pressure that runs on the pointing vector okay so I am studying plasma physics my father had assigned me to unify the gravity electromagnetism that was his assignment well there&#x27;s one more Force you didn&#x27;t talk gravity yet oh I&#x27;m sorry gravity everybody knows what gravity is now if you have two things floating in space two rocks mass mass of one mass of two Mass one Mass two they&#x27;re separated by a distance d they&#x27;ll attract each other with a force that goes as the mass times of one times the mass of the other divided by the distance between them squared inverse Square law so it gets weaker at distance but then it gets stronger when you get closer and then that&#x27;s all multiplied by a big constant discovered by Newton Isaac Newton called Big G the Newton gravitation constant that&#x27;s just written as a capital G it&#x27;s the most important number in the universe according to many people because Big G determines how much gravity force is generated between masses floating around in the vacuum of space everything that makes galaxies makes our solar system makes Stars it&#x27;s held together by gravity gravity runs on Big G so Big G is very important so in the meantime the other thing about gravity is it affects everything the same electric fields and magnetic fields they work on charge they&#x27;ll actually affect different charges in an opposite way because they are oppositely charged they give office to their facts this is why we put an electric field on a bunch of charges the positive charges will go one way the negative charges Go a different way in magnetism the opposite effect occurs where the charges will move clockwise in a magnetic field if they&#x27;re positive and orbit counterclockwise are on the lines of force if they&#x27;re negative so gravity affects everything the same it&#x27;s just attractive we have no negative Gravity Force all the masses which have no charge on them attract each other that&#x27;s it now the other thing funny thing about gravity is if you&#x27;re getting accelerated by magnetism or electricity or electric forces and you&#x27;re riding along On The charged particle doesn&#x27;t matter how fast you go you still see that electric and magnetic field if you had a little measuring device however gravity if you&#x27;re falling in free fall the gravity disappears you&#x27;re weightless you might as well not have any Mass even though the gravity is working on the mass of your body you have no Mass when you&#x27;re falling in free fall you only feel the mass so when you&#x27;re standing like on the surface of the Earth and you can&#x27;t go anyplace and you can feel gravity if you&#x27;re falling with a bunch of stuff because everything is falling at the same rate you are everything falls the same rate gravity affects everything the same way it&#x27;s as if you&#x27;re weightless they tell me Gravity was an illusion but I said well I fell off my roof one night because I was helping to put shingles on my roof and yes gravity is an illusion until you hit the ground it is no longer an illusion I was fine I actually jumped off the roof and you know landed as a young kid young and tough so anyway gravity affects everything the same but electric and magnetic fields affect everything differently except what&#x27;s interesting the electromagnetic force of the radiation pressure it runs on the pointing vector which is if you cross an electric and magnetic field you get the pointing Vector pointing in the third Direction so you got X Direction y direction that&#x27;s the electrical magnetic field and then the Z Direction that&#x27;s the pointing vector it measures the cross product of electromagnetism it is yeah electric field in the magnetic field right it is the cross product so this is a marvelous puzzle and Einstein just stared at this and just scratched his head for 30 years here&#x27;s Albert Einstein he&#x27;s figured out relativity he&#x27;s figured out black holes galaxies the whole universe began with the big bang that&#x27;s all comes out of general relativity now he wants to take the other great mystery electromagnetism and unify it with gravity can&#x27;t do it he also helped start quantum mechanics by the way Einstein was a great physical thinker he wasn&#x27;t just a mathematician he was a master at visualizing things he called him experiments thought experiments [Music] and he would sit there and daydream basically about things like gravity and everything and quantum mechanics and figured out all this stuff and then he would publish and he helped everybody accept the ideas and quantum mechanics even though he didn&#x27;t like it himself he didn&#x27;t like the way quantum mechanics developed because it was all based on probabilities rather the certainties he was a very nuts and bolts guy basically he said God doesn&#x27;t play dice of the universe he says and he got in this big debate with Niels Bohr you know one of the inventors of quantum mechanics they had this big debate in front of a whole bunch of scientists and Einstein roared God doesn&#x27;t play dice of the universe to which Orr replied quit telling God what to do hahaha now as it turns out the problem that Einstein faced is he didn&#x27;t like quantum mechanics so he tried to unify gravity electromagnetism without using quantum mechanics and as it turns out I have discovered quantum mechanics is the key if I had an imaginary conversation with old Al press it out it&#x27;s true that God doesn&#x27;t play dicer of the universe right he says yeah and I said yes but God does own the casino where dice is played so he tried for 30 years to unify gravity electromagnetism one thing that came along that was really interesting to him and he kind of adopted it later in his own theory of trying to unify gravity like it&#x27;s called calooza Klein Theory now in those days if you had a new strange idea you could send it to Einstein and if Einstein liked it he would send it to a scientific journal with a note saying I think this is a good idea you should publish this idea and that&#x27;s what happened this guy calooza a German scientist came up with this idea of a hidden Fifth Dimension it&#x27;s there but it&#x27;s not there it&#x27;s kind of mind-boggling how can something be important if you can&#x27;t actually see it well molecules and atoms are there and we know they&#x27;re real but we can&#x27;t see them correctly so the hidden Dimension is like that by the way this is how I&#x27;ve wrapped my own head around this now what calooza did and what Klein then later added quantum mechanics to this so that it came up with this is they found that if you started with just four dimensions space time you know x y z and time and you say you can have space time that&#x27;s curved so you have an equation that says I&#x27;m going to minimize the curvature it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve got a rubber mat lying on the floor and it&#x27;s got wrinkles and bumps in it and then you smooth it all out so it&#x27;s nice and flat so it&#x27;s in a state of minimum energy so space time is like that if you curve it you actually create energy so the idea is you minimize the energy the universe runs economic yes it runs with a big budget but it keeps track down to the penny what it does it doesn&#x27;t like wasting any money so if you apply that principle of minimum energy to space-time because gravity Fields have energy in them then you get Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity general relativity black holes the Big Bang everything comes out of just one mathematical principle we&#x27;ve defined space-time XYZ and time and then you minimize its curvature Bingo it&#x27;s called the Hilbert action Prince you get out of this Falls Einstein&#x27;s equations for Gravity so this is really interesting Einstein loved this idea so he made it the heart of his theory that gravity waves everything like that black holes the Big Bang was all due to the economics of running a universe at minimum energy if you&#x27;ve got a nice car you don&#x27;t go driving it all over the place to get down to the store you try to drive the most direct route right the universe does the same thing if a crow wants to fly someplace he flies in a straight line because that&#x27;s the route of minimum energy for it I mean a crow&#x27;s got to eat right so he&#x27;s going from one place where he can eat to another place he can eat he flies a straight line because that&#x27;s the shortest path and he&#x27;s got to Flap his wings all that way he&#x27;s got to expend energy to get some place so he takes the path of minimum energy the universe is like that it takes the shortcuts wherever it can okay so you do that with space-time get a minimum energy state that gives you Einstein&#x27;s theory of equations for gravity now what Colusa discovered if you add a hidden Fifth Dimension so there&#x27;s x y z and time and then something else but you make it so this other dimension is basically curled up and hidden so nothing in our real world seems to depend on it then you do the minimum action principle the shortest possible as the crow flies out of this Falls Einstein&#x27;s gravity equations and the same equations falls out Maxwell&#x27;s equations for electromagnetism out of the same Theory the mathematics is perfect you get gravity Einstein&#x27;s and the source of gravity is electromagnetism electromagnetic energy it all falls out and the equations for electromagnetism they fall out too so light magnetism picking up paper clips picking up pieces of paper with electric Fields it all comes out of one thing plus and it&#x27;s plus it mixed with gravity you get everything out of this by just adding this extra Fifth Dimension which no one can see but mathematically it&#x27;s there it just doesn&#x27;t affect anything at our scale and the way I visualize it it&#x27;s like the size of an atom you know the hidden Dimension is and colline the guy named Klein worked out the hidden Dimension part in detail because he was at the quantum mechanics so quantum mechanics runs at small scales so you have this Theory where you have now five Dimensions instead of four well this was very annoying to Einstein he didn&#x27;t like the idea of this hidden Fifth Dimension it says what&#x27;s it doing there you know it gives you electromagnetism yeah but what else does it do you know it&#x27;s useless it&#x27;s like a fifth Tire it&#x27;s like a fifth tire on a car what do you need this fifth tire for you know and it&#x27;s little imagine you got four tires on a car and then you&#x27;ve got a little uh wheel from a roller skate sticking out the side of the car he says what the hell is this for and they said well it makes the math all work he said okay I&#x27;m gonna say we should publish this he wrote a note to the journal saying okay publish this [ __ ] yeah but I don&#x27;t understand it and I don&#x27;t like it but the math looks really good now the string theory people by the way brings us to subject of string theory this String Theory people said well if you add one hidden Dimension you know this little skate wheel on the side of your car that doesn&#x27;t actually touch the road and doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t have any power and you can&#x27;t steer with it what&#x27;s it there for well it&#x27;s there to give you some math turns out okay the string theory people have now added 10 extra little wheels like that some of the wheels are within Wheels and you ask them what is that we don&#x27;t even know what the little fifth wheel does it&#x27;s like a hood ornament the car I mean what&#x27;s it do besides being a hood ornament and now you&#x27;ve added 10 more hood ornaments what do they do and they say it gives us good math because you know we do all this we can put what make stuff that looks like the weak field the strong for us and stuff and it gives us the map and that&#x27;s their answer is it&#x27;s mathematically beautiful then they try and make predictions that they test in these super collider things nothing nada nothing and this has led a lot of people to claim that string theory has become a religious cult not an area of physics it&#x27;s a bunch of mathematicians who just gotten so obsessed with their math they don&#x27;t care about the real world anymore or diversion by the government to prevent people from working on this anti-gravity problem outside of Einstein himself Einstein of course fled Einstein was just not only was a genius he was also a smart guy he sees Hitler take over in Germany he tells his family and his secretary who is also Jewish he says we&#x27;re going to take a long trip to the United States I&#x27;ve been invited there to come give lectures he&#x27;d also been banking money in the United States this guy was thinking ahead he could see the handwriting on wall not only did he see the handwriting on the wall he read it real well he got him and his family out of German so he&#x27;s in the United States he starts working at The Institute for advanced study run by Oppenheimer Oppenheimer is finally you know it&#x27;s World War II has ended finally and so Oppenheimer is put in charge of this Think Tank set up by this bunch of rich people on the East Coast called the Princeton Institute for advanced study here&#x27;s Einstein working in her office his boss is Oppenheimer Oppenheimer is Einstein do not get along they even sir suggested that in the movie they&#x27;d ask Oppenheimer about Einstein and his unified field Theory I&#x27;ve been having said he doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing you know he&#x27;s an old guy senile that&#x27;s what he&#x27;d say heck there&#x27;s Einstein down the hall and Oppenheimer won&#x27;t you know he says yeah I would give him an office here and we&#x27;ll let him work and give him paper you know but not he&#x27;s a has been he&#x27;s yesterday&#x27;s news what we&#x27;re really interested in here is quantum mechanics he says nuclear energy and Einstein doesn&#x27;t like quantum mechanics therefore he&#x27;s a nobody around here this is awesome now Oppenheimer was about to have his own little troubles but anyway so Einstein is working on this unified field Theory and he notices that the government doesn&#x27;t like his work they said well you know you were kind of a left-wing associated with left-wing politics when you&#x27;re over there in Germany before Hitler came to power aren&#x27;t you know Einstein says yeah yeah why why why do you ask and they said well we&#x27;re looking for Communists here we were just wondering maybe you do some Communists or something anyway so he actually said after he&#x27;d been in this country for you know he arrived in this country like in 1942 before World War II started he got out while the getting was good one of his buddies when Hitler came to power who was also Jewish killed himself and his son his son was mentally handicapped he took his son down to the park shot his son through the head with a revolver and then put the revolver to his own head he was a good friend of Einstein&#x27;s that&#x27;s how the despair swept through Europe when Hitler came to power in Germany but anyway so Einstein&#x27;s in the United States safe and warm working on this unified field Theory and he&#x27;s treated like an infernal old crane you know little Grandpa you keep in one end of the house and don&#x27;t talk about him anymore that&#x27;s the way Oppenheimer treats him it&#x27;s not his ideas are nothing he&#x27;s a has-bit and Einstein again not just a genius but a smart guy he says you know I wonder sometimes if people don&#x27;t want me investigating the connection between gravity and electric practice I wonder you know the unspoken message is uh Einstein now why don&#x27;t you work on something else you know work on something else find something else to work the stock market you know figure out a theory of the stock market that would really bring some money in this place if you did that so he says you know it&#x27;s as if they don&#x27;t want me working on unified field Theory so he even said that so yes there is a theory one of these conspiracy theorists that the string theory was thrown as a bright shiny object into the physics community and funded by the government who spent like 30 billion dollars on string theory produce nothing nothing no results just a bunch of papers published you ask these guys well what have you produced from this theory he says well I have 30 refereed Publications in scientific journals that&#x27;s what he&#x27;ll say one guy described string theory is a boil on the backside of physics look I&#x27;m an outsider but it sounds like mental masturbation to me oh I that term I&#x27;ve heard that term used many times I am a practical physicist I&#x27;m interested in solving real world problems energy we want to harness Fusion give me the money I&#x27;ll do it I can do it tell me to unify the fields I&#x27;ve done it and I&#x27;ve got the formulas and everything to show it and finally DARPA gave me a grant to study my gem Theory I came up with a theory called The Gem gravity E M Theory actually my preferred term is grandis at medianus meaning the Great and the middle think of the great scales of physics as the cosmic scale and then the Planck scale or the Planck turbulence occurs little black holes form and then evaporate constantly making Quantum uncertainty space-time becomes a foam at the plank scale and the size of the little bubbles of the foam you can actually predict that everything like that it&#x27;s called the Planck length the mass of the little black holes is called the Planck Mass and their charge is called the plank charge they actually are viewed as plus and minus particle and antiparticles that are charged or at least that&#x27;s my favorite model so that everything is charged fundamentally so anyway so Einstein says you know it&#x27;s like people are telling me they don&#x27;t want me to work on this and there&#x27;s no Panache attached to this idea here I am I&#x27;m Al Einstein I&#x27;m working on this thing and nobody will give me the time of day you know they give me an office yes do you think any of this is just like stupid human factors as opposed to any conspiracy I.E it just other physicists were just dismissing it and and something else was sexier like quantum mechanics funneling there there&#x27;s abundant evidence that that was the case that people were mesmerized by the beauty of the mathematics the analogy I give is the cook was sent to the kitchen with a turkey and a bottle of cooking Sherry and rather than using the cooking Sherry on the turkey he got drunk on it they&#x27;ve gotten drunk on the cooking Sherry which is the math method right and they&#x27;ve forgotten about the turkey that is sitting there in the oven so there&#x27;s a certain amount of that very much present you don&#x27;t need to imagine the government conspiracy to just think that it was group think and herd mentality in physics it was the fashionable thing to do in physics and they give you grant money and the government basically controls what gets worked on by what they give grants for you want to look for Life on Mars sure they&#x27;ll give you a grant just the unwritten message and the attached to it is just don&#x27;t find it the string theory if you have five Dimensions you can unify gravity and electromagnetic systems and then they didn&#x27;t want to stop there though they wanted a Theory of Everything and if Frederick the great said it best master of War said he who tries to defend everything will end up defending nothing same goes in physics Hugh tries to explain everything he or she will end up explaining nothing you have to be able to focus so now the gem theory that I developed is based on two postures let&#x27;s imagine quantum mechanics allows you to have a bunch of plates and magnets that create an array of e cross B drifts the pointing vectors and this is what happens around any Mass space time kind of arranges itself Quantum mechanically and makes all these pointy vectors that point towards the object so that&#x27;s gravity that is gravity and it accelerates all the charge part everything fundamentally that we know of that is stable in the universe is a charged particle all nucleuses are charged positive all the electrons are negative and that goes down to finally hydrogen you know just protons and electrons Okay so everything in the universe is charged fundamentally and it&#x27;s all caught in this pointing Vector field that&#x27;s arranged by quantum mechanics so that&#x27;s the first posture but that&#x27;s what gravity fields are arrays a pointing vector affecting all these charge particles the next postulate is that gravity and electromagnetism used to be Unified when the universe was first there was only one force and there was only one particle or particle anti-particle pair that&#x27;s the Planck scale so it was just vacuumed with plank turbulence and then a Fifth Dimension appear bingo and electromagnetism and gravity split apart from being one force to being two distinct forces they split apart and the Planck scale particles split apart and one became heavy heavier than the other and the other became lighter the electron in the proton so when you had this splitting apart of a gravity electromagnetism what also happened was the splitting apart of protons and electrons out of the vacuum plus and minus charges have the same charge different masses though they appeared and that the appearance of this hidden dimension from the Planck scale that that did all of this is correlated with the spreading apart of the mass ratio between the proton and the electron so start out with one scale of size determined by gravity and electromagnet and it splits from the flank scale becomes big compared to the blank scale it&#x27;s huge it&#x27;s the size of like an electron or a nucleus roughly actually it&#x27;s somewhat smaller but it&#x27;s about roughly that size range and then at the same time the protons and electrons appear as separate particles and move apart in Mass same charge but they move apart in Mass and so the correlation between the strength of gravity electromagnetism is correlated to the separation of masses of the proton electron and the magic number that makes this all work is the number 42 as it turns out and I&#x27;m not joking I came up with the theory and then I read The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy where the number 42 explains everything it&#x27;s the number 42 is the square root of the Mass ratio between the proton and the electron it&#x27;s actually 42.85 O3 and then you know it&#x27;s a it goes on and on so that is the magic number that governs the universe because it is the number that separates logarithmically the logarithm of this if you have an electron and a proton the ratio of the Gravity Force to the electric forces between if you take the logarithm of that four of that ratio it&#x27;s the number 42. it&#x27;s also the separation the masses between the electron and the proton so that was my big magic formula the idea that electromagnetism and gravity separated and so did the proton from the electron so you ended up in the big bang with this new Fifth Dimension cause this the new Fifth Dimension appeared so you went from just hard vacuum with just quantum mechanics at the Planck scale boom you end up with a universe with electricity and electricity and magnetism as one force and gravity is another two forces and two particles electrons and protons a universe made of hydrogen expanding and it also has electric and magnetic fields it has light and it has gravity so that&#x27;s the second posture is that the appearance of The Fifth Dimension which unifies gravity and electromagnetism is correlated not only with the separate appearance of gravity and electromagnetism but the separate appearance of protons and electrons hydrogen so that is the theory in a nutshell gravity is essentially electric and magnetic field micro Fields all aligning and that&#x27;s the first postulate and then and you can show the math as right and then you also show that the thing that allows you to have separate electric and magnetic fields from Gravity is a hidden fifth dimension of palooza Klein and when that appears and as they say deploys from being a it&#x27;s the size of the Planck scale to suddenly popping out like popcorn and becoming a hidden Dimension it&#x27;s still hidden but it&#x27;s a lot bigger than the planks did like 10 to the 20th times larger than this plank scale that has appeared and so then that expansion the appearance of The Fifth Dimension and its expansion to its size is correlated with the apparent difference in Mass between the electron and the proton now Einstein had actually been obsessed with this idea that the Universe was basically hydrogen the rest was details he says don&#x27;t make me worry about cheeseburgers and toll booths taxes all that stuff what&#x27;s really important in the universe is hydrogen which is just two particles he called it the two particle paradigm all we care about is where protons and electrons came from the rest is details and the universe especially at the Big Bang was 99.9 percent hydrogen so it has had vacuum corn to present Theory Big Bang which is of course constantly being revised you have started a hard vacuum at one moment and Bing the next moment you&#x27;ve got this expanding white hot ball of hydrogen with electric and magnetic fields in so now you can take this formula now if you pick the size of this mesoscale which means in Latin the middle scale I mean think of the cosmic scale and the plank scale very tiny very big both of them very high energies because the smaller you go in quantum mechanics the bigger the energy gets same but in the cosmic scale the bigger you get the more energy you involve okay so you have the great scales the grand then you have the middle scale the mesoscale that&#x27;s the scale of us and approximately the size of atoms you scale up a few orders of magnitude you know what&#x27;s 10 orders of magnitude among friends that gives us us you know six foot tall and then you go down a little farther and then you get the size of the electron and that&#x27;s basically the size of the Hidden Dimension an electron is roughly a thousand one thousand times smaller than a an atom a hydrogen atom that&#x27;s wrapped around another magic number in physics by the way that drove one great physicist insane he had a nervous breakdown over it it&#x27;s the number 137 it falls out of quantum mechanics quantum mechanics and electromagnetism when you combine those two you get this number falls out 137. and this guy became so obsessed with his number he actually started losing his marbles and his name was Wolfgang Polly and he was a really smart guy but he was really hard to get along I mean the joke about Wolfgang pilot is that he ends up in heaven and Saint Peter at the Apparently Gates says to him hey pair Dr Polly that God wants to speak to you he says he can answer your fundamental questions here your first half hour in heaven Paulie of course loves this so he goes and sits down with God in the office the big office and Paulie says well how does the universe work and God says oh it&#x27;s actually very simple goes to the Whiteboard Blackboard starts drawing diagrams and equations and stuff and the joke goes that Polly again shaking his head violently no no that&#x27;s wrong that&#x27;s wrong [Laughter] this is Polly so Polly he gets so obsessed with the number 137. from quantum mechanics he&#x27;d gone through a divorce he was drinking a lot apparently he just started losing his marble so he went and saw Carl Young a great psychiatrist guy Carl Young had been a student of Sigmund Freud and learned how to do Psychiatry and then him and Freud got a big fight so he moved to Switzerland where he was nice and safe during World War II hence where Einstein&#x27;s first wife and kid ended up growing up is in Switzerland because Switzerland didn&#x27;t get involved in World War II they just did the banking for everybody they banked the war they made a lot of money so he goes to to visit Young and young says in his diary yes this great physicist named Wolfgang Polly he&#x27;s one of the Nobel Prize comes assist in my office and starts talking with me and after five minutes of talking to me I think oh my God what a loony so anyway so that&#x27;s Wolfgang Polly 137. so that&#x27;s one of the big magic numbers of physics is 137.</p>
<p>now I&#x27;ve added a new number 42. 42. I&#x27;ll explain later the importance of this number and where you get this number but Paulie got interested in closing client theory he added a sixth Dimension and that&#x27;s really what got String Theory going he took the theory of closer Cline which gives you electromagnetism gravity linked together and the math is perfect it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just miraculous you just do one thing you add a skate wheel on the side of your car and suddenly you turn it into a race car and you ask why does this fifth wheel do that why do we need this fifth wheel why does this do this and nobody knows and you know that you people ask what is the fifth dimension [Music] um and you say gosh I&#x27;ll add 10 hidden dimensions and then tell you yeah you know if you want to explain a penguin what you do is you get a whole herd of penguins which penguin are you actually interested in so we have this Theory now it says gravity can be understood as pointing vector and you can see that really easy by a very simple experiment you can do on the space station where everything&#x27;s weightless okay you have two ball bearings you put them in a box you heat the ball bearings within the acetylene torch so they&#x27;re both white hot put them in this box they&#x27;ll actually repel each other due to Mutual radiation pressure which runs on the pointy vector that pushes the two ball bearings apart with a one over r squared Force very easy to understand now throw away the ball bear just let them cool off throw them away then what you do is you take two balls of carbon two balls of charcoal you cool them in liquid nitrogen and at the same time you&#x27;re heating the box with your acetylene torch out there in space not a really good idea by the way runs you know space station or settling torch inside but anyway you heat the box with a settling torch so it&#x27;s white hot why not steal then you put the two carbon balls in there they&#x27;re floating they attract each other with a one over r squared Force just like gravity and they&#x27;re doing that because radiation pressure is pressing in on all sides except there&#x27;s slightly less pressure on the side facing the other carbon sphere because it Shadows it so that gives you a slightly weaker radiation pressure on one side than the other and the two balls move together and the closer they get together the more they Shadow each other so the force goes as one over r squared just like gravity and that&#x27;s the kadunkan experiment thought experiment you can demonstrate pointing Vector can give you an effect that looks like gravity okay that&#x27;s the first posture the second postulate is in order to get the math of electromagnetism and gravity has two forces you start with one force you add a Fifth Dimension you get two forces you get gravity start with just four dimensions you get gravity you add a Fifth Dimension the skating wheel that you ply on the side of your car door it gives you electromagnetism plus gravity they&#x27;re linked together everything works the math Works beautifully it&#x27;s a miracle now you don&#x27;t need quantum mechanics to do that by the way the quantum mechanics that helps you in my theory because that&#x27;s where you start out the hidden Dimension starts out the size of the blank scale and then blossoms it pops out like popcorn pop that suddenly it&#x27;s there so you start with the Planck scale that&#x27;s quantum mechanics now you can take the formula you get for the expansion of the Hidden Dimension from the Planck scale you can take that formula and it&#x27;s correlated with the separation of the proton and electron you say the the new mesoscale which is the size of your thing from the Planck scale the size of the Hidden Dimension is entirely determined by the charges and masses of the proton and electrons so you take a compromised Mass you multiply the electron mass times the proton Mass take the square root that gives you a common mass and you sort of say okay when this thing expands the charges shrink from being the Planck scale but this Mass stays the same because the product of the masses stays the same okay so you get the mesoscale from that formula so you say this new scale depends only on things associated with hydrogen the new scale allows hydrogen to exist and you take the logarithm of that expansion from the plank scale and that gives you then the mass ratio of the proton electron or the square root of it 42 okay you can take that formula because the Planck scale uses Big G Newton&#x27;s gravitation cost you can take that formula turn it inside out and make it a formula for Big G the big number when you do that you get a formula for Big G that gives you the number of G which they measure in the lab to within one part per thousand no one else can do that I went to a big conference full of string theorists and presented this they paid me the ultimate compliment they got mad at me or your streams I don&#x27;t need any I just use one-fifth dimension the rest of these ten Dimensions I don&#x27;t need them and I get big G which they can&#x27;t get no one else has got I&#x27;m sorry let me do a little Texas brag in here I got Big G by the grace of God and nobody else has it and so they paid me the ultimate comment instead of rushing up and shaking my hand they got mad at me this one guy comes up to me this was just like a fight in the high school parking lot my high school I went to when I was in you you look for the crowd and the high school uh parking lot after school what high schools let out you know there&#x27;s a fight there&#x27;s two guys in there either circling each other or punching each other yeah this guy comes up to me and a bunch of people gather around us and he says your formula you&#x27;ve hidden G in one side of your formula and made it appear in the other you know this is what soccer Robin put off did and they were very clear about it they were just trying to show the whole concept worked as a circle you know a circular reasoning but hey the universe love circles it loves pie so this guy says you&#x27;ve hidden G in one side of this equation and made it appear in the other you know in other words I&#x27;m a shyster he&#x27;s calling me a Shasta I said we&#x27;re standing in front of a bulletin board where I have the formulas all written out I pointed it I said there it is there&#x27;s the formula find me G on this side of the formula so it will pop out on this side and he&#x27;s looking really angry at me and then his anger expression slowly Fades and there&#x27;s about 30 people standing around listening to this watching this scientific brawl and then he just walks away yeah oh and then I had all this stuff up on a big poster board and I&#x27;m presenting it and showing it to everybody and this other Gray beard comes up to me and he walks right past he just ignores me he goes up the board looking very carefully at all the stuff I&#x27;ve done because not only is the give me Big G it gives me the mass of the proton in terms of the Planck Mass he says okay the flank Mass appears and you start with blank mass and then it shrinks and forms the proton and it has to do with quantum mechanics the center of that formula by the way is Planck&#x27;s const h so he&#x27;s looking at all this stuff and he looks like an unhappy camper he is not at and I said to him and I had a really gorgeous girlfriend with she was great because we couldn&#x27;t have a real bare Knuckles brawl really with her standing there because people were spending too much time looking at her so hey there are benefits to being the HotShots physicist so anyway so he&#x27;s looking at all this stuff and I said sir can I help walk you through this or explain it he turns around it just glares at me says no I can read it for myself well [ __ ] you I said mentally and just turned around and talk to somebody else and you know that guy that oh boy talk about a corn cob stuck up his ass he just he was an unhappy character and then just stomped away because I accomplished something all the string theory people have not been able to accomplish I actually explained part of the world that we can see as opposed to a bunch of stuff that&#x27;s just pure math and I I understand group think I&#x27;m a physicist myself I know there are fashions in physics just like in rock music and people all do this one thing one year it&#x27;s reggae and next year it&#x27;s punk rock you know etc etc I understand that and human beings are very social they like to be in a group you know when they do things they like to sit around and discuss things and where they all kind of basically agree on something and string theory became and there may have been a certain amount of the government saying we don&#x27;t want people looking at just what they call the Einstein problem unifying the two long-range forces of nature which is of course what gives you spaceships and UFOs and stuff like this warp drive their people in the government who probably wanted to discourage that line of inquiry what&#x27;s really fascinating is a guy named Whit spelled w-i-t-t just a genius everyone acknowledged this guy it&#x27;s just a genius his father was actually working on anti-gravity for the government as it turns out back in the days when it was okay to call it anti-gravity nowadays people ask Brandenburg are you working on anti-gravity and I said I&#x27;m not anti-gravity I just wanted to show a little flexibility so we call it gravity modification you know was it wit or witton oh I think actually you know what I think it&#x27;s what excuse me excuse me I think it&#x27;s when I can&#x27;t remember his first name everybody acknowledges he&#x27;s the smartest human being alive on this planet he probably is but he is the father and grandfather and great-grandfather now of string theory and along with Brian Greene he is Mr string theory and his father though worked on gravity modification for the military the father was Louis or Louis Whitton I think so I think yeah thank you I have Google Kung Fu and you don&#x27;t all right there you go you&#x27;re Googling all of this great so wooden did not show up to my poster session and I&#x27;ve given oral talks on this too and the reaction was the same I was like who the heck you know you&#x27;re doing numerology Brandenburg you&#x27;re just coming up with numbers that&#x27;s how they dismiss it they say you can&#x27;t be right you can&#x27;t be right you&#x27;ve discovered some weird coincidences in physics and all this in physics by the way real physics is about explaining the numbers we measure in nature and occasionally predicting them that&#x27;s the real frown is predicting something that hasn&#x27;t been seen before and then they see it and that&#x27;s what gets you a Nobel Prize now I predicted a particle that has 42 times more mass than the electron and there was a team that was supposedly some people reported something similar to that that had been seen in an experiment then you never heard anything more about it and by the way when DARPA gave me money to do the gem Theory and develop it because when you develop the gem Theory further it says you can modify gravity Fields with electromagnetism pointing Vector here&#x27;s how you do it here&#x27;s the equation as it turns out you get a flying craft that looks like a dome with three bumps on the bottom the three bumps are coils which carry three phases of Tesla&#x27;s rotating three-phase power you create a rotating electromagnetic field a pointing Vortex I call it because it sounds more sexy and so it&#x27;s a pointing vortex and you can create it under this Dome and this enables the Dome to fly in the gravity field if you enjoyed this video please click on like subscribe and the notification button so that you&#x27;re alerted anytime I post something new nice</p>
