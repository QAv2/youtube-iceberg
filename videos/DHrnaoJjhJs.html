            <p>whole long string of things that he knew that checked out these Milestones along the way no matter how much we nitpick it apart no matter how much people don&#x27;t want to believe it the evidence that he&#x27;s telling the truth outweighs the evidence that he&#x27;s not well I agree with you and if I did not believe that I would not still be working on the story I would not be publicly defending Bob Lazar [Music] what was your function of working on this you were doing what what was your job we were to reverse engineer the power and propulsion system of this craft and see if it can be duplicated with available materials I just want to go over with you what it is that you saw to draw it out for people to make a sketch as you&#x27;re seeing it as if you&#x27;re there at that moment kind of go back in the past something I turned the sport model underneath this floor there are three [Music] three large cylindrical devices these are unmounts that allow them to completely swivel up to 180 degrees and in 360 degree rotation directly above each one a small rectangular object this is on the floor above and these are the gravity amplifiers themselves looking down from the top you&#x27;d have the center in the very center there is a small reactor surrounding this in three equally spaced areas are the amplifiers so this is looking at it sideways this is looking at it down from the top and under these amplifiers underneath the floor below are the gravity emitters so it&#x27;s the reactor here powering the gravity amplifiers gravity amplifiers output goes into the gravity emitters at the bottom and the resulting gravity beam or anti-gravity wave can be pretty much put anywhere you want to um there was another level up here now I had access and was permitted to view and look at the operation of this main level with the gravity amplifiers and the level below the gravity emitters there is a level above which consisted of these two areas that have not all that familiar with I assume these to be some sort of navigational engine uh people call these large black rectangular areas on the top portholes I believe they were some planar sensor array that just took in information from the surrounding area whether it be patterns of stars or what have you and there was their version of a computer or something to make determinations here that takes input from Those sensors and then let the craft know how to orient itself and where it was in space so that&#x27;s what I assumed to be up there I don&#x27;t know for a fact again that was not part of my job and I was only led to believe that the center antenna is really an extension of the reactor in the center and that&#x27;s a wave guide which allows the uh the emission of the gravity wave which forms kind of a heart shape over the whole the whole craft that&#x27;s how it creates its Distortion these uh gravity emitters can be swung all the way up to 180 degrees and this allows the craft to essentially stand on two of them and hover while this one swings up and creates a distortion in front of it allowing the craft to slide forward so that&#x27;s how they&#x27;re low power mode uh Omer crime configuration operate the Delta configuration uses all three and unlike science fiction movies where you see flying saucers just flying along like that they actually fly belly first the craft flies along leaves the atmosphere of the planet it turns its belly to the destination the three amplifiers focus in on the destination and that&#x27;s how it proceeds so that&#x27;s basically the operation of it and overall how things were laid out inside the craft this is an alien spacecraft right right obviously [Music]</p>
