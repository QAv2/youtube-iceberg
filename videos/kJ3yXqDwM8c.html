            <p>you&#x27;re going to change the situation the status quo you don&#x27;t like that at all that&#x27;s your problem interesting and of course you know you can put all kind of quotations from imminent scies on that you know Fineman for example says you know most of the things that we list as given inside we don&#x27;t know what they are we don&#x27;t know what energy is there&#x27;s not an adequate definition of force and he said try if you think there is try to find one you won&#x27;t find it if you really look at the problem I couldn&#x27;t find a single physicist or a single physics dictionary and I bought the best that was available that adequately Define the potential and the reason was quite simple they don&#x27;t calculate the potential there is not a university in the United States that has ever calculated the magnitude of a potential there&#x27;s not an electrical engineer or a grad student what they calculate is what is diverged from the potential by a unit Point charge that you just arbitrarily stick there in space now before the charge is there and before the interaction what exists there it&#x27;s not the E field and it&#x27;s not the potential that you have in your textbook at best that&#x27;s a real careful scientist will say potential intensity that&#x27;s a indication of the intensity of the potential not what the magnitude the magnitude thing reaches through all space so what&#x27;s its magnitude same thing with the field the imprecision that has been fered in there like all electrical engineers talk about drawing power you can&#x27;t draw power from the wall power is the rate time rate of doing work and the work is time rate of changing the energy or you know like scattering it or dissipating it in a resistor and that&#x27;s in the local component has nothing to do with what comes out of the wall the other thing energy flow has nothing to do with the electrons coming out of the wall and flowing his current that&#x27;s the energy dissipation going on in the circuit has to do with that the energy flow is outside the wire even the standard pointing Theory goes into that and if he it reaches on into space out way past the wire pointing never considered anything except the amount that hits the surface charg and gets caught and drawn back into the Char actually hits the field from the surface charges and gets drawn back in to the wire back and forth that little bit gets added to the wire it&#x27;s a tiny bit of the energy that&#x27;s out there heavy side the independent cisc discover of so-called energy flow through space which has got to be changed by the way it disagrees with quantum mechanics the energy flow in observation itself the energy flow uh does not actually conclude just the amount that&#x27;s caught just the diverged pointing component it also includes a component that does not get caught and does not get diverged and misses the circuit it&#x27;s enormously greater than the other one but now back in the 1880s you had a problem if you came up and you said that the terminals of every generator and every battery out there that from the terminals there comes this out pouring of energy far greater than the amount of mechanical shaft energy input to the generator or the amount of chemical energy dissipated in the battery you would have been violently attacked by the small scientific community that there was it was only about about three dozen electrodynamicist in the whole world you would have been violently attacked as being a perpetual motion nut so I had to be very careful with it now Lin understood both the difference between both sets of theory heavy sides was better point he got the direction wrong heavyside corrected him but pointing published prestigiously heavyside was was never was selftaught brilliant man but self-taught never went to University he published more obscurely he later got a prestigious publication in Royal Society proceedings as were pointing published but uh he spoke of it in terms of angles he&#x27;s very cautious not to say there&#x27;s a hell of a lot more energy pouring out of those terminals than we putting in that thing so what&#x27;s happening lorence took a look at it and said my God you know how did I explain that even the great lorence could not dare to say you know there&#x27;s 10 to some number you grab a number 12 I did an estimate 101 circuit was 10 to the 13th but say 10 12 times as much energy pouring out of the end of the generators you&#x27;re putting into the shaft now try to run that by an electrical engine it&#x27;s true but just try to run it by one Lorent said well this other energy he never denied it existed it doesn&#x27;t do anything and he used a clever phrase he said it has no physical significance cuz it Doesn&#x27;t power anything that&#x27;s like saying I got a sailboat on the ocean big wind and all the wind misses my sails have no physical significance that&#x27;s true for my boat for those sails on my boat that&#x27;s true the rest of that wind doesn&#x27;t power my boat at all so he said has no physical significance he gave a little trick to integrate the whole energy flow Vector around the closed surface around any volume element of interest at all that throws away everything that goes in and comes out with no diversion it throws away the heavy side component retains a pointing component now that&#x27;ll agree with your measurements on the circuit because energy that&#x27;s dissipated from the circuit which is what you got to measure has to enter the circuit and that&#x27;s the pointing compound is not the heavyside compound which does not enter the circuit the average electrical engineer it&#x27;s a rare one very rare I would say less than 10 the United States even knows there is a heavy side component missing the circuit never looked at it has no nothing to do with it doesn&#x27;t believe it if you tell him never has read the original papers never has gone back to see what heavy side actually said in his papers or what pointing actually said in his or what L said in his most of the professors have not read the original papers over 50% have not read them they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary anymore perfect job was done it wasn&#x27;t so in every area we look at there again was the broken symmetry of the dipole batteries and generators do not power circuits never have never will there&#x27;s not a battery there&#x27;s not a generator ever made that added a single watt to the power line it&#x27;s very easy to prove that in particle physics it doesn&#x27;t even exist in electrical engineering in fact they&#x27;ll think you&#x27;re nuts let&#x27;s explain it from particle physics starting from the award of the Nobel Prize 1957 for the broken symmetry of opposite charges now a dipole is two opposite charges very close to each other that&#x27;s what a dipole is so if I&#x27;ve got broken symmetry of opposite charges baby I got broken symmetry anytime I form a dipole I don&#x27;t have to prove that it&#x27;s been proven in physics if anybody doesn&#x27;t believe it go read why uh Lee and yang got the Nobel Prize in 1957 and read the papers read the literature that&#x27;s gotten unfashionable these days don&#x27;t read the literature read what somebody wrote about the literature no go to the original sources okay once I have this di Poole the very definition of broken symmetry says whatever is virtual the virtual particle interaction coming in with those charges at least a good part of that is being changed over now and is reradiated back as not as virtual form but as observable form all that is is coming in the time domain which is virtual State structures of time and radiating out by integrating by the Spin to real stuff just like an old for for first order analogy just like an old Spinning Wheel weaving threads together uh fibers together into a thread you get them bigger they become observable but then they&#x27;re thre space because you see them that means you catch them in three space so what happens is uh that&#x27;s what the charge is doing anyway and that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s coming from but we know that once we form that Source dipole now leave it alone don&#x27;t ever put another watt back into the circuit at all that dipole will sit there and pour out energy forever including both the heavy side component and the pointing component now clever Devils that we are we&#x27;ve been using aund and something year old system we whatever we catch in that circuit we want to drive the electrons around in the circle we ignore the holes in the direct C because they mostly interact with the lattice holes which are tied the big old ions down in the nucleus for example and it&#x27;s so much heavier in electron they Rock a little bit while electrons are going so what we do is we ignore a whole part of the electromagnetics going on usually in power engineering particularly and what we do whatever we catch and potentializing these electrons we look at the back EMF between the source d every electron flow that&#x27;s potentialized and goes around this way down to the ground side we have to pump its equivalent right back up through that back EMF and knock the charges apart so it takes precisely one/ half the energy it does collect to destroy its own dipole that&#x27;s pulling the energy out of the vacuum to power the circuit the other half Powers the circuit it Powers the losses and loads which mean less than half in a real circuit with losses less than half is is actually developed as power in the loow you got a half use to kill the dipole you got less than a half use to power the load you got to put back in at least as much to work back on those charges and force them back apart to make the dipole again as it took to destroy it so you got to put more in and you get out to load that&#x27;s the only reason on God&#x27;s green earth we&#x27;re building cop less than one circuit universally closed current Loop circuit restores lent Symmetry and forces us into cop less than one forces us into classical equilibrium thermody forces us into the second law of thermo and baby you can&#x27;t beat it if you have an open system a common home heat pump for example has a under good conditions has a cop of about 4.0 theoretical maximum is 8.22 but the average one with this inefficiencies and all is about four it puts out about four times as much actual energy delivered and you know heating the air or pumping the air or whatever</p>
