            <p>every material on earth is actually diamagnetic meaning it slightly repels a magnet this water gets repelled and even this wood even things like iron that are attracted to a magnet are actually slightly diamagnetic but their attraction force is just greater than the repelling force so in my anti-gravity rod here i have crystals of bismuth and bismuth is actually the most diamagnetic naturally occurring substance there is so much so that you can float a magnet in it so it&#x27;s repelling the magnet on all sides causing it to float so i thought it would be cool today to see how long we could get this magnet to spin under vacuum okay that got us spinning really fast still going in there it seems like it should be able to spin forever but because of the eddy currents that are generated it slows it down eventually has a very slow rotation right now oh it actually turned back the other way so i think we can say that it&#x27;s stopped now</p>
