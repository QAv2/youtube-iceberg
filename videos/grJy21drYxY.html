            <p>hi viewers today I will speak about the copper wire for our generator you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s very simple uh you need you can buy one square mm or 2 square mm uh wire and I&#x27;ll explain how much uh current can it holds and how much does it cost and how you can buy it because the usual packages for this wire are like 10 kilg and we don&#x27;t need that much so I&#x27;ll grab now the wire so this is how I bought the wire they can wind it for you in such shape from the usual package from 10 kg and one kilogram of such wire costs about 10 bucks so it means that you need 40 bucks for one one generator yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s enough this particular wire is 1.15 mm in diameter so it&#x27;s one square mm wire and um yeah I used 220 for one in one project I used uh 150 and in another 220 uh windings yeah so this is how I how I used this wire but you can also buy the the 2 mm wire 2 square mm wire because you can um you you will have double less of this wire but it will fit in same space and you will of course have a double less voltage yeah so you have to count on that and um yeah uh this particular wire which I showed you can hold currents up to 20 amps and this is uh yeah this is quite enough for our design to to support the the rated power and this is a double insulated copper wire uh which is is specially designed for the Transformers and for the generators and like that that it can uh hold up to 200° in temperature so you don&#x27;t have to worry that this insulation will M melt down yeah so this is why we need this kind of special wire which is called enameled copper wire yeah so so this is the prop proper um name of this wire and yeah uh uh of course you will need when you buy the wire you need a winding machine you can do it even by hand yeah it&#x27;s not it will not be so perfect but it will do it will it will work yeah if you do the molds I I showed in my project uh if you do it uh by hand it will it will do fine yeah you don&#x27;t have to worry it doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect like it&#x27;s from the factory yeah like the machine is winding yeah it&#x27;s an automatic machine but anyway way um you will uh you will learn something uh if you do this by yourself because this is very good to see uh in practice how these systems are designed and how they work and uh and uh you will see that it&#x27;s many many details which on which we do not pay attention and when you see my uh project you can see that it&#x27;s not so uh it looks simple it&#x27;s like has only maybe five parts in the end but until you get to this to this five parts you will spend a lot of time I I think you need three to four weeks to finish this turbine doing maybe one two hours a day uh to to have it to have it completed yeah so you will see that you will you will um face yourself with the challenge but uh yeah it&#x27;s a nice nice project so thanks for watching until next video bye-bye</p>
