            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I want to take a moment to thank everyone for their engagement, for taking the time out of their busy lives to come together today for this very critical briefing as we dive into, I think, the most compelling evidence relative to the reality of what is happening at Skinwalker Ranch. Jay, appreciate you pulling together a team of esteemed experts to help us better understand what we have documented at the ranch. &gt;&gt; I appreciate it. I think this is going to be a really good review because the the folks we&#x27;ve brought together, we&#x27;re trying to get the experts in their field so that we can solve skim ranch. You know, just to set the stage for the discussion, we&#x27;re talking about particularly interesting data where we&#x27;re seeing things happen with our instrumentation that has indicated what I I would say is a structure in the data itself.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve been calling that the bubble. I&#x27;ve created a conceptual model of the bubble. Let me bring it up. This is derived from LAR data from Pete Kelsey&#x27;s terrestrial laser scanner. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; How big across and how far above the ranch? &gt;&gt; 610 m radius about 2,000 ft. &gt;&gt; Okay. Of all the crazy things we&#x27;ve discovered over the past six years, a massive invisible bubble, which we have repeatedly detected with infrared LAR devices covering a huge area of the ranch above and below the ground is at the top of the list. It encompasses several hotspots where we&#x27;ve seen tons of UAPs. &gt;&gt; You seeing this? &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>and detected strange radio frequency signals that may actually be communication signals. Whatever this thing is, it appears to have stopped numerous instruments, including drones and rockets, from entering its barriers to collect data. And we&#x27;ve speculated that the area at its center, which is right at the strange spot we call the triangle, has prevented our devices from collecting GPS data inside the bubble and even above it up to about 3,200 ft. We are documenting technology and manipulation of our systems that really has no easy explanation. Correct.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We better hope it&#x27;s aliens. Right. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Cuz if it&#x27;s our near peers, then they&#x27;ve got a capability that we don&#x27;t have.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; These are serious questions. &gt;&gt; I mean, really serious. Even more reason why we need to do what we&#x27;re doing. at the Mesa drill site. Our drill ended up hitting a hard object that we didn&#x27;t anticipate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I can actually bring up a visual of that ground penetrating radar data. &gt;&gt; So, if you look right at this picture that Eric&#x27;s got up here, this is what the GPR data tells us is in the mea. &gt;&gt; Wow. We determined the best route would be rather than trying to destroy the object that we&#x27;re trying to study, it would be better to go up each side of it. As we continue those drilling exercises, we hit something that actually broke the drill in borehole 2.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. The drill rod hit something and they couldn&#x27;t move forward and they put like 15,000 lbs of pressure against it for 30 minutes and it didn&#x27;t move. Frankly, we don&#x27;t know what the heck it is that&#x27;s turning this. See, this is a brand new drill bit into this, or I should say this. Wow, that thing is damaged.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Take a look at these. The drillers have never seen anything like this. They said they&#x27;d never seen that ever. &gt;&gt; Did anything interesting come out of the sludge of the drill when it was impacting that at that point? &gt;&gt; Yes, it did. We hired an archaeologist to set up professional sifting areas and so he actually uh can tell us all about it.</p>
<p>Chris. Uh my name is Chris Roberts. I&#x27;m an archaeologist, local archaeologist in the basin area. Right in the 472 mark, they had hit a really hard spot. And once I got those spoils cleaned up, then I actually noticed ceramics that are undeniable material evidence that something is in the mesa that is not natural.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. Very interesting. &gt;&gt; So, these are some of the specimens that we&#x27;ve collected. Uh some of the ceramic materials. I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve enclosed them in these coin holders, and we&#x27;ll just pass those down so you can have a look.</p>
<p>In certain respects, it it it appears to be a rather normal ceramic composition. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What led you to believe that this material is indeed manufactured? &gt;&gt; Well, when you measure the thickness, it&#x27;s almost exact over the entire volume of the material, which suggests it was machine molded or pressed or something because it&#x27;s very uniform. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s mind-blowing. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>We ran some other experiments which were even more surprising. We dropped the ceramic over a magnet after freezing it in liquid nitrogen and it did hover like the Meisner effect. I suggest this could be a superconductor. &gt;&gt; So you&#x27;re going to freeze the sample? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago, while running additional lab tests on the ceramic material at Utah Valley University, we placed a sample in a dish of -320° F liquid nitrogen. &gt;&gt; Notice how it&#x27;s still boiling off. &gt;&gt; Now, a normal ceramic would have cooled down almost immediately. But this stuff wouldn&#x27;t cool down at all, and the liquid nitrogen kept boiling for several minutes. It&#x27;s still boiling away, man.</p>
<p>Look at that. We couldn&#x27;t believe the heat capacity of this thing. &gt;&gt; Here we go. &gt;&gt; See it? You see it? &gt;&gt; It did drift. &gt;&gt; It did drift.</p>
<p>When it did finally cool down, we put a magnet under another dish and placed the ceramic right over the center of the magnet. It literally pushed itself away, meaning it repelled the magnetic field. This is called the Meisner effect and suggests that these ceramics could be superconductors. Superconductors are cuttingedge materials that scientists are researching and developing because they have the ability to conduct energy without any resistance. Because of that and their ability to repel a normal magnetic field, some scientists believe that one day superconductors could be used to make vehicles and even spacecraft with advanced propulsion systems that don&#x27;t require rocket fuel.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the ceramics we found in the drilling spoils are superconductors and are covering whatever the objects are inside the mesa. This coming year, we&#x27;ll place a satellite in orbit, a satellite that will specifically focus on the ranch and take our investigation to the next level. So, with that, I I&#x27;d like to introduce Chad Brinkley, uh, the CEO of COPS in &gt;&gt; Hey, Chad. &gt;&gt; Hey, Brandon. &gt;&gt; Welcome.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you, Brandon, for having me. Gentlemen, &gt;&gt; now this is pretty awesome. Ranch owner Brandon Fugal, Jim Royston, Sam Daraso, and their colleagues at Omnitech have arranged with a space exploration company known as Seops for a satellite to be launched into orbit on one of SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 rockets in the coming months. And it&#x27;s going to be dedicated to helping us in our investigation on Skinwalker Ranch. I got the call from Brandon and Jim on this exciting opportunity to fly a satellite to space under a very aggressive timeline.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. From space to ground in air. We have a capability to push data up, pull data down. That&#x27;s our goal. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>So, this is a Skinwalker Ranch satellite. This will be a 6U spacecraft. While small, you can put a lot of capability in a 6U spacecraft. A 6U cubat is a class of miniaturaturized satellites. These compact units are designed to carry various instruments, cameras, and other space related technologies.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Over the next several months, we will put together what each component we could squeeze onto this thing and have mission success with. &gt;&gt; Pretty amazing. We&#x27;ve detected so many strange energy signals, anomalies, and even UAPs between 30 ft and 10,000 ft in the air. But using rockets, drones, and helicopters to try and pinpoint where they&#x27;re coming from is very limited. Having a sixu satellite in space that will pass over Skinwalker Ranch once every day will give our team incredible capabilities to search for the source of all the phenomena that we keep encountering on the ranch.</p>
<p>Now we can send all kinds of signals, GPS data, and more from the ground to space and back, scouring the entire range in an instant. This could lead to major revelations about the bubble and all the things we&#x27;ve seen across the ranch. &gt;&gt; With that, let&#x27;s open a new chapter. Look forward to uh our future discussions and collaboration and carrying this investigation forward. Thank you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you. Onward.</p>
