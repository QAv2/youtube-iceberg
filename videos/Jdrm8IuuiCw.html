            <p>a multi-dimensional hypothesis that if you look at quantum physics, one interpretation is the many worlds hypothesis that you could have a situation where reality is not just the 3D space within which we operate, but it could be laced or overlaid with hundreds or millions or an infinite number of additional universes, all of which are simultaneously operating. We can&#x27;t see them. We can&#x27;t get there, but maybe somebody else has figured out how to, you know, imagine a civilization. Imagine us, we don&#x27;t walk off a cliff in the next hundred years. Imagine us a million years from now.</p>
<p>What will we be capable of doing? What would any civilization be capable of doing? We don&#x27;t know. But so, one of the things that needs to be on the table is that you need to say these might be interdimensional. It&#x27;s easy to say it. It doesn&#x27;t prove it. But it what it does do though is it opens the aperture a little bit in terms of well if it is easy enough just to skip dimensions and move from one parallel world to another then if the timelines are misaligned or disaligned or not aligned then that means that something which is a trillion years old could skip back to us which were only 14 billion years</p>
