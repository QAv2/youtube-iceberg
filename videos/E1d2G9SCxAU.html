            <p>I&#x27;m joining science and spirituality. I&#x27;m joining the outer and the inner. Science is about the outer world. But meaning, experience, consciousness, free will is about the inner world. And right now they&#x27;re separate.</p>
<p>There is the spiritual people that you know think that this exist, but scientists say that doesn&#x27;t mean these guys look at those guys say matter doesn&#x27;t care. You know, so there is separation now between science and spirituality. This way of thinking brings them together. They integrate them. They become one.</p>
<p>So if we want to start a new theory, I start with a postulate. Even in math, you start with postulates that are taken to be true and they had to be self-evident. &gt;&gt; Your ground assumption. The ground assumption. The ground assumption of quantum physics.</p>
<p>They are so self-evident that you have to study 10 years before you say, &quot;Oh yeah, they are evident, not self-evident. They don&#x27;t pass the test of self-evidence to me.&quot; Now I&#x27;m going to tell you a part that is self-evident. One, the totality of what exists. One, dynamic. Dynamic means it&#x27;s never the same instant after instant is holistic means it&#x27;s not made of separable parts and so far I have describe the universe described by quantum physics I add one more thing one more quality one wants to know itself</p>
