            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right welcome again to social distillation the submarine still love the internet where we attempt to drop the bead and po White Lightning straight onto your brain what are we talking about today SEO well we&#x27;ve got uh three quick topics if we can get to them all we&#x27;re going to finally go over that advention invention secrecy act that we&#x27;ve been teasing for a bit uh then we&#x27;re gonna talk some dad bod and then if we have time the the viral sensation and actually my uh my thoughts on the response to when people found out her real name and everything so uh all right so you wanna you want to start here with this interesting nonsense yeah let me make it to where you can share hold on so appropriately I have worn my Jack Rony with the Constitution tatted on his chest CA all right well I wore my snatch specialist because whether it&#x27;s the invention secrecy act where we&#x27;re getting screwed or where you&#x27;re getting screwed we we&#x27;re covered so Let Me Whip this out real quick this [Applause] is yeah I way too many windows and tabs open make sure I&#x27;m looking at the right thing here um this is title 35 part part two chapter 17 sections 181 to I think it&#x27;s 189 yeah I would like to point out that this isn&#x27;t just some somebody talking about something this is actually the White Pages stuff this is the actual law yeah now hold on you&#x27;re in my way think I&#x27;m a doodle let me so I did find this here um and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m gonna go down this Rabbit Hole a little later this is an organization that is it&#x27;s kind of a a government Watchdog accountability type thing and they&#x27;ve got a lot of stuff on this specifically the the secrecy of certain inventions and filing applications in foreign countries is is the the ACT here something I will say that did jump out out at me immediately is you&#x27;ve got these seven sections here and that&#x27;s it this is i&#x27; I&#x27;m I&#x27;m gonna switch back over to the Cornell Law website because it&#x27;s just easier to read there but you see here that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the entire bill that we&#x27;re talking about so it is interesting that at least back in the 50s we still knew how to write a law and when they actually pass a bill nowadays a small one is under a thousand pages but most of the time you&#x27;re looking at a thousand to 2,000 Pages yeah we saw that with the uh the amendments to Title 9 was 1500 pages mhm it wasn&#x27;t even the the original Title 9 I think was a page or two MH yeah yeah so uh the the nuts and bolts of it here are are in the opening uh section here um whenever publication or Disclosure by the publication of an application or by the grant of a patent on an invention in which the government had a property interest might in the opinion of the interested government agency be detrimental to the National Security the commissioner of patents upon being so notified shall order that the invention be kept secret and shall withhold the publication of the application or the grant of a patent therefore under the conditions set forth here in after it&#x27;s still goblook but at least it&#x27;s understandable legal gobble back in the 50s MH so this was um I believe it was it was enacted in 52 so it was it was written and debated in I think 5051 it was enacted in 52 and one of the important things to remember and you&#x27;ll see because uh it pops up a couple of times in the bill where it specifically uh references the atomic energy Commission because what&#x27;s going on in 50 to 52 the Soviets get the bomb and the Korean war is going on so it it&#x27;s pretty clear that the original intent of the bill to me uh it seems was about nuclear security but of course that wasn&#x27;t put into the bill it&#x27;s left very open-ended so it can be applied to anything anything that somebody in the government deems a threat exactly and that is the first thing that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m wearing uh super Ronnie here with the Constitution tatted on his chest because right off the top it&#x27;s well wait a minute this is blatantly unconstitutional what does the Fourth Amendment say Pop Quiz anybody fourth oh [ __ ] that no it&#x27;s not that&#x27;s not the one that you can&#x27;t they can&#x27;t make you house soldiers and stuff uh no that is the third the okay I was close which is which always kind of gets made fun of but that was a big effing deal well I was assuming from the purpose of that that they might have been in the same one but well it it is interesting to note the Second Amendment right to bear arms shall not be infringed which seems pretty PL language to me the third amendment is quartering of soldiers not an accident and then the Fourth Amendment also related to that all right so back to all right the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and choosers shall not be violated and no warrant sh issue but upon probable cause unless we say that it&#x27;s a threat what&#x27;s fth I was a comment on that before you get to the fifth is this the whole National Emergency thing we talk about con we&#x27;ve talked about concept creep before think of all of these things that have creeped unconstitutional things in the name of National Security you know you look at the the fisa warrant act that just got renewed in the name of security ah domestic terrorism is the number one threat so we need to expand this law from foreign terrorists to our own American soldiers because they&#x27;re bad people the Fifth Amendment very closely connected to the fourth clearly I I don&#x27;t think the order here was an accident on the part of the founding fathers no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise Infamous crime unless on presentment of indictment of a grand jury blah blah blah nor shall any person be subject for the same offense twice um nor compelled to witness against himself nor and here&#x27;s the key one that is the blanket protection of the individual from the state nor be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law now here&#x27;s that include intellectual property uhhuh here&#x27;s where I think and again this is going to be a quickie and I just wanted to look at the statute itself and if we want to keep going down this Rabbit Hole I can get into the um I can get into the jurist Prudence of it how how cases involving this law have been ruled on because that&#x27;s really what comes down to when when when I talk about how we have a legal system not a justice system one of the things that contributes to that is that uh very rarely does a court actually go back and look at the original Law go back and look at the original Law and is that even constitutional instead what they look at is what have previous courts ruled on this law and then that that essentially expands the law because the the uh the courts are filling in the blanks that&#x27;s what we mean when us cranky conservatives talk about legislating From the Bench you&#x27;re filling in the gaps you&#x27;re expanding well not just crazy conservatives Progressive accused the right of doing the same thing so that very specific to your statement legislating from the court is used by both sides just only when the other side does it no I&#x27;m going to guess that if I dig into that Jurish Prudence what I&#x27;m going to find is that the justification for this act and how it&#x27;s still in use is this second part here this last part of the Fifth Amendment which is the imminent domain provision which is nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation and for anyone who&#x27;s been paying attention for a while you know that imminent domain has been horrifically abused in the past decades and clearly the courts haven&#x27;t done anything to help out with that and legislatures just keep doing it well according to Dr step Greer who&#x27;s the main whistleblower on all the things that have been done with that law part of the the what they do is they actually pay you for that patent yes and so they they pay you for 75% of what they think it&#x27;s worth for you never to to do it but it&#x27;s not the the problem is it&#x27;s not just okay well you&#x27;ll uh you&#x27;ll owe us back if you do it or with interest or something it&#x27;s you go to the jail for life where you&#x27;re probably going to get emed but it&#x27;s uh because they they&#x27;ve now officially can&#x27;t trust you after you&#x27;ve sign a contract so they&#x27;ve got to do something to make sure you never talk to anybody ever again about your ideas uh but but yeah so uh Dr Greer uh I watched one bet David but he&#x27;s got a full documentary out I can&#x27;t remember the name of it but uh as you pointed out it was probably written for this one specific purpose but because they didn&#x27;t state that specific purpose they can use the national security thing and from what I understand their justification for some of the things that they&#x27;ve held back like uh an engine that can go 200 miles to the gallon which is I think one of them that was quoted uh that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s a national Ser uh National threat being translated as oh if this comes out the industry is going to change so rapidly that the econom is going to collapse that that&#x27;s their justification for National threat I I I suspect the other um legal loophole here again we have a legal system not a justice system is the the other part that kind of jumps out at me um is still in the first section here and inv mention shall not be order kept secret in the publication of the application or the grant of a patent withheld for a period of more than one year see it&#x27;s just temporary it&#x27;s just temporary well yeah except that the commissioner of patent can just rubber stamp it add infinitum to keep the secrecy forever um also section 186 um okay uh first compensation because you you brought up punishment which I want to get to but first the compensation so again I think this is probably where the legal loophole is of well it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s essentially imminent domain no it&#x27;s not first of all because imminent domain clearly is for public use not because the government doesn&#x27;t like it so we&#x27;re going to here&#x27;s the other problem with that again everybody watch the interviews and watch the documentary is would you consider military operations public use they kind of should be but that&#x27;s not how they&#x27;re used yeah so some of these things that they&#x27;ve stolen from the person who invented it in the first place are being used in these situations so you know I would consider that public use because the Army Navy Air Force Marines space force are all public all right and you so you brought this up if a if full settlement of the claim cannot be affected the head of the department or agency May award and pay to such applicant his suor successors sexors no that&#x27;s the last segment that&#x27;s the last ass signs or legue of representes a sum not exceeding 75 percentum of the sum which the head of the Department of agency considers just compensation for the damage Andor fair use which is funny because that the the one example I gave the 200 miles on a gallon engine how do you qualify what is just compensation because that patent and royalties on that patent for as long as it lasts for something that revolutionizes an industry that compensation is huge but I bet that&#x27;s not what they get remember this because I I want to get to the uh punishment part here real quick because this is a a huge red flag for how this is brazenly unconstitutional um penalty now I assume this has been amended um but the penalties aren&#x27;t actually that severe no be fine not more than 10,000 or imprint is in not more than two years or both but I&#x27;m guessing from the interviews you&#x27;ve listened to and the things I&#x27;ve heard before I start stopped listening so I could look at it myself is that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening yeah all right okay so so just just kind of to qualify what we&#x27;re doing here is we&#x27;re not saying this whistleblower is telling the right thing but when we looked up the actual legal documents it was like oh gosh there there&#x27;s at least enough truth to look further into it uh all right that is yeah stop that all right so let me get dorky on you here and bring this up all right this is from Black&#x27;s Law six Edition ition all right due process does not mean there is a process and then it is followed okay doe process do we not know that recently geez yeah due process is a specific legal idea that goes way back for us to English common law and then it as it as it evolved you know through through the what we call the enlightenment period to the modern period uh it was added on to and essentially um due process of law implies the right of the person affected thereby to be present before the tribunal which pronounces judgment upon the question of life liberty or property in its most comprehensive sense to be heard by testimony or otherwise and to have the right of controverting by proof every material fact which Bears on the question of right in the matter involved if any question of factor liability be conclusively presumed against him this is not due process of law presumed against him it is just presumed oh well this this this violates National Security and then that that is fact and there is no controverting that there is also no due process here because there is no uh tribunal as Black&#x27;s Law says it&#x27;s just you you are you are making the authority here the agency the regulator the bureaucrat you are elevating him to not just judge and jury but also to both attorneys he is the entire court this individual this bureaucrat is the entire court because due process means the the government claim makes a claim hey you can&#x27;t publish that patent because it&#x27;s a threat to National Security so we&#x27;re gonna seize it uh uh no no you prove that in court now if there are secrecies involved sometimes we have closed courts that is a thing and that can get a little shaky in of itself but there is still a process there is still a a comeback process you have the government making a claim here you have the individual or group refuting the claim here and then you have an impartial judge and jury there is no impartiality here whatsoever because you know I didn&#x27;t want to go too far in the weeds but part of the statute says that well if if you don&#x27;t like this you can appeal to the person who made the claim in the first place you know that that that is the exact same rant we have been making about you know the the FBI investigating itself and said well there there was some there are some small problems here but we fixed it everything&#x27;s fine nothing to see here yeah and if a if a progressive accidentally listened this far into our episode uh will say the same thing about uh police unions they investigate their own and that&#x27;s why Chin&#x27;s back on the street after 14 offenses right because oh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s they&#x27;re their own people they invest themselves uh but from a civilian standpoint what people don&#x27;t realize and this goes for the IRS to anything is you can&#x27;t sue the federal government unless the federal government gives you permission to sue they&#x27;ll a bureaucrat like you said will will take their little signature and go oh no uh there there&#x27;s not enough to to bring a a case to court it&#x27;s like the da that turns down on every case right it&#x27;s just yeah and it&#x27;s of their own people so if you say IRS I think you made a mistake and we don&#x27;t think we made a mistake so yeah yeah the the the IRS is a brazenly unconstitutional organization it shouldn&#x27;t exist as it is because it violates every step of due process that you know so so that&#x27;s an example of something that has just been around and allowed to exist and we just accept it that that&#x27;s the way it is because that&#x27;s the way it always been no no no just because we&#x27;re dealing with you know just because we&#x27;re dealing with this kind of a case instead of that kind of a case doesn&#x27;t mean that suddenly the burden of proof is on you that&#x27;s the way the IRS operates the IRS says you&#x27;re in AAR you you failed to pay you you did not pay appr rately now we&#x27;re going to come in without a warrant we&#x27;re going to demand that you hand over every piece of paper in related to your finances and that you Prov to us that you didn&#x27;t do these things yeah that was there was a good meme on that several years ago where it was uh someone as asking an IRS person how much do I owe and the IRS person says well here&#x27;s these forms figure it out and then they turn in the forms and then the IRS comes back and says you didn&#x27;t pay enough and then the same person says if you couldn&#x27;t tell me how much I needed to pay how do you know if I didn&#x27;t pay enough well that&#x27;s the thing they can and and which to that sense it they should just send you a bill exactly and and if here is what you owe if you&#x27;re taking the standard deduction if you don&#x27;t want to do this if you want itemized deductions then start doing the paperwork but here&#x27;s your bill if you&#x27;re just going to take the standard deduction and something like 80% of people just take the standard deduction Someone Like You a small business owner you can&#x27;t do that because you have so many expenses that oh you do both no no it when you when you&#x27;re a a sole proprietor LLC you you rip when like say Nicole my wife gets her uh her W2 we plug that number in because she&#x27;s an employee she doesn&#x27;t have expenses MH associated with running the business but when I report my income the the the the net income is what the business brought in minus deductions and then that you you that number that comes out of that at the end goes into the the big pot with both of us filing jointly and from there you take the household standard deduction or itemize more which we don&#x27;t qualify for a lot of the itemization so we just take standard deduction I just had a brain fart I&#x27;m trying to remember there&#x27;s a term for it and I can&#x27;t find it okay so anyway um for some inexplicable reason and I don&#x27;t know the the um I don&#x27;t know the root of this I don&#x27;t know when it started and I don&#x27;t know what the Judicial philosophy of this is is because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just patently absurd in a lowercase L liberal democracy that this is a thing that exist which is judicial deference to administrative agencies what so so the reason something like the IRS exists and is able to operate the way it does is in large part because we no longer have separation of powers if if the judicial branch which is supposed to be a separate branch is deferring to the executive branch and just assuming that the Regulatory Agencies know what they&#x27;re doing and aren&#x27;t violating either the statute they&#x27;re supposedly enforcing or you know the the base statute which is the Constitution then we don&#x27;t have a impartial Judiciary we H we have an extension of the executive branch and and that is I am I am sure if I go digging into you know the Juris Prudence on this that that&#x27;s what going to see is that the the courts have for the past 70 years just continually deferred to whatever agency is making the claim well the the you know the Department of Defense says this is a threat to National Security okay well they know what they&#x27;re doing rubber stamp it meanwhile the person who is supposed to have an impartial separate power to go to when the legislative or executive B branches being abusive they have nowhere to go because it&#x27;s just an extension it&#x27;s just a subset of of the judic of the executive when it does that and and that&#x27;s why this exists uh also to to your earlier point that I think the other reason this exists is because Cold War nuclear threats they they I am sure looked at this and said well no this is an existential threat we have to we have to overcompensate if we&#x27;re going to air we&#x27;re going to air on the side of not having the entire continent literally turned to Glass so yeah well here&#x27;s the here&#x27;s the third answer there were nefarious people that knew what the outcome would be of that and how it would be used but they weren&#x27;t the person that cast the vote to put the law in place but don&#x27;t give those guys too much credit because they a lot of them purposefully turned a blind eye to who was doing it CU I bet you the5 trillion doll order industry was putting a bug in the ear of the Congress person that their lobbyist was supposed to to talk about like you don&#x27;t want everybody on the other side to have the extra extra powerful nuclear bombs do you this is a national security threat so somebody can just come up with an invention and patent it and then the whole world would have it well and this gets extra mesy when you start to get into dual use Technologies which a as as we have become more technologically advanced the the you know this is a dual use technology you know this is a supercomputer in my pocket and the components of which well heck you could just use this as a military technology you hook up a controller to it and now suddenly it&#x27;s attached to a drone and I&#x27;m watching the Drone feed while I you know drop a bomb on somebody so you could very easily have said oh no the iPhone we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re going to seize that that&#x27;s never going to happen that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a threat to National Security but it also makes big bucks so maybe we won&#x27;t seize that yeah so I I tell this goes along with a lot of other topics we talk about most of our problems with politics would be solved if we just took lobbies out of it if they were actually public servants MH I would even say give them a pay increase but they&#x27;re not allowed to take Lobby money there you go speaking of that we haven&#x27;t gone down the um the fouchy rabbit hole in a while but did you see several weeks ago I saw uh a story on the millions of speaking of patents the millions in patent royalties that were paid to people at the NIH CDC Etc it was a big number the the the people who are supposed to be overseeing those companies this seems like a slight conflict of interest and I bring that up to also point out that speaking of the past several weeks there&#x27;s been a lot of hyperventilating about the bird flu anyone else noticed that anyone El no the headline that was would you take the new bird flu vaccine um no I will just uh not touch random birds and not wash my hands and it it&#x27;s somehow when the kamic cof hit suddenly out of nowhere the entire world forgot that uh we know how to deal with upper respiratory infections we&#x27;ve been doing it for a long time well the big difference there here is a flu would have a liquid component so as long as that bird doesn&#x27;t spit in my face but uh as long as that doesn&#x27;t happen or I you know give mouth to mouth to a bird or you know uh apparently eyes is where where most infection comes from from because you touch something an eye worker or or you get particulate into your eyes because people think to cover their their mouth and nose they don&#x27;t think to cover their eyes and the difference the difference is there your eyes would just B basically give it a saline solution to transfer down to your nose because that&#x27;s where your tiu drained so instead of having all of the filters that has to go through here yeah yeah well and also it&#x27;s in liquid form so it just kind of sticks to the sides and that virus breeds and breeds and breeds where the mucus itself can stop that before it gets too far back if it&#x27;s Airborne the the connection here to you know same same song different verse is that I don&#x27;t remember who I first heard say this but the the retort from the right about the when when leftist anti- capitalists would get would would go overboard about how companies just want to kill people is the rort from the right was always why would you want to kill your customers these you&#x27;re saying these are all greedy companies and all they care about the bottom line then why do they want to kill their customers that makes no sense the problem with that when it came to the commic cof is that we weren&#x27;t the customer the government was and we&#x27;re supposedly the government but we&#x27;re not because they weren&#x27;t selling us the treatment they were selling them to the government which is what is happening here these same companies are trying to sell a vaccine or a treatment for the bird flu now they want they want governments to spend billions if not trillions of dollars stockpiling these things and then preferably mandating their usage same song different verse same song the problem is they did they did make one adjustment they uh the bird flu is a lot more fatal or lethal than what we just went through but not nearly as transmissible because of that liquid component yeah all right speaking of viruses and pandemics and trying to keep yourself out of the clutches of the broken system let me close out the last conversation first uh so this episode we went through the the actual law of the the ACT next one hopefully uh Heath has had a time to listen to The Whistleblower and what he has to say and everything so it&#x27;ll actually be more that one will be more about the content of what was being stopped and what actually may be there for the government to use but not us use but then when you see the government use it they say oh aliens so aliens have been having a lot more lately yeah look over there yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the The Simpsons episode hey Mark Maguire is MLB really spying on us well I could answer that question or I could hit some dingers nice okay so on to the next one so what did you want to not I I I&#x27;m kind of surprised that uh this came up for me years ago when I dad bod what the heck are these people talking about and I was confused but apparently it came back up just recently for you and you were also confused well no I wasn&#x27;t necessarily confused there was just something I hadn&#x27;t heard before because I I you know I knew the the dad bod thing transformed into the bald short belly gut guy that you know women feel comfortable with because it is a I know he&#x27;s not gonna leave me because can&#x27;t you know that kind of thing I first heard the term in reference to um pictures of Leonardo DiCaprio where he&#x27;s you know he doesn&#x27;t have that leading man bod and of of the dad bod I&#x27;m like you&#x27;re fine with him having a dadbod because he&#x27;s worth hundreds of millions of dollars yeah so there&#x27;s there three main components to it that was already a couple years after it had become starting to become popular MH because it originally meant what I think dadbod should be but uh this is what happens when they put something in Shape magazine and Suburban white women take a hold of it they&#x27;re so awful uh is well let me tell you what I thought because when I first heard the term one is the money like you said no no but see when I first heard the term I assumed what I think you were assuming which was oh the the dad like because so like like my dad he he didn&#x27;t work out he didn&#x27;t lift weights but he always had uh broad shoulders and chest he could always pass his PT test even as he aged in in in the Army and and he you know and he had a gut because he liked chicken fried steak like the rest of us um you know or it for your Dad it was probably the beer gut because beer um no he fluctuated he fluctuated and he would get it like his fat pattern is the same as mine where I uh I&#x27;ll G If I gain a lot then it&#x27;s kind of uniform but if I try to lose weight again you have to go through a stage of where it actually looks worse because I I kind of Melt from the ribs down which means you get that ribbon around the middle uh if if if it kind of gets to that point uh but no dadbod to me was exactly what you just described it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a strong capable man that you can tell physically when you look at him uh because he does stuff but also lives a normal life but they don&#x27;t have the trust fund that allows them to spend three hours a day in the gym you know half of it on your phone yeah uh but and also the time to do like bodybuilder Mill prep and all of those things MH so so someone who looks like they&#x27;re strong and capable physically but also is not perfect you don&#x27;t need a six-pack to beat somebody up in the ring that that&#x27;s over look what look at BJ Penn even or another example Chuck Ladell back in the day yeah in a weight class sport you got to kind of maximize your performance with body fat and and muscle so you can make weight but at the same time that you can be perfectly capable with a little bit of a gut or a little bit there&#x27;s a reason the lower weight classes tend to be the guys who are more ripped yeah but you also have a broad chest you&#x27;ve got big shoulders there&#x27;s a reason these things are attractive to women because they implied you could chuck a spear real hard and kill the animal that will feed your family for the next three weeks so that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s what I that&#x27;s what kind of the dadbod meme started as and that&#x27;s exactly what it should have been and then it took about five years to now where it became your beta male you know balding nonthreatening that&#x27;s what nonthreatening one of them is those people right now in today&#x27;s society make more money than the big strong people professional sports aside but I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t I think I can even make that statement because there&#x27;s not enough professional athletes to shift it that far yeah uh so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s the money part those people tend to make more money now and especially if you&#x27;re in an area like ours you&#x27;re pretty much pre-ordained married by the time you&#x27;re out of high school sometimes and then if not you go to a college and you marry the first girl you find in the youth group you went to so it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s that type of Personality because you&#x27;ve got the guy he&#x27;s like I&#x27;m punching up I&#x27;m punching up on this one and the girl who&#x27;s saying he won&#x27;t cheat on me because who else is going to take him you know uh so there&#x27;s the money there&#x27;s the security and then the third one that came up in panels that I saw including male and and female psychologists this is the one that will get us cancelled though women are not only threatened by having a good-look man because they have more opportunities to be approached by other women but they also like to be better looking than their partner because they don&#x27;t they they ruminate on oh my partner is better looking than me that makes me old and used and fill in the blanks of all the uh all the the ways you can you can say the same thing but so they&#x27;re they&#x27;re not threatened with leaving they&#x27;re financially secure and they don&#x27;t make me feel bad about myself and that&#x27;s why dadbod went so extreme in the other direction problem is when you get to a certain point that&#x27;s the eventually the semi middle-age but still keeps herself in shape and she&#x27;s pretty good-look woman that walks in the bar and takes the ring off and puts it in her pocket because you this may this may segue into HW Tua um because you you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t escape certain basic laws of the universe okay and so this is this is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it seems subtle but it makes perfect sense this is why you see them take the ring off because if it was just about I want I&#x27;m horny and I want to cheat or whatever they would have taken the ring off long before they walked in the bar MH but they&#x27;re they walk in for two reasons before they take it off cuz they scan the room real quick and see if there&#x27;s anything worth taking it off for CU I already have a husband I already have the financial security I&#x27;m looking for a good-look alpha male right now and so I want them to see that that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m looking for uh and they need to scan the room to make sure there&#x27;s something worth doing that for because there&#x27;s risk involved let&#x27;s get more cancelled this comes from the idea of toxic masculinity and I say that say it that way because what it has become is that all masculinity is toxic except that&#x27;s not how the female mind works you can you can say all you want that a woman can be a man and they can try but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s going to satisfy most of them most of the time that is why you see all these I&#x27;m going to be a career woman and then they never come back from their maternity leave because after they have that kid and after they stay at home with that kid for a while they realize I like this this makes me feel good well let&#x27;s use gender correctly here so sex is male or female or technically INX because that actually exist but gender is masculine and feminine so let&#x27;s talk about the L in the lgbtq look at the more effeminate there&#x27;s always an effeminate and a masculine even amongst females in those groups it&#x27;s very when you see hot and feminine and hot and feminine doing that together most times they&#x27;re lipstick okay it&#x27;s but when you see a real couple that I just completely out of closet on both sides it&#x27;s usually one very AFF feminite and one very masculine because they still like those traits and their masculine partner carries the traits they still like even though they they like you know they don&#x27;t like The Twig and berries as much right so the pattern is still there and masculine and feminine might be more of an indicator than male and female in a lot of situations so back to how this connects to the dadp is you&#x27;ve settled for this your your focus is control and security but how you&#x27;re getting it is contrary to your nature and so that is going to lead to that 35 40 year old 45 going I&#x27;m not happy well duh because you purposefully chose things that were bound to make you not happy because what your focus was wasn&#x27;t actually happiness yeah and if your if your primary motivator was that paycheck I bet you your complaint is he does doesn&#x27;t spend enough time with the family he&#x27;s always at work MH well you know paychecks come from somewhere and if you had emphasized that early in your relationship just with like oh I&#x27;m I love that you pick up the check oh I love that you tip so well I love all the things that involve you spending money you&#x27;ve been trained for that now let&#x27;s go to the guys and put have equal representation of you&#x27;re responsible for this going on too the guy started seeing this and was like I I can be lazy I can be lazy you know if that&#x27;s what they like anyways now you&#x27;ve just created a justification in their head is oh you&#x27;re being lazy and you&#x27;re unhealthy right now I&#x27;m just trying to make my wife happy because Dad happy wife happy life happy wife happy life yeah duck uh it&#x27;s the uh yeah I got so much on those on the inner thoughts there that uh did this come up in a class discussion did you get did you get roasted for being a patriarchal you misogynistic bad word person no I but I am very careful how I use my words especially when I&#x27;m talking about a controversial Topic in class and I&#x27;ve I never got well part of this is the fact it&#x27;s kind of over reported what the students actually think before brainwashed versus what the message is in the class because you only need to shift the the the boundary like three% of people to make it look like it&#x27;s everywhere and Mo B my experience most students are pretty just normal people even amongst the indoctrinated they they may shift one a little one way or the other but they&#x27;re pretty much normal but I do pick my words carefully that uh I I I wouldn&#x27;t say the the beta males that go dadbod or gonna end up cucks but there&#x27;s probably a higher percentage there and that that&#x27;s the opposite of masculinity so well but what I what okay so what the new part was the new part was okay that I I gave my description of what I thought dad bod should be which we just went over and so the person I was talking to said oh that&#x27;s called father figure and I was like ah I hate this timeline I blame CERN see when they turned on the when they turned on that giant reactor they sucked us into an alternate Dimension and this it is the dimension of stupid yeah I don&#x27;t know the details of how that would work but we I I would more go to the uh effects of the smartphone like that you just held up earlier things that used to be something you may never have even experienced in your life become viral and so then everybody who has a cell phone which is almost everybody in the country knows it and uh I think that&#x27;s that&#x27;s more to blame than CERN I I say there might be a long-term effect that I don&#x27;t know about but yeah well we we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve talked about some of that long-term effect with the lady with the nice accent whose name I can never remember because it&#x27;s this ridiculously long Indian name uh you know talking about stop getting your mental health advice from Instagram it treit something excuse me um yeah you know that that is part of the point I and I and that goes to both she was talking about um girls mostly it partly because that&#x27;s she&#x27;s a woman herself and that&#x27;s kind of her Focus but also because women were not allowed to say this young girls because of their more Collective versus hierarchical nature they&#x27;re much much more susceptible to peer pressure and to mental health issues that&#x27;s just a fact so there that demographic you are seeing a much more ridiculous shift into the you know statistically significant spikes in in reported mental health you know problems and treatment and whatever but then on the flip side of that on the on the male side of that I I where I think the supercomputer in your pocket flips to is if it becomes too easy to I&#x27;ve ranted about this before of just Googling the answer and then just that highlighted box at the top you go okay there it is there there is something to be said for finding an answer there&#x27;s something to be said for digging and doing your own research and having to think where should I go to try and find this answer or you could just look at something you know some moronic statement by some jack off like Andrew Tate and go yeah bro that&#x27;s not helping either that&#x27;s just making the problem worse and and that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s good that people like Jordan Peterson came along and you know every time he gets interviewed by one of these feminist reporters and they&#x27;re all your audience is overwhelmingly male how is that a bad thing he&#x27;s telling young men to become men and that and to do that is to take control of your own life stop being complacent and lazy and Dad botting it because you can stop stop just happy wife happy life because you can because it&#x27;s easy yeah and this is okay so this is the the up and down part of being masculine being a masculine m you can look at lions and you a pride of lions and this this would uh help you visualize it when asked to do something when made to do something I&#x27;m not going to say asked asked is what we should do to each other as human beings but made is what is the right thing at the right time to get the best result uh so they&#x27;re made to do something when they&#x27;re needed but if you don&#x27;t ever make a man do anything they&#x27;re going to be lazy as hell you know I brought up Lions the male will defend the pride from other male lions or hyenas and all of those things but they don&#x27;t do the catching of the food so what do they do all day they sleep all day until some other threat shows up to the pride and they take care of it and then they go back to sleeping all day so that in that situation if it was up to the male to catch the food he&#x27;d get up and do go do it and there are times where that happens that&#x27;s why I like to use the lion as an analogy because a while back I think this was following a a pride in South Africa I was watching this documentary and the The Pride had not made a kill for something like a week which is bad and so the the lead female starts making this call and the next day the the male comes back to the pride because hey get over here and help your family is starving literally and so with the maale there to join the hunt they take down a giraffe which is a buttload of meat for the pride because she as the lead female she&#x27;s like 180 to 200 pounds he&#x27;s like six to 700 PBS mhm so when he jumps on the back of that giraffe it goes down and so that that that is where that is where I like to use that analogy of hey do your damn job get over here stop just going out there marking your territory your while your family&#x27;s literally starving get over here and do your job you know sposi talks about baboons because one of his things about why baboon&#x27;s translated so well to his transition to human brain development was that like Western Society they spend about three or four hours managing food demand for the day and then they have the rest of the day to make each other&#x27;s lives completely miserable he said that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re more like us than like the chimpanzees in Behavior because chimpanzees spend most of their time trying to survive and then they just groom each other the rest of the time where baboons will groom each other a little bit but then they get bored and so they find the next one down on the notch to stress them out you know uh but to to tie that won&#x27;t do anything if not made to to H to what we&#x27;re talking about to humans you no longer have to have a healthy physique for me to be attracted to you well what do guys do more uh do more for sex food or shelter this is another downfall of man but it&#x27;s you know it makes sense they will stop making their shelter and hunting their food if that just right sexual encounter is sitting right there and by just right that&#x27;s a very broad umbrella so especially if you live in the wild so if you don&#x27;t motivate the man with that access to that thing that he finds more important than shelter and food they&#x27;re not going to do anything to improve that until the Western phenomena of midlife crisis happens where they&#x27;re starting to get it just as dissatisfied with their partner as their partner is dissatisfied with them because men value Youth and in order to keep that guy around you got to get that sorry do we want to transition yes okay I don&#x27;t want to but let&#x27;s talk about this because apparently it&#x27;s still going on out there no we&#x27;re we&#x27;re at a good point now now we&#x27;ve gotten to the phase where the memes talking about being tired of the meme has already started okay does that mean we&#x27;re almost done all the memes the memes I saw that made me go what what is going on here what are people what are people talking about the one I the one I saw was uh the I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what if it was from a movie or if it&#x27;s just from him standing outside and some Paparazzi took it but that that picture of Ben afflac holding a cigarette in his mouth and he&#x27;s just got this look of uh I&#x27;m just done with life right now and it was the HW to a girl&#x27;s dad right now and I was like what what are you talking about that I had to go figure out what&#x27;s going on here and go oh okay so it wasn&#x27;t the actual video that I really wanted to talk about though uh have you actually watched the video too yeah yeah so the thing I wanted to talk about was the the followup from the other Community First there was a false story that she was a preacher&#x27;s daughter but it it&#x27;s not the fact that the story was false it was the people who reacted to it it was I don&#x27;t know what percentage of it is of the church anymore but it was the the Damned to uh Brimstone and fire crowd and the name was wrong in the original story and it was a to use that the pastor&#x27;s name and everybody&#x27;s response to that oh she should do that I&#x27;m like I was I was a little upset of the it was like the shame walk in in Game of Thrones it&#x27;s like Shame Shame Shame and the everybody even trashing the dad you didn&#x27;t do a good job you didn&#x27;t do this then when her real name came out was when the community she she&#x27;s a apparently a a a young school teacher I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s Elementary or or uh preschool but everybody that saw that Meme and knew who she was were demanding her to get fired from her job and all of these other things so I was just like I was actually very disappointed with the response because a mem&#x27;s g to be a meme if you&#x27;re going to get annoyed by it it&#x27;ll be gone in a week because that&#x27;s how fast these things go now but it was it was basically the reaction to just a semi- drunk girl giving a funny answer to a stupid question my frustration with all this nonsense was um first of all to your point it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just another in a long line of viral memes and videos it&#x27;s this is not new we have seen this before this is just what happened get people&#x27;s attention right now first of all um and then secondly the reaction to it okay so now that there&#x27;s this story out there that she&#x27;s a preacher&#x27;s daughter now it matters now people are upset now now people what I what I think it did was that gets you into the algorithm of the ultra conservatives I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s it and that&#x27;s what the crossover was but my initial reaction to to people getting all upset about it was if if this is improper Behavior it&#x27;s improper Behavior the fact that you now think she&#x27;s a preacher&#x27;s daughter makes it more worser no it if you think this is improper Behavior you should be saying this is improper behavior and we shouldn&#x27;t be celebrating this well here&#x27;s here&#x27;s one thing about that when you when it comes to the it would be Islamic and J Judaism and Christianity the the uh the why would that kind of behavior be really shameful is because it implies that you&#x27;re promiscuous we don&#x27;t know that from that video we don&#x27;t know if she&#x27;s got one partner if she&#x27;s had a 100 Partners we don&#x27;t know if she keeps the guy happy in bed maybe she&#x27;s had a long-term partner because she keeps him happy in bed because that was the question what do you do to drive your man crazy in bed and she said you got to give him that Tua spit on that thing that doesn&#x27;t tell you that she&#x27;s a harlot and what what people on my side should be pointing out is the why do we why do we celebrate salacious behavior in public because Jason Whitlock made this point a a while back that I think it was at the beginning of June where you know why why why are we heterosexuals and and people who profess to be Christians why are we getting all M mad about pride month we&#x27;ve been putting our sexuality out there in the public space for decades why why do you think they&#x27;re not going to the the the fact that the the fact that their Antics uh repulse you or you think they&#x27;re wrong or you think they&#x27;re going too far or whatever but you know he&#x27;s right in that the the sexualization of everything has been going on for decades and it&#x27;s just accepted as Norm but it&#x27;s not really any different than what&#x27;s happening at these you know over-the-top Pride parades it it&#x27;s you know Victoria Secret catalog isn&#x27;t that much different than you know what what what&#x27;s what&#x27;s on that Pride float in the thongs and asess chaps I really hate saying asess chaps I shouldn&#x27;t say that all chaps are assets that&#x27;s how chaps work anyway it&#x27;s just minor Bugaboo of mine but and and that to me is what what is so frustrating about a situation like this because I&#x27;m fine with the shame walk because we should have shame it if not for the an act itself but the hey how about we keep private stuff private why do we got to throw it all out there in public all the time this is improper Behavior improper question improper moments and you know whatever happened to what happens in my bedroom stays in my bedroom okay well then keep it there okay so I can agree on one point and disagree on another it does say something that these Street interviews are like the most viral popular ones you can find on Instagram or or Tik Tok it&#x27;s also not an accent these interviews are almost always with someone who is clearly Saed exactly yeah so so you&#x27;re you are approaching drunk people on the street who aren&#x27;t trying to be famous but you&#x27;re trying to provoke a reaction you&#x27;re trying to provoke an reaction they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re intoxicated usually uh and this this some this is actually something that should be discussed in the legal realm in the proper place in the in the legislature mhm that person is technically I mean unless you can prove they signed a document that says you can use this that seems to be accepted on social media but that would never be accepted if is if I just filmed you and then I yeah I just send it to all your friends we have single party and dual party consent states most states are single party meaning so long as I consent to being in this you know video that&#x27;s fine all right well that there are there are some problems there to begin with but the bigger problem is to I you know I think also make this point is how how can that person consent to anything when they&#x27;re intoxicated yeah you should be fighting this fight by the way you know because this is this is a verbal uh sexual assault basically you&#x27;re getting people to talk about their intimate moments while they&#x27;re intoxicated when they normally your own personal profit yep because I guarantee she didn&#x27;t get any money from that now at this point of Fame she can probably open and only fans and never even have to get naked and make a [ __ ] ton of money but that other than that know she didn&#x27;t she wasn&#x27;t looking to make a viral moment she gave an intoxicated honest answer to a question I mean if anybody can be expected to not do something stupid like that it&#x27;s not stupid at the time it&#x27;s this guy I don&#x27;t even know because I didn&#x27;t I hadn&#x27;t even heard of this street walker uh before until he went famous filming this one uh she probably didn&#x27;t know him either yeah because everybody&#x27;s putting a camera in your face these days especially if you&#x27;re in those you&#x27;re putting a camera in your own face a lot of times you&#x27;re putting a camera in your own face so she was a little intoxicated she probably thought the answer was funny she may tell that joke with her friends all the time we don&#x27;t know that that could be her go-to when all these girls get like little birds and talk about their their boyfriends and stuff uh trust me because I&#x27;ve actually been the the the P Psy in some of these groups just because for some reason girls trust me but this is just one of those infuriating moments that we we&#x27;ve had a number of these which is that I hate them because everything about them or at least so much about them is wrong and so much of the discourse isn&#x27;t even looking at those things but maybe is picking up on one wrong thing but then arguing about it in a dumb way and not even looking at all the other things about this whole situation that are just ugly yeah and there&#x27;s also the human just compulsion to try to perform when there&#x27;s a camera in your face again the expectation of where this would go versus I&#x27;m talking to a guy and we&#x27;re bantering back and forth it just so happens it was to somebody who can put it on the internet and go viral with it because apparently had enough uh followers but I&#x27;ve you know listen go watch some of those guys this was mild compared to some of the answers you get oh I think I saved one earlier just to be able to say jeez uh where did I put that please no stop that&#x27;s the wrong one oh okay so this this one okay this this gives me Beyonce vibes okay okay oh jeez told my man I was out with my mom he didn&#x27;t know Mom stood for my other man those are the ones that should be uh discussed more there&#x27;s plenty of those out there yeah uh but this one the difference was it was funny it was cute it was it looked genuine not rehearsed and uh it was a perfect meme moment because it was is so much different from all these other not as uh genuine as that that person so it it was it it&#x27;s gonna die though it&#x27;s I do have to maybe I have to make a counter meme because I have to disagree with the the the HW Tua girl herself if you think you can give me a hand job no matter how much you H to on that better than I can give me a hand job I&#x27;ve got 30 some odd years of practice okay I know exactly my buttons hand advice for all you women out there put it in your mouth that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s goal that you should pay my $65 hourly rate for that ladies that that fix your world there I hate this timeline stupid sir reactor all right are we done are we done yammering about all everything that is stupid and that I hate yeah I think we covered all three topics uh more efficiently than we usually do so Friday we will have Wheel of Time day which hopefully won&#x27;t be this annoying I can&#x27;t remember what we&#x27;re coming up on though so no promises there oh presidential debate that&#x27;ll be the next topic that&#x27;s tomorrow night isn&#x27;t it I heard the 27th is is that still on yep the the good news is compared to others apparently because sleepy Joe gets sleepy they they limited it to an hour not two hours oh my gosh they tried to pretend it was on CNN&#x27;s end everything about this is stupid uh so yeah next Wednesday won&#x27;t definitely won&#x27;t be any better because everything about this is stupid and so much of the discourse isn&#x27;t even remotely On Target yay all right well in that case I&#x27;m gonna go lay down because I don&#x27;t feel good well lunchtime for me so uh we will see oh no no I got a client too okay it is not lunchtime for me I forgot the reschedule so uh yeah we&#x27;ll see you next time no disclaimers needed I think other than no no I&#x27;ll give give a disclaimer we technically semi gave Health advice indirectly by saying don&#x27;t have a dad bod as it&#x27;s described yeah yeah so be strong healthy lean eat your vegetables but also eat your meat later guys</p>
