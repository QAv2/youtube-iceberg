            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this channel is for educational purposes and uh we look at theories of everything in particular today as our 480th video on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larsson and uh we&#x27;re going into this deep and you know hopefully we&#x27;ll help you uh kind of appraise uh this Theory of Everything and how you can use it to benefit your life uh because you know with a theory of everything it might seem like it&#x27;s about one subject or another but it can be applied universally and um like so today we&#x27;re going over uh chapter 10 of larsson&#x27;s book uh basic properties of matter chapter 10 is on electrical resistance now before you turn this off and say you&#x27;re not interested in electricity or the basic properties of matter uh think uh kind of more broadly that um you know this is a generalized Theory the reciprocal system is a generalized or a system of theory uh you can plug it into any subject that you&#x27;d like and to see how Larson plugs it into chemistry and to electrical resistance in particular sheds light on how it can be plugged into other subjects uh so you have to kind of get a grasp of the whole Theory how he applies it to chemistry astronomy metaphysics economics uh you know psychology and how some of his followers plugged it into even uh studies even further a field to be able to kind of uh grasp its potential and how you can use it in your own life okay now uh if you don&#x27;t know anything about the reciprocal system you can try to glean something from this uh from this uh episode here but uh you can also go back to any of my first 474 videos on this subject and I give at least the relatively explanation of the reciprocal system and how it works uh but now um I pretty much uh am going to assume that you know something about it uh that you know the basic uh idea behind the reciprocal system the universe of motion and uh I&#x27;m just going to start in with the reading from chapter 10 okay uh chapter 10 electrical resistance while the motion of the electric current through matter is equivalent to motion of matter through space as brought out in the discussion in chapter n the conditions under which each type of motion is encountered in our ordinary experiment uh experience emphasize different aspects of the common fundamentals in dealing with the motion of matter through extension space we are primarily concerned with the Motions of individual objects Newton&#x27;s Laws of Motion which are the foundation stones of mechanics deal with the application of forces to initiate or modify the Motions of sub such objects and with the transfer of motion from one object to another our interest in the electric current on the other hand is concerned mainly with the continuous aspects of the current flow and the status of the individual objects that are involved is largely irrelevant the mobility of the spatial units in the current flow also introduces some kinds of variability that are not present in the movement of matter through extension space consequently there are Behavior characteristics or properties of material structures that are peculiar to the relation between these structures and the moving electrons expressing this in another way we may say that matter has some distinctive electrical properties the basic property of this nature is resistance as pointed out in chapter 9 resistance is the only quantity participating in the fundamental relations of current flow that is not a familiar feature of the mechanical system of equations the equations that deal with the motion of matter through extension space present day ideas as to the origin of electrical resistance are summarized by one author in this manner ability to conduct electricity is due to the presence of this is a quote ability to conduct electricity is due to the presence of large numbers of Quasi free electrons which under the action of an applied electric field are able to flow through the metallic lattice disturbing influences impede the free flow of electrons scattering them and giving rise to a resistance as indicated in the preceding chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electrons we find are derived from the environment it was brought out in volume one that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities and that although the Motions that constitute these electrons are in many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited it follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector of the universe most of which are uncharged in this uncharged State the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space because they are inherently rotating units of space and the relation of space to space is not Motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the Natural reference system in the manner of of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material Aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment of photons by radiation meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later whereby electrons are returned to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the Earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level these processes that determine the equilibrium electron concentration are independent of the nature of the atoms of matter and of the atomic volume the concentration of electrons is therefore uniform in electrically isolated conductors where there is no current flow it follows that the number of electrons involved in the thermal motion of atoms of matter is proportional to the atomic volume and the energy of that motion is determined by the effective rotational factors of the atoms the atomic volume and the thermal energy therefore determine the resistance distance those substances which uh those substances whose rotational motion is entirely in time uh those of division 1 and two have their thermal Motion in space in accordance with the general rule governing addition of motions as set forth in volume one for these substances zero thermal motion corresponds to zero resistance and the resistance increases with the temperature this is due to the fact that the concentration of electrons or units of space in the time component of the conductor is constant for any specific current magnitude and the current therefore increases the thermal motion by a specific proportion such substances are conductors where there are two dimensions of rotation in space as in many of the elements of division 4 the thermal motion which requires two open Dimensions because of the finite diameters of the moving electrons is necessarily in time in this case Zero temperature corresponds to zero Motion in time here the resistance is initially extremely high but decreases with an increase in temperature substances of this kind are known as insulators or dielectrics and now I&#x27;ve read that over many times and I just don&#x27;t get it um but um perhaps you do and you can explain it to me um but I don&#x27;t see um I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not grasping the um relationship between the thermal motion and the um rotations in time and space apparently so anyway keep moving on where there is only one dimension of spatial rotation as in division three the elements of greatest electric displacement those closest to the electropositive divisions are able to follow the positive pattern and our conductors the division 3 elements of lower electric displacement follow a modified time motion pattern with resistance decreasing from a high but finite level at zero temperature these substances of intermediate characteristics are semiconductors for the present we will be concerned primarily with the resistance of conductors and will further limit the discussion to what may be called the regular pattern of conductor resistance a limitation of this kind is necessary as at the present stage of the investigation because the large amount of uncertainty in the experiment Al information on the resistivity of the various conducting materials makes the clarification of the resistance relations a slow and difficult process the early stages of the development of the reciprocal system of theory prior to the publication of the first edition of this work in 1959 which were very productive in the non-electrical areas made relatively little progress in dealing with the electrical properties largely because of conflicts between the theoretical deductions and some experimental results that have since been found to be incorrect uh the increasing scope and accuracy of the experimental work in the intervening years has improved the situation very materially but the basic problem Still Remains and that is definitely uh you know a sticking point in some of larsson&#x27;s work is that um you know he has his two fundamental postulates and then from his postulates he derives a theoretical universe and then in books like this he Compares his theoretical Universe with the uh actual measured universe of the Legacy scientists you you know and you know really I can I can derive my theoretical Universe uh strictly from Theory and it matches up with your uh measured uh empirical Universe however you know if the theor if the uh empirical uh universe is pro presenting incorrect answers then that leaves the reciprocal system a little bit um you know Mis misled and ultimately Larson has to go with just okay well this is what my theory says and you know ultimately the theory overrides the um the um observations um I guess you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard to say you know because you don&#x27;t want to be like in denial about things but um certainly there is a history of of making erroneous observations as well and in some cases the observations are not erroneous but they are just of limited U accuracy okay ideally it should be possible to deduce all of the pertinent information from theoretical premises alone within reference to experimental determinations but as a practical matter this is not feasible a few steps can be and have been taken on a purely theoretical basis particularly where the previous development of the theory has cast some important new light on the subject uh on the subject matter but from the Practical standpoint an extensive and detailed investigation in anywhere and any area is Possible only if the theoretical study and the checking of the theoretical conclusions against experimental and observational data go hand in hand it follows that where empirical data are lacking progress is difficult and where they are seriously wrong it is essentially impossible okay Larson just in a more articulate way said what I was trying to say there uh for um he can&#x27;t really make a lot of Headway uh when the empirical data that he&#x27;s comparing his theoretical Universe with is wrong you know especially when if he doesn&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s wrong so um going on unfortunately resistance measurements are subject to many factors that introduce uncertainty into the results the purity of the specimen is particularly critical because of the great difference between the resistivities of conductors and dial electrics even a very small amount of dielectrical impurity can alter the resistance substantially conventional theory has no explanation for the magnitude of this effect if the electrons move through the interstices between the atoms as this Theory tends a few additional obstacles in the path should not contribute significantly to the resistance but as we saw in chapter 9 the current moves through all of the atoms of the conductor including the impurity atoms and it increases the heat content of each atom in proportion to its resistance the extremely high dialectric resistance resistance results in a large contribution by each impurity atom and even a very small number of such atoms therefore has a significant effect semi semiconducting elements are less effective as impurities but they may still have resistivities thousands of times as great as those of conductor Metals the resistance also varies under heat treatment and careful annealing is required before reliable measurements can be made the adequacy of this treatment in many if not most of the resistance determinations is questionable for example GT Meen reports that the resistance of brillium was lowered more than 50% by such treatment and comments that much earlier work was clearly based on unannealed specimens other sources of uncertainty include changes in crystal structure or magnetic behavior that take place at different temperatures or pressures in different specimens or under different conditions often with substantial hysteresis effects ultimately of course it will will be desirable to bring all of these variables within the scope of the theoretical treatment but for the present our objective will have to be limited to deducing from the theory the nature and magnitude of the changes in resistance resulting from temperature and pressure variations in the absence of these complicating factors and then to show that enough of the experimental results are in agreement with the theory to make it probable that the discrepancies where they occur are due to one or more of these factors that modify the normal values in as much as the electrical resistance is a product of the thermal motion the energy of the electron motion is in equilibrium with the thermal energy the resistance is therefore directly proportional uh to the effect thermal energy that is to the temperature it follows that the increment of resistance per degree is is a constant for each unmodified substance a magnitude that is determined by the atomic characteristics the curve representing the relation of the resistivity to the temperature in application to a single atom is thus linear like the curves representing the temperature variation of the properties that We examined in the earlier chapters and for the same reasons the initial level of the resistivity curve is negative from this initial level to The Melting Point the resistivity of an unmodified atom one that has not undergone on a structural rearrangement or other change that modifies the resistance relations follows a single straight line rather than a curve composed of two or more segments of different shapes as in the specific heat and thermal expansion curves this limitation to a single line is characteristic of the electron relations and is due to the fact that the electron has has only one rotational displacement unit and therefore cannot shift to a multi-unit type of motion in the manner of the complex atomic structures a somewhat similar change in the resistivity curves does occur however if the factors that determine the resistance are modified by some rearrangement of the kind mentioned earlier as PW Bridgeman uh commented in discussing some of his results after a change of this Nature has taken place we are really dealing with a different substance the curve for the modified atom is also a straight line but it is not collinear with the curve of the unmodified atom at the point of transition to the new form the resistivity of the individual atom abruptly changes to a different straight line relation the resistivity of the aggregate follows a transition curve from one line to the other as usual at the lower end of the temperature range the resistivity of the solid aggregate follows another transition curve of the same nature as those we found those that we found in the curves representing the properties discussed earlier the relation of the resistance to the temperature in this temperature range is currently regarded as exponential but as we saw in other cases of the same kind it is actually a probability curve that reflects the resistivity of the DI diminishing number of atoms that are still individually above the temperature at which the atomic resistivity reaches the Z Z level the curve for the solid aggregate also diverges from the single atom curve at the upper end due to the increasing proportion of liquid molecules in the solid aggregate in this case again two values are required for a complete definition of the linear curve either the coordinates of two points on the curve or the slope of the Curve curve and the location of one fixed point a fixed point that is available from the theoretical premises is the 0 point temperature the point at which the curve for the individual atom reaches the zero resistance level the theoretical factors that determine this temperature are the same as those applying to the specific heat and thermal expansion curves except that since the resistivity is an interaction between the atom and the electron it is effective only when the Motions of both objects are directed outward the theoretical 0 point temperature normally applicable to resistivity is therefore twice that applicable to the properties previously considered up to this point the uncertainties in the experimental results have had no effect on the comparison of the theoretical conclusions with experience it is conceded that the relation of resistivity to temperature is generally linear with deviations from linearity in certain temperature ranges and under certain conditions the only question that issue is whether these deviations are satisfactorily explained by the reciprocal system of theory when this question is considered in isolation without taking into account the status of that system as a general physical Theory the answer is a matter of judgment not a factual matter that can be resolved by comparison with observation but we have now arrived at a place where the theory identifies some specific numerical values here agreement between Theory and observation is a matter of objective fact not one that calls for a judgment but agreement within an acceptable margin can be expected only if one the experimental resistivities are reasonably accurate two the point the zero point temperature is applicable to specific heat which are being used as a base were correctly determined and three the theoretical calculation and the resistivity measurement refer to the same structure table 24 applies uh equation 71 uh with a doubled numerical constant and the rot ational factors from table 22 to a determination of the temperatures of the zero levels of the resistance curves of the elements included in the study and compares the results with the corresponding points on the empirical curves the amount of uncertainty in the resistivity measurement is reflected in the fact that for 11 of these 40 elements there are two sets of experimental results that have been selected as the best values by different compilers in three other cases there are substantial differences in the experimental results at the higher temperatures but the curves Converge on the same value of the zero resistivity temperature in a situation where uncertainties of this magnitude are prevalent it can hardly be expected that there will be anywhere near a complete agreement between the theoretical and experimental values nevertheless if we take the closer of the two best experimental results in the 11 two value cases the theoretical and experimental values agree within 4 degrees in 26 of the 40 elements almost 2/3 of the total The Rare Earth elements were not included in this study because the resistances of these elements like so many of their other properties follow a pattern differing in some respects from that of most other elements including a transition to a new structural form at a relatively low temperature accompanied by a major decrease in the slope of the resistivity Curve because of this low temperature transition it is difficult to locate the 0 point temperature from the empirical data but in nine of the 13 elements of this group for which sufficient data are available to enable a an approximate identification of this temperature it appears to be between 10 and 20° Kelvin the theoretical range for these elements as indic indicated by the factors listed in table 22 is from 12 to 20° Kelvin here again then the measured resistivities of 2/3 of the elements are at least approximately in agreement with the theoretical values the existence of this amount of agreement in spite of all of the influences tending to generate discrep encies is about as good a confirmation of the validity of the theory as a general proposition as can be expected under the existing existing circumstances furthermore it is not unlikely that there are alternate resistance patterns that result in explainable deviations from the calculated values and some of the larger discrepancies may be thus accounted for when an investigation of broader scope is undertaken okay um now he goes into table 24 which is a temperatures of zero resistance um so I guess this is the temperature at which um superc conductivity ensues or not exactly sure um um but he&#x27;s uh he&#x27;s doing the same thing that he was doing in chapter 7 this is a table from chapter 7 and he shows the uh rotational factors of each each atom and then the um calculated and [Music] observed um temperatures of zero resistance and as he said uh looks like most of the values are quite close to where they um are supposed to be but there are quite a few exceptions and some of them are kind of glaring uh here he predicts for indium that the temperature would be 48° and the actual result is 19° um he&#x27;s off by uh again not necessarily off because it could be the it could be the empirical results that are off so it&#x27;s hard to say but uh anyway we will uh examine this table a little bit more in tomorrow&#x27;s episode and then we&#x27;ll move on to the next part of this chapter um again if you are confused you need to watch one of my first uh 474 videos on this subject to get uh yourself up to speed on the reciproc system uh because in future videos we&#x27;re not going to be going over it we&#x27;re just going to be getting right into the content okay thanks for tuning in and have a great</p>
