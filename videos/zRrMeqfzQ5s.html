            <p>all right everyone hello and welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel and we take a look at different theories of everything go deep into them and um you know explore all their ins and outs so you can uh appraise them and figure out if they can help you with your Paradigm shifting and your Awakening to 5D Consciousness your formation of a holistic worldview and today is our 497th video on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson and in 1959 Mr Larson proposed his two fundamental postulates about um how he believed that the Universe operated and then um through a process of deduction he arrived at a theoretical universe so this is a theoretical Universe what the universe would look like if his postulates were correct taking his postulates and carrying out their ramifications to get to a theoretical universe and then in many of his books he Compares his theoretical Universe with the uh so-called uh actual measured empirical universe of the Legacy scientists that they have uh compiled in all their scientific tables through laboratory and Observatory experiments and um we&#x27;re looking at one of his books that does that called basic properties of matter it&#x27;s on um chemistry many of the basic properties of matter Larson arrives at equations for them such as the melting point or the compressibility and then he uh plugs all the atoms all the elements and the many compounds into his formulas and arrives at values for these basic properties and then Compares them with the scientific tables uh we are in the middle of chapter 15 of this book toward the end um which is called electrical storage now Mr Larsson has some problems here with this chapter um now uh if you understand the reciprocal system then you understand that for each uh scientific entity scientific quantity such as matter energy force pressure um they can all be described uh in units that are um exclusively space or time basically uh a fraction with space or time as the as the numerator and time or space as the denominator such as um motion uh well such as speed speed is um you know the runner is running at 10 miles hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time space over time that&#x27;s speed uh but all scientific quanti these have those units are units such like uh like matter matter is time to the third power over space to the third power and in this case uh we&#x27;re talking about capacitance electrical capacitance and uh Larson arrives at uh the units of s for the [Music] farad uh but some of his associates have proposed using the unit of s the3 power over T instead and it appears as if they are correct and uh when you read this chapter with that in mind um some of Larson&#x27;s uh uh some of the things he says ring a little bit Hollow um and it seems as if he&#x27;s uh um kind of U contorting logic a little bit in order to fit his um units which work some of the time but not all of the time and uh he has to kind of contort a little bit in order to make them work uh to his um to his satisfaction uh in every case now uh we&#x27;ll continue to go over that let me just uh say that uh if you want to get a a more thorough rundown of the reciprocal system uh me to go into the postulates in a little bit of detail and um discuss some of the ramifications and and you know just the workings of the reciprocal system then you want to watch one of my first 474 videos on this topic where I I take about 20 25 minutes to go over um how the reciprocal system operates in this this video I&#x27;m pretty much going to assume that you have some kind of working knowledge of the reciprocal system or that you are just an adventurer and you want to go into some something that you don&#x27;t really know that much about um but you probably better served in going over one of my old videos and then coming back and uh tuning in here uh I will tell you uh I will you know recite Larson&#x27;s two fundamental postulates as they are very short uh the first postulate which does most of the work the second postulate is more the conditions in uh which the work is being done so Larsson takes his first postulate which is really the original stuff that comes from Larson and then he plugs it into um kind of uh the scientific uh um you know consensus most scientists would agree with the second postulate although many of larsson&#x27;s followers do not and I don&#x27;t either um but I don&#x27;t even really think that that&#x27;s the most important thing with the second postulate because uh he&#x27;s just he&#x27;s really just trying to establish some kind of consensus with the second postulate along with um you know some working model um and I I think Larson was aware of kind of the limitations of the second postulate but recognize that um you know this is this is kind of good enough for right now um the first postulate is that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so there&#x27;s really four prongs to that first postulate the universe is made out of motion not matter not energy not force but motion and in particular Larsson is talking about what he calls scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction uh you can Envision scalar motion using a balloon that you put dots on if you blow up the balloon all the dots will be moving away from each other if you contract the balloon all the dots will be moving toward each other but they won&#x27;t be moving in any particular direction every dot will be moving in every uh will be moving toward or away from every other dot the outward motion of that balloon Larson refer refers to as the progression the inward motion uh he refers to as gravitation and those are really the two basic uh forces or you know um in the reciprocal system the force of the progression um basically is the source of everything in the universe and that source is manifested by turning that outward motion of the balloon into an inward motion uh gravitation which is inherent in all matter all manifestation and uh then so that&#x27;s the first prong second prong is that motion is the relationship between space and time space and time having no other significance other than what they uh are together in motion um so no independent existence of space and time only together in motion and uh motion is basically a fraction with space or time is the numerator and time or space is the the denominator motion space and time come in three dimensions um you can think of three-dimensional space and threedimensional time uh what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time but then there&#x27;s also three-dimensional motion which goes beyond those because uh it requires three dimensions of space just to Define one dimension of motion so those three dimensions of motion go beyond coordinate space and time um and I would uh argue also then beyond ukian space and time and uh which kind of uh throws some cold water on the second postulate which we&#x27;ll get to in just a second the uh so space time and motion come in three dimensions space time and motion come in only discrete units you have to have a full unit of space before you have space you have to have a full unit of time before you have time one unit of space is approximately 2 millions of an inch one unit of time is approximately uh 1.5 uh fto seconds or 1.5 * 10 - 16 seconds and um that&#x27;s a very short amount of time and if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you uh pretty much are working in the other quantity and so you use the reciprocal like that so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space if two particles approach each other to one unit of space they can&#x27;t get any closer because there is no such thing as less less than one unit of space so instead they move further apart in time not in space there is no space there&#x27;s only one unit of space so they&#x27;re they can&#x27;t get any closer but they can get further apart in time which is the equivalent of getting closer in space because of the reciprocal postulate between space and time so that gives you a little bit of a clue how this works and um hopefully some uh of the details will be fleshed out here as we finish this chapter I think we left off uh where Larson is discussing um let&#x27;s see uh collisions do not transform accelerated motion into steady flow if they are elastic as the collisions of electrons presumably are the acceleration in the direction of the voltage gradient is simply transferred to other electrons um if the force EQ um and this is part of Larson&#x27;s uh contortions is he&#x27;s using a lowercase q and an uppercase q to describe cooms one of wh one of the kums has uh S as its unit and the other has uh t/s as the units which are uh for Larson uncharged and charged electrons in larsson&#x27;s World there is an uncharged electron uh in its natural state um that is just a rotating unit of space but a an uncharged electron can take a charge which is not an electron it is a rotational vibration a kind of of motion just like everything else is a kind of motion so a charge is a rotational vibration and it can it can go onto an electron but it also can go onto an atom or sub subatomic particle so the charge on a subatomic particle or an atom is not an electron it is a rotational vibration and here he&#x27;s using EQ e is the electric field intensity I believe and then Q is the quantity um so he says if the force EQ actually existed as a as present day electrical Theory contends it would result in accelerating the average electron the authors quoted in this reference evidently recognize this point but they they fall back on the prevailing confidence that something will intervene to save the moving charge theory of the electric current and that&#x27;s the electron that&#x27;s the uncharged electron for Larson is the electric current electric current is uncharged static electricity is charged so the theory of the electric current from its multiplicity of problems there must be other forces end quote or quote uh that take care of the discrepancy no one wants to face the fact that a direct contradiction of this kind invalidates the moving charge Theory and the truth is that this concept of an electrostatic force EQ lowercase Q applied to the electron mass is one of the fundamental errors introduced into electrical Theory by the assumption that the electric current is a motion of electric charges as the authors quoted above bring out in the derivation of their electric current equation such a force would produce an accelerating rate of current flow conflicting with the observations in the universe of motion the moving electrons that constitute the electric current are uncharged and massless the mass that is involved in the current flow is not a property of the electrons which are merely rotating units of space it is a property of the matter of the conductor instead of an electrostatic force t s^2 applied to a mass t3r s 3r producing an acceleration s/ t^2 what actually exists is a mechanical force voltage t/ s^2 applied to a mass per unit of time a resistance T ^2 s 3r producing a steady flow on electric current um current being s overt uh the uh electric electron quantity over time and that is t/ s^ stimes uh divided by resistance furthermore it is observed that the conductors are electrically neutral even when a current is Flowing the explanation given for this in present day electrical theory is that the negative charges which are assumed to exist on the electrons are neutralized by equivalent positive I&#x27;m sorry is that the negative asterisk charges which are assumed to exist on the electrons are neutralized by the equivalent positive asterisk charges on the atomic nuclei and Larson uses these asteris because he&#x27;s using the conventional terminology negative and positive here but the way Larsen works it out it would be the opposite positive would be negative and negative would be positive but for the purposes of uh staying in somewhat in convention he uh uses the asteris but if the hypothetical electrost and this kind of just gives you the uh you know just shows you how difficult it is to come up with a Theory of Everything um a generalized theory that you can apply to every subject you have to deal with nomenclature in every field and you have to come up with new terminology and sometimes that you know you have to experiment with that stuff you know some some names work out better than other names and you know Larson did run into a lot of difficulty with just the uh terminology that he uses and you know you can&#x27;t really blame him for it you got to call it something but some but sometimes um when you&#x27;re dealing with the past and maybe they called something uh something and it&#x27;s not in harmony with what you C with what you with the concept that is behind what you&#x27;re doing uh it&#x27;s difficult to fit in um a a non clumsy type of nomenclature uh but if the hypothetical electrostatic charges are neutralized so that no net charge exists there is no electrostatic force to produce the movement that constitutes the current thus even on the basis of electrical or conventional physical Theory there is abundant evidence to show that the moving electrons do not carry charges the identification of the electric current phenomena with the mechanical aspects of electricity that we deriv from the theory of the universe of motion now provides a complete and consistent explanation of these phenomena without recourse to the hypothesis of moving charged electrons as noted in Chapter 13 charged electrons are subject to the same forces that apply to their uncharged counterparts as well as to those specifically appertaining to the charges it would therefore be theor thetically possible to apply a voltage and store these charged electrons in capacitors in the same manner as the uncharged electrons in practice however the storage of of charged electrons is accomplished in a totally different manner a widely used electrostatic device is the Vander generator in this generator charged electrons are produced and sprayed onto a moving belt of insulating material the belt carries them to a storage unit in the form of Large Hollow Metal sphere the electrons pass from the belt into the sphere gradually building up a potential that may reach as high as several million volts in our examination of electric current phenomena in the preceding chapters we found that the electrons which constitute the current move from the regions of higher voltage or greater concentration or higher speed of the electrons to regions of lower voltage in the vandag graph generator electrons of very low electrostatic potential on the Belt pass into a container in which the potential may be in the million Volt range obviously we are dealing with two different things both having the dimensions of force and and both customarily measured in volts but physically unlike in some important aspects it should now be evident why the term potential was not used in the preceding pages in connection with the capacitor storage or other electric current phenomena the the property of the electric current that we are calling voltage is the mechanical force of the current a force that acts in the same manner as the force responsible for the pressure exerted by a gas electrostatic potential on the other hand is the radial force of the charges which decreases rapidly with the distance the potential of a Charged electron in volts is very large compared to the contribution of the translational motion of that electron to the voltage it follows that even where the potential is in the million Volt range the electron concentration in the storage sphere and the corresponding voltage may be low in that event the small buildup of the voltage in the electrode at the end of the belt is enough to push the charged electrons into the storage sphere regardless of the high electrostatic potential many present day investigators realize that they cannot account for electric currents by means of electrostatic forces alone Duffin for instance tells us that quote in order to produce a steady current there must be for at least part of the circuit nonelectrostatic forces acting on the carriers of charge end quote his recognition that these forces act on the carrier of charge the electrons rather than on the charges is particularly significant as this means that neither the forces nor the objects on which they act are electrostatic Duffin identifies the nonelectrostatic forces as being derived quote from electromagnetic induction or nonhomogeneities such as bound iies between dissimilar materials or temperature gradients end quote since the electric currents available to both the investigators and the general public are produced either by electromagnetic induction or by processes of the second non electrostatic category mentioned by Duffin batteries Etc the non-electrostatic forces that admittedly must exist are adequate to account for the current phenomena as a whole and there is no need to introduce the hypothetical electrostatic charge and force we have already seen that the charge does not enter into the mathematics of the current flow and storage processes now we find that it has no place in the qualitative explanation of current current flow either addition of these further items of physical and mathematical evidence to those discussed earlier now provides conclusive proof that the mathematical structure of theory dealing with the storage of electric current is not a representation of physical reality this is not an isolated case as pointed out in Chapter 13 the conditions under which scientific investigation is conducted have had the effect of directing the investigation into mathematical channels and the results that have been attained are almost entirely mathematical as expressed by Richard feinan quote every one of our laws is a purely mathematical statement in rather complex and abstruse Mathematics end quote the development of this mathematical structure structure of theory is an outstanding achievement and it has had very important even spectacular practical results however these successes have fostered a tendency to forget that mathematics is not physics it is a useful perhaps indispensable tool for the physicist but physical phenomena are subject to a multitude of limitations that do not apply to the mathematics that are are utilized to represent these phenomena and consequently are not recognized unless they are identified physically the mathematical representation of space for example can be curved or otherwise modified but this does not in any way assure us that physical space can be so modified that question can be settled only by means of of a purely physical investigation such as the one reported in this work which finds that such modification of extension space is impossible and that is the end of this chapter on electrical storage uh chapter 16 the next one is called induction of charges and uh we will begin that chapter starting tomorrow uh now I just wanted to uh make a quick Point here which I make in many videos but um we&#x27;re not really studying uh chemistry charges and um magnetism and all of this stuff for the s for the for its own sake um I mean maybe some of you uh are maybe some of you want to invent new devices that uh create free energy or something um but the reason why we want to study uh Larson on chemistry is because Larson&#x27;s theory is a general theory it&#x27;s a system of theory and so you can plug it into any subject so we&#x27;re just trying to get a feel for how he plugs it into chemistry and then we want to you know take a look at how he plugs it into economics see how he plugs it into physics see how he plugs it into astronomy see how he plugs it into religion you know see how he plugs it into dream interpretation because he has written on all those subjects and then you know by getting that kind of broad cover we can get a sense of how the reciprocal system works and its potential and how we can plug it into whatever subject we want you know we can plug it into underwater basket weaving or you can plug it into nutrition you can plug it into um you know um physiology or biology or whatever subject you you&#x27;re interested in the reciprocal system uh will deliver but you have to understand its basic um you know the basic postulates and then how to employ those postulates in a field uh and so that&#x27;s why we take a close look at how Larsson does it and Larson admitted that he was subject to error he believed that his theory itself was correct but whether he applied it correctly in every instance was another matter and that he was subject to error and that he would uh he was welcoming of people coming along in the future and poking holes in his application of his theory because that would move the theory along and that sometimes it just does take the test of time where you know your interpretation of his uh of his postulates and plugging it in um if it doesn&#x27;t hold up then you know he wants it to be replaced and so you know this is all in the spirit of Mr lson himself you know to try to um you know figure out if he if he applied it correctly in certain situations in particular um Larson&#x27;s uh one of his the weaknesses of his theory in my opinion is the um electricity uh stuff in particular so um but Co not coincidentally that is also my weakest field of understanding Larson is the electricity stuff so um you know we&#x27;re all kind of in the dark here a little bit together but that&#x27;s the nature of dealing with um you know esoterica you have to be able to accept the fact that uh there&#x27;s a big mystery and and that there&#x27;s a big learning curve and but the rewards are great uh if you actually you know make progress and have epiphanies and um you know uh be able to apply them into other areas okay well thank you for tuning in today and uh we&#x27;ll be back tomorrow for chapter 16 on induction of charges have a great</p>
