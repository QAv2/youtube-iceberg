            <p>hey Dad what&#x27;s going on with the panel in there so we just put in a 400 amp panel and we ran parallels okay so first off we just put this disconnect up so what we did was we put the plywood behind it and what we&#x27;ve got here is parallel three ODS okay okay and that is uh rated for 400 amp I&#x27;ve got two inputs and two outputs so when you do parallels you have to make sure that your equipment grounding conductor meets the over current protection device right in this case it&#x27;s number two wire Brown orange yellow boy is the standard the industry standard for 480 volt 277 480 volt now a lot of times the neutral if there is one and there isn&#x27;t in this case will be gray so it&#x27;s gray for the neutral and brown orange yellow 400 amp 600 volt okay Believe It or Not 600 volt is still considered low voltage thank you thanks for the knowledge</p>
