            <p>[Applause] hey what&#x27;s up everybody I&#x27;m Dr Bob the mascot of cold fusion in today&#x27;s video we will take a look at some of my favorite cold fusion devices number one the Mizuno cells these devices are popular among amateur researchers and universities the cells are commonly referred to as Mayo Fusion because humans making them often utilize a mayonnaise jar AS the containment V vessel while it can be hard to measure excess heat with the basic Muno cell looking for transmutations is not the parts are easily accessible and cheap but be careful handled the wrong way these toys can be quite dangerous to play with number two Dennis Craven brass spheres these balls were demonstrated during a tech Event in Austin Texas 2013 together with Engineers from National instruments one of the best measuring companies in the world the demonstration was fairly simple two brass balls rested in a bath of aluminum Pebbles heated to 80° C the ball that contained the active cold fusion powder maintained a higher temperature throughout the whole event since then no other team in Cold Fusion has come even remotely close to showing off anything nearly as sophisticated many people ask me for the recipe so here it is the active powder consists of 10 nanometer big grains of Palladium and gold powder within chunks of carbon and a few sprinkles of magnesium and hydrogen storage powder the active spheres also contain dyum gas and operates under two bars of pressure number three the ecat Bing number four the salani cell duplicated in several Laboratories all over the world the salani cell was the first generation gas- loaded devices to go mainstream these devices are quite easy to build and use hydrogen gas and nickel wires as fuel if you ask nicely salani might send you some active wires although the salani cells typically operate very low energy and efficiency the idea is to have them scaled up number five dog bones dog bone technology went viral last year after an international group of scientists had tested a dog bone during 32 days in a laboratory in Switzerland and the test report leaked out on the internet using only 1 gram of fuel the dog bone produced as much clean energy as if it had burned 50 gallons of dirty gasoline just as in the sci-fi movie chain reaction from 1996 featuring keano Reed harmonics play an important role in dog bone experiments however instead of using musical instruments like keano Reeves did scientists are using a device called a thy restore being cheap to produce and efficient enough for pretty much any commercial applications the dog bone has great potential the claims of excess heat production in these devices is now being researched all over the world remember the results could be positive but they also could be negative number six bruan technology IES bruan energy has worked with cold fusion for 10 years and have two systems under development one low temperature wet reactor and one high temperature gas reactor according to Stanford Research Institute who has studied many cold fusion devices brillan have a great chance to make it to the market soon with a bit of tweaking here and there the most powerful brillan technology relies on something called Q pulses they are high power electromagnetic pulses that functions as an onoff mechanism for the reaction the ability to turn the reactions on and off at will is an important advantage of Bran&#x27;s lenr technology over others so how does it work the CU pulse allows some of the hydrogen atoms to turn into neutrons the tiny difference in weight between a hydrogen atom and a neutron is provided by the effects of the CU pulse brillan is then able to add the newly formed neutrons to other hydrogen atoms each Neutron added to a hydrogen atom releases some binding energy according to eal mc² when a hydrogen atom is accumulated three neutrons it becomes unstable and decays to form helium 4 and this low energy nuclear reaction generates even more energy number seven the golden tea kettle the golden tea kettle has never been demonstrated publicly yet this one-of-a-kind gold infused prototype was specifically designed to boil water for making tea that&#x27;s a statement if you could build a cold fusion reactor how would it look and what would it do please answer with a comment below that&#x27;s all for this time please don&#x27;t forget to like share and subscribe see you soon [Music] bye-bye I&#x27;m [Music] everywhere</p>
