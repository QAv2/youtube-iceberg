            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>July 2001. NSA headquarters, Fort Me, Maryland. An analyst stares at his screen watching someone silently move through the most classified networks in American intelligence. Not breaking through firewalls, not triggering alarms, just walking through open doors like he belongs there. The NSA calls the FBI.</p>
<p>The FBI calls Scotland Yard. Scotland Yard calls Interpol. Three of the world&#x27;s most powerful intelligence agencies coordinating in real time against a single intruder. They trace the connection. It leads to a bedroom in a small apartment in North London.</p>
<p>The hacker is a 35-year-old unemployed man named Gary McKinnon sitting in a computer chair eating a sandwich. He&#x27;s been inside US military and NASA networks for almost 2 years. He hasn&#x27;t stolen money. He hasn&#x27;t sold secrets. He says he was looking for evidence of UFOs.</p>
<p>How does one man with a dial-up connection embarrass three intelligence agencies simultaneously? And why does his case become the most controversial extradition battle in British history? Gary McKinnon is born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1966 and grows up quietly in North London. He&#x27;s not a prodigy in the Hollywood sense. No early programming competitions, no Silicon Valley internships, no dramatic origin story. He&#x27;s a systems administrator who fixes computers for businesses, earns modest wages, and spends his evenings doing what millions of people do, reading things on the internet that most people dismiss as fringe. Specifically, Gary becomes obsessed with one question.</p>
<p>Is the United States government hiding evidence of extraterrestrial technology? This isn&#x27;t casual curiosity. Gary believes deeply that secret government programs have suppressed free energy technology derived from recovered alien spacecraft. He reads declassified documents, follows UFO researchers, and becomes convinced that the proof exists somewhere inside government computer systems, specifically NASA and the US military, filed away in databases the public will never access through official channels. By 1999, Gary decides to look for himself. What makes Gary dangerous isn&#x27;t technical brilliance in the way people imagine hackers.</p>
<p>He doesn&#x27;t write sophisticated zeroday exploits or develop custom malware. His method is embarrassingly simple. And that simplicity is exactly what makes it so devastating to the agencies he penetrates. Migari discovers that thousands of US military computers running Windows operating systems have been connected to the internet with absolutely no security precautions whatsoever. No passwords on administrator accounts, no firewall configurations, no intrusion detection.</p>
<p>The machines are simply sitting online fully accessible to anyone who tries the default settings. He uses a program called Remotely Anywhere, legitimate remote desktop software used by IT professionals worldwide to scan military IP address ranges looking for machines with blank administrator passwords. He finds hundreds, possibly thousands systems at the Army, Navy, Air Force, Department of Defense, and NASA that any person on Earth could access by simply typing the IP address and pressing enter. He he later describes the experience as walking into a house and finding every door not just unlocked but standing wide open. He enters through those open doors.</p>
<p>His searches are methodical but not sophisticated. He moves from system to system looking for folders with interesting names. He searches document databases for terms like free energy, anti-gravity, and non-aterrestrial officers, a phrase he finds in one spreadsheet that he interprets as evidence of a secret space program. He photographs his screen when he finds things that interest him. He leaves notes on some systems.</p>
<p>One message left on a US Army computer. Your security is crap. for almost two years. From February 2001 through March 2002, Gary does this from his aunt&#x27;s apartment in North London using a dialup internet connection. Mate, he hacks between 10:00 p.m.</p>
<p>and 6:00 a.m. UK time. Morning hours on the US East Coast when systems are quiet, nobody notices, nobody stops him, nobody even detects him for 20 months. This is where Gary&#x27;s story splits depending on who&#x27;s telling it. American prosecutors will later claim Gary caused $700,000 in damage, deleted critical files from military computers, and left US Army systems in the Washington DC district inoperable for 24 hours immediately after the September 11th attacks, a claim Gary consistently and furiously denies.</p>
<p>Gary&#x27;s version is different. He says he was a careful intruder who deliberately avoided disrupting systems, never deleted anything intentionally, and was motivated entirely by his search for suppressed technology. What both sides agree on is what Gary claims to have found. And this is the detail that makes his case genuinely strange. On a NASA computer at the Johnson Space Center, Gary says he accessed a database containing highresolution photographs of what appeared to be structured craft of nonhuman origin.</p>
<p>The images were being processed, certain features being airbrushed out before public release. He was viewing them through a slow dialup connection when the system remotely disconnected him before he could save copies. on US military systems. Gary says he found a spreadsheet listing names under the heading non-terrestrial officers with ship names that don&#x27;t correspond to any vessel in official Navy records. His interpretation, a secret space program operating outside public knowledge.</p>
<p>He also found what he describes as evidence of free energy technology, references to systems that shouldn&#x27;t exist according to publicly known physics. Did Gary actually find any of this? The US government has never directly addressed his specific claims about what he saw. They prosecuted him for unauthorized access and damage, not for revealing classified information. This silence, neither confirming nor debunking the specific content, is something Gary&#x27;s supporters find significant. The actual technical damage Gary caused is disputed, but likely real in some form.</p>
<p>Remote desktop sessions on military computers in 2001 and 2002 were operating on hardware with limited memory and processing power. Multiple simultaneous remote sessions could genuinely slow or crash systems. Whether Gary deliberately caused damage or accidentally destabilized systems he was moving through depends entirely on whose account you believe. What&#x27;s not disputed is the scope. Gary accessed 97 individual systems across US military and NASA networks.</p>
<p>The Army, Navy, Air Force, Department of Defense, and NASA all confirmed his intrusions. The investigation that eventually caught him involved the FBI&#x27;s National Infrastructure Protection Center, military intelligence personnel, and British authorities working in coordination. A response scale typically reserved for state sponsored attacks. The man who triggered this response is eating sandwiches and reading UFO forums in North London on a dialup connection. For almost 2 years, Gary moves through American military networks without detection.</p>
<p>Then he makes the mistake that every careful intruder eventually makes. He gets comfortable. The specific error is timing. Gary is meticulous about operating during US morning hours when network activity is low and administrators are less likely to notice unusual sessions. But in early 2002, he starts hacking at different hours, UK evenings, US afternoons when system administrators are active and monitoring.</p>
<p>On March 19th, 2002, a system administrator at a US military installation in New Jersey is conducting routine network maintenance when he notices an active remote session he didn&#x27;t initiate. He watches the session for several minutes, observing someone browsing through directories. He notes the incoming IP address and immediately contacts military security personnel. The IP traces back to a British internet service provider. British ISPs maintain subscriber records.</p>
<p>Within days, investigators have an address in North London. What happens next reveals something important about Gary&#x27;s character. British police contact him. They don&#x27;t immediately arrest him. British law at the time has limited computer crime provisions that make prosecution complicated for attacks on foreign systems.</p>
<p>Instead, they warn him. They tell him he&#x27;s been identified, that US authorities are investigating, and that he should stop. Gary stops hacking. He cooperates with the initial British investigation. He admits what he did without apparent understanding of how serious the American response will become.</p>
<p>The Americans response is serious. US prosecutors charge Gary with computer fraud under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. They announced they want him extradited to face trial in the United States. The indictment lists 97 counts of unauthorized computer access. Prosecutors seek the maximum sentence, potentially 70 years in American prison.</p>
<p>For a man who believes he was looking for UFO evidence on government computers. 70 years feels like a response calibrated to send a message rather than achieve proportional justice. Gary&#x27;s lawyers begin fighting extradition. What follows is the longest and most expensive extradition battle in British legal history. 10 years of courts, appeals, parliamentary debates, and ultimately a decision made by the British Home Secretary rather than the judiciary.</p>
<p>Gary&#x27;s defense evolves significantly during this decade. In 2008, he receives a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, a form of autism spectrum disorder affecting social interaction and communication. Medical experts argue his obsessive focus on UFO research and failure to understand the severity of what he was doing are directly connected to his neurological condition. They argue extradition to face decades in an American prison would constitute inhumane treatment for a man with his diagnosis. British public opinion swings dramatically in Gary&#x27;s favor.</p>
<p>He becomes a cause celeb, a vulnerable man being pursued by a superpower for what many Britain see as essentially harmless curiosity. The extradition fight runs from 2002 to 2012. 10 years. Multiple appeals courts. Two different British home secretaries making decisions about Gary&#x27;s fate.</p>
<p>Parliamentary debates. Celebrity supporters. A campaign that makes Gary McKinnon one of the most recognized names in British legal history. The legal argument against extradition runs on several tracks simultaneously. First, proportionality.</p>
<p>Gary&#x27;s lawyers argue the potential 70-year sentence is wildly disproportionate to the actual harm caused. British prosecutors had already indicated they could charge Gary domestically with offenses carrying a maximum 6-month sentence. The gap between 6 months in Britain and 70 years in America is the gap between accountability and destruction. Second, Gary&#x27;s Asperger&#x27;s diagnosis. Medical evidence presented to courts argues Gary&#x27;s mental health would deteriorate catastrophically in American prison conditions.</p>
<p>Experts warn of suicide risk. The European Convention on Human Rights prohibits extradition when there&#x27;s a real risk of treatment violating human dignity. Third, the political dimension. Gary&#x27;s supporters, who eventually include figures across the British political spectrum from rock musicians to members of parliament, argue the extradition treaty being used against Gary was designed for terrorism cases and was never intended to apply to individual computer crimes. The campaign generates genuine political pressure.</p>
<p>Multiple members of parliament raise Gary&#x27;s case in the House of Commons. His mother, Janice Sharp, campaigns relentlessly for years, becoming one of the most persistent and effective advocates in British legal history. In October 2012, Home Secretary Terresa May makes the final decision. He blocks Gary&#x27;s extradition on human rights grounds, specifically the risk to his mental health and life. It&#x27;s an extraordinary intervention.</p>
<p>a politician overriding an extradition treaty obligation to protect a British citizen from American prosecution. American officials are furious. The decision effectively ends the legal case. With extradition blocked and British prosecutors declining to pursue charges, Gary faces no criminal trial anywhere. He walks free, never tried, never convicted.</p>
<p>The man who penetrated 97 US military and NASA systems serves no prison time. The case fundamentally changes how British courts and politicians view the extradition treaty with the United States. Subsequent cases are handled with significantly more scrutiny of proportionality. Gary McKinnon&#x27;s decadel long fight creates legal precedent that protects other British citizens from disproportionate American prosecution. strip away the UFO element, which makes Gary easy to dismiss as a crank.</p>
<p>And his case exposes something genuinely alarming about American military cyber security in 2001. 97 military and NASA systems accessible with no passwords using default administrator credentials that any IT professional knows to check first. Connected to the public internet with no meaningful security configuration. This isn&#x27;t a sophisticated state sponsored attack exposing deep architectural vulnerabilities. This is a man with a dialup connection finding doors that were left open.</p>
<p>The embarrassment isn&#x27;t that Gary was skilled enough to break in. The embarrassment is that breaking in required almost no skill at all. American military and government networks in 2001 had been connected to the internet rapidly without corresponding security infrastructure. The assumption was that obscurity provided protection, that military IP addresses wouldn&#x27;t be targeted because attackers wouldn&#x27;t know to look there. Gary demonstrated that assumption was catastrophically wrong.</p>
<p>If he found hundreds of unsecured systems while looking for UFO photographs, state sponsored intelligence agencies with actual resources and actual objectives had presumably found the same doors years earlier. The $700,000 damage figure American prosecutors cited, disputed by Gary, questioned by independent experts, may be less significant than what the intrusions revealed about systemic negligence. E addressing the actual security failures Gary exposed would cost far more than any prosecution of Gary himself. After his case concludes, Gary lives quietly in North London. He&#x27;s given interviews over the years, consistently maintaining that he found genuine evidence of suppressed technology and a secret space program.</p>
<p>The US government has never specifically addressed his claims about what he viewed on NASA systems. Whether Gary McKinnon found evidence of extraterrestrial technology or was a vulnerable man with asberers who convinced himself that government folder names confirmed his beliefs. The question remains genuinely unresolved. What is resolved? One man with a sandwich and a dialup connection exposed the security failures of the world&#x27;s most powerful military for 20 months before anyone noticed. That part isn&#x27;t a theory.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s just what happened.</p>
