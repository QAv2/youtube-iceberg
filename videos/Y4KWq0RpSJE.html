            <p>okay welcome back to the M eg replication so in this video I&#x27;m going to go over some calculations and we&#x27;re gonna use the data from the last testing to calculate our input and output current so that we can calculate our power and empower out and I don&#x27;t want us know if we have a co P greater than 1.0 so on the left here you can see we have our transformer C core with the 100 turn input and 1500 turn output and the magnet stack in the middle we have some properties of the core these are given the area the mean magnetic path and the relative permeability from that we can calculate the reluctance and that&#x27;s basically like the resistance to magnetic flux and these are all just going to be a constants that we&#x27;re gonna use next we have to calculate the inductance of each coil so this is our equation L is gonna be equal to N squared over R so that&#x27;s just the number of turns squared over the reluctance and so we get two different numbers here one for the input coil and one for the output coil below this we have our equation that we use to calculate our flux that was generated by our input voltage and finally we&#x27;re going to calculate our current and miss equations used to calculate the current which is a number of turns times the flux divided by the inductance so for the two coils we have this equation in this equation which we basically use to calculate the power in empowerhouse so we got some really really interesting results if you look here on the right so if we were to operate this core below about three kilohertz it would have the normal properties of having a co P less than 1.0 which is what we would expect but as we raise the input frequency just above five here you can that the blue curve which is the output is increasing while the power n is you know slowly decreasing on this smooth curve here so from about this point right here we are getting more power out than m and it peaks at this frequency of eleven point eight kilohertz right here and then slowly drops back off so as if we were to operate above 16 kilohertz here it would continue to drop and we would have a co P a less than one point O so you can see that operating the transformer at the correct frequency is going to be key to get in an output greater than your input so I went ahead and graphed the co P versus frequency so you can see as we start with our low frequencies here it&#x27;s below 1.0 1.0 until we get to about 4 right here and then boom it&#x27;s above 1.0 all the way all the way until about eleven point eight and the co P is three point five so we are outputting more power than we are inputting and this is awesome so basically the only design thing left to do is to figure out how to feed back some of this power into the circuit and use it to self power so here you guys go it&#x27;s it&#x27;s happening and we have free energy happening thanks for watching check out the next video soon</p>
