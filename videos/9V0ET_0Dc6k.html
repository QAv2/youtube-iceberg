            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas and I do videos on educational topics today is video number 189 on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and Mr Larson&#x27;s theory is called the reciprocal system because there is a reciprocal relationship between space and time uh in Larson&#x27;s system the universe is made out of motion not matter not energy but motion and motion is the relationship between space and time so we have a universe composed of motion space and time are the constituents of that motion so normally we recognize space and time as kind of being like the container of the universe the universe is occurring in space or time but in Larson&#x27;s system space and time are actually the contents of the universe and they have a reciprocal relationship so space time sorry motion is the constituent of the universe and motion is a fraction where time and time or space is the numerator and space or time is the denominator uh it is a bit more complicated because space and time can be multi-dimensional three or more dimensions Larson calls this coordinate space which we recognize x y z coordinates and also coordinate time and which we don&#x27;t generally recognize and which has gotten me kicked out of physicist office for even suggesting it and um then there is also um the scalar aspect uh a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no Direction which you can Envision by taking a balloon putting dots on the balloon with a magic marker and blowing up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but in no particular direction um and that is what Larson calls clock time the progression of time time is always getting later and later and later but uh since the reciprocals have the same qualities there is also what you call clock space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and that is the progression of space now um there is one more thing that space and time have in common and that is the discrete unit postulate both time and space come in discrete units they are not continuous there is a minimum chunk of space and time even though those chunks are very very small they exist so there&#x27;s not a continuity but there is a discrete a discreetness about space and time and exactly one unit of space in one unit of time space over time which is speed the car is moving 20 miles per hour 20 miles of space in one hour of time but one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light uh and so that is really looking at really the origin of the universe or the midpoint or the null point or the what Larson calls the natural reference system or even The Ether of this universe is the speed of light moving outward in all directions scalarly and that there is half of the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light which we recognize as the material sector and this is where we make all our observations and measurements and this is where we have our three-dimensional space coordinate space accompanied by a one-dimensional scalar time the progression of time three dimensions of space one dimension of time in the material sector but in addition to that there is also a half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls this the cosmic sector and in the cosmic sector uh we have three-dimensional time three-dimensional time and one-dimensional scalar space or clock space so we have coordinate time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart you could also think of this as with the material sector as the universe of matter and the cosmic sector as the universe of anti-matter which isn&#x27;t exactly a reciprocal that&#x27;s more of a negative but uh it&#x27;s just with the terminology uh anti-matter maybe isn&#x27;t the right term um but it&#x27;s the one that the scientists use so this is B this would be what the scientists would determine as that maybe Larson would call it Larson did call it Cosmic matter but he&#x27;s referring to what the scientists call anti-matter okay now um what Larson did is he basically derived those relationships and then he created a theoretical Universe through a process of deduction so okay this is what we know is true if this is true then this is also true and then if that&#x27;s true then this is also true and so it&#x27;s a chain of deduction where he derives The General you know mechanics and physics of the Universe um and I went over that in about 15 videos earlier in the series it uh it was going over a paper that Larson gave called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so you might want to go back and look at the universe verse that he deduces a point by point and then he makes identifications the the the things that come out of his Universe he tries to figure out what those things are in the scientist Universe if anything um okay now uh today we are looking at his 1979 book that is called Nothing But motion and this has to do with physics Atomic physics in particular and um we are on chapter 13 which is on uh uh physical constants so these are constants uh like you know Avogadro&#x27;s number and other constants that uh have come up in science um Larson uh is pretty opposed to the whole notion he thinks that the constants they should all boil down to units of space and or units of time multiplied to the first second third or more dimensions and he was just going over this concept of secondary Mass which is a pretty difficult concept but we will start um we will start right there beginning his explanation because of this directional freedom in the time region now remember that the time region is the region inside a unit of space space and time are discrete they only come in discrete units and if your unit of space is this size really be like a sphere but if if the unit of space is this size there&#x27;s no space less than that once you get less than that you are in a realm of time and Larson refers to that as the time region and in on the other side of the universe in the cosmic sector there&#x27;s such a thing as the space region there&#x27;s always this reciprocal relationship what goes on in the material sector exactly the same thing is going on in the cosmic sector except that you&#x27;re reversing the roles of space and time okay so because of this directional freedom in the time region the secondary Mass may be either positive or negative furthermore the directions of the individual displacement units are independent of each other and the net total secondary mass of a complex atom may be relatively small because of the presence of nearly equal numbers of positive and secondary Mass components now remember that uh a direction in space is has no is is independent of a direction in time um so they are independent of each other the directions of motions in space and motions and time this directional variability introduces a number of complications into the secondary Mass pattern of the elements the complete pattern has not yet been identified but a substantial amount of information is now available with respect to the values applying to subatomic particles and the elements of low atomic number the magnitudes of the natural units applicable to physical quantities are independent of the sector or region of the universe in which the phenomena to which they relate are located as explained in chapter 12 however a only a fraction of any physical effect can be transmitted across a regional boundary and the measured value beyond that boundary is substantially less than the original unit that&#x27;s what Larson called the inter-regional ratio remember there&#x27;s four separate regions of this universe and in those four separate regions when you cross the border or when you measure across a border uh those the rules change across the borders and when you measure across a border you have to reduce the value because you&#x27;re not or you you would really in some cases even increase the value because you&#x27;re not seeing everything that&#x27;s actually there you&#x27;re only seeing a fraction of what&#x27;s there because uh it&#x27;s a scalar scalar motion again with this directional Independence and so you&#x27;re only able to see One Direction out of many okay um this is the principal reason for the great disparity between the magnitudes of the primary and secondary Mass a unit of mass in the region inside unit distance is inherently just as large as a unit of mass in the region outside unit distance but when both are measured in terms of their effect in the outside region the inside or secondary mass is reduced by the inter-regional ratio which in general is uh approximately 1 to 150. for a a full atom it&#x27;s 156.44 and for a uh sub atom it is 142.22 which he derived in the previous chapter if you want to go back uh in this chapter we are dealing with some very small quantities and for greater accuracy we will extend the previously calculated value of the inter-regional ratio to two more decimal places making it 156.4444 the reciprocal of this relation of this ratio is .00639205 is the fraction of the time region unit that is effective outside unit distance it is therefore the unit of secondary Mass applicable to the basic two-dimensional rotation of the atom or particle the unit of inertial mass is one such secondary unit plus one unit of primary mass or a total of 1.00639205 an analysis of the secondary Mass relations enables us to compute the mass of each of the subatomic particles a magnitude that is of Interest not only as one more item of information about the physical universe but also because of the light that it throws on the structure of the individual particle here we must take into account not only the two-dimensional component of the secondary Mass the magnetic component as we will call it following our usual terminology but also the other components that may be involved in the secondary Mass one of these is the component due to the electric rotation if any inasmuch as this electric rotation the rotation in the third dimension is not an independent motion but a reverse rotation of the pre-existing two-dimensional rotating system or systems it adds neither primary Mass nor the magnetic unit that is the principal component of the secondary Mass it contributes only the mass equivalent of a unit of one-dimensional rotation in this case the one over nine Factor representing the possible positions of the basic Photon applies directly against the basic 1 over 128 relation we then have for the unit of electric Mass one over nine times one over one Twenty Eight which equals 0.00086806 now he&#x27;s using the same factors that he used to uh to calculate the inter-regional ratio but with the inter-regional ratio he uses that one over 156 and then he multiplies that by 9 over 11. uh here he&#x27;s taking the uh 9 over 11 basically being uh 1 over 1 plus 2 9. here he&#x27;s taking that one-ninth or that ninth and he&#x27;s having to multiply it by this 128 and he does that I believe it&#x27;s because uh we&#x27;re not dealing with one of the two-dimensional rotating systems we&#x27;re dealing with just one because it&#x27;s a sub atom and we multiply them together instead of basically adding them um because they&#x27;re independent I believe uh in this case the one-ninth factor representing the possible positions of the photon applies directly against the basic one to 128 relation whereas when you&#x27;re calculating the inter-regional ratio you&#x27;re adding them uh anyway this value applies specifically where the motion around the electric axis is a rotation of a two-dimensional displacement distributed over all three dimensions as in a double rotating system where only one two-dimensional rotation is involved such as the sub atoms the electric mass is two-thirds of the full unit or 0.000578 7-0 which is two-thirds of that earlier number the .0086806 when two of the two-dimensional rotations four dimensions in all are Consolidated to form a double rotating system three dimensions the two zero point zero zero zero five seven eight seven zero mass units become one zero point zero zero zero eight six eight oh six units another secondary Mass component that may be present is the mass due to an electric charge like all other phenomena in a universe of motion a charge is a motion an additional motion of the atom or particle we are not ready to discuss charges in detail at this stage of the presentation so for the present we will merely note that on the basis of the restrictions on combinations of motions defined in chapter nine the charge as a motion of the rotating particle or atom must have a displacement opposite to that of the rotation in order to be stable this means that the motion that constitutes the charge is on the far side of another Regional boundary another unit level and it is subject to two successive inter-regional ratios or inter-regional transmission factors the relation between the time region and the third region in which the motion of the charge takes place is similar to that between the time region and the region outside unit space the inter-regional ratio is the same except that because the electric charge is one dimensional the factor one plus one-ninth has to be substituted for the factor one plus two-ninths that appears in the inter-regional ratio previously calculated this makes the inter-regional ratio applicable to the relation with the third region 128 times 10 over 9 equals 142.22 at the mass unit of charge is the reciprocal of the product of the two inter-regional ratios 156.444 at 142.222 and amounts to point a 0.0000494 [Music] the charge applicable to electrons and positrons deviates from this normal value because these particles have effective rotations in only one dimension leaving the other two Dimensions open in some way the exact nature of which is not yet clear the motion of the charge is able to take place in these two dimensions of the time region instead of in the normal manner since this is on the opposite side of the unit boundary the direction of the effect is reversed making the mass increment due to the charge negative as well as reducing its magnitude by one-third the effective mass of a charge applied to an electron or positron is therefore two-thirds negative two-thirds times 0.0004494 equals negative 0.00002996 two-thirds of that first number we may now apply the calculated values of the several Mass components as given in the foregoing paragraphs to a determination of the masses of the subatomic particles described in chapter 11. for convenience these values will be recapitulated as follows okay so he&#x27;s going to go over that and we will go over that tomorrow when we resume but basically in these in this episode he basically derived the um mass units for all of the um subatomic particles and he&#x27;s going to use all those various numbers to apply them to these various particles so we&#x27;ll be doing that tomorrow otherwise have a great day and thanks for tuning in</p>
