access 24 7 anywhere in the world and you just can&#x27;t beat that so again don&#x27;t forget to come to the conference and don&#x27;t forget to get signed up for the YouTube and now without further Ado I&#x27;m going to introduce a Russell Anderson and he&#x27;ll be uh talking tonight about uh the extreme um the TT Brown and so I work on board uh Russell glad to have you back you&#x27;ve been here a couple of times I think uh yeah yeah I believe I have yeah this must be my third time yeah no no Steve&#x27;s place and then uh not to mention at the conference you know yeah well conference I was there uh my first time uh lecturing I guess uh back in 1990 in the poster room on the very same things we&#x27;re going to be talking about and that I have spoken about and demonstrated uh the tech uh many times at the conferences and it&#x27;s just every time I see it I&#x27;ve been working with it I built my first TT Browns flying saucers back in uh end of January of 1990 and every time I see him work or every time I see my Annie grabs fly I just uh the B Phil Brown effect the t-towns and brown patents I just it&#x27;s just like magic it&#x27;s The Wonder of science the Wonder it&#x27;s like uh What uh President John F Kennedy said let both sides explore the wonders of Science and not the terrorists of science well without further Ado I&#x27;m going to go ahead and uh let you take it from here and uh and I introduce us to the wonderful world TT Brown yeah well Thomas Townsend Brown was a American scientist physicist and he spoke about electric gravitics he coined the term electrogravitics which is a transduction or coupling of electricity and gravity specifically electrostatics uh pure potential if you can get it just electrostatic charge that is not moving across the surface although it can move across the surface until the entire surface carries an equal charge and uh that uh Coulomb&#x27;s force is used in capacitor configurations just as the the coil is used in magnetic coil configurations to transduce electronic uh electronic magnetism basically electromagnetism uh the capacitor in induces gravitation the third uh of the four fundamental forces in the form of a capacitor or Coulomb&#x27;s forces that are really the same thing as gravitational force although gravitational force electrostatically produced is many orders of magnitude stronger than the mass gravity of a planet or a star so uh anyway uh I basically got interested in electrics back in the mid 1980s I came across a book by uh well actually no it was earlier than that uh my mother gave me a book uh because she knew I had the interest in UFOs and how they could possibly fly without any means of visible support and no uh control services no heat energy and she gave me this book called uh how to build a flying saucer and other proposals and speculative engineering and I thought my gosh you know this is uh right up my alley if I ever saw anything and I looked at it and it was right in there a description of the beef felt Brown effect which was a coupling of uh electromagnetism specifically electrostatics and gravity into a usable propulsion methodology now Thomas Townsend Brown always have been always had been interested as a boy in the possibilities of space travel and then uh you know disappointed by the obvious limitations of uh chemical rocketry and heat energy to produce propulsion uh certainly had its limitations in the exploring space but the electrogravity or electrical means or other force field methodologies do not suffer from that uh that detrimental effect of uh well say you&#x27;re in space after you discharge your fuel you know what are you going to do for more fuel more reaction Mass you only have a you know a flying fuel tank at which you&#x27;re sitting at the top of or on the side of and once that fuel is gone it&#x27;s gone you&#x27;re stranded in space unless you have some other way to eject reaction mass for Newtonian uh third law of motion type reaction action reaction well electrophobic goes beyond that there are no moving Parts there&#x27;s no fuel there&#x27;s none needed and Thomas Townsend Brown while playing around with Crooks x-ray tube he was thinking maybe the x-rays would provide some kind of force akin to a rocket Force he noticed that when he turned on the apparatus that powered the tube the whole thing seemed to want to move so he became intrigued by that and then he concluded correctly that it was the electrical force in a capacitor configuration in a device that was causing the motion in the first place and then if left free to swing it would move and uh you know with if enough charge was present it would certainly fly and uh fly in a v-toll vertical takeoff and Landing configuration which was desirable for you know many many reasons uh anyway I will get right to the slideshow what you see on this first Slide the title slide is one of his most famous applications of his electrogravidic effects and one that worked the best obviously a saucer at least one saucer or two saucers in a round robin configuration basically with a tower and rotor apparatus which I replicated back in the late 90s and then got working with electrostatic propulsion electrostatic generator that I built anyway you can see that these are basically flying saucers what we call flying saucers or flying discs or what people have been reported seeing in great numbers since uh just uh after World War II they had been observed in great numbers since the late 1890s in cigar shapes and some saucer shapes and some spheroid shapes since the early 1900s or late late 18 late 19th century which was incredible they had a great Airship flap in the late 1890s and these things were silenced they sometimes had powerful searchlights and they looked like dirigibles it&#x27;s very interesting somebody was either on Earth or off from off the Earth was testing this technology in full view of the people of America and Europe and South America Canada all of the whole world one of the most striking things about the UFO phenomenon is that it&#x27;s a global phenomenon and they tend to congregate around certain areas and uh I may or may not get into that later but uh you know it&#x27;s really interesting that uh whoever is flying these UFOs including us takes an interest in uh our technology especially the technology we we had intended to use for self-destruction but anyway this technology cannot be used for self-destruction and must only be used for good purposes to help us get rid of fossil fuels and nuclear fuels and help us get off the planet so the planet can renew and colonize other places in space because we know of a lot of planets now but well over five thousand anyway here we go oh uh one minor thing well a major thing the forward wire and the that forward conductor that Arc that&#x27;s about uh a little over one third of the front of the saucer in the direction of motion that is charged positively and the rest of the saucer is charged natively which is the same thing as chassis ground or Earth ground and that&#x27;s how you get your motion the negative charges are always attracted more strongly toward the positive charges that&#x27;s the nature of electrodynamics and it&#x27;s part of Paul uh a levile it&#x27;s model G I highly recommend you look at his books uh look at uh well we&#x27;ll talk about his books a little bit later anyway we&#x27;ll go to the next slide Opposites Attract so these electrodes this forward wire or tube is conductive these little triangular shaped items there are insulators dielectrics and the disc is negatively charged or chassis ground so of course the disc having more affinity for the positive charge which is the area of highest electrical potential anyway that just flies around the maypole because it&#x27;s held in a fixed relationship it can never reach that destination so that charge is transduced into an electrogravitational force in other words the vacuum or space is polarized polarized by using a high tension high voltage high tension electrical field and the uh the higher the intensity of the field the stronger is the G well in front of the disc with that positive charge and the stronger is the G Hill which the disc actually sits on and goes downhill on that and so there&#x27;s a strong downward Hill Force which we normally call gravity which is a pull or push because all forces act in pairs the pole and a push from space toward the center of mass or center of gravity of a body now here&#x27;s Thomas Townsend Brown this photo right here showing one of his discs flying around that may pull apparatus he&#x27;s operating a high voltage generator setup a positive ion generator basically you want to have a positive ion generator not negative ion generator positive ion generator that works the best you want a strong G Hill or sorry G well below the saucer the G Hill but in front of the saucer in the direction of motion is the G well gravity well and the sauce arrives on the G Hill and is pulled alternately pulled and pushed by the G well Hill phenomenon like a wave a picture of three-dimensional wave in space and this thing just is a Wave Rider those discs are Wave Riders riding that wave of electrically modified space time into Infinity as long as the charge is maintained and the speeds are very very fast and because of the nature of the propulsion itself there is no inertia in other words if you were riding on board these things they could make instant starts stops right angle turns the disc and anything inside that field inside the disc you wouldn&#x27;t feel anything of it it&#x27;d just be like standing on the Earth inside the Earth&#x27;s gee well now slide three there&#x27;s Thomas Townsend Brown unpacking one of his saucers I believe this these photos this series of photos was taken in California Los Angeles in the early 1950s uh circa 1950 51. now notice on the right side that saucer that was the size I built that I flew in Reno Nevada in the year 2000 with the tower and rotor apparatus and discs I built notice these Plexiglas insulators and plexiglasses are really really really good insulator just like regular glass good dielectric notice these spheres these balls on the ends of each of those each end of the wire there that&#x27;s so you don&#x27;t get any arcing from The Wire the end of the wire to the disc if you get any arcing then the force is sorted out you don&#x27;t get any more gravitational force so if the device shorts out either on the wiring or the disk itself the gravitational force stops so you always want to have the disc nice and round and smooth and around its smooth ball here on the forward conductor you don&#x27;t even need a forward conductor you could Beam with microwaves a point in space with a microwave projector on this side of the disc and a microwave projector on this side of this or on the bottom of the disc and uh whoops didn&#x27;t want to do that and then uh have a point in space that&#x27;s electrified positively and of course the rest of the disk is negative or chassis ground so you don&#x27;t even need this forward conductor just make it Wireless and it should work even better and by the way in air there&#x27;s no drag there&#x27;s no air hitting a solid surface it&#x27;s just hitting a soft electrical field so there&#x27;s no sonic boom or skin Heating the air is just diverted Away by the force field very great method of propulsion yeah Los Angeles California 70 years ago actually this was 73 years ago it&#x27;s about 1950 going around the maypole in a vacuum there was no limit to the speed No Limit that they could see they had to shut it off and at that point that was 1955 Paris France in November of 1955 every intelligence and Military agency you can name met in lower Manhattan or some place in Manhattan may have been closer to Midtown Manhattan and they determined that uh this technology deserved their kind of attentions and it was no longer taught in the schools after 19 late 1955 early 56. and uh I&#x27;ve never seen a clear example of a cover-up except if you look at the works and writings of Nikola Tesla but uh things are becoming more open there&#x27;s a new glass notes than a new disclosure there&#x27;s a stiff new Breeze and it&#x27;s blowing the truth and it&#x27;s quite refreshing notice the angle this is at when it&#x27;s going around the maypole it&#x27;s uh one force that is left on this support pole is a centrifugal force in the cervical Force makes it want to go out if you have it so that they can&#x27;t move outward as they&#x27;re flying if they won&#x27;t fly as well and you need more power to feed in it&#x27;s one important item there now there&#x27;s the tower and rotor apparatus with the one meter diameter flying saucers that I built way back in uh the 90s and this is in the year 2000 June about 23rd or 24th about that in Reno Nevada Reno library downtown Reno Nevada and these are being powered with about 120 000 volts at some tens of microamps not a lot of electrical power at all but the force is so much more so that&#x27;s why these devices are over unity and they break cherished physical laws such as the conservation of energy law which says Energy may not be created or destroyed only converted only changed in form converted and formed and that&#x27;s what these do these take electrical energy and convert it into gravitational energy but the conversion of energy is so much more than you get with any other system known to our science this you get far more energy out in propulsion than you put in in wattage or calories is just incredible to see this inertia free no fuel no moving parts and no noise and that is one of the most striking characteristics of actual UFOs there is no sound whatsoever silent nights and days and uh yeah here I am a little thinner version of me from 23 years ago back in Reno Nevada in the year 2000 it&#x27;s my lab partner Dave it&#x27;s great friend since 1988. anyway uh yeah you can build these on your kitchen table and experiment and uh I get my uh lab equipment and high voltage generators as finished units and kits from uh God I&#x27;ve been getting them from information Unlimited in Amherst New Hampshire for the longest time since the 80s and there&#x27;s also a great store here in in Orlando downtown Orlando just on the outskirts of downtown Orlando called Skycraft and their logo is a flying disc flying craft Flying Saucer and they have all kind of surplus electronic you know you know what you name it they have it so uh all the electrical experimenters in Florida know where to go I think they also do a mail order yeah so just three foot diameter one meter uh I guess a little over one meter in diameter flying saucers and we got the equipment all this equipment the tower and rotor PVC pipe aluminum copper tube we got from Home Depot we used to joke that you can get all the equipment you need to build your own Starships at Home Depot what a great place yeah there it is just a flying capacitor the TT Brown electrokinetic apparatus so typical Flying Saucer double convex and the profile is circular that forward electrode could just be a thin stainless steel wire that&#x27;s all you need and charge positively there&#x27;s your high voltage unit right there out of the Left End there&#x27;s a positive polarity strong positive that&#x27;s why you need a strong Electrical uh positive electricity coming out of your Ion generator positive ion generator and then chassis ground goes to the rest of the disc the outer Hull because the charges naturally want to stay on the outside of an enclosed structure this is the profile that works the best think of the Terminus of a Tesla coil or a Van de Graaff type generator you want to maintain charge you want to hold on to charge with as little leakage as possible lost charge is lost propulsive Force and acceleration yeah a 2.3 billion dollar flying capacitor that&#x27;s the B2 Spirit stealth bomber notice that same strong positive charge on the Leading Edge the ship wants to fly towards the positive charge because that&#x27;s your gravity well the ship itself is sliding down a Gravity Hill that is because of the negative charge negative charges are repulsive positive charges are attractive that&#x27;s sub Quantum Kinetics I highly recommend you read subcontinent kinetics by Paul a leviolette and look at model G specifically and look at the formula in there that explains how you optimize these devices for minimum input now this is also t-towns and Brown&#x27;s famous flame jet generator patent positive charges are pumped to the outer shell of the Leading Edge then there&#x27;s a dielectric of depleted uranium you want something with a very high K Factor that&#x27;s a dielectric geranium uranium oxide is and that&#x27;s also a high mass as high mass as possible now which shot out the back of the engines and but goes into the engines is a highly negative charge so you get that all-important separation of charge that you need there&#x27;s your gravity well in front of the positive charge and your ship is sliding down that Gravity Hill now imagine this gravity well Hill phenomenon in three dimensions and that&#x27;s what it would look like without this right here it&#x27;s basically called the rubber sheet model and that helps you envision a gravity field in two Dimensions but of course gravity operates in three and four dimensions the force being time the intensity of gravity affects the flow of time where there&#x27;s hardly any gravity time flows much faster this is demonstrable improvable where there&#x27;s a very high gravitational potential gravity flows slower the higher the gravitation gravitational potential the slower time flows and that again is demonstrable and provable it&#x27;s called gravitational time dilation yeah there&#x27;s what it looks like and notice this Cloud effect of the condensation that is uh enhanced by electrics also the electromatic effect makes radar beams just slide around this flying device this flying capacitor without bouncing back with no Echo the radar can&#x27;t see it and neither can an adversary so this is used to Great effects nothing can touch this just like the song there are the intakes at the front out the back are shot the negative charges positive charges here and there&#x27;s enough separation of charge that you won&#x27;t get any arcing so very very high voltage into the megavolt range with this flame jet generator you can generate up to 15 million volts which is way more than enough you need to get a really good gravitational electrogravitational effect and here&#x27;s the next generation of that craft which was seen around many places in the world and it&#x27;s known as the Telos it&#x27;s a boomerang shape device certain configurations that work well with electrolytics saucer is one triangle is another Boomerang is yet another think of the stealth bomber as a boomerang type craft lots of advantages to electrolytics no Sonic Boom no skin Heating reduced or no radar signature at all there&#x27;s a cross section on top of the spirit bomber and the Telos Telos you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see it at night except for the lights on the bottom and those are plasma lights they&#x27;re not LEDs and they&#x27;re not incandescent which is interesting also these lights no matter what color they are and I&#x27;ve seen actual craft their craft look the same chroma and Spectra as laser lights very pure colors very pure Reds very pure monochromatic blue and monochromatic green it you know when you&#x27;re seeing something odd something not out of the ordinary and I&#x27;ve been looking at aircraft all my life and that&#x27;s a long time I highly recommend this book uh I know that Steve elswick has sold this book at the bookstore at the conferences held every summer every July or August and it&#x27;s August this year middle of August um at the bookstore TT Brown&#x27;s electric research and here&#x27;s the electrogritic apparatus on the cover and there he is in La sitting in the middle operating the generator it&#x27;s a vacuum chamber stuff vacuum chamber apparatus highly recommend you look at that and study that because that&#x27;ll help you in your research more than a lot of a lot of books that I&#x27;ve seen and but they&#x27;re all helpful they&#x27;re all helpful I highly recommend this one Paul A La Villa who I believe just died I hope I&#x27;m wrong but I think he died about a year and a half ago I saw him first in 1990 in Colorado Springs at the Tesla conference Tesla Tech Conference and his book secrets of anti-gravity propulsion delves deeply into the electromatic effect shows why it&#x27;s warp drive many times you know many times faster than the speed of light oh incidentally if you look online or have been online lately there are so many incredible discoveries coming out one of them is that they have actually made warp bubbles that are capable of going 10 times the speed of light in the laboratory and a team of physicists had was wasn&#x27;t even looking for now qbr type warp bubble but they inadvertently created one and create can create them at will in the laboratory and now they just can scale them up like anything else uh and uh we can start to study these things and uh the future is now what was science fiction is science fiction no longer but don&#x27;t forget this stuff came out a long time ago uh Germany under Nazism also did lecture about his work because they heard about t-towns and Brown&#x27;s work and uh got his patents for pennies on the dollar just like they got a hold of Robert goddard&#x27;s patents for pennies on the dollars and took that took both Technologies and ran with them of course the alternative science technology that doesn&#x27;t deal with explosions the heat energy really did a lot with this technology and uh there&#x27;s a lot of really interesting stuff look at electric gravity and uh it supports the phenomenon in general relativity believe it or not so the laws of physics as as taught are correct but what&#x27;s going on with these electrophobic devices and similar discoveries don&#x27;t forget the aforementioned warped warp bubble confirmation Discovery uh delve into a deeper understanding and elucidation of phenomena we see and observe in physics so uh physics is being Rewritten finally as we speak which is really exciting I thought I&#x27;d never lived to see that but it&#x27;s being done highly recommend these two books electric resistance by Tom valone and the second volume and of course there&#x27;s the electrical electrokinetic apparatus Thomas Townsend Brown holding one of his flying discs on the cover there&#x27;s the uh I believe that&#x27;s the alien reproduction vehicle which is really an earth reproduction vehicle because electrographics is an Earthly technology but once they started crashing after World War II we discovered that our initial research was correct it&#x27;s just they just use a little different material science than we do but they helped Advance our Material Science as well yeah there&#x27;s the device that I built back in the 90s and being demonstrated in Reno Nevada and of course you can make it levitate and do the anti-gravity vertical takeoff and take off and levitation and Landing thing uh if you just build it light enough then you don&#x27;t have to feed in an ungodly amount of power those are always losses from these sharp Corners you want everything as round and smooth as possible for this type of propulsion and I don&#x27;t know what that is now there&#x27;s your G well positive charge is right below your G well positive charges are attractive on matter there&#x27;s your G Hill negative charges are repulsive on matter so remember all forces act in pairs this thing wants to go in the direction of the positive charge and go it does yeah and there&#x27;s a rubber sheet model again with the alcubier warp drive metric which permits the existence of faster than light travel within the framework of general relativity just like the subtitle of that book there&#x27;s the alcubier warp drive metric there&#x27;s the equation right up at the top so the vacuum of space is being polarized with a high voltage charge and the higher the voltage the more the bending of space-time into a wave-like phenomenon just like you&#x27;re riding a wave of electrogravitational energy like you&#x27;re riding a surfboard at the beach and of course these waves can travel much much faster than light but you&#x27;re sitting right about in here in the eye of the hurricane you don&#x27;t feel any Force no G-Force and no inertia you switch polarity you&#x27;re instantly off in any direction you choose depending on where your positive charge is oriented there it is very simple clean no fuel no moving Parts no use of heat energy for propulsion in the atmosphere no use of aerodynamics think of this as Electro hydrodynamics there it is again yeah there&#x27;s uh what I call one of my beam shits and I I sell these as kits sold them for uh 21 years since uh 2002. just about 21 years on this one it&#x27;s a four foot diameter triangular model I used inefficient copper wire so the electrical requirements in terms of waters are a little bit more later on I switched to stainless steel wire and got the same effect with much less power input so it was a rise in efficiency also wrote a paper on it with my data table on my findings shows the larger you build and the more efficient they are which is also one of the tenets of the b-filled brown effect for electrographic Electro ravidic propulsion and uh if you build them a certain configuration whether it&#x27;s a saucer or a triangle they seem to work better too but uh this is basically a flying capacitor but vertical takeoff and Landing capacitor and there&#x27;s a six foot beamship variation three the four footer was beam shift variation two this is a six footer beam chip variation three and it has a framework of Balsa which is hard to see in this photograph that helps keep the structure uh stiff enough so that you don&#x27;t get any loss in efficiency but that&#x27;s running off a high voltage generator that&#x27;s right here and there it is an anti-gravitational mode the six footer beam ship variation three you can see a little bit more of the framework there you can make the framework solid still work great and there&#x27;s a three footer variation one beam ship variation one uh June 30th 2002 21 years ago almost in Valley Forge PA at uh oil Flying Club for radio controlled aircraft and there it is a beam there&#x27;s a five footer beam ship variation five in the lab here in Altamonte Springs Florida and there it is energized doesn&#x27;t take much to get these up in the air and flying just uh just a few Watts or some tens of Watts John fiala my good friend who I met in 2000 when we gave that the first demo with the flying discs he has a hobby side hobby of building high voltage uh generators well he bought one of my beam ships and uh the very next year he powered it well he uh had gotten it flying before with other smaller generous he powered it with a super high power generator he says it took off so fast that these bottom pods and the lower part of it lower frame was left on the ground while the upper frame and the foil was somewhere around the ceiling in a fraction of a fraction of a second and that was you know probably hundreds of miles an hour with no air movements hundreds of miles per hour with no discernible air movement in fact whatever ion wind is generated the US Army showed it was far too feeble to elevate even a three grand model and there&#x27;s an upper limit to the force with iron wind so obviously this cannot be a wind force and it works more efficiently a vacuum there&#x27;s no wind in a vacuum now this is electrical potential to find in the work required to move a charge over a distance in an electric field this is what gets you your uh efficiency and for anybody that studied electrostatics or electrodynamics or electrical engineering these uh formula are very familiar so I highly recommend you look at that that&#x27;ll help you in the work if you choose to do this work now Oleg jeffymenko Russian scientist whose work I highly respect and he has a book on electrostatic Motors that I bought a very important book uh he relates to the electro gravitic field electrokinetic field which is emotional electric field like Hooper talks about in his books uh relates it to Maxwell&#x27;s equations and I think this is a very cogent analysis of what&#x27;s going on with these devices very important stuff this will get us to Mars in a few days Alpha Centauri Proxima Centauri star group Proxima Centauri IV which is uh should be an earth-like planets in the Goldilocks zone get there in less than a month maybe a couple weeks and no time dilation because you don&#x27;t get heavier and heavier there&#x27;s no inertia inertia is canceled by an electrical field so no time dilation when you get back after a round trip of a month assuming you&#x27;re going to do some kind of planetary survey your friends and relatives won&#x27;t be any older than you and the formula for calculating gravitational force is right here and the basic equation for calculating electrographics it looks just like the regular equation for calculating gravitational force f equals V well if f is force of course and where V is voltage m is the positive polarity conductor M1 and M2 is a negative polarity conductor and that&#x27;s over r squared or divided by r squared r is the radius in area of the device so uh that&#x27;ll help you design devices that will work with hardly any electrical input at all but of course the stronger the charge the more intense the charge the more intense the gravitational force the electrical gravitational force that levitates you and don&#x27;t forget gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces in nature this electromatic force is far far more powerful now this is a patent I Believe by James Frank King who worked with Thomas Townsend Brown at Thomas Townsend Brown&#x27;s uh laboratory well actually Agnew H Benson&#x27;s labs in Winston Winston-Salem North Carolina and that was around from 1957 or 56 to 1959 by 1959 he was up in Pennsylvania Southeastern Pennsylvania only a few miles from where I used to live at GE Space Center where they had a huge vacuum chamber now it&#x27;s Lockheed Martin since uh about uh 30 some years ago that is uh man-made adamski type saucer kind of primitive by today&#x27;s standards and this is the flux of gravitational force you want in your electric electrographic device it would be like a toroid look like a donut and the vector or direction of your force is always from your negative to your positive so if your ship is positive it wants to go or sorry negative if your ship is negative or chassis ground it wants to go toward that positive so you get a force of ether or space fabric in this direction in at the bottom out at the top and that&#x27;s what will take you any place in the universe you want to go and there&#x27;s something else from Vance and Labs that&#x27;s a line diagram of a test lift system rig of what is named a tri-arcuate saucer three arcs one Arc here one Arc here one Arc there that proved to have the most lift for the least power input and then this device is a dielectric here that piece so this will be a negative plate or cathode this would be a positive plate or anode and that flies and you have a test weight at the bottom to see how much you can lift versus a given input of electrical energy now here&#x27;s a TT Brown rig with two conductors on either side so the disc is always charged positive on either side you can I&#x27;m sorry the disc is always charged negative I keep saying positive always negative here&#x27;s a positive pole here positive pole here you can switch polarity so the positive is on either side and the disc changes its direction instantaneously and that&#x27;s pretty cool effect and graphically demonstrates electricity Force there&#x27;s no inertia no g-forces you don&#x27;t feel a thing when you&#x27;re riding uh inside one of these when you&#x27;re inside the field your all the atoms you&#x27;re subject to that field all the atoms and molecules move at the same rate there&#x27;s no Freight cars effect of moving Adam by Adam by atom yeah the positive electrode everything wants to fall into that so that&#x27;s the small electrode the big electrode is your cathode small electrode is your anode and you have your high voltage source notice the largest line is the one of the largest electrical potential that&#x27;s your positive that&#x27;s your gravity well and here&#x27;s an illustration of that aforementioned aforementioned Freight cars effect by Leonard G cramp highly recommend his books this piece for a jigsaw books are excellent and help elucidate electrics for me anyway normally in all other propulsion you have a freight cars effect where you have something exerting force from the rear or at some point on the device and then that propulsion is translated atom by atom by atom by atom as if the atoms were Freight cars and look what happens but if the force happens to each car simultaneously as it does say in Electrics there&#x27;s none of that no push no pull everything moves at the same rate so there are no G forces and this is a nice model of line the drawings of an electric saucer with your electrostatic generators your TT Brown capacitors and even portholes and there&#x27;s a diagram of a pretty simple to devise electrostatic saucer electrogravidic saucer that would utilize the TT Brown electrokinetic apparatus technique to fly you have a Transformer coil and some field coils to generate a high voltage some static generators and single plate capacitors and they&#x27;re single plate capacitors would be in the form of metallic spheres which would control your attitude and also be auxiliary propulsion and surrounding the ship is a vacuum either a partial vacuum or full vacuum depending on the strength of the charge the stronger the charge the stronger the higher the voltage the stronger the vacuum that the ship is sitting in in the air that&#x27;s very important to understanding this stuff now the factors that increase the force in parallel plate capacitors and these type of thrusters which Hector Serrano also uh in the year to around the year 2000 2001 uh co-created and co-padented with NASA and I&#x27;m not too far from Space Coast less than an hour from my house voltage primary factor the greater the voltage the greater the force that&#x27;s Factor number one two is the area of the plates and I found that out as well in my uh flying capacitor experiments the greater the area equals a greater force the greater the area of the plates equals a greater force three distance between the plates the smaller the distance between the plates the greater the force and number four greater the dielectric K factor of the dielectric that is between the plates the greater the force and five the greater the mass of the dielectric between the plates the greater the force which explains by uh dielectrics like barium titanites and it&#x27;s depleted uranium uranium oxide which is used in that dielectric and the B2 Spirit bomber are so popular and you have Coulomb&#x27;s law of electrostatic attraction very very important because there is where your electromatic force is coming from in the first place and the force is transduced into electric electric charge and a high electrical field because those electrodes are in a fixed relationship if those electrodes are allowed to move you&#x27;re losing electrographic Force so you want those electrodes to be in totally fixed relationship and not to move and that&#x27;s where f is the electrostatic force between the charges and Newtons Q is the magnitude of the first charge and Coulomb&#x27;s Q is always a charge and Q is the magnitude of the second charge in the coulombs R is the shores the shortest distance between the charges in nanometers well in meters I&#x27;m sorry in meters and ke is the coulombs constant and there&#x27;s what is equal to 8.98756 times 10 to the ninth power newtons that the N is Newton&#x27;s times M which is the mass squared over c squared and there&#x27;s your Coulomb&#x27;s charge in a nutshell now the Germans in the 1930s starting the late 1920s the Alternative Energy societies they had an alternative energy and a law to the German rocket Society headed by Werner Von Braun and Dr Hermann oberth uh they had a real and Thule uh basically Alternative Energy Society vril I&#x27;m pretty sure is either etheric Force The Ether or electrostatic pure electrostatic potential electric force now notice on this device here you have what looks like a segmented rotor passing through electromagnets at the periphery which is going to generate a pulse and then that&#x27;s sending a high voltage charge to insulators that carry the charge to the hole that&#x27;s electricividux for you and there&#x27;s that your typical saucer looks like a circle effect saucer which is also one of my areas of expertise for the last 30 some years and there it is on the ground it&#x27;s a very primitive round crew cabin and this device is about uh 53 feet in diameter and there&#x27;s the back of the head of I believe that&#x27;s Maria orsik who was a German psychic and she claims she got uh uh propulsion Secrets after contacting a extraterrestrial group in the constellation of aldebaran or I&#x27;m sorry the star about daburon which was uh kind of odd kind of interesting at the same time a lot of cases in electrics of people having contact with uh other forces in the universe like David Hamill read the book The granite&#x27;s Man and the Butterfly he built a successful UFO drive after he was allowed on board a UFO and took a ride on a UFO he copied the propulsion system and basically worked the exact same way free energy and electrics the two go hand in hand and there&#x27;s an elaborate laboratory one of uh an electric Riddick model that I had been working on here in Florida still working on it&#x27;s a version of an electric device called a grab a flyer or grab a lot from Alexi checkerkov and my lecture on that is available from Tesla Tech still working on that everybody&#x27;s trying to get this to go this is the next Generation because it&#x27;s heavy lift for even even less input power and there&#x27;s checkercov testing it somewhere that&#x27;s either Portugal I believe that is Portugal in Western Europe it&#x27;s testing a uh a version that I worked on here in Florida and there is about uh six seven meters up in the air yeah small device but a large effect with electric events you can do some amazing things including brake chairs physical laws like lutons Newtons first and third laws of motion and the aforementioned conservation of energy law and there&#x27;s equipment uh Tesla coil that Tesla coil is operating on the one to two megahertz range and a voltage of about twenty two thousand eight hundred and forty volts don&#x27;t even feel it but if you&#x27;re if you wear a metallic wedding ring you will definitely feel your wedding ring getting hot Around Your Finger if you&#x27;re anywhere near less than two meters away from the Tesla coil and high voltage DC unit which is low high voltage maybe anywhere from 15 to 25 000 volts and an ultrasonic generator that&#x27;s generating about uh a frequency of about at 80 to 120 decibels at uh maybe uh oh let&#x27;s say uh one megahertz you want to be in resonance with the Tesla coil everything is here is designed in this system to be in resonance this is a Next Generation anti-gravity device and more consistent with Tesla technology Tesla said think of every anything in the universe and nature in terms of power and resonance and you can do a lot of amazing things which he did 770 patents to Tesla&#x27;s name many of which we still use for over a century as the diagram of the force fields around Checker cause anti-gravity device of course the closer these plates are the of course the upper one is charged positively which is what you&#x27;d expect the negative one is charged the lower one is charged negatively that&#x27;s again for electric bikes that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect and the Tesla coil is powering an AC field putting an AC potential whoops AC potential on that center plate and there are magnets on the lower disk on the negative disk with their North Poles facing upwards six magnets they&#x27;re ring magnets so what happens is the lines of gravitational force coming in from outer space along the Plumb line toward the center of the Earth are diverted by this resonant electromagnetic field and an electrography field too in resonance everything&#x27;s in resonance and that&#x27;s how it starts to lift off and then by adjusting the parameters of the devices you can get more or less Resonance of course less resonance not going to want to fly and there&#x27;s a circuit diagram of that device of the the devices that power that flying device the Checker carve Alexi Shaker cough flying capacitor basically the ultrasonic generator is designed to mimic the systems that are also found in nature of flying insects where you have a beating set of wings that are oscillating an ultrasonic frequency or a very very high frequency and on the inside of the wing covers those smooth tightness wind covers you have multiple cavities for cavity structural effect there it&#x27;s a cavity Structural Engineering found in nature and that effect has been shown to be repulsive against Mass yeah we can have Starships just like we see in science fiction and I&#x27;ve been reading in science fiction for a hundred years we can have this technology but we already have it and it&#x27;s been refined developed and improved upon and I believe there&#x27;s definitely a breakaway civilization that has gone out into space since the 1960s and 70s and established colonies on other worlds and in this solar system as well with Mars perhaps and uh yeah we can we can learn a lot about space and about our Earth with electromatic technology we can uh start to explore the final frontier and renew our planet because electromedic Technologies are not polluting there&#x27;s no noise pollution no flux no emission except for high voltage and ozone in the atmosphere and uh you&#x27;re off and going much much faster than the speed of light just like those aforementioned warp bubbles that have recently been created in the lab we live in an Age of Wonders and electrics&#x27;s wonder that was created first discovered by Thomas Townsend Brown in this country in 1923 100 years ago so yeah we have a long history long history of this stuff and that&#x27;s my Spiel for the night time and Steve you&#x27;re free to end anybody it&#x27;s free to ask questions I know if the chat&#x27;s working but uh you can see if we can get some chat action but uh yeah there we go electricity we have a question a couple slides back we&#x27;re showing a book and they&#x27;re wondering what author of book title oh there are there were a few books uh let me go back to the book section well I think you passed it let&#x27;s see a little slower yeah I usually I have double this number of slides at least I just passed it there was that one there oh that uh go back one I think 39.</p>
<p>right there oh yeah Leonard G cramp c-r-a-m-p piece for a jigsaw his piece for a jigsaw series which he first started publishing and I got uh hardcover copy of that at a UFO conference in uh late 1980s 1988 in Manhattan in uh Midtown Manhattan and that&#x27;s from peace for a jigsaw where you can see right there author and book title here peace foreign um I think as piece for a jigsaw the original and then uh piece for a jigsaw two piece for a jigsaw three which are published by information Unlimited Chris uh out of Kempton Illinois and they have a lot of really good books on electric riddicks and free energy and UFOs and all sorts of things that uh inquiring moms want to know about but I try to have a lot of their books over at the I want to do the conference so we try to get them up at the conference um so uh yeah this shape if you want to build something that will utilize fields of artificially generated gravitational force for propulsion this is a shape that seems to work the best has another question here since the Russians are really into like electrographytics do you have any Russian colleagues to share research with uh yes I do Alexi checkercov is one and I have bought a couple of his kits and uh working with him and uh also yes um a member of new Energy Technologies magazine um who do you remember who published that as guy out of St Petersburg Russia and uh let&#x27;s see I published an article in there hold on one sec if you&#x27;re online go online and look at uh look for beam ship technology is that going to show up uh not reversed yeah that&#x27;s okay yeah beamship technology there I am flying a uh four footer in Valley Forge Pennsylvania flying field beamship technology it gives my email and uh oh that&#x27;s a faraday lab limited uh Alexander frolov Alexander froloff uh he wanted me to publish uh in his uh in his uh publication first which I did I wrote a paper for him and included my data and my data table for my experiments in 2002 and he published in new energy uh the magazine new Energy Technologies magazine published by Faraday Labs six times a year I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re still publishing um and uh yeah it was Alexander furloff in Russia in Saint Peter from St Petersburg Russia is he still around I don&#x27;t know I haven&#x27;t heard from him in a while but if you entered uh the title beamship technology at 20 early uh 20th century uh discoveries um yeah uh you&#x27;ll see that article come up in the cover of the magazine and I have that the copy of that magazine uh the journal but uh yeah it&#x27;s showing that beam ship flying Outdoors indoors and uh I included my paper so yeah Alexander frolo from new Energy Technologies journal in St Petersburg Russia I just reminded everyone to give us a thumbs up you know yeah we&#x27;ll like to see that thumbs up that shows we&#x27;re doing our job keeping the folks entertained it helps the search engines to find us you know it&#x27;s extremely important you know yeah we live in an age an information age for and it&#x27;s called information age for a reason all the information you ever want is right out there at your fingertips with just like one or two clicks you know imagine if you have a chip in your head that can you know like Wi-Fi you know you never have to go to school anything you want to learn to be instantly attainable and that&#x27;s the great thing about our our YouTube channel here is that um this year you get Global access 24 7. I mean you could be sitting in a trench in the middle of the Ukraine you know during a break and watching this stuff in order to get a break from the uh the seriousness of stuff that&#x27;s happening there that&#x27;s how pervasive this stuff is this technology where you can see this stuff 24 7 globally is truly a miracle you know I wish I would have had this 20 years ago I think would be a lot further along you know oh yeah wow so so yeah you know it&#x27;s just uh a miracle here and uh you&#x27;re gonna be our accomplished right I will be there I plan to be there and um exciting new and exciting talk that everyone who cares about this type of stuff really needs to see and you always have Hardware there and I always have working Hardware that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been saying since the late 80s uh and early 90s working Hardware not vaporware anything else is just not going to cut it you have to have working Hardware to show that uh we can do what we uh what we say we can do we want Hardware not hot air there you go I like that one we have enough real warming here yeah yeah we have too much hot air yeah yeah but let&#x27;s talk about global warming and ameliorating our climate uh crises which are self-generated uh we can do that with electric Riddick technology you know I I love that uh that line in the last uh part of Back to the Future where uh Christopher Lloyd Doc Brown says uh uh roads where we&#x27;re going we don&#x27;t need roads as Marty McFly says back back up doc you don&#x27;t have enough road to get up to 88 miles an hour he goes we don&#x27;t need roads I like that the thing if we didn&#x27;t have to you know build roads you know we just leave everything pristine and just you know Glide over a surface you know or fly you know any altitude we want uh electric vertically you get anywhere on the Earth from anywhere in 30 minutes or less and here you go would you consider making personal anti-gravity vehicles on a mass scale of course just like personal drones are being built now they&#x27;re all over YouTube and personal jet packs uh is you know no no reason why we can&#x27;t have personal anti-grass uh this technology is even more accessible and uh you know kids are winning have been winning science fairs with my assistants with it since 2003 it&#x27;s uh almost uh almost 20 years you know I never see this has amazed me you know how we now have like SpaceX and all these space companies you know trying to get out his face using the old uh chemical Rockets you know and um I believe that we are way beyond that you know and we&#x27;ve been beyond it for a long time don&#x27;t forget that this technology has been secretized for a long time since the 1930s even though so much of it had been in the public domain and until that conference in lower Manhattan in 1955 November 1955 it was taught in schools Larry Davenport who is a good friend and colleague who I saw his uh demonstration and talked at Tesla Tech years ago uh uh I&#x27;ve admired his work for a long time too uh he said he first learned about it in school can you say cover-up goodness sakes just like they did to Tesla&#x27;s work and Otis T Carr look what they did to Otis T Carr uh basically a SWAT team came to his lab and his company offices and said we&#x27;re going to shut you down because your your work uh jeopardizes our financial system to all these inventors didn&#x27;t they well I see the thing is is that a lot of the stuff especially at our conference is is uh disruptive very disruptive technology Bingo it&#x27;s disruptive as heck that&#x27;s who the uh to our Antiquated systems as Jack Nicholson put it in Easy writer when he was talking about UFOs he said you know these these uh you know UFO people operate on a totally higher level than the people living here and our systems are already Antiquated and uh you know they you know it&#x27;s there&#x27;s no reason why we have to use internal combustion anymore we could use hydrogen hydrogen doesn&#x27;t pollute the environment hydrogen power and uh you know generating internal combustion hydrogen that that might work but you still get noise with the electricals such as the soil technology that I work on and and 2000 brown stuff that I&#x27;ve also worked on um there&#x27;s no noise there&#x27;s no pollution uh there&#x27;s uh just clean propulsion and uh efficient use of natural forces present in nature all around us every second well yeah I understand though that we are this plant is being run by fossil fuel people and um money and power same old same old and what we are doing here disruptive and I&#x27;m thinking about renaming my confidence to the disruptive technology conference but yeah well that will generate some interest I&#x27;m sure it might generate the wrong kind of interest but I say you know the heck with it you know I&#x27;m we&#x27;re old you know it&#x27;s long past time for this technology to come out look how many years it&#x27;s been uh sequestered and suppressed you know a century basically and uh you know we&#x27;re in been in a new age lately where a lot of this stuff is now coming out and we&#x27;re in a new openness a new glass notes where uh you know the disruptive Technologies are being let out the cats are being let out of the bags and uh they&#x27;re saying oh well I guess they&#x27;re saying yeah we we uh we know the uaps were they&#x27;re not climbing UFOs anymore they&#x27;re calling them uaps you know we know what they are uh you know we&#x27;re you know we don&#x27;t know where they come from but we know they they don&#x27;t operate with any you know Wings Tails surfaces control surfaces and no internal combustion but yet they do things that are technology cannot you know and uh it&#x27;s a new openness I think part of it is the uh the openness of the information age the openness of the internet that affords openness on so many uh subjects that heretofore had been suppressed yeah and I think one of the new tactics they have it now is uh instead of trying to uh science says they&#x27;re trying to push out so much misinformation out there that everybody gets confused you know and that to come I find you know that people like if I put something in writing people and put on paper and print it people are tending to believe it you know as opposed to just reading it on the internet Because the Internet exactly uh and that&#x27;s also because sadly anybody can put anything on the internet even if it&#x27;s totally untrue but this style of technology has been written about in many books of course and verified by many experimenters and inventors and patented and uh you know works like a dream works like a charm and uh it&#x27;s uh obviously you know a a hop skip and a jump ahead of uh of uh what we&#x27;re using currently at least publicly so anyway on that note I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and call it a night and sounds great I&#x27;m starving I got tacos waiting thank everybody for showing up tonight and uh like I said you know don&#x27;t forget to go ahead and uh smash that thumbs up you know we can always use the promo and uh share this uh link you know let other people find it and uh with that I&#x27;m going to say it good night and I&#x27;ll see you on it&#x27;d probably be the week after next because next week is Easter thank you much</p>
