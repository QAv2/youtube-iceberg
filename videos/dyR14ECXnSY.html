            <p>if you take a Taurus and you put a ferof fluid like Mercury inside of it and you magnetize the Taurus in a way that creates this rotation this RPM of the of the Mercury moving around that field and you get it up to about 60,000 RPMs and then you actually pressurize the Taurus to about 250,000 atmospheres you and you Electrify it you get anti-gravity properties what yeah whoa so you can create a anti-gravity flying device you utilizing that technique and this is really you know welln and how do they describe it in the text in the text they talk about the fact that it used mercury in a rotating disc really yeah and then they have some of the you know the flight plans and some of the layout of actually the the plans of the actual ship itself one of the ships and so from that you can almost hypothesize or backward engineer what it might have been able to do</p>
