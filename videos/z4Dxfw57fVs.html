            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Good day, YouTube. We&#x27;re uh running this fan here off grid as usual. And uh basically, I got more LEDs here as indicators. And uh what I got going here is a little cell I made. So, basically, I have a 8.7 inch carbon or sorry, copper rod that is down the center of a little jug in here.</p>
<p>And if I were to open this guy up to where you can see, it&#x27;s just um Oh, wow. It&#x27;s changed colors. Um the copper is definitely going into the solution. But basically, that was just a little bit of salt and activated carbon into that solution. It fizzed when I put it in.</p>
<p>And then this is magnetic sand I collected from the desert sand and then put around here. And then um as you can see, the wires aren&#x27;t connected from input to output. This input is just to ground. This is literally connected to my water pipe. And then this is connected to the negative terminal of my uh source battery here, which is uh obviously blocked with the diode going this way from my solar system and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Um but as you can see, this was clear and now it&#x27;s blue. So that&#x27;s kind of an interesting find. That&#x27;s cool. Um so I&#x27;ll put that back. And then um basically these dodes they&#x27;re they&#x27;re uh light emmitting diodes are acting nonlinearly.</p>
<p>So it allows the scalar electromagnetic field to collapse through them. And so these run 247. These are free lighting for 247. I can just run more LEDs and light my whole garage like that for free out of this scalar electromagnetic potential flaps. If you do this, you have to be careful by adding a resistor.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so bright you can&#x27;t even see the resistor, but it&#x27;s a thousand ohm resistor right there. Um, and that uh helps keep you safe, dissipate that heat. Delta V equals IR, right? So you increase R and you drop the current component for that amount of potential you have stored in the ether. Right now I&#x27;m rocking around uh 13 volts I believe and earlier it was showing around 30 volts across this LED. So we have it on 50.</p>
<p>The uh positive is always this AD node right there. So, we&#x27;ll go positive on this side. Sorry, we&#x27;re across the LED. As you can see, we&#x27;re on uh the 50 volt mark. So, that means we&#x27;re uh six volts across this LED, which is kind of cool.</p>
<p>And then uh the 10 volt mark just to confirm that if I can touch it again. I can&#x27;t seem to get good Kong tap, but it looks like maybe closer to five and a half volts actually. Um, and at one point I measured a lot more than that. It seems that it&#x27;s um a decent amount of potential here. So, this uh source battery has been isolated all week from the rest of them.</p>
<p>And uh I&#x27;ll go ahead and measure that as well. Prop this up for you. Okay, measuring the source battery terminal now across from the negative to the positive and we are definitely above 10. So we&#x27;ll go to the 50 mark and measure that again and we see we are at 12.5. So, I haven&#x27;t lost any charge yet from this battery, even though I keep running inverters and loads and things.</p>
<p>Um, this gu is still on and ticking away, but it it turns off at night. And, uh, these LEDs before because I had it coupled to the solar panels essentially, I was tracking the, um, etheric window of when that scalar pressure happens. So that&#x27;s around 5:30 to uh just after 900 p.m. or so that it completely fades away. Um but basically now that I have this cell right here and this as my nonlinear junction I have this uh it&#x27;s a high rate of change uh with a thigh with respect to time and so that is uh collapsing with this electrostatic potential of that I built relative grounds through this uh nonlinear way and that&#x27;s what allows this to light up Even if this is like 30 or 40 volts, which I&#x27;ve me measured before, across this, it lights up and doesn&#x27;t burn out, which is pretty cool about this type of energy.</p>
<p>Um, so I can just keep buying more of these LEDs and I can string them all around my garage and all that light is for free once again. And I just want to make that be known because there&#x27;s blocking diodes right here that the cathode side is pointing into this negative terminal. Okay. So, I let the water soak in more evenly here. So, as you can see, it&#x27;s nice and wet, but not so wet it&#x27;s dripping down there or anything like that.</p>
<p>And uh yeah, this is just an LED in my hands. And check that out. Just light it up right off the ground. You know, like maybe I&#x27;ll just like Ah, here&#x27;s not. So, uh Oh, here we go.</p>
<p>Something about the path needs to go. See, it&#x27;s not equally conductive as everywhere. But, um, I want to show you guys this isn&#x27;t any trickery. This is not any trickery. And you say, &quot;Oh, well, you&#x27;re powering the wire.&quot; And you&#x27;re like, &quot;Okay, well, I want you to try this at home.</p>
<p>If you think you can do it like this, right? This is a ground wire. This is just a ground wire. Um, so yeah, you want to know where this ground wire goes? To be fully transparent, it goes under here. Goes along and it goes along and it goes in here and it touches this metal fitting. Oh, look at that.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s so cool. So, this is under my sink touching the brass hose fitting with the LED.</p>
