            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald abuse at founder and chair of the International Society unified science and president trans power corporation a commercial and custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company I work as a theoretical physicist and as a systems and mechanical engineer today is with many of my screencast I&#x27;ll be discussing the cyclical system in particular of the suitable system micro cosmos database as you can see on the Left panel here I&#x27;ve already covered all the layouts on their super equals system macro cosmos database so please see my other screencasts for all those on the micro cosmos database we&#x27;ve already covered solid matter properties in liquid vapor gas mantle popu so we&#x27;re going to come into this area here cosmic element&#x27;s atomic particles I&#x27;m going to cover cosmic elements today so what our cosmic elements first of all there&#x27;s there is no antimatter there&#x27;s no dark matter in the reciprocal system there are two types of matter material cosmic cosmic matter is the inverse of our ordinary material there are 118 cosmic elements just as they&#x27;re 118 interior elements with 118 elements being unstable regardless of their region if you try to make an element of Tummie them again in 18 either in the material sector or the cosmic center decay immediately regardless of the environment so atoms with material cosmic are rotating photons the distinction is that the rotation of material images in time which means it&#x27;s less than the speed of light whereas the rotation of the photons and the cosmic sector his space so the first element the first actual element the cosmic Searchers cosmic deuterium mrs. C - D we prefix all cosmic elements with the C - in front of description cosmic deuterium and here&#x27;s the regular rotational displacement it&#x27;s 2 in parentheses 1 in parentheses and one without parentheses so it&#x27;s the primary or principal magnetic rotations two units in space and then the secondary magnetic rotation is in space also it&#x27;s one and there&#x27;s then there&#x27;s a unit of electric rotation in one dimensional um number one if you wanted to play around with the rock debris you didn&#x27;t want to change anything the refugee could just duplicate the record by hitting control D up the full number and then play of the other numbers now this one&#x27;s pretty simple there&#x27;s just the z factor here there&#x27;s two of Z so we have the am in here riches precisely - this is a muse based on oxygen or as u is based on carbon incidentally so there&#x27;s a slight difference between the two 1.999 etcetera so just keep that in mind the system is more consistent with the old oxygen basis and with the newer carbon bases but I would give birth here T sub C means the number of gravitational units from the cosmic sector so it&#x27;s less than number of materials are materials from charges as observed B - in this case so then we get decent see here in cosmic terms because it&#x27;s zero and then here this is the mass of the cosmic guys are typically measured in the material center so there&#x27;s you here and commonly with Nissan&#x27;s by the way the conventional theorists refer to all these causing elements as Nissan&#x27;s because they&#x27;re intermediate and mass between let&#x27;s say hydrogen but the reason for that is that cosmic atoms have the inverse mass to material atoms so keep that in mind please then down here we have most commonly observed C - D sigh that&#x27;s the identification of Amis on the solid particle P sub C is 0 the number of material gravitational units is - that&#x27;s a rotational vibration by the way caused by neutrinos there&#x27;s a me V over C square which is the common you know in particle experiments the observed is pretty close you can see and then the decay products now cosmic deuterium can change right over to material deuterium so that&#x27;s the positive or the change in the cosmic helium so I say here in the notes causing deuterium converts to D because each unit cosmic rotational system is equal to the unit a unit material rotational system however there may be situations where the case to cosmic helium-3 know that CH 1 is an intermediate particle disorientation systems are different so C - D is actually the first real cosmic calendar ok if you look down here you can see 118 elements in this particular database file I&#x27;ll go to the next one here&#x27;s cosmic Hill Yemen pretty much the same stuff you saw before I will note here that Jesus II can be a - bird doesn&#x27;t have to be positive and again mature marination charges this is another side particle but the Jesus C and G so them are different so we get a different value 3 105 and then pursue Square and then this can decay to causing Borah on a cosmic carbon and cosmic nitrogen has caused me to lithium I&#x27;m not going to go through all the elements under school just briefly go through cosmic car here we have 0 to 1 for T sub C and additional charge here this is identified the sea magic somebody used to have identification so this is a pile that&#x27;s pretty important cosmic silicon this is now I have the identification zekkai on but you got to read the notes usually on is one half of the cosmic crypto that is this one rotating system rather than two that has a mass a four ninety one point four five seven and Percy squared ascending one the chair of a petition charge cousin could time decays to two masses neutrons which are difficult cheats attacks these less neutrons then eventually combined with antara neutrinos to create protons okay that&#x27;s how that operates I think we&#x27;ve come a probably enough you can sees we go to the higher atomic number then we have more possible values for the cosmic isotopes and these fragment when they come in if you get a constant this is gonna frighten me all right well that covers the cosmic elements again cosmic elements are the ingress of materials there&#x27;s no antimatter there&#x27;s cosmic matter the cosmic matter is localized in coordinate time so yes there are cosmic stars cosmic galaxies etc but they&#x27;re not legalized in the space that were placed in time so we don&#x27;t encounter them the two sector than the material cosmic sector actually pass right through each other we&#x27;re moving out with the space profession but as the cosmic sectors meaning that with the time tradition velocity in our sector as I&#x27;ve said many times s over T whereas it&#x27;s to arrests in the cosmic or inverse sector so now I understand why we call the whole system the reciprocal system space and time is super symmetrical in space-time promotion in the most general sense alright so that wraps it up for today I&#x27;m just going to close out here study the reciprocal system in truth for yourself the simplest possible treatment in the theory is my luck the understeers universe as all the diagrams need all the concepts and has a critique of conventional theory might as well still in trend after many decades and it&#x27;s gotten very good reviews on Amazon now if you give all the mathematics oh please get my magnum opus existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything sudden hair 11 pages in the PDF files and 211 is in the town 25 thousands and thousands of equations I should point out of the house all the dimensions of all the physical bodies all would you stand the space-time terms it&#x27;s nothing like this some of the lives it has thousands of equation phezzan I&#x27;ve said numerous diagrams tables figures it&#x27;ll keep you busy for months then let me finish with that you&#x27;re ready to tackle the two database models I have here the micro cosmos database in the macro cosmos database the micro cosmos database covers solid matter properties including inter tonic distance valence specific heat energy and entropy thermal expansion compressibility electrical magnetic properties isotopes an atomic spectra also covers liquid vapour and gas meta properties including volume and density specific heat energy attribute viscosity surface tension and electromagnetics connectivity I&#x27;m stable covered cosmic elements next atomic particles and then we&#x27;ll have proton properties I&#x27;ve already covered the macrocosmos database so please see my previous screencasts I&#x27;ve covered these astronomical properties for the universe as a whole galaxy clusters and glutes galaxies star clusters stars planets moons minor bodies maybe like gas and dust and voids and you can just click on the events if you just want to go look at the pictures and business this also has a nice diving rating for the progression of annotations and star properties now I think that acoustics Manor Derby Larson was also a theoretical economist who may have made his work in economics also fully computation that work is called optimal economists and implementation of our son Ian Connor physics there I cover the economics of individuals businesses and business sectors as Michael each one looks in my house to cover macroeconomics you cannot mix the whole regions in countries totally supersedes the conventional nonsense attention and I really wish that more people will enjoy purchasing that that particular but helped having more people understand how economics actually operates ok well that does it for today I&#x27;ve covered cosmic elements in some detail again please study the reciprocal system and people through yourselves and thanks for your attention</p>
