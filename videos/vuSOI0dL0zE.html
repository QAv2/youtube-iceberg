            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas and I do educational material on this uh on this channel and today is video number 106. of the uh review of the reciprocal system of theory this uh Theory of Everything was originated by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century and uh the basic idea is that it is a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it&#x27;s made out of motion matter and energy are in fact just different kinds of motion and uh motion is defined by Larson as the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other kind of meaning that they are the same as one another except they are inverted there is an inversion between space and time and uh space and time have the same general qualities uh space and time are both three or more dimensions and they are both progressing or flowing space is always time is always getting later and later space is always getting farther and farther apart and that&#x27;s what Larson generally calls um clock time and clock space and the three-dimensionality or more is what Larson calls coordinate time and coordinate space and then space and time are also in only discrete units uh there&#x27;s one unit and there&#x27;s two units and there&#x27;s three units and there&#x27;s four units but there&#x27;s not 3.43 units you either have one or you don&#x27;t have any and uh one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light and the speed of light in the universe of motion is the default position or the neutral or the null point or the origin of this universe half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light which contradicts Einstein who said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe he&#x27;s referring to the half of the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light Larson calls that sector one or the material sector but sector two are the cosmic sector is the half that is moving faster than the speed of light and they there is a semi-permeable boundary there which is the speed of light and uh that is you know the midpoint um now sector one phenomena chemistry physics matter um atoms grow by aggregation bonding until they get to their most complex level which is the DNA molecule which contains a few billion atoms per molecule then from there at that point the DNA molecule uh becomes eligible to be controlled by a Cosmic unit from sector two and that Cosmic unit then can take control of the material unit of the DNA molecule and uh Larson generally refers to that as the spinning apparatus and that spinning apparatus then takes control of the uh the sector 1 unit and turns it into what Larson calls the life unit so life is a combination of a material and Cosmic sector units and in the right proportion in the right configuration and anything that is uh life then has a lifetime so there&#x27;s a certain time that this entity uh lives um and then these and that starts out with really the single-celled organism uh and then the single-celled organism develops and evolves uh over time and eventually gets to its most complex level which Larson says sizes the intelligent human being and at that point the intelligent human being becomes uh eligible to be controlled overall by a uh an entity from sector three now sector 3 uh is what other people might be calling God or the gods or goddesses or um the numinous or the religious or the spiritual and uh at that point the sector 3 entity uh this might be what Larson is referring to when he&#x27;s just talking about the speed of light this boundary region uh where you have one unit of time per one unit of space and everything just cancels out and it just turns into one and um this unit of area of Oneness that Larson calls sector three um then communicates with uh the intelligent human being uh under the guise of things such as ESP intuition scientific Insight religious Revelation and um these communications that we get from sector three are always correct but our ability to decode these messages is very limited because the human being the intelligent human being is kind of analogous to the single-celled spiritual organism or this single cell numinous organism and um so we&#x27;re not yet quite Adept at decoding these messages uh especially the ones that are more complicated or complex like the religious Revelations and the scientific Insight the normal everyday intuition we have a better chance to decode those messages okay now we are in um chapter 26 here uh outlook for communication so he&#x27;s uh uh this is his book his final book that&#x27;s called beyond space and time it has to do with sector three and uh you know how we deal with sector three and uh we are in chapter 26 called outlook for communication so he&#x27;s discussing uh these sector three entities and they&#x27;re uh communicating with us at sector um at sector um sector two the life unit and here we have a you know we have issues uh in terms of uh how we are able to decode these messages and uh you know um and he kind of indicated that yeah well we need to be patient with this uh it may take a long time for us to be able to you know systematically decode these messages and uh also that um you know we kind of have to make a delineation between sector two Communications and sector three communications um and these things are all things that we&#x27;re we&#x27;re working on this is the this is the underlying goal of the of life and really of the universe in general is for um being such as intelligent humans to be brought up to the sector three level or really level three is what he calls it a an intelligent human being under the influence of sector three he calls that level three um now I did make a mistake we are in chapter 26 that&#x27;s called the road ahead okay uh we just began this chapter and um I&#x27;m going to take over uh let Larson take over from here okay from the foregoing it can be seen that the situation in the philosophical field is by no means unique uh now he&#x27;s he&#x27;s uh discussing how philosophy and religion even though they&#x27;re seen to be kind of separate uh that they&#x27;re really working in the in the same um in the same realm and that philosophy is is really kind of like the uh he he he Compares it to science that the philosophy part is really kind of like the science where the religion part is like the engineering applied science so he&#x27;s saying that you know religion is applied philosophy is kind of what he&#x27;s uh what he&#x27;s getting at here uh and this kind of Echoes a lot of the themes that he talks about throughout this book and that um he&#x27;s really trying to put religion in onto a scientific footing um so that it becomes more of a systematic thing and that uh that helps to eliminate a lot of the extraneous Matters from religion such as uh you know the uh Arcane rituals and um you know just the uh the things that are not at the core of the religion that the sector two parts of religion that are not concerned with sector three okay so getting back starting from the beginning again uh from the foregoing it can be seen that the situation in the philosophical field is by no means unique the same considerations are controlling in the physical field indeed they apply to the theoretical branch of every field of knowledge Theory cannot be put into practice until objectives are designated assignment of philosophical goals is a function of religion this statement will be challenged but the objectors cannot deny that some agency must set the goals those who suggest that they could be set by some non-religious agency are simply offering a substitute for religion actually nothing but religion under another name one uh for instance tell for instance tells us that ethics can disclaim all essential connection with religion but in the same discussion he concedes that values are arbitrary as long as they stand by themselves and that actions receive their value from a command or a directive to which the person is committed now let us ask what are we to call the agency that commands and directs the most important aspects of human life isn&#x27;t this about as good a thumbnail description of religion in general as we could want those who wish to divorce their value systems from religion are simply transferring the primary functions of religion to some other agency thereby making that agency a religion or at least a quasi religion regardless of what name they may attach to it as noted earlier a moral code is not self-enforcing it contains no directive that it be obeyed such a directive is obviously needed if the code is to have any practical effect as that same philosopher points out and one of the basic functions of religion has been met has been to meet this need the findings of this work now provide a directive independent of religion by showing that compliance with the code the ethical code is essential to the Fulfillment of the purpose for which the human race exists but this is not inconsistent with the religious explanations of the origin of the command and each individual is at Liberty to accept either or both it is now evidence that the obstacle that has hitherto prevented the formulation of a consistent and workable theory of Ethics was a lack of clear understanding of the nature of the moral objective as long as ethical judgments were based on criteria such as human happiness not related to the true objective and not more than ethically neutral at best it was impossible to set up any satisfactory ethical system but now that a clear and unequivocal definition of the objective is available there is no longer anything standing in the way of working out the provisions of the true moral code the code of sector 3 in full detail this knowledge of the details of the moral code will provide the basis for a new and more consistent theory of values there is a rather General agreement that this is one of the basic needs of the present era some of the statements quoted in the earlier Pages were taken from the published report of a conference on values held at MIT in 1957. an idea of the gravity with which the participants in this conference viewed the value problem can be obtained from the following excerpts from the preface to the report so quoting the report this volume Springs from the belief first that the ultimate disease of our time is valuelessness second that this state is more crucially dangerous than ever before in history and finally that something can be done about it by man&#x27;s rational efforts okay that&#x27;s it um this the state of valuelessness has come to its present dangerous point because all the traditional value systems ever offered to mankind have in effect proved to be failures the cure for this disease is obvious we need a validated usable system of human values values that we can believe in and devote ourselves to because they are true rather than because we are exhorted to believe and have faith in the light of the new information that has been developed in this work it is evident that this critical statement falls into the same error that has produced the results that it deplores that is it speaks of human values where it should be concerned with moral values moral values are human values to be sure but not all human values are moral values in fact most value decisions that are made by human beings involve economic values or social values rather than moral values from the standpoint of the ultimate Destiny of the human individual only the moral value judgments are relevant lack of recognition of this fact is the reason why as pointed out in the foregoing statement all the traditional value systems have an effect prove to be failures they were and are failures because they have no solid foundations the efforts of the philosophers to replace authoritarian morality with value systems based on empirical premises have been nothing more than futile intellectual exercises none of these systems gets any significant amount of attention outside philosophical circles because it is obvious that the values thus derived are not the kind of values that we can believe in and devote ourselves to as emphasized earlier most human individuals have an intuitive understanding of simple moral principles and they realize that pleasure happiness and the like are not the grounds on which an acceptable code of human conduct can be based our scientific analysis confirms the validity of this intuitive judgment as it shows that the objectives defined by the hedonist philosophers are the objectives of sector two the biological sector rather than those to which the human race must subscribe if it is to be anything other than one more species of animal some supporters of the so-called naturalistic view of ethics who recognize the incongruity involved in basing morality on Hedonism have tried to find a basis in human development or self-realization the good or right according to one expression of this view is that which is in Conformity with evolutionary development but evolution in the usual sense is also a purely biological process of course Evolution could be redefined but as one philosopher points out if we Define evolutionary development as change for the better as one is tempted to do the definition of good proposed uh will of good proposed will constitute a vicious circle the the definition of good proposed will constitute a vicious circle unlike these philosophical value systems which have little actual moral content and a correspondingly minimal practical effect the religious systems have had a profound impact on human life throughout recorded history however the true foundations for the principles of morality included in the religious teachings has not heretofore been recognized and the organized religions have therefore been forced to rely on the power of authority for thousands of years this has sufficed to hold the rank and file in line but now that more and more individuals in the advanced societies are reaching the point where they want to make their own decisions rather than accepting the word of authority the religious value systems are left without any basis on which they can claim authenticity okay um I think we are going to stop it off here and we will resume uh with chapter 26 of beyond space and time next time thank you for tuning in and um hope to see you back uh next time have a great day</p>
