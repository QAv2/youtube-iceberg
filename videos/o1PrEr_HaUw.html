            <p>okay I just wanted to show what happens when you put the high voltage DC without the capacitors on them so we have a 15 kV 4 amp diode here we got about two four six six thousand volts here and go just going right into our so when I turn it on okay we&#x27;re all we&#x27;re all the way out okay there&#x27;s there&#x27;s nothing going on absolutely nothing those from sand in there okay all standards just falling to the bottom it&#x27;s just sinking down into the bone and falling down so you know the power is there okay jumping up to 200 watts okay go back down okay so without the capacitors turn this off now without the capacitors there is no effect now in a book that I have Westinghouse book alright here we go alright so here in westinghouse lighting handbook from the 1950 1952 it&#x27;s got cosmic rays in here and cosmic rays so so it says in here light is that form of radiant energy which is capable of producing the sensation of sight visible energy is an exceedingly small portion of the electromagnetic spent spectrum a tremendous range of radiant energy which travels through space in the form of electromagnetic waves all of these radiations are similar in nature and in the speed at which they travel the speed of light they differ only in wavelength in frequency and in the ways in which they manifest themselves so they give a formula here that says the distance between between crests of successive waves shown here is L and is a wavelength since wavelength times frequency equals velocity which is constant frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength so what they&#x27;re trying to they&#x27;re trying to you know teach us about frequency and wavelength here but I want to focus on velocity so a frequency over a wavelength creates a velocity and now of course it goes on to talk about if you if you have a 60 cycle alternating current okay thirty one thousand miles long that&#x27;s a cosmic ray okay so cosmic rays are at 60 cycles alternating current 31,000 miles maybe we&#x27;re using our grid system as a receiving antenna for these 60 60 Hertz cosmic rays coming in so that we can turn them into velocity you know burn it in watts so okay back over to here now the capacitor these are just basically you know two giant aluminum antennas in here that are separated by a dielectric material so the frequency I believe of the diode turning on and off okay to create the square wave on off on off that frequency is creating over the wavelength in this capacitor is creating a velocity and so it&#x27;s a very high velocity and when you okay so now so when I when I put them in these oil with the dielectric materials the there&#x27;s a dynamic movement within the oil excuse me so just by adding the frequency over wavelength we&#x27;re getting this velocity here which we could what it may be doing okay what it may be doing is the frequency over this wavelength is creating the velocity straight out of the vacuum through the Casimir force you know the two plates really close together the dielectric materials if they do hold charge so I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the one way to explain how the ampère&#x27;s force law is creating a not only a line integral with the electrostatic charge when there&#x27;s conducting material it all stacks up and creates a electric field electric field lines when you put the dielectric material in there it creates a convergence in a curl very similar to the quaternion equations of Maxwell now when you charge this for a second and you turn off the system there&#x27;s the force is still being generated between the two electrodes there for a period of I haven&#x27;t done this one yet time timewise but usually it&#x27;s a period about an hour and you know the measured the voltage here and the voltage doesn&#x27;t go down when that when the dynamic movement in the dielectric stops so that tells me that the what&#x27;s happening in the capacitor the velocity is actually the demonstration the of gravity of the Earth&#x27;s gravity through electrostatic excitation the the gravitational field can flow easier on on smaller scales and I think on all scales so when you have this capacitance and you know this high electric static charge you get the convergence and curl which are the gravity you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the convergence and curl the torque and torsion of the space-time itself which are made up of all the different electromagnetic fluxes so no wonder it would if you had it charged it&#x27;s like greasing the tube when you got when you when you grease the tubes here with the electrostatic charge another force that is inherently convergent and curling and fractal okay they just keep going to open up this VAT the counter-rotating vortices they just they just keep linking that and it&#x27;s the it&#x27;s the most efficient way for that force to to move so this is related to amperes law force the the f12 you know Lorentz force that&#x27;s between the the two electrodes that that attracts them well there is that convergence and curl portion to it which is related to the geometry of gravity so yeah that&#x27;s uh and what we can do is here we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll turn these on and we&#x27;ll get them started so that we can see the difference all right so put a little a little bit more of a hourglass and you&#x27;re just gonna see if there&#x27;s something wrong all right I just put my safety glasses on and and there were a lot of movement now dynamic flow convergence and pearl looks like I&#x27;m looking into a galaxy with all the look it just shifted seeing it like shifts from one side to the other it&#x27;ll spin around for a little while so definitely a difference when you add the capacitors okay so and here&#x27;s the light you know because it&#x27;s a light equation there&#x27;s your light okay so both of those capacitors are charged I just don&#x27;t want to do it with well I&#x27;m filming here the back one so there it is the explanation and the demonstration of electro gravitation okay</p>
