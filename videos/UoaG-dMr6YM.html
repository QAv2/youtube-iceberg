            <p>excuse the hair I really need a haircut but today let&#x27;s talk about something really heavy gravity so there&#x27;s lots of discussion on social media YouTube about gravity reduction lighter than air making planes repel gravity and there&#x27;s all these devices all the ones that I&#x27;ve seen are actually ion thrusters using streams of ions out of pointy bits of metal to produce upward thrust they don&#x27;t actually overcome gravity but there is a technique that works and is being applied now you can actually make a plasma boundary layer over AER foils so heavy bombers like the B2 bomber or other craft who knows who can produce a lot of power electricity can produce a plasma boundary layer over their wings effectively reducing drag not anti-gravity but anti- drag and that&#x27;s about it I&#x27;ve really looked into this for you it would be great if there was a anti-gravity machine like this one and then out of the blue and email playing as seems to happen to me thank you very much for reaching out and sharing what you know this person knows a lot he knows how anti-gravity might really work let me tell you the email actually came from a well-known physicist who doesn&#x27;t want his name mentioned but he asked me a question to ask you and that is what is the science definition of gravity not what is gravity because we don&#x27;t really know gravity is very different from electromagnetism or electricity or ionizing radiation it doesn&#x27;t have things in space it&#x27;s a way of actually altering space itself so his question to me I&#x27;m going to ask you what&#x27;s the dictionary definition of how gravity works those who know those who teach or those who look it up know the answer is gravity is when Mass modifies space and time hang on a minute yes in his email he went ding to me Gravity is affected by large mass say the sun when that mass distorts space and time well we know it distorts space we&#x27;ve seen gravity lensing around our sun all the time but time that&#x27;s his point this person works for a large defense contractor modifying gravity they were using gravity to modify time straight up that&#x27;s what he said there are programs out there looking at the properties of what I might call exotic matter with high gravitational mass that locally say around a tank or an airplane or a missile can modify time now if you can modify Time by just a few Nan you completely have disguised the Press Ence of your weapon system you&#x27;re not there you&#x27;re there the ultimate camouflage this is what&#x27;s being developed today not making things zoom up into space anti-gravity but using Mass using extended gravity to move you in time if you work in that field I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t say anything about it but if you can if you&#x27;re studying the effects of extended Mass gravity modification of time I and my viewers would like to know because of you the truth is out there</p>
