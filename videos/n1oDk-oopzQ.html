            <p>would you believe me if i told you that there was a secret government organization that was covering up the existence of aliens and ufos since the 1940s i&#x27;m talking about the majestic 12. the story goes that 1947 after the supposed ufo crash in roswell harry truman signed an executive order creating this clandestine group among its ranks were scientists military leaders and government officials who were charged with looking into and covering up alien visitation to earth old documents were uncovered in the 1980s by ufologists timothy good and jamie chadera that made reference to this group seemingly adding weight to this theory however it&#x27;s largely thought that these memos were forgeries or part of a larger hoax but what do you think was mj 12 actually a real organization or was it just a hoax after all we do have organizations today within the government that do look into this phenomenon so it&#x27;s interesting to think about let me know what you think in the comments</p>
