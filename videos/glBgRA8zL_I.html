            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this is channel that is dedicated to educating the public on uh very obscure and esoteric things that the channel feels should be spread more widely uh usually like cosmologies theories of everything all-encompassing theories that you can incorporate into your life and um they would enrich your life if you did today is video number 344 I believe possibly 345 I think 344 on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey Bernard Larson and Mr Larsson was an engineer who lived in the 20th century and uh he died back in 1990 but not before he wrote uh a dozen or more books and about 50 articles and gave a lot of talks on different aspects of the reciprocal system basic gist of the reciprocal system is that we live not in a universe made out of matter not in a universe made out of energy or force or anything else but we live in a universe that is made entirely out of motion and motion for Larson was the relationship between space and time and uh in Larson formulation space and time both have three dimensions as does motion and uh that&#x27;s what Larson calls coordinate time and coordinate space uh space and time are reciprocals of one another they don&#x27;t exist uh separately they only exist together in motion and uh they can be abstracted so that you can pretend that they exist separately but they don&#x27;t uh if they do they uh one would exist with uh one unit of motion so that would be um you can think of motion as a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time space as the denominator such as speed speed is the most basic uh form of motion that we know of speed is space over time the bicycle is moving 15 mil hour 15 miles of space in one hour of time space over time all other forms of motion are also relationships between space and time uh fractions with timer space as the numerator space or time as in the denominator but space or time can have three dimensions and space or time also have what they call their CL clock aspect which is a scalar motion this is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no Direction no specific Direction other than in or out and you would Envision this using a balloon with dots on it blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away away from each other but in no specific direction that is the progression of space or clock space the flow of space and uh that was also um observed by the Hubble telescope all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other um and it&#x27;s also seen in a clock the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but in no specific Direction as a scalar motion and uh scalar motion was is known by the Legacy science Community but not uh it has not been investigated or discovered to be uh fundamental uh they consider it to be kind of a uh Backwater um anomaly of motion but in Larson&#x27;s formulation scalar motion is the most fundamental um and it is the basis of his Universe of motion so he calls that clock time and clock space and then uh space and time also only come in discrete units meaning that there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time Quantum uh Quant of time and space and you have to have at least one unit of time and space and/or space to have anything and then if you have one then in order to uh go to the next unit you have to have a full two units there are no fractional units there are no negative numbers oh only the integers and um if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have what Larson calls unit speed or the speed of light and so this speed of light in all directions uh outward at all all directions is really the what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system uh this is the default motion of the universe this motion is always occurring uh and this is the most fundamental motion uh you could call it the zero point uh or the null point or The Ether third the origin um the background motion of the universe is outward in all directions at the speed of light and then from there that is where you make your measurements from so that&#x27;s your kind of your reference point and then uh you measure are you going faster than this or slower than this unlike the uh Legacy scientists who are making all their me measurements from zero motion and that makes sense in a universe of motion you have motion before you have anything else and motion is underlying the whole thing so um you make your measurements from a certain motion and then he Larson refers to that as displacement uh whether you are going faster or slower than that uh reference um null uh null Point um and um so therefore in Larson system half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light and half is moving slower Larson refers to these as the cosmic sector and the material sector um the Legacy scientists only know about the material sector hence Einstein&#x27;s dictum that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe he&#x27;s neglecting an entire half of Larson&#x27;s Universe uh the cosmic sector and then um there&#x27;s also what you would call so that is the major boundary in the universe is the speed of light boundary if you cross that speed of light boundary the rules invert uh the cosmic sector and the material sector seor are basically reciprocals and so uh in the cosmic in the material sector you have coordinate space and you have clock time but in the cosmic sector once you cross that speed of light boundary you invert the roles of space and time and you end up with coordinate time and clock space in the cosmic sector then there is also the unit boundaries within each sector within the material sector you have what Larsson refers to as the time region and the time region is this kind of region of abstraction where you basically neglect uh the idea of space because you do not have a full unit of space um and so within one unit of space you have this region of action that Larson calls the time region it&#x27;s time only because you uh uh you don&#x27;t have space if you uh and since time and space are the contents of the universe it&#x27;s got to be one or the other or both so if you don&#x27;t have any space because you don&#x27;t have a full unit of it then you only have time and the same uh and so this is the realm of the microscopic the atoms and molecules of um the material sector same is true in Reverse in the cosmic sector if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time then you only have space and that&#x27;s what Larson refers to as the space region within the cosmic sector and this is your realm of cosmic microscopic um activity Cosmic atoms and Cosmic molecules what L uh what Larson refers to as Cosmic atoms and molecules what the Legacy scientists refer to as antimatter okay now um today we are uh reading the third installment or the third paper from Dr Bruce pet who was uh one of the uh illuminated uh uh revisers of Dy Larson uh who began uh his work in the probably in 198 80 s and um he passed away in 2020 but he along with Dr Bruce Bruce pet Dr kbk neru the two of them came up with what is called rs2 the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system so they took Larson&#x27;s system in the spirit of Larson system and made a few Corrections uh of mistakes that they claimed claim that Larson made and Larson did admit that he was subject to error he believed that the system itself was correct but that he could make errors in his application of the system and hence we have this re-evaluation rs2 and so this paper is called rs2 103 uh we just went through rs2 101 and rs212 so this is the third uh installment here of this uh series I believe there are nine of them and I think we&#x27;re going to look at all of them um and so you&#x27;ll be able to see kind of the thinking of pet and also the thinking of Larson and uh you know what pet is saying that Larson is missing out on and uh you can so you can kind of Judge that and then to see what in what direction uh pet goes here and I think this one here RS 2103 is really compelling because what lson uh what pet does is he takes larsson&#x27;s two fundamental postulates which he you know uh explains here and um he shows that in addition to those two fundamental postulates which govern the physical Universe um Larson also needed four additional postulate to handle what he called the metaphysical Universe for his final book um the uh beyond space and time uh which has to do with metaphysics so has to do with you know life biology has to do with ethics and has to do with um mental phenomena thinking and memory and uh all of these kind of Life uh related things that are are not covered um by his two fundamental postulates but when pet reformulates his two fundamental postulates he actually is able to get rid of those four metaphysical postulates because they now fit in so that is a I think that&#x27;s a major uh Improvement and uh we&#x27;ll see if you think so too okay rs2 103 uh submitted by Bruce Pratt in 2013 and um he&#x27;s quoting Larson here to start with at best therefore what we term knowledge is merely an approximation and the advancement of knowledge is essentially a process of arriving at even closer approximations to the ultimate truth fundamental that&#x27;s the end of the quote fundamental laws and principles are no exception even though they may have served us well and Faithfully in those fields wherein we have uh utilized them uh let me just check something I I think this also is a quote from Larson this is a different quote though okay uh fundamental laws and principles are no exception even though they may have served us well and Faithfully in those fields wherein we have utilized them thus far time comes that greater accuracy is needed we must replace them with closer approximations in order that progress may continue unimpeded the Carpenters rule serves its own limited purpose very satisfactorily but the marvels of modern machinery would be impossible without micrometer calipers or their equivalent from time to time therefore it is well that we should undertake a critical reexamine reexamination of our fundamental theory in order to determine whether it is still adequate to carry the additional burdens that our more advanced facilities for observation and measurement have placed upon it perhaps the branches of the tree may have become too numerous and heavy for the trunk to support okay now the section is called rs2 the critical reexamination rs2 is the critical reexamination of fundamental Theory using modern tools de developed by the computer industry such as matrices querian projective geometry and the resulting artificial reality commonplace tools we use and experience daily that were inconceivable when lson first published his book his first book in 1959 in keeping with larsson&#x27;s intent of a Theory of Everything one cannot have a set of rules for one situation and another for an analogous situation Larson was able to accurately Define the physical Universe in terms of space and time he did not need one set of rules for the atomic configuration space another for astronomy and another for mechanical interactions but when he encountered the living realm his level two biologic the postulates fell apart the rs2 reexamination targets two areas of the reciprocal system firstly to clarify the exact details of how the system works addressing concerns and issues brought out over the last 50 years the RS re by RS researchers and secondly to find out why the fundamental poates are not generally applicable to the other levels of existence and Define what can be done to correct that situation so that they are of General applicability again Larson changed his fundamental postulate at least five times before he settled on their final form then had to use a new set of postulates to continue from that point rs2 believes that is unnecessary that a simple modification of the postulates once again can open the door to a generalized set of postulates to include the other levels of existence that Larson documented as well as to clarify some of the inherent problems identified with his level one research or the physical Universe this section is called the new micrometer artificial reality the field of computer imaging has produced some very precise and detailed tools for the construction of artificial realities objects and images that appear so real that one has difficulty separating them from the observable objects in the physical Universe this is a big clue that these computers must be doing something right when reduced to their simplest form computers are nothing but binary bits which are grouped into scalers starting with integers magnitude only uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s basically what a scaler is something with magnitude only it has no units binary bits which are grouped into scalers starting with integers magnitude only that somehow manages to create virtual buildings virtual people planets and G galaxies sound familiar it should it&#x27;s the same process that Larson documented as the reciprocal system from scalers to the physical Universe uh that&#x27;s what Larsson referred to as his theoretical Universe he took his two fundamental postulates and through a process of deduction he derived a theoretical universe and then through his books he basically compared his theoretical Universe with that of the Legacy scientists now uh I went through that process of deduction in about 15 videos that I did about 10 months ago um so go back in the archives and look at those videos that are called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system Larson goes through 165 different steps um if this is true then that is true and then if this is true then that is true and then he so he derives a theoretical Universe uh kind of like this uh virtual uh doesn&#x27;t call it virtual what does he call it um uh virtual buildings virtual people planets and galaxies uh Larson calls theoretical Larson uh so it&#x27;s the same process that Larson documented as the reciprocal system from scalers to the physical Universe from scalar motion to the physical universe but with millions of man hours of effort refining the details of the process creating the artificial realities in the case of the computer programmers there are millions of man-hour going into this as opposed to just one guy D LaRon rs2 or the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system applies this new micrometer caliber of computer Imaging techniques to replace Larson&#x27;s Carpenters rule of the 1950s and expands upon Larson&#x27;s request that the system be reexamined regularly to see what these new tools can do to refine and clarify the system the primary tool in this virtual toolbox is that of projective geometry a technique that explicitly defines the process from converting a scalar magnitude sitting in the memory of a computer into an artificial reality that is nearly identical to that which we observe projective geometry has actually been around a long time it became popular with the Advent of computers and computer Imaging and was used by the military to convert spy plane photographs into three-dimensional Scale Models so they could figure out what the enemy was building and determine its abilities and limitations lson never provided a mechanism to convert scalar motion into coordinate motion other than probability projective geometry provides this solution in enormous detail the second tool in the virtual toolbox is the use of complex quantities to represent linear and rotational motion concurrently uh now you may uh remember from your high school uh algebra class um that you uh learned about complex numbers so a complex number is combination of a a a normal number and a an imaginary number and the imaginary numbers you might remember they were called I in particular I which is a square root of1 U which is imaginary um but there was also J and K uh which are went together with I they were all the square root of NE -1 and they interacted in various ways they basically are just 90° 90° turns um and so this is a way of being able to map kind of uh a linear motion and um circular rotational motion at the same time so a complex number is is like a plus bi I um so a number plus a number times that that imaginary number okay so uh the second tool in the virtual toolbx is the use of complex quantities to represent linear and rotational motion concurrently everyone is familiar with how you can define a point in space to determine a direction there is also another process using roll pitch and yaw um which is um I think from uh like the Air Force you learned that uh he says as any flight simulator will demonstrate so these are the different ways that you can steer an airplane and I believe these are also 90° turns uh a paret once he said that like so the rooll is like 90° this way then the pitch is up like that and then the yach is back like this so you have three separate 90° turns that are 90° apart from each other and um when you do all three of them you end up uh basically 180° away from where you were and facing in the opposite direction okay uh so there is also another process using roll pitch and yaw as any flight simulator will demonstrate the computer Imaging process discovered that they are actually geometrical geometric reciprocals of each other polar geometry is the inverse of linear geometry and what better tool than a geometric reciprocal for a reciprocal system of theory now I do wish that pet would go into a little bit more detail when he&#x27;s talking about this role pitch and yaw and these complex quantities and projective geometry in general he does have a footnote here at the end of the article where he talks about uh kind of the history of projective geometry but he doesn&#x27;t go into any detail about this role pitch and Yacht maybe in maybe in future articles he will do that but uh we are about halfway through this article right now and I&#x27;m going to stop it off now and um then um get into the second half of it tomorrow we should be able to finish it tomorrow um so uh you know again he&#x27;s just kind of going over the uh the techniques that he&#x27;s using to evaluate or re-evaluate the reciprocal system and particular projective geometry and complex uh complex quantities and U then in the second part he&#x27;s going to kind of put it all together and present larsson&#x27;s postulates and show that there&#x27;s a few flaws in them and that by making some very simple changes VOA we can get rid of all of the metaphysical postulates okay uh thanks for tuning in today have a great day and I hope to see you tomorrow</p>
