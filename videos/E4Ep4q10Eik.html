            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right how&#x27;s everybody doing out there welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas and I do educational videos today we&#x27;re looking uh this is our 30th video on the um reciprocal system of theory developed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century and updated uh by Dr Bruce perrett and others uh in the 21st century both of those people are sadly deceased and so the theory is in Jeopardy of falling through the cracks so we&#x27;re going to try to rehabilitate it here because I think it&#x27;s a very important Theory and it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s very uh leveling up Theory because it it gives people without a you know a you know a bunch of letters after their name uh with scientific degrees and stuff the ability to do science the ability to understand science um you know we don&#x27;t have to defer to a bunch of pointy-headed uh nuclear physicists or or astronomers or or whatever to be able to understand how this universe operates uh even in even technically so that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re getting into this one of the reasons um and uh right now we&#x27;re doing uh I believe this is the eighth video on um his book called beyond space and time this is this last book put out after he died and it&#x27;s uh his only book really on metaphysical stuff most of his books are on uh chemistry and physics and astronomy um but uh he&#x27;s got a couple books on economics but this is really uh the real squishy uh stuff the religion and the philosophy and um psychology things like that now uh we were talking last the last episode uh here about chapter five and in chapter five he&#x27;s trying to uh attempt to talk to us about uh what life is and uh now I&#x27;ll just go through a very basic thing about the theory again the universe is the his first postulate the basic uh part of the theory the universe is uh composed entirely of motion and uh let me just make sure I read it exactly um first postulate the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay now that is the nuts and bolts of his theory it took him 20 years to develop that then once he developed the theory uh the pastulate there&#x27;s another postulate too which is more in dispute and less germane but um he then he takes a deductive process and he says well if this then that if this then that if this and that and he constructs a full theoretical Universe out of that postulate okay like if this if this postulate is true then the universe looks like this um you know because if this and that if this and then that if this then that okay so what he eventually comes up with is you know the if the universe is composed of motion meaning it&#x27;s not composed of matter it&#x27;s not composed of energy it&#x27;s composed of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time which are reciprocals of each other and they both have three dimensions or they exist in three dimensions um now in Einstein&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe in Larson&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is really like the neutral point a meaning that there is a universe moving faster than the speed of light as well as the universe that we&#x27;re familiar with that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light so we&#x27;re kind of over here in this slower than the speed of light Universe which he calls the material sector I also calls it sector one but over here is the cosmic universe and in this Cosmic universe everything is moving faster than the speed of light he calls this sector two um and [Music] um we don&#x27;t know really anything about sector two um but we we know a lot about sector one because we&#x27;ve measured it and we&#x27;ve observed it and we&#x27;ve come up with theories about it and what he&#x27;s really saying is that when there is a reciprocal relationship between space and time that means that everything that we know about the material Universe can be applied to this Cosmic universe the only thing that you have to do is you have to reverse the roles of space and time so you know when you have a when you have something over here uh you also have it over here it&#x27;s just that the roles of between time and space are inverted okay so uh that is kind of where he&#x27;s coming from and uh that is where we&#x27;re gonna pick him up here where he&#x27;s talking in chapter five about life and um okay here he says a theory that has been established as accurate Knows No Limits meaning it can penetrate into the you know unknown realms other than those resulting from the finite capacity of the human Minds that develop its consequences he&#x27;s basically saying his theory is correct but whether he applied it correctly or not is another matter and that you know because he has a finite capacity to develop it but the theory is correct so you know the more human Minds that are employed on this task the better uh this theory is going to be now because of the finite limits to that capacity it cannot be claimed that all of the details that will be discussed in the pages which follow have been established with certainty but there is no element of uncertainty in the general conclusions the theoretical situation in general is clear and unequivocal the identification of the theoretical with the actual is positive and the status of the theoretical universe as a true and accurate representation of the actual physical Universe was definitely established okay so what he&#x27;s saying is in the first few chapters of this book He&#x27;s established that his theoretical universe that he&#x27;s deriving through the postulates and through deductive reasoning taking the postulates and saying well if the postulates are true then this is also true and then this is also true and then this is also true and he constructs a theoretical universe and then he Compares it with the actual universe now he gets ironically he gets in trouble doing that because the actual universe is often wrong the actual universe is the universe that has been determined by the uh pointy head scientists that I was talking about earlier that think they know everything and that put uh sentences in their textbooks that say scientists now know blah blah blah or it is now known that such and such and that is a lie they don&#x27;t know any of this stuff they have a best theory and if you if you talk to a real Top Flight scientist they will admit that they will admit this is just our best theory for right now you know we&#x27;re we&#x27;re looking to improve upon it um you know this is the best we&#x27;ve got right now and so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going with um but the kind of the rank and file scientific establishment is just like we know this now that we know this you know they&#x27;re very very arrogant in the way that they approach these things um they think that they are so smart and uh but then they make all these mistakes we won&#x27;t even apply this to anything that&#x27;s going on right now but um in this particular situation what we&#x27;re talking about is um that Larson has established his theoretical universe and uh it Compares very favorably with the actual universe developed by the scientist Larson says that only over 90 percent of his theoretical Universe uh you know matches up perfectly with the actual universe but in the Realms of the very slow the very fast the very large and the very small Larson&#x27;s Theory uh similar to Einstein&#x27;s uh you know Shores up a lot of the weaknesses of those theories uh the Newtonian universe is pretty much accurate for the kind of the macro day-to-day uh things that we need it for but when but it falls apart when we&#x27;re talking about things that are going really fast really slow or the things that are really large or really small and you know that&#x27;s where Larson uh provides a better alternative than Einstein&#x27;s in uh you know kind of um clearing up those discrepancies that&#x27;s why Larson has a book that&#x27;s called Beyond Newton because that&#x27;s where Larson really starts his you know um Corrections it&#x27;s not Beyond Einstein Einstein is uh you know more or less kind of put on the scrap Heap here by Larson um except for equals mc squared and um okay so now he says that um we are therefore on firm ground in concluding that the characteristics of a living organism which caused level two not to be confused with sector two um you know that&#x27;s where Larson really has problems is with his terminology he makes it very confusing I can&#x27;t really blame him because he&#x27;s trying to he&#x27;s trying to do science but he has to come up with a whole new language as well so you know the language itself is a little bit cumbersome but he calls it level to a living organism level two are the so the the characteristics of a living organism level two are those theoretically applicable to sector two the inverse or Cosmic sector of the universe so he&#x27;s saying that the characteristics of a living organism are those applicable to sector two this faster than the speed of light part of the universe that&#x27;s where life uh that&#x27;s where life phenomena comes from this does not mean that the biological organism is a sector to structure okay now again we&#x27;re saying that over here we got the material sector over here we have the cosmic sector in the material sector we have things like atoms and particles atoms and Aggregates so in the same way in the cosmic sector we have atoms Cosmic atoms Cosmic uh particles Cosmic aggregates um now and and everything else the same kind of characteristics now he says it is not possible for a purely sector 2 structure a cosmic motion or combination of motions to exist more than momentarily in the material sector of the universe okay meaning that if you if you put a uh faster than light uh Adam uh Cosmic atom over here in the material Universe it will um Decay immediate immediately it it&#x27;s not stable it&#x27;s unstable in the same way if you put a material sector um atom over here in the cosmic Universe it will immediately decay um because it&#x27;s unstable in that environment so the the the the material sector environment is not a stable situation for a cosmic atom a cosmic atom can&#x27;t go over there and exist on its own but um emotion or combination of motions of the cosmic type may exist as a minor constituent of a material structure okay so the this Cosmic atom can go over here and kind of glom on to a material atom and uh be part of a a be a minor part of it so it can exist over here in this unstable Zone if it kind of gloms on to something that&#x27;s already stable and um uh you know serves just as a minor constituent of it in such a case the reaction of the material set structure as a whole to environmental conditions may be determined in whole or in part by the minor component meaning that this minor component that goes over into this other sector will affect uh will affect the that that body it will uh create certain effects there in that event it is appropriate to say that the total structure is under the control of the cosmic component okay so he eventually does call these uh control units the total structure is under the control of the cosmic component the term control being employed in a purely mechanical sense as in the control of room temperature by a thermostat so you know you can turn your thermostat up and down and that controls the environment the temperature of that room in the same way this this Cosmic atom Cosmic entity can come over here and be a minor component just like a thermostat is a minor component of the room but it controls the environment okay the theoretical analysis thus tells us that a living organism is a compound structure it is a material or sector one aggregate connected with and under the control of a cosmic unit the cosmic unit is the something new that we saw uh in chapter five uh is essential to account for the differences between the living and the non-living okay now he gets into some more of this philosophizing that he does which is really just kind of looking at the literature that&#x27;s already out there and again Larson gives in my opinion far too much credit to the scientific literature that&#x27;s already out there um you know he&#x27;s writing for that audience and I think it it it uh in many ways kind of destroys not destroys but diminishes uh his analysis of his own system because he gets bogged down in in answering to and and legitimizing you know the the the literature that&#x27;s already out there I think he would he would do better if he just paid attention to what he was doing I know he wants to contextualize things and he wants to put himself into the um you know into the conversation um in the appropriate place but you know page after page after page of this stuff um okay um now I would like to at least begin to talk about um where he okay it is clear from the theoretical considerations that the inanimate structure with which the sector 2 unit is associated must be a relatively large and complex compound in order to have the sector 2 unit as a minor component this collusion is corroborated by The observed fact that the polio polynucleotide the giant organic molecule which is the basis of Life as we know it is the end product of the process of increase of complexity by means of aggregation there are many larger structures to be sure but these are simply Aggregates of smaller individual units and they do not have the structural complexity of the large organic molecules and he&#x27;s quote somebody here DNA is the largest molecule known containing in advanced organisms such as man as many as 10 billion separate atoms if it were possible that&#x27;s the end of the quote if it were possible to produce the behavior characteristics of life without utilizing the most complex molecules available we would now have at least a few living organisms based on less compact complex structures in fact the greater probability of the occurrence of simple simpler units suggests that if simpler units simpler living structures were possible they would now predominate but the evidence indicates that the polio polynucleotides such as DNA are the very essence of life so far as its material aspect is concerned and this means that the development of molecules of this type was a prerequisite for the emergence of life on this basis such molecules are not only the most complex units that are available they are the least complex units that will serve the purpose so he&#x27;s saying right here that DNA even though it is the most complex uh um molecule it is the least complex molecule that will actually accommodate life and uh he then he&#x27;ll he will go into the numbers here and talk about the uh inter-regional ratio we&#x27;ll be uh going back into that tomorrow then so today uh we just kind of wanted to figure out what is life life is a combination of a cosmic component and a material component but the cosmic component is just a minor aspect of it all right we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow</p>
