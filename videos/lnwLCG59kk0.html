            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right how&#x27;s everybody doing out there tonight and welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel we focus on highlighting different theories of everything that have been important in my life and that I&#x27;d like to share uh because they&#x27;re pretty obscure and uh not too many people know about them at least in detail so we have been doing a deep dive on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson believe today is our 374th uh video on um the reciprocal system and Larson calls it a system of theory because it is a Theory of Everything meaning that um if you understand the theory and how it works you understand the system you can apply it to any subject that you&#x27;d like um you just have to figure out how it plugs in and so it is uh has revolutionary potential uh doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s easy in fact quite the opposite it uh is not really that hard um what makes it harder is that you have to unlearn a lot of things that you&#x27;d already thought you learned um that turned out to be wrong and uh there are you know a few kind of quirky things that you have to have to learn you have to it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not an easy study but I believe it really does pay off over time and it just gives you a key that helps you unlock the doors it also helps you kind of organize things in your own mind that are already there um you may have a thing here and a thing there and another thing over there and they&#x27;re all kind of separate but then when you can kind of uh download a uh a system of theory you can plug all of them into that and then you can see how they relate and how they interact okay um now the uh basic idea behind the reciprocal system was articulated by Mr Larsson uh in his two fundamental postulates back in uh the late 1950s and then he took those two fundamental postulates and he he uh went through a process of deduction this was outlined in my videos uh about 15 of them that I did uh nearly a year ago called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system and this was a paper that he gave must have been a very long paper but uh it was a paper that he gave um that explained is really all 165 steps of deduction that he went through to get from his fundamental postulates to what you would call his theoretical universe so this basically creates a theoretical Universe for Larson of like how the universe would look if his uh logically if his uh system if his postulates are correct and then in his books he Compares his theoretical Universe with that universe that was discovered observed and measured and um compiled by the uh Legacy scientists in whatever field whether it&#x27;s economics or chemistry or physics or astronomy um these people have various find ings and in many cases they have laboratory tested tables of uh data and Larsson Compares uh his Larsson comes up with the same he recreates those tables uh in uh strictly from Theory so he goes through his process of how he gets these certain equations that pop out of the reci iCal system and then he applies the equations to the various uh uh for example the basic properties of matter and then he writes up his own scientific tables basically theoretical scientific tables and Compares them with the uh actual laboratory tested scientific tables and uh in the vast majority of cases he&#x27;s like with in one tenth of 1% of uh the table values and then when he&#x27;s not uh there&#x27;s usually a good reason and a lot of times that reason is that the table is wrong so um it&#x27;s interesting to look at um uh The Logical conclusion that I would draw is that if he&#x27;s able to do this uh he&#x27;s doing something right uh there&#x27;s something right about the theory um I&#x27;m not saying that everything is right and I don&#x27;t believe Larsson would have said that either and he did have revisers among whom uh Dr Bruce pet and Dr kvk neru Who will be hearing from here today but uh they believe that the theory itself is correct whether they are able to uh agree with every aspect of his dar ation of the theoretical universe is a different uh story and they had some revisions that they&#x27;ve made in what they call rs2 the reciprocal system 2 or the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system neru in particular um was instrumental in uh redesigning the um the theory behind the photon uh for Larson the photon is a simple harmonic motion a wave um Larson derived his wave structure by combining two um normalized or orthogonal uh motions a translational motion and a vibrational motion that was 90° apart from the translational motion so when you combine those two you get a wave nuou uh gets his Photon uh from a bir rotate two bir rotating motions that when you combine them together you also get a wave which is uh something that uh Leonard Oiler um the great 18th century mathematician uh had uh derived I believe he called it the Epsilon function and um lson wasn&#x27;t down with that because Larson believed that you can&#x27;t have rotational motion until you have something to rotate so Larson kind of downgraded rotational motion as being really a secondary motion and uh both pet and nebu uh thought that rotation was primary and that is kind of a little bit what we were talking about yesterday with the article uh from Bruce paret on the da of Larson um paret is really saying that uh well this this translational motion is really like a Yang motion but the rotational motion is a Yin motion so they both are primary both of them uh have a Primacy to them and you need to be able to see rotational motion as uh just as sustainable and just as primary as a translational motion where Larson is and really that the vibrational motion is a secondary motion that only comes from the combination or interference of two of those other kinds of motion so that is a that&#x27;s that&#x27;s an example of how pet and nou uh had kind of different concepts uh than Larson um in particular in this case due to their exposure to Dost philosophy uh that Larson probably didn&#x27;t have and that he although there&#x27;s certainly evidence that Larsson did know something about doas philosophy uh but um you know it was just kind of a different a different approach and so they were able to come up with a result that I believe um makes more sense um you know with all of the other data if if you&#x27;re looking at quantum mechanics and the the different uh light uh the different properties of light um are more easily explained using a bir rotating Photon than they are using a uh a photon that is uh coming from a combination of a rotation and a vibration anyway um the basic idea en Lars two fundamental postulates just to read his first postulate which is by far the most important is that uh the universe is composed entirely of one component motion exists exting in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so that is the first postulate basically saying that uh the universe is made out of motion motion is a relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of one another meaning that they are identical to one another except that they are inverses and that they are uh have so whatever quality one has the other also has but they actually don&#x27;t exist at all separately they only exist together in motion motion is a fraction uh with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator only uh space and time can have multiple dimension Dimensions both of them and that um uh the kind of motion that Larsson is referring to is called a scalar motion this is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction so you can Envision this like a um like dots on a balloon if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction this is a scalar motion and was uh is a Bonafide kind of motion as identified by um the scientists uh Hubble uh way back in the 1920s determined that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and um that is a scalar motion and um but the scientists have not really uh given scalar motion it&#x27;s due as uh as being a central important kind of motion they&#x27;ve looked at it as kind of a sideshow Larsson put it at the center of his theory and uh then also the discrete unit postulate both time and space come only in discrete units there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time a Quantum a minimum unit of space Quantum and if you don&#x27;t have a full unit you don&#x27;t have any and uh so it goes like that uh that&#x27;s uh just a short version now we&#x27;d like to I believe Mr neru Dr neru is going to go into some of this in this article uh it&#x27;s called technology in the Aquarian age and uh this was written by n quite a while ago I think way back in the in the &#x27;90s sometime and so um I&#x27;m not reading it as much for his ability to kind of um predict the future as to kind of looking at the reciprocal system and how it can be applied to uh technology all right epic making discoveries or breakthroughs in science have always faced the barrier of official recognition before eventually gaining Universal acceptance there are indications that the present generation is on the threshold of a new era of scientific development Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system is revealing Realms of existence not limited to the O age-old concepts of space and time a magnificent World experience is in the offing okay this section is called limitations of forecasting breakthroughs and science science technological forecasting depends on the knowledge of two things the state of the present technology and the trends in the techn technological development it is implicitly assumed that the trend could be extrapolated on the basis of our knowledge of its prevenient changes this works as far as it goes but miserably fails as to correct forecasting if unforeseen developments take place which take knowledge into a new Dimension uh or perspective such a breakthrough for example in science had occurred at the turn of the present Century 20th century when MOX plank discovered the Quantum of action this changed the entire course of development of the science and hence of technology and resulted in the present technological Society bringing in its wake altered human values as we are fast approaching the end of the present Century Humanity might be in for another of these unforeseen breakthroughs in fact there are already indications that pressage this age of new science of Technology it is a truth that every time such a breakthrough has occurred the people of the time hardly succeeded in seeing its implications nearer to the mountain one always misses its majesty and magnitude it is only in the historical retrospect that one can see these developments in their true significance it would invariably be the case that such a breakthrough would be too far beyond the Ken of the scientific establishment of the Epic that hardly any so-called official recognition is ever bestowed on it Plank&#x27;s case is itself a classical example but for fortunately truth prevails and a succeeding generation would be quick to see it okay this section is called Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system this time such a revolution in science seems to have already taken place silently due to the researches of Dey B Larson into the nature of the most fundamental entities of the universe space and time his reciprocal system a system of theory rather than merely a theory might be the single theory of the 21st century of the entire physical universe or at least would be the nucleus from which such a theory might emanate a new science would engender new technology new technology and new culture and set of values a forecast of this new technology is not possible unless uh is not possible since the full implications and the ramifications of the new science are not yet known however enough of them is already known to establish its imminence therefore some of the highlights of the reciprocal system will be mentioned here to indicate the nature of the revolution in the offing this section is called The Familiar SpaceTime concept for over 3,000 years the preva ing conception of the universe in which we live has been a universe of matter set in a background of three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time both the scientist and the common man have subscribed to this view unswervingly indeed it has been so deep rooted in our mental makeup that we tend to think of even abstract things as embedded in space we see the drama of the universe unfolding on the stage of space and time during the EB and Tide of scientific thinking so many Concepts have undergone radical changes but this concept of setting in space and time is the only one that remained unchanged Larsson discovers that this concept is untenable he finds that the basic constituents of the physical Universe are not units of matter but units of motion space and time being the constituents of scalar motion then become the content of the universe and not a setting Larson demonstrates that our familiar three-dimensional spatial system of reference is a very limited reference frame one of its deficiencies is that it cannot represent some type of physical processes some types of physical processes at all while it cannot represent some other in their TR some others in their true nature all the long lasting problems in science are due to the ignorance of this fact even to the present day the enormous success and Prestige of the scientific of science notwithstanding there is no understanding of many fundamental entities in science the question what is electricity illustrates one case lack of explanation of the origin of gravitation or how it cannot be screened off is another while the mathematical aspects of the constituents of an atom are well known there is an utter lack of conceptual understanding of their intrinsic nature indeed by the consideration of the set of properties the scientists are driven to ascribe to these hypothetical constituents of the atom the scientists deny that they belong to the realm of reality that we otherwise seem to comprehend this section is called the dawn of the the grand unification Theory most strenuous efforts of generation after generation of scientists have consistently failed to produce the much sought-after Grand unification of the various types of basic forces that pervade the physical Universe Larsson has shown that this was due not to the lack of intellectual Acumen on the part of the investigators but to the fact that they all without exception had subscribed to the wrong fundamental Concepts about the nature of the basic constituents of the universe this discovery leads him to the development of the first truly General Theory of physics besides resolving all the recalcitrant difficulties in the conventional theories the insights gained through the reciprocal system to the extent one is able to comprehend its altogether new line of approach unmistakably points to breakthroughs in the Technologies of energy generation transportation and the like and uh then this section is called the future potential of the reciprocal system science depicts all existence to be embedded in space and time as such there is no room in such a scientific attitude for uh aerating the reality of the existence of those intimate human values aesthetic cultural and spiritual by demonstrating the true status of space and time the reciprocal system removes the bar against the possibility of Realms of existence not limited to space and time and thereby opens the door for a new science that does not entail a spiritual vacuum though it is too premature to Endeavor to forecast the actual effects on the future of human civilization of this new science it is not not difficult to foresee the holistic World experience that they are going to bring forth and that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s inter that&#x27;s the end of the paper um he uh this he he sounds this last paragraph sounds very much like Larson&#x27;s own book Universe of motion his book on astronomy at the very end says you know this physical stuff is not the end the space and time is not the end of this reciprocal system study this takes us beyond space and time and that was the name of Larson&#x27;s final book that came out after he died um came out in 1995 probably about the same time that this article did um beyond space and time and that is on a book on metaphysics which includes you know psychology and philosophy and religion and biology these things uh a lot of them at least uh you know tend to be outside the um purview of you know hard uh science and you know into the kind of the squishy Sciences and so uh but Larson and economics as well and Larson is putting these uh through his uh deductions being able to go beyond space and time uh is able to put these things on a hard scientific footing and being able to do that is I think uh going to lead to breakthroughs once people recog ize that this is what&#x27;s going on N comments that this you know probably 30 years ago when he was writing this he&#x27;s saying that you know this is going to be the science of the 21st century well unfortunately it might be the signs of the 22nd century at the rate that people are picking up on this um but uh eventually and I mean that could be true you know if you look at uh cernic uh views on um heliocentrism and so on it took 50 years or more before those ideas were accepted by the scientific community in at large uh took all the way up until Newton&#x27;s principia in 1687 to really um solidify all of the uh Paradigm breaking findings that uh kernic us and Bruno and Galileo and you know those kind of people were um putting forward uh throughout the 16th and early 17th century so you know it could take forever for these ideas to be accepted but it it I believe it is inevitable and you might as well get used to it might as you know might as well get ahead of the curve and figure this stuff out now um and then by the time there&#x27;s a demand for it you&#x27;re already an expert and you can plug yourself right in um that&#x27;s the way I see it for me um but uh you know could be I might have to live another hundred years before that um um you know that happens but I&#x27;m prepared to do that so uh I&#x27;ve studied up on some other stuff uh longevity stuff and so I&#x27;m ready I&#x27;m ready to go for the Long Haul here uh now Neu does leave behind three specific books that he recommends for more reading on the reciprocal system that is larsson&#x27;s nothing but motion this this is really the a Trilogy of Larson&#x27;s um structure of the physical Universe which is a three book set this is the second edition of those books which originally came out in 1959 but then uh during basically the 1980s Larson put out um nothing but motion which is more or less on Atomic physics um and then basic properties of matter which is on chemistry and universe of motion which is on astronomy and then together with uh his final book beyond space and time those are the four particular books that I&#x27;ve gotten the most out of studying now Dr pet is uh favors uh some other books like neglected facts of science um I&#x27;m I&#x27;ve read that book but I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m in the process of going over it again and um there are several other important books that has written but if you want to start with four uh those are the four that I would start with as well nothing but motion Universe of motion basic properties of matter these are all and these are all inspiring too because um especially for somebody like me like I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;m planning on living long enough to see this through and uh these are all books that Larson wrote when he he was in his 80s or 90s Larsson was born in 1898 uh just recently would have celebrated his 125th birthday and um these books came out basically in the 80s I think that uh nothing but motion came out in 79 when Larsson was would have been 81 and then uh Universe of motion is from &#x27; 84 basic properties of matter is from &#x27; 87 so he is in his mid uh in his 80s when he put out all of his Magnum opuses and then beyond space and time was postumus so um you know it&#x27;s inspiring that uh this person you know didn&#x27;t get any success or credit in but he kept with it and by the time he got into his 80s he was pounding out you know the his highest quality work so uh that&#x27;s also inspiring and then [Music] um uh just uh just a quick comment about where we&#x27;re headed here I&#x27;m going to I&#x27;m going to look through some of larsson&#x27;s Articles and see if there are any important articles that I&#x27;d like to read here uh in this format um and then we&#x27;re going to move into um two other books now we&#x27;ve already gone through the the majority of lar &#x27;s book nothing but motion the book on Atomic physics uh next we&#x27;re going to uh go into covering his book on chemistry basic properties of matter the other book that we&#x27;re going to be covering uh before we move on to other subjects is larsson&#x27;s book called The Road to permanent Prosperity this is one of his two books on economics and it&#x27;s quite an interesting study in that he um you know attempts to move uh move um economics out of the social sciences and into the hard sciences and he comes up with a number of Fairly surprising conclusions um that fly right in the face of um your um Legacy economics uh in particular kyian economics but really all forms of Economics very surprising results in terms of like supply and demand and in terms of um inflation in terms of you know how to actually fix an economy and um I don&#x27;t firmly understand it but I&#x27;m I&#x27;m working on studying it and so I think when we go through though uh uh that book um road to permanent Prosperity I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;re going to read the whole thing I I might uh uh try to do chapter summaries uh there&#x27;s quite a few chapters 25 or 30 um so I might try to do chapter summaries rather than uh reading the book I like to read the text verbatim you know because I&#x27;d like you to be able to get the whole whole uh flavor of of what they&#x27;re doing but at the same time um that takes a very long time to get through and I think you probably if you&#x27;ve been watching these videos you probably already kind of get the flavor so I&#x27;d like to kind of condense it at least in terms of the economics uh cuz I understand that being more of a liberal arts person myself and so I don&#x27;t want to like you know when I&#x27;m going into talking about Atomic physics I don&#x27;t really want to mischaracterize um what they&#x27;re saying what Larson is saying in particular because I don&#x27;t fully understand it so I&#x27;d like to be able to read it verbatim but um uh so that&#x27;s probably what we will do with basic properties of matter but with the um Ro</p>
