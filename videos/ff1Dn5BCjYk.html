            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Chinese scientist that was working on anti-gravity and she came from China to the United States to work on anti-gravity and she was working on some anti-gravity propulsion system and then vanished. This Chinese immigrant physicist claimed she had cracked one of science&#x27;s greatest mysteries. Her device could make objects [music] float in midair, defying gravity itself. The Pentagon believed her enough to write a check for nearly half a million dollars. Major science publications rushed to her Alabama laboratory to witness the impossible.</p>
<p>Then she vanished. No papers, no public appearances, no explanation whatsoever. Colleagues couldn&#x27;t reach her. Journalists hit dead ends everywhere they turned. She stopped publishing papers, stopped making public appearances, and before long, people began to wonder if this promising physicist who seemed to have unlocked the secret to anti-gravity had gone missing, or maybe worse.</p>
<p>For nearly [music] two decades, conspiracy theories exploded across the internet. Had she fled to China with classified American technology? Was she silenced by the government? Did she even exist at all? But when an obituary surfaced in 2021, her son finally broke his silence. The truth about Dr. Ning Lee&#x27;s disappearance is something nobody [music] saw coming. The woman who challenged gravity.</p>
<p>When Ning Lee arrived in the United States from China in 1983, she carried something more valuable than any luggage. She had a mind that refused to accept limits. By the early 1990s, this physicist at the University of Alabama Huntsville had begun asking a question that most scientists considered pointless. What if gravity could be controlled? The Center for Space Plasma and Aeronomic Research became her proving ground, working alongside physicist Douglas to Lee started publishing papers that made the scientific community uncomfortable. Between 1991 and 1993, she released a series of studies describing something that shouldn&#x27;t exist, a practical method for producing an anti-gravity field.</p>
<p>The theory sounded like science fiction. Lee proposed that spinning ions in a superconductor, when properly aligned, could create a gravitational force field, not reduce gravity, not shield against it, actually produce a controllable force that could attract or repel objects just like gravity does. She called it AC gravity. Think about superconductors as materials that conduct electricity with perfect efficiency. When cooled to extremely low temperatures, they develop strange quantum properties.</p>
<p>Lee theorized that at high rotation speeds, billions of aligned atoms in a superconducting disc could amplify their tiny gravitational effects into something measurable, something powerful. Her colleagues were split. Some dismissed it outright, others couldn&#x27;t find flaws in her mathematics. The papers passed peer review, which meant experts examined her work and found it credible enough to publish. That didn&#x27;t make believers out of everyone, but it meant her ideas deserved serious consideration.</p>
<p>By the late 1990s, Lee had moved beyond theory. She claimed actual experimental results. Weight changes in objects suspended above rotating superconductors. Small effects, yes, but effects nonetheless. Using just 1 kilowatt of electricity, she told reporters her device could neutralize gravity in a 1 ft diameter column stretching from Earth&#x27;s surface into space.</p>
<p>If true, the implications were staggering. Imagine spacecraft that don&#x27;t need massive fuel tanks because they&#x27;re not fighting gravity. Transportation systems where vehicles float effortlessly. Construction projects where heavy materials become weightless. energy generation transformed.</p>
<p>Even the hoverboards everyone joked about from Back to the Future might become reality. Popular mechanics sent reporters to her Huntsville laboratory in 1999. They photographed her prototype, a 12-in disc that looked disappointingly ordinary, like a car&#x27;s clutch plate. Lee explained that once complete, a bowling ball placed anywhere above it would simply hang in the air, motionless. The magazine published her claims, complete with photos of Lee and her team standing proudly beside their equipment.</p>
<p>But something was about to change everything. The company nobody could find. In 1999, Ning Lee made a decision that baffled her colleagues. She walked away from the University of Alabama Huntsville, left her position, abandoned the security of academic life. She started a company called AC Gravity LLC.</p>
<p>determined to commercialize her anti-gravity technology. This wasn&#x27;t just Lee jumping ship alone. Larry Smallley, the chairman of UAH&#x27;s entire physics department, left with her. When the head of your physics program quits a prestigious university position to join your startup that sends a message, either they&#x27;re both delusional or they know something nobody else does. Lee told Popular Mechanics she had turned down multiple investors.</p>
<p>Money wasn&#x27;t the issue. control was. Investors want control over the technology, she explained. This is too important. It should belong to all the American people.</p>
<p>Those words would become eerily prophetic. The Department of Defense agreed. Apparently, public records show that in 2001, the US Army Aviation and Missile Command at Redstone Arsenal awarded AC Gravity a grant for $448,970, nearly half a million to continue researching gravitational manipulation. The military wanted to know if Lee&#x27;s claims held water. Then the paper trail went cold.</p>
<p>No results were ever published from that Defense Department grant. No patents filed, no press releases. AC Gravity&#x27;s business license kept getting renewed year after year through 2018, but there&#x27;s no record of the company actually doing anything. No employees, no office that anyone could find, no product announcements, just a Delaware LLC that somebody kept legally active. Lee herself stopped publishing scientific papers entirely.</p>
<p>The woman who had been producing groundbreaking research throughout the 1990s suddenly went silent. Her last public presentation came in May 2003 at a MITER Corporation conference. MITER manages federally funded research for US government agencies. At that conference, Lee spoke about measurability of AC gravity fields. She presented alongside an official from US Army Aviation and Missile Command, suggesting her military research was still active.</p>
<p>Her final known communication came that same month. Lee sent a private email to colleagues claiming she had observed an 11 kW of output effect in an experiment. Whatever that meant, she never explained it publicly. After that email, Ning Lee disappeared from scientific discourse completely. Journalists tried to reach her.</p>
<p>Other physicists working in related fields sent emails that went unanswered. Her old academic contacts had no current information. It was like she had evaporated. In 2004, science journalist Tim Ventura became obsessed with finding her. Every 2 months, he tried the email address he had, lining at comcast.net.</p>
<p>The return receipts showed someone was opening those messages, but nobody ever replied. So, where was she? The conspiracy theories begin. The silence around Ning Lee created a vacuum that conspiracy theories rushed to fill. Online forums exploded with speculation. Had she been silenced, kidnapped, bought off? The lack of answers only made people more suspicious.</p>
<p>Eugene Pod Kletnoff, another physicist researching gravitational anomalies with superconductors, received one of Ventura&#x27;s emails in 2004 asking about Lee&#x27;s whereabouts. His response added fuel to the fire. Pod Kletnoff claimed Lee was fine, just working for the Department of Defense. That&#x27;s why she couldn&#x27;t discuss her research publicly, he explained. He didn&#x27;t have her current email or phone number either.</p>
<p>The DoD is a serious organization, he wrote, and he frankly had no idea how to reach her. That confirmation, instead of calming concerns, intensified them. If Lee was working on classified military projects, what had she discovered? What was the government hiding? The woman who said anti-gravity technology should belong to all the American people was now locked behind classification barriers. Then came July 2008. Physicist Jack Sarfat gave an interview that got posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>His claims were explosive. According to Sarati, Lee was no longer working for the Department of Defense. She had disappeared and allegedly returned to China. This is very important from a national security and political point of view, Sarati said on camera. One of the key scientists is a Chinese woman named Ning Lee.</p>
<p>She has disappeared and gone back to China. Sarati continued building the scenario. Lee had been working at NASA and Redstone Arsenal, he claimed, but had vanished for several years. People at the Pentagon couldn&#x27;t reach her anymore. She was allegedly back in China and the Chinese government was pouring money into similar experiments.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why our intelligence guys are very interested. Sarati explained, &quot;The most likely people to develop the first anti-gravity propulsion technology are the Chinese.&quot; The implications were clear. Sarati was suggesting Lee had taken American research funded by American taxpayers and the American military and handed it to the Chinese Communist Party. a brilliant Chinese American scientist defecting with cuttingedge classified technology. It fit every Cold War nightmare playbook.</p>
<p>The YouTube video spread. Discussion forums debated whether Lee had been pressured to return, offered money, or even coerced. Some speculated she had family in China who were being threatened. Others suggested she was a spy all along, embedded in American research institutions to steal technology. The conspiracy theories grew more elaborate with each retelling, and with Lee completely silent, there was nobody to dispute any of it.</p>
<p>The mystery deepened year after year until 2021 [music] when an obituary appeared. The obituary that raised more questions. Barry Hill Funeral Home in Huntsville, Alabama, posted a death notice on their website. Dr. Ning Lee had passed away on July 27th, 2021.</p>
<p>She was 78 years old. The obituary described her as one of the world&#x27;s leading scientists in superconductivity anti-gravity who had constructed the first 12-in HTSD of the world in the late &#x27;90s. That was it. No cause of death, no details about her life after 2003, no explanation for the 18-year silence, just confirmation that she had died in Huntsville, which contradicted every theory about her fleeing to China. But conspiracy theorists weren&#x27;t convinced.</p>
<p>The obituary seemed too simple, too convenient. Why would it appear so long after her disappearance from public life? Why were there no details? Some questioned whether the death notice was even legitimate? Maybe it was misinformation designed to close the book on uncomfortable questions about classified research. The obituary did include one crucial piece of information. It listed her surviving family, her son, George Guang Yu Men, and his children. That name posted publicly became a thread someone could pull.</p>
<p>Noah Logan, a journalist at the Huntsville Business Journal, started digging public record searches, business registrations, property records. Eventually, he found where George Men had registered a business. That business had a phone number attached to it. Logan stared at his phone, trying to figure out how to make this call. How do you tell someone their mother is the subject of millions of online conspiracy theories? How do you ask someone if their mother invented anti-gravity technology without sounding insane? The phone rang.</p>
<p>George answered. Logan introduced himself and carefully explained the situation, the YouTube videos, the conspiracy theories, the questions about what really happened. He asked if George would be willing to talk about his mother. George was gracious. He invited Logan to his home.</p>
<p>And while Logan was the first journalist to reach him by phone, he revealed something interesting. George had received letters before from people in New Zealand and other countries. People desperate to know about his mother&#x27;s research. The world hadn&#x27;t forgotten Ning Lee, but George had stayed quiet until that day. And now he was ready to tell the truth.</p>
<p>a son&#x27;s perspective. George Men sat in his living room with his two children beside him. Logan showed them the barely sociable video. George watched his mother&#x27;s story unfold on screen, narrated by strangers who had never met her, the dramatic music, the ominous implications, the theories about defection and government secrets. George started laughing, not mockingly, but with the kind of amusement that comes from seeing reality warped beyond recognition.</p>
<p>His children were fascinated. Their grandmother was internet famous for disappearing. The whole family found it surreal. &quot;My mother was very concentrated,&quot; George told Logan, choosing his words carefully. &quot;She concentrated on one thing and only one thing at a time.</p>
<p>She passed that down, too. She told us to find our one thing, concentrate on it with all you have, and don&#x27;t feel the need to compare yourself to other people. That philosophy had driven Lee&#x27;s career, but it also meant she compartmentalized her life strictly. Work was [music] work, family was family. She didn&#x27;t discuss classified projects at home.</p>
<p>George recalled asking her about her research once when the rumors and conspiracy theories started circulating online. Her response was immediate and clear. I said, &quot;Mom, do you need to tell me something?&quot; George remembered. She told me, &quot;First off, you don&#x27;t know anything. Second off, if you even think you might know something, you forget about it.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, that&#x27;s fine.&quot; That was the end of that conversation.</p>
<p>George never asked again, but he did notice changes in his mother after she left the University of Alabama Huntsville for the private sector. The academic world had suited her personality. She loved publishing findings, sharing knowledge, engaging in scientific discourse. That all stopped when she obtained top secret clearance. When she was at university, she loved to publish her findings, George explained.</p>
<p>But after she got her top secret clearance, she wasn&#x27;t allowed to share anything anymore with anyone. She became much quieter. The secrecy wore on her. George watched his mother&#x27;s demeanor shift over the years. She would return home from work looking exhausted, her makeup smudged, her energy depleted.</p>
<p>The vibrant scientist who had once eagerly discussed her theories with Popular Mechanics was gone, replaced by someone carrying the weight of classified knowledge. She would return from work looking worn down. George said it wasn&#x27;t like that when she was at the university. The job was taking a toll, but Lee kept working, kept researching, kept pushing forward on whatever project consumed her attention until 2014 when everything changed in a single terrible moment. The accident that changed everything.</p>
<p>Ning Lee crossed the street on the University of Alabama Huntsville campus in 2014. She had worked at Redstone Arsenal everyday for years, conducting research that remained locked behind classification barriers. At 71 years old, she was still sharp, still dedicated to her work. Then a vehicle struck her. The impact threw her body into the air, and standing nearby, watching it happen, was her husband of 46 years.</p>
<p>George&#x27;s father witnessed the woman he loved being hit by a car. The shock and horror triggered an immediate heart attack. He survived that day, but his heart never recovered. A year later, in 2015, he died. For Ning Lee, the physical trauma was catastrophic.</p>
<p>She suffered permanent brain damage. The injury triggered Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which began its cruel progression almost immediately. The brilliant mind that had challenged fundamental physics, that had theorized ways to manipulate gravity itself, started deteriorating. George became his mother&#x27;s caretaker. For 6 years, he watched Alzheimer&#x27;s slowly erase the person she had been.</p>
<p>People who knew about his situation kept asking the same question. How could you do that for six whole years? His answer never changed. First of all, she&#x27;s my mother. Second of all, she gave us a better life. Without her, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to come to the States and get my education.</p>
<p>Third, I just really admired her as a person. The woman who had immigrated from China in 1983, who had built a career in American physics, who had raised a family while pursuing impossible Theories, deserved that dedication. George found strength in his faith and support from his church community at the Chinese Christian Church of Madison. Caring for someone with Alzheimer&#x27;s requires learning a new language of non-verbal communication. George studied his mother&#x27;s expressions, her body language, her subtle cues.</p>
<p>He could tell when she was uncomfortable, even when she couldn&#x27;t speak. He tried playing Buddhism inspired music, remembering her cultural background. It didn&#x27;t soothe her. A member of his church suggested Christian hymns. George tried them, uncertain if they would work.</p>
<p>The change was immediate. His mother&#x27;s agitation decreased. Her breathing steadied. Somehow, those melodies reached through the fog of her declining mind and brought peace. For six years, George provided the care his mother needed.</p>
<p>He watched the disease progress, knowing that the classified research, the groundbreaking theories, the answers to questions millions of people were asking online would all die with her. The secrets of her work after 2003 remained locked away. On July 27th, 2021, Ningly died at age 78, taking all her knowledge to the grave. What really happened? George Men could finally address the conspiracy theories that had swirled around his mother for nearly two decades. Jack Sarfat&#x27;s 2008 interview claiming Lee had defected to China completely false.</p>
<p>She never left the country. She never stopped working for the Department of Defense. She never betrayed American research. But Sarat&#x27;s claim about Chinese recruitment wasn&#x27;t entirely fabricated. In 2008, Chinese government officials did approach Ning Lee.</p>
<p>They came to America specifically to meet with her and made their pitch. Return to China. Continue your research there. We&#x27;ll provide funding, facilities, support. Lee refused.</p>
<p>She had immigrated to the United States 25 years earlier. She had built her life here, raised her family here, conducted her research here. Despite the frustrations with classification, despite the isolation from the scientific community she once engaged with, she had no interest in relocating. George confirmed something even more telling. When Lee&#x27;s mother passed away in China, Lee attempted to return for the funeral.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities denied her permission to enter the country. Her own government wouldn&#x27;t let her attend her mother&#x27;s burial. I remember that so clearly, George said. She was very upset. That detail demolishes the defection narrative.</p>
<p>Why would China prevent a supposed asset from returning? Why deny her something as basic as attending her mother&#x27;s funeral? The answer is obvious. Lee wasn&#x27;t working for China. She was working for the United States on classified projects that made her a security risk in Chinese eyes. So, what was she actually doing all those years? George only knows what the clearance level tells us. It was top secret.</p>
<p>Freedom of Information Act requests filed by journalists and researchers have been denied. Whatever Lee discovered, developed, or concluded about anti-gravity manipulation after 2002 remains classified. Was her research successful? Did she actually create a working anti-gravity device? Did the Department of Defense fund a dead end? Or did they fund a breakthrough they wanted to keep secret? We don&#x27;t know. George doesn&#x27;t know either. What he does know is that his mother continued working at Redstone Arsenal until the 2014 accident physically prevented her from doing so.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s 12 years of continuous classified research. You don&#x27;t keep a scientist on payroll for over a decade if their theories aren&#x27;t producing something valuable. The government doesn&#x27;t waste money on failed experiments for that length of time. But here&#x27;s the frustrating reality. We might never know what Ning Lee accomplished in those classified years.</p>
<p>The answers are locked in government vaults, protected by security classifications that could last decades, maybe longer. The truth about anti-gravity research conducted with taxpayer money remains hidden from the taxpayers themselves until who knows when. The broader picture. Ning Le&#x27;s story doesn&#x27;t exist in isolation. Her research connected to a larger stranger pattern of scientists working on gravitational anomalies who faced similar trajectories promising early results.</p>
<p>Media attention then silence. Eugene Podlet, the Russian physicist, published papers in 1992 claiming he had observed weight reduction in objects suspended above rotating superconductors. His experiments reported effects between 0.05% 05% and 2.1%. Not huge numbers, but if real, they would revolutionize physics. After media leaks and intense scrutiny, Pod Kletenov withdrew papers and became difficult to reach for comment.</p>
<p>[music] The European Space Agency conducted their own tests in 2006. Over 250 experiments, 3 years of facility improvements, 8 months of result verification before making any announcement. They claimed to confirm a gravitational equivalent of a magnetic field when rotating a superconductor at 6,500 revolutions per minute. Then they backtracked, calling it instrumental noise. NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center, where some of Lee&#x27;s research connections existed, launched their own attempts to replicate these experiments.</p>
<p>They never completed a full replication. Their rotating mechanism only achieved 30 revolutions per minute when the experiments required 5,000 revolutions per minute. Incomplete tests can&#x27;t prove or disprove anything. This pattern repeats across the field. Researchers report anomalous effects.</p>
<p>Mainstream physics demands replication. Replication attempts use different parameters. Results don&#x27;t match. The research gets labeled fringe science and funding disappears except for military funding which continues in classified programs. The US Navy recently filed patents that sound eerily similar to Lee&#x27;s work.</p>
<p>Salvatoreé Pas, a Navy scientist, submitted patent applications for a PZO electricityinduced high temperature superconductor, a highfrequency gravitational wave generator, and a craft using an inertial mass reduction device. The patents were pushed through despite lacking working prototypes, with the justification being Chinese advancements in similar technology. Most physicists who review these Navy patents say they make no scientific sense. The technology described violates our current understanding of physics. Yet, the Secretary of the Navy personally vouched for them.</p>
<p>Why would the Navy&#x27;s top official stake his credibility on pseudocience? Two possibilities exist. Either it&#x27;s an elaborate disinformation campaign designed to make rival nations waste resources chasing impossible technology or there&#x27;s classified research that actually works and these patents are establishing legal ownership before it becomes public. Lee&#x27;s research might fit into this second category. Her theoretical papers passed peer review in the 1990s. She received substantial military funding.</p>
<p>She maintained top secret clearance for over a decade. She worked until physically incapable of continuing. None of that suggests a failed experiment. It suggests something valuable enough to classify and protect. But without access to her post 2002 work, we&#x27;re left speculating just like everyone else.</p>
<p>The questions that won&#x27;t die. The interview with George Men should have closed the book on Ning Le&#x27;s disappearance, but it only raised more questions. If she worked on classified projects for over a decade, what did she accomplish? The Department of Defense doesn&#x27;t fund scientists for 12 years on theories that fail. Consider the timeline. Lee received nearly $450,000 in 2001 to continue her research.</p>
<p>That grant officially ended in 2002, but she kept working at Redstone Arsenal until 2014, 12 more years. Someone was funding her work and believed it valuable enough to protect with top secret classification. AC Gravity LLC&#x27;s business license stayed active through 2018, 4 years after Lee&#x27;s accident left her unable to work and after she developed Alzheimer&#x27;s. Someone kept renewing that Delaware Company registration and paying annual fees. Why? George Men doesn&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Freedom of Information Act requests get denied, citing national security exemptions that can last 25 years or longer. Other researchers who worked with Lee maintain their own silence. Douglas to founded Faze Spacetime LLC after leaving the university, but no public information exists about his research. Larry Smallley, who left UA to join Lee&#x27;s company, reportedly died years ago without public statements. The patents filed by the US Navy in recent years described technology remarkably similar to Lee&#x27;s theories.</p>
<p>High temperature superconductors, gravitational wave generators, inertial mass reduction. Navy scientists vouched for these patents despite having no working prototypes, citing Chinese advancement in similar technology. China&#x27;s 2008 attempt to recruit Lee back suggests they took her research seriously enough to send officials to America specifically to offer her a position. Every piece of evidence suggests Lee&#x27;s [music] work produced something significant. Something valuable enough to classify and continue funding for [music] years.</p>
<p>Something that made her a security risk. Something naval engineers are still trying to develop today. The truth exists in classified files, hidden from the public who funded the research, protected by walls of secrecy that might not come down for decades. What&#x27;s more likely that Lee&#x27;s research failed and the government wasted millions? or that breakthrough anti-gravity technology is being hidden from us right now. Share your theory in the comments.</p>
