            <p>hello hello hello guys it&#x27;s been 30 years since my last major publication in gravity research and I thought it&#x27;s time to let you guys know what&#x27;s going on both in the field of anti-gravity research and a couple of points about what I&#x27;ve been doing and from now on I&#x27;ve decided to spend a lot of time getting you guys up to speed on the current state of the research in anti-gravity and walk you through some demonstrations that you can do pretty much at home with some materials and some things you can buy very inexpensively online to see actually how the the physics of gravity actually is working and it&#x27;s in my mind not very complicated [Music] well thanks for tuning in guys it&#x27;s a pleasure to be sharing some concepts with you today and a lot of things have changed in 30 years and on the positive side of things of course we have cell phones and internet that&#x27;s a big one and we&#x27;ve also got YouTube now pretty much anybody with an iPhone or an Android phone can self publish their work or their ideas to the Internet for the world to see and I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s a time to let you guys in on a few of the things that I&#x27;ve known for many years that explains what gravity really is and how it may be possible to artificially generate anti-gravity and light forces and if you stay tuned I&#x27;ll be walking you through a number of videos I&#x27;m not sure how many yet but I have a long list of videos on the drawing board and hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to put something out every few days or every few weeks so in this video I just want to walk through some of the research that has been done in the last 30 years in the gravity area that we know of of course they&#x27;re probably secret projects going on everywhere in in big aerospace companies and the military groups all over the planet but I don&#x27;t have access to that information but the public information I will be sharing and I&#x27;ll also be sharing some of the not in this video but the next video I&#x27;ll be making some demonstrations showing the original electro gravity theories that I published in 1987 how it works and you can actually put together some simple demonstrations at home with some very simple equipment to prove to yourself that gravity is in fact a pseudo force it&#x27;s not a real fun amount of force but it&#x27;s a side effect of other fundamental forces and I&#x27;m very excited to bring this to you as as a new video series and I do apologize for having been silent for 30 years more or less but I&#x27;ve been actually very active not only with raising a family and being busy with a career I&#x27;m gonna walk you through some things about gravity and anti-gravity research and a series of videos with demonstrations that you can pretty much put together at home in on in the garage or in the kitchen bench so you can see for yourself how gravity actually is a pseudo force it&#x27;s not a real fundamental force but it&#x27;s a side effect of normal electrical forces and I&#x27;m excited to see a new movement in the electric universe understanding of the cosmos although they don&#x27;t have figured out the math or the the motor or the battery behind the electrical fields of the universe I can I&#x27;ll be I am going to show some demonstrations on how the electrical universe model is quite accurate I don&#x27;t agree with everything they&#x27;re saying but I&#x27;m going to show you how how it is quite possible and I believe it is not only possible but how electro gravity feels between the bodies of the universe is the cause of a lot of the phenomena we&#x27;re seeing and the basic key that noticed other researchers in this field of gravity seemed to be missing is the concept of divergence there there have been several people both with theories and experimental devices and one test was done by NASA replicating the hooper device and all of these efforts are missing the single most important point about electro gravity and that is divergence of the of a field and how divergence actually pulls both smaller objects atoms and molecules and larger objects planets suns cars you name it towards the center of convergence of the field the field can be electric it can be hollow types of fields but when an X on a on the charges within atomic particles there will be a charge separation and the separation will cause a net force because the force on the positive and negative charges are not equal because they&#x27;re separated a little bit because of the polarization and that will cause that is actually the course of what we consider as gravity gravity is not a fundamental force that&#x27;s another fallacy that I strongly want our voice here gravity is not a fundamental force at the pseudo force it&#x27;s a side-effect of the divergence of a electrical type of field is actually a Laplace force that generates a electrical field that&#x27;s non she&#x27;ll double and without getting too theoretical here I want to just show you with a whole bunch of hands-on experiments simple experiments in my lab that you can replicate at home and see for yourself how gravity is in fact a pseudo force due to the dielectric separation of charges in in material things and how there is a net force on objects attracting towards the center of the field a couple of years after I published the basic electro gravity axioms through my website in 1994 dr. padlet no not sure how you say his name wrote up a paper for publication in 1996 and before he could even get it fully published that was leaked to a news organization in England and he got a bad rap from the University where he was working at the time in Finland the news organization was claiming that anti-gravity machines the big taboo subject of gravity have been salt and from what I wasn&#x27;t there before I understand he got fired or he got let go from the University and you had to go back to his homeland Russia and carry on his research and I think the paper that he had published or not published but submitted for publication was withdrawn and there was a whole flap around that whole thing but he actually claims he had rotating charges through some semiconductors I was supercooled and to me that sounds like a solid principle but unfortunately he was never able to get it replicated through some other organizations so his his work kind of is there but has some big questions around it and the BBC made a documentary on some of the anti-gravity research that&#x27;s been going on for the last I guess 20 or 30 years and his work was not it was not replicated and was not confirmed to be valid [Music] [Applause] [Music]</p>
