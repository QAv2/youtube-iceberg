            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>While investigating an old missing persons case,  I expected to uncover a cover-up or some forgotten   experiment. But I stumbled onto something far more  interesting: I figured out the key to antigravity. ♪ Intro Song (Instrumental) ♪ Humans have been fascinated with the idea </p>
<p>of antigravity for over 350 years now. It   then should be no surprise that modern  scientists are trying to achieve such a   thing. But with any advanced technology,  or more accurately powerful technology,   there are those who seek to keep it to themselves. </p>
<p>The people working on this have disappeared from   public view and their work has been restricted  by government entities. If people and ideas are   disappearing because of these entities, I  figure it&#x27;s because they found something   worth hiding. The biggest mystery was that </p>
<p>of Ning Li. When I began my investigation,   she was considered to have just disappeared.  And her inspiration, Eugene Podkletnov,   claimed to have already produced an  antigravity effect. What really went on here? It started with Eugene Podkletnov’s investigation </p>
<p>into the shielding properties of yttrium-based   superconductors against electromagnetic fields  in 1992. He began to notice it shielded more   than just electromagnetic fields. Gravity  itself began to be shielded against.</p>
<p>Thus   in 1997 he tried to replicate this result  and was successful. It perhaps should be   noted that at some point in the 2020s Russia  began to restrict scientific dissemination and   collaboration outside the country, and  possibly began even earlier than that.</p>
<p>Inspired by these results, on February 13th of  2001, Ning Li founded her company AC Gravity LLC.   She did some experiments and floated some ideas,  but mysteriously disappeared on June 16, 2004.   The company was left as still existing but was  not actively being used. It was a very strange   situation.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Jack Sarfatti, she  went back to China, but Eugene Podkletnov alleged   that she began working for the Department  Of Defense. After her death on July 27,   2021 it was discovered that she had in </p>
<p>fact died in America leading people to   believe she never left. It was later confirmed  that the Department Of Defense had a contract   with Ning Li and her company, AC Gravity LLC. in  an Annual Report on Cooperative Agreements and   Other Transactions.</p>
<p>In fact she was not allowed  back in China due to this agreement. Altogether,   it wasn’t that mysterious in the end, but the  lack of information being disseminated to the   public left everyone searching for a missing  person who was never missing.</p>
<p>Given the fact   that they hid her away for so long and recruited  her, I assumed she discovered some secret to   antigravity. While her work with the DOD is still  not publicized, I don’t see any indication that   progress was made. The whole situation was less </p>
<p>of a conspiracy and more of a mismanaged mess. But with the semi-recent Russian cut-off  of science outside the country combined   with this situation, they really go to show  how much countries of the world are willing   to cut off progress for humanity just  because they’re scared of each other.   And with our cryptid work, we can </p>
<p>see that they are even willing to   sacrifice their own citizens to do so.  But that&#x27;s a topic for another video. While Ning Li’s supposed disappearance is  the mystery that got me to look into this   in the first place, looking back at Podkletnov  is much more interesting.</p>
<p>He said he measured   the effect and people just didn’t believe  him. He even put controls in on the second   experiment to rule out outside forces like  buoyancy. Now we’ve seen how little it takes   for skeptics to write-off legitimate reports on </p>
<p>this channel, so what do you think it took here?   If your answer was 2 failed replications that  both got the parameters wrong from the get go,   you’d be right. Although a lot of people point  to a replication attempt by project GRASP,   but it has no evidence of actually existing. Aside </p>
<p>from Ning Li’s attempt where she didn’t even turn   the thing on, there was one attempt in Sheffield,  England and one by someone named George Hathaway. Sheffield’s Rotations Per Minute was 2500 higher  than it should have been, the disc was too small,   had an incorrect composition ratio of materials,  and had a coil that was 10 Megahertz too high to   name just a few parameters that were wrong.</p>
<p>And  this is the proof used to claim the experiment   cannot be replicated. As for Hathaway, his  Rotations Per Minute were 3000 too low,   couldn’t confirm the necessary junctions were in  the superconductor, had limitations in frequency   tuning, and had multiple differences in disk </p>
<p>structure. Of course these are the conditions   that are meant to prove a failed replication.  The RPM alone is off by thousands on both of   these. At best they show that inputting the  incorrect parameters will not produce results.</p>
<p>Of course for this research, I tried to  understand the terminology and physics,   and analyzed what the results might mean.  With this, I came up with my own idea,   and it seems to match what&#x27;s going on.  It also explains how to reproduce it. Conceptually, it deviates from the basics of </p>
<p>general relativity. Have you ever seen those   videos of the trampoline things that people  use to visualize the warping of space and   how it can create orbits and gravity? Well they  are helpful for predicting but I disagree with   the model. Einstein initially thought of this </p>
<p>model, where matter can warp space time, which   in turn looks like gravity. But particle physics  doesn’t always align with this. In the quantum   world everything is mediated by particles. So </p>
<p>why is Gravity the exception? A process where   one atom does something to another atom. Why  does that need the space warping middle man?   Why can’t it just send out a signal similar to  photons? It makes more sense on a quantum level.   This particle is then called a Graviton. This </p>
<p>is simplified but is the basic idea that got   me to prefer the Graviton model. In addition to  that, Podkletnov’s experiments were anisotropic,   meaning Gravity was only shielded in  one direction, rather than in a sphere,   which does not fit with the space warping  model but does fit with the graviton model.</p>
<p>When a Graviton hits another particle,  it disappears or is absorbed, which then   causes the particle to go towards where it was  hit from. Maybe this is because of absorption,   or maybe it is because of some quantum charge. The </p>
<p>specifics of how it does it aren’t necessary for   you to understand right now, especially because  most people wouldn’t have an answer anyways, just   know that this model has gravity interact with the  world like light, just a bunch of particles being   shot out and hitting other particles, with the  addition that it pulls what it hits towards it. This Graviton particle is what I figured was </p>
<p>being shielded. But how? What&#x27;s stopping it?   Well in superconductors, they can create something  called Cooper pairs. Basically superconductors   make positively charged space, which means a  bunch of electrons want to go there to even out   the charge, but multiple might go at once and end </p>
<p>up in the same spot in space-time. Effectively,   this makes 2 separate electrons become one  particle that we then call a Cooper pair. Now something about this situation  felt familiar to me.</p>
<p>In optics,   photonic crystals can trap light. So I figure  the Cooper pair is the photonic crystal and the   Graviton is the light. And this analogy created  my model, which fits with all the experiments.</p>
<p>To   make it more technical and objective I published  a 22 page scientific paper that I will leave in   the top line of the description but that&#x27;s the  general concept of the model. That paper has   instructions on how to try to replicate it so if  anyone has money or access to a superconductor,   feel free to try it yourself and see what </p>
<p>you can find out. This is not going to be a   new ASP categorization until more is proven  so I do hope someone pursues that if they   can. This could even begin to explain  the physics and technology behind UFOs.</p>
<p>Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed,   and Subscribe for more. Like the video  if you want more like this. Goodbye.</p>
