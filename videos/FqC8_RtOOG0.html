            <p>HH+ is a white compound whose exact formula is protected by the invention secrecy act, which keeps 5,784 patents under secrecy order. If a prototype threatens fossil fuel corporations, the usual course of action is classification and oblivion. We had access to several of these hidden patents, and thanks to them, we are developing these prototypes. But that&#x27;s also the reason we can&#x27;t market them. And that&#x27;s why you shouldn&#x27;t trust anyone who claims to sell them online.</p>
