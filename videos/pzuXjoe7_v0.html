            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] w [Music] Bas here has landed that&#x27;s one small step for man one for man I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world and yet I ask you is not an alien force already among us we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist now I am become death Dyer of world in my association with project groop they definitely withheld information a whole Fleet of them look on the sa they&#x27;re all going against the wind the wind&#x27;s 100 you Solly swear or affirm that the testimony you&#x27;re about to give is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you guys do you believe that our government is in possession of uaps absolutely welcome back to total disclosure everyone sorry about the tardiness uh that was uh my fault I over napped uh my alarm didn&#x27;t go off um I&#x27;ve been up since 3:00 in the morning so um you know I I that was my bad uh and then I had some tech technical difficulties had to reboot the computer obviously everything that can go wrong will go wrong always expect that uh but we&#x27;re here we&#x27;re live we&#x27;re with Teresa Tindle tonight um as usual when we&#x27;re live and we&#x27;re going to be talking about some emails that The Black Vault released between David crush and arrow uh kind of that go against uh what David grush told the public that he was never formally um contacted by them uh for any such interviews um but the email says otherwise um so there&#x27;s some controversy there as well as recently Declassified project called kona blue um I kept calling it Kota blue in my head and writing that but it&#x27;s kona blue even though I&#x27;ve been looking at the document probably nine 10 times uh we&#x27;ll bring Teresa in for this little rant um but hey Teresa how you doing hey Ty good to see you yeah it&#x27;s good to see you thank you for uh for for understanding my tardiness we&#x27;ve all been there you work really long days I don&#x27;t know how you do it 3:00 am. till I guess it&#x27;s 900 PM your time now that&#x27;s a long day Ty and you&#x27;re still completely loose it and have it together and you work a long day so yeah well it is what it is we&#x27;re here now like I said um we have we have a bunch of things to talk about and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s um there a new skiff meeting happened um but there is some the with the con of blue release came a lot of confusion and uh that&#x27;s what I want I I kind of want to talk about first uh because it I think it um so kona blue is a a remote viewing project that was proposed and from the looks of it some form of it did get through obviously we know uh things like project Stargate um with the CIA um and SRI happened um but uh this one got Declassified in a lot of all the slides of the proposed special Access program uh unacknowledged by the way this would have been so this would have been one of those projects that was buried so deep compartmentalized so much that you know Joe wouldn&#x27;t have known Tom was working with them um it&#x27;s one of those ones so I found it to be interesting that they Declassified this um but they did and it&#x27;s raised yet again the the attention to assap the program that was funded um by people like Harry Reid and D Daniel inway um back uh in the Skinwalker Ranch days uh and that&#x27;s Jim latsky he WR he ran that program the assap program by the time it had gotten to Lou alzando Who probably did head some form of government um uh AA meeting if you will like it wasn&#x27;t funded but they were doing it as a hobby so they had their day job and then they would go and they would task themselves uh and group together work together and try to keep this uh project up on its feet in hopes for more funding but atip was a moniker that was used to try to get special Access program so they could get extra funding for assap which again was the 22 million over multiple fiscal years I believe it was 10 million and then 12 million that was given over multiple years to Bigalow who won the contract from Harry Reid so there&#x27;s there no denying this that is how the New York Times had it wrong a tip was just a moniker so a tip was also what they picked up um to separate it from the funded program once Lando came around um and there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that he probably did had some sort of Investigation for the government for the Pentagon but it wasn&#x27;t funded it was more like a Grassroots effort um and that&#x27;s commendable in itself I I don&#x27;t understand why there&#x27;s been so much confusion around it it&#x27;s I guess the problem what so what that I have not heard of this Kaa blue so can you give us some background okay yeah well we&#x27;ll go through the whole we&#x27;ll go through the whole thing but this in particular so the community right now UFO Twitter is uh saying that and and and listen I listen I like Lu Alando I think he&#x27;s like I said commendable I think he his his CV speaks for itself um but there&#x27;s just been this this narrative that he has not himself fixed um and he John Greenwald um the black fault um as has recently called it back out and uh there was some some some some real Back in Forth if you will uh between him and Matt Ford of the good trouble show um and calling John Greenwell Jr an idiot but he&#x27;s not he&#x27;s not he&#x27;s right to be skeptical um he&#x27;s been doing this for 25 years so um this slide not not only does it not mention luel oando but it mentions only two people and those are the two people in the whole thing that are dead that you can&#x27;t go ask for questions right and that&#x27;s Senator Reed sorry Senator Reed and Daniel inway who&#x27;s also a decorated World War II veteran by the way he gave that speech um about the shadow government to the UN um about a a a the what I tied to the Michael Herrera um stuff uh a shadow government that operates outside governmental means that&#x27;s that guy that&#x27;s why they they secretly gave the money the 22 million uh because they knew that they that this was something worth studying Daniel had been in World War II he had heard stories of the Foo Fighters yada yada yada it goes on and on but uh Lou alzando does need to come out he he needs to come out of hiding um we know his book is done it&#x27;s going through the doser process um and uh I just I think Lou needs to clarify um a lot um I think there&#x27;s a lot um because he was the face of ufology for for quite some time and then just disappeared because of the pressure I mean for a guy who worked at the Pentagon uh pressure pressure from the public that&#x27;s the reason come on um Ty so do you think that that money that Senator Reed basically you know he gave the contract and the award to Bigalow is that what started the Bigalow Institute for Consciousness research it it&#x27;s what it&#x27;s what catapulted it yes yeah okay yeah that&#x27;s because nids which for people who are unfamiliar so Bigalow ran Bigalow has always been kind of a a a Nutty uh one of those nutty real estate guys um who got rich um you know uh in the 90s or 80s and 90s and he was always really fascinated by the the the the questions that we Ponder and then he had all of a sudden he had the money to do something and he created the nids a National Institute of Discovery Science um and that was more based in the UAP field that was more based in uh um physical craft uh uh that kind of stuff Advanced uh Tech propulsion uh that got him um you know in that time he also buil built up up a company called Bigalow Aerospace and he did that with the $22 million you he came from a family uh did you know he came from a family of experiencers I there&#x27;s no doubt about it there&#x27;s I mean there&#x27;s there&#x27;s something in this minutes I don&#x27;t remember if it was his parents or his grandparents who uh as a couple they had uh really Pro profound uh UFO craft experiences um and that and I don&#x27;t know if Bigalow is an experience through himself but I&#x27;ve heard him talk about that with his family um and I&#x27;ve actually had a a chance to talk to him a couple times he&#x27;s a great guy he&#x27;s really awesome so it sounds like that was kind of the seed money uh that he got the con the government contract to sort of to open the Consciousness studies and he he ran that famous contest uh anyone who could prove life after death um formerly and I forget who won but it was a guy from the Monroe Institute uh who won and who who had had previously been to the Monroe Institute which is a remote viewing they they they they teach you out of remote view among other um um cognitive abilities that you can unlock yeah so I went there I went there Ty it was there in Virginia not too far from where I lived and actually it was the Monroe Institute who directed The Army in their remote viewing programs so as the Army was developing its protocols for military remote viewing uh it actually sought consult it they consulted with uh the Monroe Institute and it was actually the Maro Institute had who had been using the B narl beats and they kind of had the protocols already so the army military remote viewing protocols really came from the Monroe Institute who had been doing this for a long time they&#x27;re very cool they&#x27;re very Cutting Edge they&#x27;re out there in the Beautiful You Know scenic areas of uh Virginia and um uh so it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that that&#x27;s uh you know who won big Low&#x27;s contest I remember contest um but I just I love Bigalow I think he&#x27;s doing a lot of cool stuff and so it sounds like that&#x27;s where he got the money from so what is the Kona okay so you talked about Lou alzando and he just kind of out you said uh but it&#x27;s a lot of pressure being in the public guy especially they&#x27;re trying to say yeah but they&#x27;re trying to say that this slide proves that elzando headed the a program and all I&#x27;m pointing out is that in nowhere shape or form is that the case that his name is not on this slide it has no indicators that elzando ran the program um but but before we get to K of blue I did want to get to to so the famously do you know David grush um was saying that he that he formally had never been in talks with arrow about any meetings or anything like that right yeah right well The Black Vault releases this this is um from David grush to the arrow staff and it says with du respect I will need answers to my questions before I will be comfortable meeting please provide responses so that we can hopefully move forward and schedule a meeting the law May Grant your office need to know but does not establish policies and procedures with various data owners I&#x27;ve managed multic compartmented activities throughout my entire career and have multiple dsca security professional certifications I did not ask these questions for mere curiosity signed DG which I assume David grush now I I&#x27;m not gonna I&#x27;m not attacking Crush but this seems a little weird um why deny any now maybe in his head um I know um people like him uh uh when they say certain things uh they they mean it in a different way um where maybe he never BEC it sounds like he asked qu them question they wouldn&#x27;t answer them they still wanted to meet with them but they wouldn&#x27;t answer the questions um or do what he he was asking um so maybe he thought by them not doing that like they didn&#x27;t try to formally meet because they didn&#x27;t so so it could just be miscommunication um totally but I find it weird that he would say that or or not not because he&#x27;s been very open he&#x27;s been very very transparent and nothing but uh commendable in my in my book um but this contradicts what he said is is very disheartening honestly yeah it&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s curious I&#x27;m not sure what to make it that if you know he seems so trivial it does yeah and like you said he seems like someone who has been you know uh he&#x27;s had he&#x27;s been consistent in his message every time um certainly his resume is impeccable so you know there must be a simple explanation for this what was Black Vault saying when uh you said it was Black Vault who released this right yeah he he just did his job he released it he put didn&#x27;t put context to it because there&#x27;s no context that you can put to it other than he didn&#x27;t have any context is that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what I asking but but he had been trying to formally because because Arrow maintained um and K Sean katrick M maintained The Narrative and the story that they reached out to David Crush John was like okay well clear I&#x27;ll be able to fo you that so yeah he kept going you know he kept trying and eventually this came to him uh he he got this from that that that trial and tribulation and it confirms that Arrow did it was in talks with Crush to some degree now to what that means to David grush and to to what it means to meet versus Email exchange with a staffer um I mean it could be as simple as that right is it he him not just him not considering this formal right yeah it could could you know I usually like to try to give people the benefit of the doubt um until they&#x27;ve proven to me that you know I can&#x27;t trust them and certainly uh David grush has really tried um you know really hard I mean he&#x27;s been he&#x27;s done a very good job I think of showing that he is a trustworthy exemplary guy so maybe we can give him the benefit of the doubt on this until we get more information but if you ever get a chance to talk to him certainly this would be like very first question pose you know what what&#x27;s this about Dave yeah uh no no no absolutely uh so I&#x27;m trying to F figure out because I can download this and then if I open the file I can share it I can share it where in a in a different way where it&#x27;s like slides um yeah okay here it is oh no yeah yeah here we go here we go here we go because I made like a special thing for it um so okay so they&#x27;ve here is Arrow arrow release this um and this is a a set set of of slides and it is I mean it&#x27;s 56 slides we&#x27;re not we&#x27;re not going through the whole thing just just just&#x27;s no way um but I I do want to go through some of the it it the the the the stuff that it talks about um because I mean this is a remote viewing program I mean it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it is exactly that um what it describes is uh the project description here says this project will investigate identify and analyze sensitive information Advanced Materials and Technologies to increase the basic knowledge of potential emerging and or disruptive scientific and Technical data this project addresses basic applied and advanced researching technology demonstrations in order to identify and anticipate threats to the US Homeland pretty sounds like a tip and assap I mean it it um usually these kind of National Security heavy emphasis programs get accepted so um so far I&#x27;m not seeing anything that stands out or would uh um uh get them denied a unified approach will be used for data collection and Analysis advanced technology acquisition applied technology Theory demonstration ah I figured it out guys I know why it got denied it says right in it Consciousness studies and we don&#x27;t take that seriously in the scientific community so that&#x27;s why it got denied is uh it has something to do with uh uh um most likely Consciousness uh because for some reason the government um uh in up front doesn&#x27;t take it seriously uh why is that we don&#x27;t know um but everything up into see how they listed last Consciousness studies they were trying to sneak that in there uh because that always um like physicists won&#x27;t even utter those words Consciousness studies uh because that would that would mean it makes it real and for some reason um they won&#x27;t touch the Consciousness subject uh no nobody will aside from people like us in our community um yeah you know there&#x27;s one because I&#x27;ve been interested in Consciousness studies also so I&#x27;ve I follow that and there is a PhD in the psy the psychology department at the University of Arizona and boy I cannot remember his name right now uh he is pretty much on the cutting Edge Of Consciousness studies right now um a simple Google search would review uh would reveal it but um but he is he&#x27;s done a lot of um Research into tubules and mic micr tubules in the brain and is uh that would be a whole show in itself but are some real docs who are doing he&#x27;s also so he is a PhD olist and he&#x27;s an anesthesiologist and which seems like a great pairing you know to uh Be steady in Consciousness Dr Hammer Hammer Hoff that&#x27;s who it is it&#x27;s Dr Hammer Hoff at the University of Arizona and he is on The Cutting Edge Of Consciousness studies right now and I highly recommend anybody interested in Consciousness studies to look up his work it&#x27;s uh Stuart off really really he&#x27;s written some books um uh so Consciousness Consciousness is it&#x27;s a hot top you know it is well another thing and and if you look down at the bottom here guys um where it says at the bottom year uh total funding is in millions so um in FIS year 2012 they would have received an initial 12 million the next year the budget would have doubled to a little bit over double uh at and it would have went to 25 million um by the third year the budget would increase to 35 to 50 million and then it was set up uh to be a uh seven-year proposed plan and the last four years uh to be decided uh or determined so they were thinking that this is going to be a 50 at least um uh uh let&#x27;s say 50 75 uh 80 87 a minimum the first three years $ 87 million um to study this con to study Consciousness um and this is right around the time that assap and arrow uh uh not Arrow assap uh comes into the uh to the play and $22 million gets uh over there so uh do you think that they either so do you think that there&#x27;s a possibility that this project did move forward but it moved forward under a different name and they just couldn&#x27;t justify the money or it moved forward and you know that&#x27;s completely um top secret or above and we would never have access to that like I&#x27;m surprised this has even come out because um so it sounds like this was The Proposal right and so this is what they call a a p saap so proposed unacknowledged special Access program special Access program yeah so I would think that this that this kind of research is definitely going on maybe this not the specific proposal maybe like you said the budget was too much or maybe it wasn&#x27;t enough um I mean I we have no idea how much they they put into these special access programs and if you watch um James gordano on YouTube he does a great presentation and it was at the Naval Academy um and the it&#x27;s a DARPA Pro he was from DARPA and he was talking about how the brain is the battlescape of the 21st century and so this entire presentation that he goes through uh and it&#x27;s on YouTube you know he talks about all of the technology that we have um all the ways that we have to interfere with manipulate and disrupt Consciousness and he really painted Wars of the future as not being with tanks and you know guns and not with you know kinetic energy weapons but with EMP with uh weapons that interfere with with Consciousness and then and we&#x27;ve heard about that we&#x27;ve heard about some of that in the news with Havana syndrome and we still don&#x27;t have a good explanation for that other than it was the Russians in uh you know on United States soil doing this to US citizens which you know if that was truly not even not even us not even just US citizens but it started with us politicians in Havana Cuba that&#x27;s where it got the havan syndrome name yeah actually started before that but that&#x27;s just that&#x27;s just um what imagine targeting politicians and military personnel I mean War yeah it yeah so it started with targeting diplomats us diplomats and yeah that is most certainly an act of war and we still have a good explanation for that but I just think that that is a good example of how the brain really is uh the battlescape of the 21st century you know we don&#x27;t need kinetic weapons if we can do something you know uh that interferes with somebody&#x27;s perception or their behavior or if we can manipulate their perceptions or somehow manipulate their behaviors or their thoughts or their beliefs um we don&#x27;t need to fire a single shot and so I really highly recommend the James Giordano DARPA lecture on YouTube just to get an idea of you know what we&#x27;re going into in the future because you know the tinf foil hat conspiracy stuff you know tinf foil sounded pretty good after I watched his lecture you know although I think it Le whoever goes into the lead hat business they might they might have a real good business model well you know what&#x27;s funny is I&#x27;m watching Fallout right now and uh the whole thing is based on um like a a big company um basically uh uh marketizing marketing the end of the world right and having a vested interest to their shareholders in the end of the world as a product and that&#x27;s a huge problem uh because then you know that company has a vested interest to make sure that you know International conflicts uh don&#x27;t get resolved and that&#x27;s kind of the basis of the storyline so I won&#x27;t I won&#x27;t go further than that but uh for anyone in the UFO uh Community uh I just want to throw out that um Fallout is a show um that you need to watch um absolutely uh it&#x27;s up there right now with the three body problem and uh the signal which is uh two shows on Netflix uh this one being on Amazon Prime but yeah I so after our last after our last show I did start watching the three body problem because of your ringing endorsement for that and it&#x27;s really good it&#x27;s really good but you know again it kind of goes back to what we were just talking about with sort of this Consciousness manipulation and this Consciousness Warfare and I don&#x27;t want to get too into it and spoil it I think you said spoilers uh you gave me a time frame on that so I would be spoiling it and I don&#x27;t want to but they do you know Consciousness and uh uh it is definitely a part of that and it um and it also involves extraterrestrials or other you know so it&#x27;s very interesting so I think um and I really think that understanding Consciousness not not only is it fundamental to science because we don&#x27;t even know you know we don&#x27;t even know what Consciousness is I mean we literally don&#x27;t even know what the you know the so the software is that we&#x27;re interpreting the world through um but it&#x27;s also you know it&#x27;s so important to understanding the Extraterrestrial or the you know David grush would call it the interdimensional presence because they they seem to operate off of Consciousness you know they they communicate through telepathy they communicate through dreams you know the craft have telepathy I this is very bib I mean this is in every great historical uh you know every great ancient book uh every great religious book that there is so you it uh they&#x27;ve been they have mind I&#x27;ll leave it at this for for for three body problem have you ever looked up at the universe and had the universe wink back at you yeah very oh my God gave me gave me shivers yeah at that I think I don&#x27;t think that happened and this is a very good example of how Consciousness is so important because I don&#x27;t think that really happened I think they manipulated the brains and perceptions of people and that&#x27;s where it occurred now you&#x27;re getting it Teresa yeah that&#x27;s now you&#x27;re getting it now now you&#x27;re getting it and uh so again this brings us back to this project now this project um there is a page uh and I am sorry I&#x27;m just just I have it big on my side so what is the research need now this is a big part now this is early in the slide this slide four this would be crucial right at when presenting um this would be a crucial slide uh because what is the need of this program um so they list the need as this research is a congressional interest item and this is remember 2012 is was the initial proposed year of start so we have to assume that it took place before then um so This research addresses the critical need for the United States Science and Technology Community to identify Global emerging Andor potentially disruptive technologies that could have a significant impact on homeland security I&#x27;ll repeat that Homeland Security not National Security not Global Security like in our backyard security yeah you know I really wonder if this was um if if this was in response to the Havana syndrome cases I ABS I&#x27;m convinced it is yeah really am uh so the focus collaborations uh on the knowledge based deliverable ensures that the uh departmental requirements and those of the inter agency partners are addressed and provided opportunities uh for follow on efforts and additional collaboration on scientific investigation and Technology exploitation the Department&#x27;s interest area with this project Target is the ctif scientific and Technical investigation threat analysis and assessment of materials and data of unique origin let&#x27;s say that again and assessments of materials and data of unique origin engineering and purpose so what do you think they mean by that what does unique origin mean I mean if it was created in China or Russia that would be foreign origin I don&#x27;t know that we would necessarily term that unique well back then back then that&#x27;s how you hide this right because back then the the you the subject wasn&#x27;t so transparent right and you hide this from being foyble by saying things like that not nowadays they might include the word um uh you know non-human origin or uh yada yada yada uh who knows what you know what interdimensional ad who knows what word they&#x27;re using these days but um that&#x27;s what&#x27;s that that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s it makes it so impossible and what that&#x27;s what I respect about John Greenwall Jr is he he&#x27;s like a dog with a bone with this stuff um you know because it takes words uh if you don&#x27;t get the exact wording right in a foyer request well he said extraterrestrial this says interdimensional well nope we don&#x27;t have what he&#x27;s looking for it makes all the difference so it it literally makes all the difference in so word salad so here what I that that that to me that would be um just an early uh way of of saying um so unique in origin equals probably can&#x27;t say definitively but unique offworld technology and materials and Engineering because they go on to say that too um uh uh disruptive materials um technologies that could potentially impact National Power and security um yada y y oh no no here it is materials data of unique origin engineering and purpose so uh things that they quite they don&#x27;t understand the engineering the purpose and uh uh purpose of that&#x27;s what does that sound like to you it sounds like UFOs and I I this this I Arrow arrow is very contradictory so they&#x27;re saying this is a proposed plan in 200 whatever right before 2012 um this is them admitting that they&#x27;re having these conversations that they&#x27;re proposing plans for for projects like it this we stop thousands of these things are submitted a year so we know just by this existing and the government at the same time publicly saying we have no studies like such we have no plans to study things like that we have no skin in that game anymore clearly when having skin in that game still right they&#x27;re taking on proposals uh uh briefs and contracts bids for programs this did not get that far but it seems others did so you know really the the goal with this slide was to say if this didn&#x27;t get through what did what did and and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the real question because if if this is what they&#x27;re showing us what got through is three times as far weird that is a very good point if this is what&#x27;s public just imagine what&#x27;s classified like just now you know it&#x27;s three times as weird yeah so um yeah that&#x27;s fascinating I mean we know that they&#x27;ve been interested in Consciousness studies you know since the 50s and 60s when the the Russians were showing uh the Russians were showing people with telekinetic abilities and certainly the Nazis did a lot of research in um remote viewing and things of that nature and and telepathy and you psychic uh ESP abilities and uh so we you know this has been an ongoing thing for a very long time so it&#x27;s not surprising to me it&#x27;s uh you know it&#x27;s interesting it&#x27;ll be a while before any of this technology really comes down to you know really improve our lives and it isn&#x27;t just for you know used as military applications but I think it&#x27;s exciting I think it&#x27;s exciting for Science and um you know I do hope that the uh civilian realm will continue to push further um and tackle tackle these really important subjects that um I mean they mean so much this is just as important as the Extraterrestrial question uh because it truly answers it it goes right to the heart of you know what does it mean to be human right I mean what is consciousness it does it exist brain brain uh if Consciousness is outside of the brain then does it go with us after death I mean a lot of near-death experiences would say that that is the case so I mean we can&#x27;t even say if the brain is more of like a radio and an antenna uh uh or if it is um actually where cons is so uh these are cool Jeffrey Mish thank you thank you so Jeffrey mishlove won the Bigalow prize um yeah he Institute yeah so thank you uh so Rockstar uh intuition um uh thank you thank you for that but um so dude it&#x27;s YouTube is really killing so we&#x27;re again we&#x27;re at over a hundred people and over like and and then there&#x27;s only 15 on like YouTube it drives me so insane because the like the podcast does so well Twitter does so X does I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t with this Twitter X thing X does so well well um X needs to to to rival YouTube I think um but that&#x27;s not not not here nor there um but it just drives me a little insane to like look at it and and see it no but I&#x27;m I would just like to thank everybody for being here and all of our Twitter Community is hard our ex our ex people who are here thank you being here and you know I I certainly enjoy interacting with a lot of the ex uh UAP community in spaces um so thanks for being here guys and you know what we did have um I should have started the show by saying this but um we had some weird stuff happened this week and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to do with UFOs we&#x27;ll get back there we&#x27;re gonna get back there trust me but we have two stories that you have and there they&#x27;re very interesting and um so one of the things I want to talk about um with with with real real quick is uh you and I text obviously and uh Israel got attacked by Iran um but four or five days ago and um they destroyed a Muslim temple and you know they were able to shoot 99% of the missiles down very good success rate um and then the one get that gets through is destroys one of the most an it just it seems that the prophecy that we talked about is being fulfilled right in front of our eyes it does and when you sent me that I wasn&#x27;t even awake yet because we there&#x27;s a big time difference and you know you&#x27;re at lunch and but yeah um now it was not the Dome of the Rock The Dome of the Rock that was a that was a Target by the way so I&#x27;m sure it was but yeah I think you&#x27;re right I mean I you know for the Dome of the Rock to be destroyed in war would be the perfect argument for um the Jewish people to go ahead and rebuild um the Third Temple of Solomon on that site and you know if we&#x27;re already in war wartime you know what would they uh you know what what would they have to lose by doing that you know and so and then Israel struck back against Iran uh since our last show and you know I really I really have to wonder Ty if these mid East Wars you know we talked about in some of our previous shows about how how the um Ancient Temple of Solomon was really a placed to meet um the others you know this ancient Advanced presence and not in spirit you know in corporeal you know form I mean it talks about um having a place for their feet to walk so we&#x27;re not talking about the presence of some spirit that hangs around there we&#x27;re talking about actual beings and I think we were feeding them and that&#x27;s why you always brought the best of your Harvest and you brought the best of your your um your animals to bring as sacrifices uh because we were feeding these beings these Ancient Aliens is what I really think they were and some people are saying it&#x27;s the anunaki um you know I think that&#x27;s fair that&#x27;s worthy of you know looking at uh so these ancient temples you know Solomon&#x27;s Temple and especially you know it had an area inside and the the very center of the temple had the holiest of holies area and that was separated by a curtain and it&#x27;s actually that curtain that ripped uh after the crucifixion of Jesus when the earthquake took place and so if these ancient temples were really they were uh they were they were embassies they were embassies for meeting these extraterrestrials inner dimensionals whatever I like to call them an ancient Advanced presence um but that&#x27;s what these that was the purpose of these temples was to meet them there and not just in spirit and through prayer but actually face to face in person and so if they&#x27;re wanting you know if the Jewish people are are wanting to reconstruct the Third Temple uh so that their Messiah can come back just as we discussed in you know previous shows um that means that they are literally quite literally constructing or wanting to construct wanting to build a physical structure uh that is very specific in how it has to be built that is very specific in um how it has to be purified um you know even through animal sacrifice which we discussed previously with the red huffers and previous shows and you they want their Messiah to come back um and they want their Messiah to come back not just through um a a non-corporeal spirit they want their Messiah to come back uh their their Messiah is not of this Earth which by very definition means extraterrestrial and they want that entity to come back or those entities um to come back and they are building the infrastructure for that to take place and now that they are bombing Iran you know there&#x27;s quite a lot of evidence in Iran which would uh be ancient Persia is modern day Iran and Iraq and ient Persia really ruled that area for a very long time and the zoroastrian faith was uh the most popular faith for a very long time of ancient Persia and still all throughout um Iraq and Iran you can see the man in a there&#x27;s literally a bearded man in a circular um disc with wings uh and this this is the this is the symbol for the zoroastrian faith and it is literally everywhere in Iran um it&#x27;s on the bank of Iran it&#x27;s um it&#x27;s on the tomb of Xerxes I mean it&#x27;s just everywhere so you and they have they have a name for the Craft um they call them fahar f a r a v a h a RS Farah vs so this aliens type of stuff this is the actual craft that God the it&#x27;s the actual it&#x27;s the actual craft that the that the gods traveled in and so if we know that they weren&#x27;t really big G Gods but they were you know beings from somewhere else that we would in current terminology call extraterrestrials or inner dimensionals anaki yeah or the Anunnaki you know they hadra Flesh and Blood beings just like us and they they traveled in crafts and those crafts are very clearly documented in Iran so the question becomes you know are any of the those crafts still in Iran um either by accident you know like some crashed craft maybe some wreckage or maybe maybe do they still have a base there I think it&#x27;s pretty clear they had a base there at some point and uh maybe they have part some of these far of aars there and it&#x27;s you know I&#x27;m really starting to wonder and I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s I think it&#x27;s a fair question is this the reason uh for uh wanting to um have war with Iran um and I think it&#x27;s a fair question to ask if is that really why we went into Iraq because what if people will remember we went into Iraq after the World Trade Center was was hit by airplanes that had nothing to do with Saddam Hussein or Iraq at all but yet we used that we used 911 as an excuse to go into Iraq when it had it had Iraq was completely unconnected so the question did we tell the public we told the public they had weapons of mass destruction what if they weren&#x27;t lying because yeah wasn&#x27;t conventional weapon wasn&#x27;t it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not it wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t nuclear weapons that hey hey they don&#x27;t have to divulge that right we American public doesn&#x27;t need to know what type of of mass uh devastating weapons they have they just need to know that they have wmds right weapons of mass destruction right so uh could they gone in wow that&#x27;s a wow wow that&#x27;s a very good point but you know just it was never never made clear to the public why we um went into Iraq and completely destabilized the country um I mean there&#x27;s certainly plenty of you know theories and reasons um but it wasn&#x27;t given to the public hi William thanks for being here um so I think uh they okay starblade they seem to enjoy the fire cooked meats yeah I think refer to the entities uh yes they do they seem to like a good barbecue well they like a good barbecue and they like a pyramid so what if the pyramids were their bases and so like we see in different cultures um so in Egypt right the pyramid the craft would have hung over the pyramid right they would have us us descended from the craft gone into the pyramid used it as a base yada yada um same in South America the St pyramids they just did it they cut it off so that the craft could actually land um in India they you know T it almost looked like they Tethered to the the the temples uh that&#x27;s where we get the vman um so these different craft of the different region it it they&#x27;re similar in nature right um it&#x27;s just the the uh the park the the the parking lots are different yeah I love the way you said that yes the parking lots are different and I think that&#x27;s what a lot of these ancient megalithic structures were they they were the bases uh I mean we still can&#x27;t replicate a lot of these most of these any of these ancient megalithic structures you know where and people have seen the pictures where it appears um uh where it appears that rocks have been melted you know into very specific shapes where you couldn&#x27;t even get a piece of paper through there uh we we don&#x27;t have the technology to replicate those things so I do think that the uh ancient megalithic structures that they they were bases and uh we see that all over the world but initially you know the Middle East what we and we call that the cradle of civilization um I mean even an archaeologist say that that&#x27;s the Cradle of you know civilization it&#x27;s known that way uh but I think yeah I exactly but I think it&#x27;s the cradle of civilization because you know that&#x27;s where they were genetically creating us Insight radio podcasts the way they make those pyramids is far to Advanced yeah I agree and you know they always said that those pyramids were um they always said that those pyramids were burial Chambers but they never found I mean that was just obvious crap because they never found any mummies inside any pyramid ever um uh so that doesn&#x27;t hold up and then it wasn&#x27;t even a very good lie so yeah it wasn&#x27;t a good lie and people like zahi HOAs out of Egypt Egypt off you know I know a lot of people think he&#x27;s done a lot of good and you know for the people of Egypt and restoring uh restoring Egypt&#x27;s you know greatness because you know the what what they what Egypt&#x27;s beef is is the white man always comes in and uh they do the excavations and they they take these artifacts from Egypt out uh I believe you know I believe the Vatican in the the the the British uh Min you know Ministry um uh have tons uh that you know these churches and and uh places have tons of artifacts that that don&#x27;t belong to them and you know zaki&#x27;s you know gone on this campaign that you know basically says that you know Egypt has eminent domain over those and you know wants them back and I side with him on it um but what I don&#x27;t side with him on is his hiding uh and cherry-picking of the data and uh of what uh he&#x27;ll let out for information on the pyramids um I I find it very disturbing um that uh it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a case that we see all the time is you know absolute power corrupts absolutely yeah yeah I agree 100% I 100% I agree with you Ty and um yeah they have to I don&#x27;t blame them for wanting to protect their their Heritage and their artifacts and yes please do that because there has been a history but like you said you know the world also has a right to know yeah the British stuck being Jessica said the British British were um bad about that uh a lot of you know very very in fact I think je I think one of the jewels in one of the British Royal Crowns um was stolen from India and um you know India wants it back and the British royal family doesn&#x27;t want to give it back so uh yeah there&#x27;s been a long history like dude like you have like it&#x27;s that you can&#x27;t do that you can&#x27;t just take someone&#x27;s like if if someone came here and literally took our Declaration of Independence right out of the fuck Nick if they Nick CAG that bitch and took it back home we would throw a fucking fit and go to we would go to war over that we would start World War I if someone came in and and took our Declaration of Independence and stolen yeah yeah I mean so you&#x27;re exactly right I don&#x27;t blame people zahu haash for you know protecting their artifacts but you he still is sitting on top of knowledge that really belongs to everybody you know in terms of you know who are we and where did we come from and he won&#x27;t allow certain experiments to happen he won&#x27;t allow certain access to certain Chambers He has blocked off certain Chambers so when the tours go through that they they have no idea right they walk right past them they don&#x27;t illuminate them they uh you know unless you&#x27;re doing like you know unless you&#x27;re Jimmy church or uh Billy Carson apparently um you don&#x27;t get the full tour of the of the pyramid uh it seems only those two guys and sorry I&#x27;m shitting on a little bit I love Jimmy Church uh and I and I I I I like Billy Carson um I love Jimmy like Billy it&#x27;s different but apparently they&#x27;re the only ones who get the real tours but it it just it goes to show you that they are showing and if and if you go to the pyramid and you mention alternative ideas oh my God the the tour guides they&#x27;ll start kicking you out right oh W yeah say you&#x27;re leading yeah if you&#x27;re leading a group of people and you&#x27;re say and and and you&#x27;re you know if you&#x27;re being peaceful about it I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d leave you alone but like guys like Tyler um uh of of of God uh I I was I actually almost worked for him um no Tyler something um I was in the running to be a producer on his show uh or for his his his his thing whatever whatever he went to the pyramid and he was being very belligerent he was walking up to people and he was saying do you believe that aliens could have built the pyramids and he was like interrupting people&#x27;s lunches and you know like like pictures and he was being very beligerant about it and yes they kicked they wanted to kick him out and they almost did and they they allowed them to stay but they&#x27;ve been known to kick people out who uh who cause the rocket like that right who are challenging the ideas of of of of what Egypt and and the egyptologists are saying so um and and we know that they they they definitely hide things from the public when it comes to the pyramids I mean the oldest one is the most advanced right that that doesn&#x27;t make sense right right that&#x27;s a question everyone you know that most people don&#x27;t even know that the pyramid has is actually eight sides the Great Pyramid is eight different sides it&#x27;s not four uh most people don&#x27;t know that um but that&#x27;s only yeah because it only happens during a a a eclipse or or like a certain uh you can only see it in a certain uh phase of the of the sun uh but that&#x27;s neither here nor there uh so let&#x27;s talk about uh um so we talked about Iran uh so there&#x27;s been retaliation uh Teresa are you worried that world war three is is breaking out I think that&#x27;s a question on a lot of people&#x27;s minds yes I am and um you know I I so I was mu fund director for Maryland for a long time and I worked with experiencers for a very long time um so I&#x27;ve been working with the public for over 15 years uh until I left DC and and moved to a peaceful life of just my own but I spoke to enough people to know um and this is very well documented in books and call that you call that peaceful Teresa oh where where I&#x27;m living now well I am having some interesting I am having some tylera thank you thank you the chat tonight thank you finally see thank you chat tonight you guys have been doing great you&#x27;re being like the producer uh don&#x27;t worry um we did uh uh uh hopefully

the screen all right back to your other topic well I just wanted to finish the World War II um thought for damn it all right go okay so you know one of the biggest themes that is that I consistently uh observed you know personally and you know it&#x27;s very well documented in books and other researchers have um have doc have seen this too is people getting imagery of you know catastrophic Wars and um you know even being taken on ships like they have memories of this being taken on ships and being shown imagery of catastroph catastrophic Wars or U catastrophic uh breakdown of the environment or um environmental collapse and um you you know that&#x27;s always been very curious and that&#x27;s been going on for decades and you know and I&#x27;ve heard other researchers I even heard a PhD you know tell me one time you know he said you know Teresa you know they lie the the aliens lie and and you know maybe all that stuff is a bunch of crap but I think that they have been trying to warn us I think uh because look at what they did with Noah you mean there is precedence for this when the flood was going to occur um I believe it was anky uh that uh approached Noah um because he was actually his father but this is that&#x27;s a story for another another day but um Noah&#x27;s father was one of the Fallen Angels and he approached Noah to let him know that there was going to be a flood and he gave him for warning yes three wars being fought yeah Donnie yeah um so there is historical precedence that they have warned people in the past and to try to get them you know in the case of Noah to build an ark um or to to prepare them and I think that that&#x27;s been happening I think that&#x27;s been happening for decades and we just didn&#x27;t realize it because we weren&#x27;t this close to War I don&#x27;t know what the clock is at right now but we are there we&#x27;re on the precipice and so I thinkers have been have been being warned and I do think that we&#x27;re going that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re heading and you know but I do really wonder you know is this a war over real Advanced ancient technology that may be in Iran and another reason I think that there&#x27;s a a good argument for that is because in 2023 the Jerusalem Post published an article and it was about how they had been able to use AI to um consistently and accurately translate Kia form and Kia form is the most ancient method of writing that uh we have that has ever been discovered and but there are only like four experts in all of the world who can read and translate cop form so now we have ai who can accurately and consistently transform these caniform tablets and so they started doing that they started running all of these ancient kapor tablets through the the AI and uh you know and I&#x27;m wondering you know did they discover something yeah 90 Seconds To Midnight um but I&#x27;m really starting to wonder if they if they discovered something in these tablets by running them through the AI 90 Seconds To Midnight is the closest that we&#x27;ve ever been we were we weren&#x27;t even at 90 seconds during the Cuban Missile Crisis yeah it&#x27;s really scary and um and then it makes you wonder well you know are they going to come back will they will they come back for a or you know of of that scale and and then it&#x27;s really coincidental timing that they are about to sacrifice the red heers to uh to literally put a phone call in for their Messiah to return who is by definition not of this Earth and extraterrestrial so it seems to me um you know and and Jesus did say that he would come back that he was leaving to basically go terraform other other planets other exoplanets uh to make homes for us and that he would return um and we know because of Relativity time would be very different for any space traveler um and that&#x27;s actually in the Bible too there&#x27;s actually relativity in the Bible in time dilation um thousands of years before Einstein came up with that which I think is is really cool too but um yes I I think um I really think it&#x27;s worth discussing is this war about ancient technology in Iran um so uh I don&#x27;t know I think I think that we should keep an eye on it and I think that we should continue to have this these conversations and you know if the Messiah or the messiah&#x27;s um come back um then will&#x27;ll really be a popular show at that point um but yeah don&#x27;t worry if if if if the Messiah start returning um I will be the first to be to be to be with a camera um flying there and uh dropping everything um to get that we&#x27;ll really get a lot we&#x27;ll really be getting a lot of views then is that possibility that they would come back and you know if we if that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re witnessing right now is that we&#x27;re witnessing you know ancient prophecy uh play out in front of our eyes then it would seem to indicate that they are coming back and I think you have said in every single show Tai that you know we&#x27;re being prepared um they&#x27;re coming back you know even the United States government and it&#x27;s not just the US government anymore it&#x27;s also the British government it&#x27;s the Australians um that they they seem to be preparing attempting to prepare us um for their return and I can&#x27;t it&#x27;s hard to argue against that it does seem like there has been a multi- deade um kind of priming going on to get people used to this idea and it&#x27;s so shocking it really does have to you be a longterm uh a long longterm program that they roll out and then even Professor Simon in one of his last videos that we discussed on this on show uh a couple weeks ago I think you know he talked about how the United Nations had decided that um it needed to be a 25 year long rollout period to um to acclimate people to these ideas so all of that does seem to point that are coming back and then people have talked about catastrophic disclosure where you they come back and we&#x27;re not prepared yeah and there&#x27;s dates you know like 2027 being thrown around by people like uh John Ramirez Lando&#x27;s hinted at it others have hinted at it um there&#x27;s I I hate putting dates on things uh because I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not a huge fan of it but uh John Ramirez is is someone that I really respect and um for him to to to drop that uh it it just it it it resonates with me and it leaves a haunting haunting message um but um so listen some guy lit himself on fire yeah I really want to so just really quickly all things aside you brought up a story to me I wasn&#x27;t really going to talk about it didn&#x27;t really want to talk about it but he wrote a Manifesto I started getting into it it&#x27;s something I probably want to talk about in a at a later date but something really terrible happened and at this Trump uh hearing was it a hearing it&#x27;s actually it&#x27;s the it&#x27;s the court so Trump&#x27;s actually in the court case now Supreme yeah yep yeah so um yeah I mean to accurately cover this we would need a lot more time and I think we&#x27;re running out here briefly yeah so um outside crazy that that someone could do something like that um well guy who did it has a really impressive resume he&#x27;s on LinkedIn I don&#x27;t remember what his name is but it&#x27;s not hard to find um I mean anybody can do a ex search for you know guy who set himself on fire and his name is there I don&#x27;t remember what it is um but his I looked at his LinkedIn and it was impressive I mean he&#x27;s worked on political campaigns he had his picture with Bill Clinton um he I believe he graduated from Rutgers I mean this is a this is a smart guy um he worked he worked for an energy company um he had a there&#x27;s a reason I bring it up too he had an impressive res and yeah that was well that&#x27;s what one of the things that stood out um I think for early on when you sent it to me was I was like who is this guy like really um but um there&#x27;s been talks about Marco Ruby uh running as Donald Trump&#x27;s vice president um Marco Rubio is very very adamant um and involved in the UAP uh transparency um a fight to you know uh so you know what what does that do um uh you know to the UFO world when if if in in a world where Trump runs with Rubio I mean do people vote just Rubio just be just because yeah that&#x27;s really interesting I um I mean I&#x27;ve heard Rubio talk about these uh you know UAP issues and you know he he has just flat out said you know aliens or little green men are not you know there&#x27;s incursions into our airspace and it&#x27;s a national security issue that we um we talked about this last time di time dilation right with the Lord a thousand years are like a day yes star blade yeah so we talked about this last time I think that this was a reference to um like something like Interstellar where when they go onto the Water World um each hour that passes on that planet that water world you know is uh whatever amount of years on Earth and um you know how that if if you&#x27;re looking at it through the the eyes of Relativity would actually be the case um so you know when he goes and talks about um um other worlds and uh visiting other worlds and and um uh find us other homes uh I find it peculiar I find it very peculiar um because that&#x27;s when you when you step back and look at that I mean it all sounds very very very like scientific spot on yeah yeah I mean so yes so this thank you starblade for posting that because this is quite literally relativity and time dilation right there in the Bible you know 2,000 years before Einstein and how did these people know that you know how did they know that you know 2,000 years to us or th I think it says a thousand years to us is uh one one day to the Lord yes thank you Jessica Max azarello is the uh was the the person who set himself on fire today outside of Trump&#x27;s trial and so he wrote a Manifesto and I didn&#x27;t really get into it because we were getting close to the show but just the first couple paragraphs it said history is a lie and then I think he went on I I think his whole thing was about how um I saw the sign that he had and it said basically Trump and Biden are two sides of the same coin kind of kind of it was wasn&#x27;t that phrasing but it was that sentiment um if aliens come down and bring us into the caves we&#x27;re effed Sam yeah yeah if this guy if the sky people if the sky people come down if the ant people come down and start bringing us into the caves We Know It uh end of days uh at least some cat cataclysms come in uh because that&#x27;s that&#x27;s American war yeah I think we might be the lucky ones certainly the the Hy would say that they&#x27;ve the ant people have rescued them at the end of every world I think four or five times now so if if the ant people show up and start taking me into under the ground in the Grand Canyon I&#x27;m gonna feel pretty lucky yeah which also lines up the four or five mass devastations um they line up with this theory that Nibiru uh the planet the anaki planet the object that NASA now confirms that there is a large object that orbits further than Pluto orbits but has a very peculiar orbit and only comes by every you know 35,000 years um and that its orbit it&#x27;s not clear um but uh the theory posed the the the the one that neiru with the ancient aliens uh or or the anunaki is that um the the Nibiru sometimes passes right you know uh right in the perfect spot does no harm to Earth but sometimes it passes in between the Moon and Earth and causes massive extinctions so um you know yeah it you&#x27;d be lucky if one person survived um yeah if there&#x27;s lot of evidence for the PO shifts in Earth&#x27;s history but they don&#x27;t really know why and there was that book from the CIA reading room and it&#x27;s called I think it&#x27;s called the story of Adam and Eve and and it was actually classified um in the 1950s for a long time and then when they Declassified it they only Declassified parts of it and it was about pole shifts that regularly happen on the earth and um and and we have evidence for that I mean they have evidence of you know these a these huge huge prehistoric animals with grass in their mouth and they were literally frozen to death in a Flash instant flash like yeah yeah it&#x27;s crazy it is crazy for for in in North America um at least at least Down to Georgia was covered in miles like 20 I forget what they say uh uh like 10 10 or 20 miles of ice like the sheet of ice over North America Canada um and uh North was it it was and then when that melted you know um it it it it caused um Rush A Rush of water and that&#x27;s how you get plac like you know the channel channel scab lands and um uh yeah yeah yeah and and the sinking of Atlantis or um uh any other civilization close to the ports because the sea levels would rise drastically very quickly um so could it be possible if Atlantis was in the place that most people agree uh which is off the coast of Cuba um could yeah it Mak sense that Atlantis would have FL it would have been destroyed after um some sort of heating Mass really really quick heating of the planet um and that usually comes with either a comet impact like the young grias Theory um or something like that yeah there what we know is that there was a erup yeah a definite drastic shift something drastic happened multiple times um in our in the history of the earth and the Hy will say that at the end of every Earth that they have been saved by the ant people and then um when you look at a description of you know when they when you read a description of how they describe the ant people they&#x27;re literally describing Grays I mean their ant people are what we would today call Gray aliens I mean and and then when you think about a gray alien well yeah I guess it kind of does look like an ant person I mean if I had to that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a pretty good description and you know so the Hy will say that at the end of every at the end of every World um you know when a massive cataclysm happened which like you said maybe it&#x27;s neiru coming into the orbit and completely destabilizing the Earth um or these pole shifts or combination of all those things but the Hy will say that the ant people took them um underground in the Grand Canyon and and saved them and um and actually the Hopi are are very um sentimental about the ant people very grateful to them because uh they even say that the ant people gave up their own food rations to feed them um and and then when everything was stable on the surface of the Earth again they would let the hopy people go and they would tell they would give them directions they would say you know go out in all four corners of the Earth spread out and go and repopulate the Earth and um that is actually inscribed on Prophecy Rock in Arizona um on one of the Mesa in northern Arizona there and so you and I have talked uh multiple times on this show about you know if they come back where where are they going to come back to are they going to come back to a temple in the middle of a war zone in the Middle East um are they going to park over s right yeah are they going to go back to some place like Stonehenge or the pyramids I personally think there&#x27;s good evidence that they could return to any of those places but especially the Grand Canyon I think um and the hope you say that they would take them underneath the Grand Canyon and there&#x27;s actually a specific place and I think I can&#x27;t I think it&#x27;s called H I think it&#x27;s called Devil&#x27;s uh H I can&#x27;t remember but there&#x27;s a very specific place in the Grand Canyon Dev Tower not Devil&#x27;s Tower that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the place Wyoming yeah Wy tree stump um but Devil&#x27;s Tower in Wyoming is where um they depicted the alien return in um stepen Spielberg&#x27;s movie um the what was what was it uh the third what was that movie the ah um we mashed potatoes guy what the guy who was making he was sculpting Devil&#x27;s Tower out of his mashed potatoes Encounters of the Third Kind that&#x27;s what it was so oh oh Richard dry the mashed potatoes yeah oh okay okay yeah um so Stephen Spielberg and then what going on about I know I know is specific but um so Stephen Spielberg sort of LED people to believe that it was Devil&#x27;s Tower in Wyoming but breaking news from variety Stephen Spielberg is his next movie is going to be a ufob based genre film and it&#x27;s going to be based on his own ideas an original script and um it it will not be a direct sequel to close encounters but um we know that Spielberg you know worked closely uh um with people like dock uh for project Blue Book the U main scientist from Project Blue Book uh even made a cameo in the film um at the end there when they&#x27;re celebrating he walks through with a cigar um so we know Spielberg is informed um to some degree and I think that directors like him are informed to some degree um I I think it&#x27;s all I need to know but I think what they need to know is what they&#x27;re they&#x27;re given and because it&#x27;s not uncommon for the CIA like say Marvel is shooting or some big studio is shooting and they need to use um the CIA or and one of these FBI buildings what they&#x27;ll do is the FBI will um yeah they&#x27;ll let them do it but they uh they consult on the film at that point um and make sure like the uniforms and stuff and you know that it it&#x27;s kind of cool uh how it works but um so I think some directors um are absolutely told certain information and are uh nudged in certain ways to make it so that the public is you know a drop here a drop there again I think that we&#x27;ve been being slowly seed the idea that life outside of Earth is not UNC if you look at Marvel um the popularity of it right uh if you look at any Disney movie nowadays right is all about uh aliens everything everything&#x27;s aliens EV everything&#x27;s uh nonhuman intelligence um and I think there&#x27;s a reason for that I think it&#x27;s it and that&#x27;s why we see this new generation of people who instead of volunteering ing for the military are not identifying with a nation they&#x27;re identifying globally as a citizen of of earth right that we have the lowest volunteer numbers in the military in in years uh and I think that&#x27;s a testament to what&#x27;s going on and that is that people are realizing and waking up to the fact that these borders are drawn on Maps they&#x27;re not real right it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s stupid all this conflict it&#x27;s and and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s being it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a a game of chess being played by people who run the world the top 1% making the decisions to the rest of the 99 and I think the 99 are starting to fucking get pissed and again that&#x27;s why movies like a24 and Civil War this new movie that came out is their highest grossing film of all time uh opening weekend this yeah I&#x27;ve read a lot about that where people are kind of leaving walking away pretty Disturbed but you know it could happen again we are very divided you know and maybe just like you know Ronald Reagan said and I think you have it in the opening of this of the show um that uh yeah you know Jessica I think it is Devil&#x27;s Bridge it had devil in it um yes Close Encounters thank you Richard thank you yes um so maybe maybe this maybe this is you know the information that we need right now to put our differences aside you know because if we&#x27;re going to be having Wars and literally not launching you know uh nuclear weapons over you know my my sky person is better than your Sky person this is that&#x27;s a real problem and and we are not spiritually Advanced enough to have those kinds of weapons so if people can all if people can recognize and extend their respect and courtesy and and and recognize yes your religion is right and your religion is right and everybody&#x27;s right everybody has a piece of the puzzle there all just looking at a gem through different facets I really believe that and if we could get people to see that maybe we could avoid stuff like Civil War or World War III or hot war or nuclear war you it really I hope and I I hope for that every day I think it is our best chance um I mean I don&#x27;t know what do you think do you think that that this is our best chance to avoid you know completely catastropic rhic War uh with with people who may have different religious beliefs what I think is that the factionalization is is what&#x27;s the worst for humankind and um I think the I think it&#x27;d be wise that people to step back and realize that um that each religion has is a piece of the puzzle and um if we were to to all sit down at a table you know unlike what the UN rhetoric would be right or or what what the idea of the UN is right is sitting down but on another level on a scientific on a on a on a philos philosophical sit at a table in a in a in a room somewhere and just talk everyone all the leaders of the world and prerequisite I&#x27;m going to bring something up that Sam said because we do is to get into this room you need to eat an eighth of mushrooms and then all the world leaders go in they eat an eth the mushrooms together right everyone has a happy time they all love the life and they love each other uh and we come out peace done that&#x27;s how you solve it immediately get him in the room uh uh give him some DMT give him some give some mushrooms give him some a no not acid no because they might end up ripping each other to you or fighting each other um but uh no yeah uh that I think it&#x27;s a prerequisite that if you if you&#x27;re leading if you have nuclear codes I think you need to have gone on a spiritual journey yeah I mean it just seems like our we don&#x27;t have the spiritual maturity to have these weapons and and that&#x27;s what worries me about people like I&#x27;m sorry I cut you off I didn&#x27;t the the Wi-Fi lag there didn&#x27;t do justice um so in North Korea they changed uh the laws so that Kim jung-un um basically could could misread a situation and cause or or or or uh respond retaliate with a nuclear force on a moment&#x27;s notice to to any threat that he deemed uh to North Korea and it is O very very open and vague as to what determines what a threat is so basically he&#x27;s changed the laws so that he can basically start a nuclear war whenever he wants and yeah very scary yeah in places like Russia and the United States where UFOs have tampered with nuclear sites what if they go in and tamper with a a North Korean one and no three is like well this must be an attack on us click yeah or maybe that maybe that&#x27;s some of the only um reassurance that we have is that we do know that there is a long demonstrated history of these crafts completely shutting down um launch codes missiles computer systems all of that and you know so maybe that is some reassurance that maybe they could intervene if we were about to on the of others yeah if we were about to you know go to midnight and um so I don&#x27;t know if they would interview to that point I certainly hope that somebody&#x27;s watching out for us but you know maybe if we could just find one thing that the whole world can agree on um that we can come together instead of being so far apart that&#x27;s my yeah that&#x27;s why I think that&#x27;s why I think think that disclosure is even on the table I think I think it there&#x27;s a I right now I think that we&#x27;re in the end game right so if anyone is a Marvel fan we&#x27;re in the endgame now and what that means is so Doctor Strange he&#x27;s a wizard in or he&#x27;s a Mystic uh if you will um uh uh he is basically the protector of the universe uh on in like on an astral level on a magical level um you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s he that&#x27;s who he is and he tells Tony Stark Iron Man that we&#x27;re in the end game now and he goes through five million 8,000 whatever possibilities and there&#x27;s only one where the Avengers win and beat Thanos and it needs to play out exactly as it as it plays out right tick tock tick tock domino domino domino domino so each needs to fall so Doctor Strange sees that and in that moment gives up the one thing that can beat the villain in that moment right so he loses the battle in order to win the war because he knows that it will set off this domino effect right um and I think we&#x27;re in the end game now I see a hole and I if we thread the needle just right I think we come out on the other side and I think we come out on the other side something different right well hopefully new technology you know that would solve our energy problems and our environmental problems and I think that would be best case scenario and I certainly work for that every day you know to try to make this an issue that brings people closer together instead of farther apart because we&#x27;re not getting way we&#x27;ve been going what I worry about is the false flag using the others as the thing that unites us but in the other way as an enemy unites us against common common enemy yes that is what scares me so and that&#x27;s the doct Greer way of looking at it I get it right but um I&#x27;m gonna hold on hope that that is not the end game that is not the the that&#x27;s not the needle that&#x27;s not threading the needle I think what we do is we come out on the other side as a species that is welcomed in to the cosmic Galactic Federate whatever it is that&#x27;s out there um you know I think I think at at that point we&#x27;ll have proven ourselves worthy um and uh possibly raised our Consciousness um in the process so um that&#x27;s all for guys um uh really really great show though really great show um Teresa we&#x27;re g they continue the conversation if they would like to uh you&#x27;re a a wealth of knowledge you always are very articulate in what you say about and how you present um what you what you do so uh if they want to get you on the show if they want to um you know bring you onto a space how do they do that uh they can find me on Twitter at um Tindle review yes Tindle review thank you um and I&#x27;m pretty

monitor that account and I always respond and uh thanks for having me I love doing the show I love uh the people who watch us and our audience MERS and um you know maybe next I&#x27;m really hoping to bring some evidence um from my own life I don&#x27;t like being the story I don&#x27;t want to be the story but there yeah number one rule of Journalism yeah don&#x27;t become the story don&#x27;t become the story but there has been so much bizarre activity um you know not just from my childhood when I first saw the gold disc but recently um and I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not right on top of Skinwalker Ranch but I&#x27;m close-ish and I really wonder if I&#x27;m experiencing some skin walker activity so maybe we can bring some of those videos on um yeah I would I would really like I&#x27;d be open to that if I would really I really what I really need is somebody who is an expert in like video analysis because I really think I have on on my ring camera and well just so happens just so it happens that I do have a video guy and his name is and he&#x27;ll be coming on the podcast um actually probably next week uh Mark Antonio he&#x27;s the muon video guy um yeah yeah um and so um good news for everybody is that um we are full throttle um on finishing the movie uh we got access to the website again uh I was locked out for a while got access today to the website so a lot of the stuff for the movie and the show um total disclosure. org is going to be the One-Stop shop for uh everything live shows um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s how how you can support the show um updates on the movie uh when the movie comes out you&#x27;ll be able to buy it there that kind of stuff um it&#x27;ll be uh we&#x27;re working with various distribution companies but uh we have the whole team we
