            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In 2024, the city of Rockford publicly announced that $500,000 would be invested in this initiative. This commitment mattered. It signaled a willingness to acknowledge past harms and invest in a future where BIPO communities could thrive. I do not believe that there needs to be a vote tonight because I honestly don&#x27;t believe the parameters of this money being situated as an all or nothing. I don&#x27;t believe that it has to be that.</p>
<p>Please, anyone here, name an opportunity that has been structured and targeted to help black and brown people in Rockford. Name something else outside of the regrow grant. Please, anyone. &gt;&gt; I understand helping to balance this budget. However, there is still a purpose for these funds and I think that every single penny of them should be considered to go back into this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re actually engaging in discussion on the council floor in drafting an amendment. That&#x27;s I as far as I know that is all [clears throat] out of order. I think we are way out of order. So they I I don&#x27;t believe we should recess. I think the amendment can be brought at any time somewhere else or an ordinance.</p>
<p>But again, the reason for the rules that we have established is exactly what&#x27;s happening now. It&#x27;s a little bit chaotic. we can go down this new road of of every week coming in here and someone asking for a recess to allow on the-fly amendment on on any given topic. Uh which really just makes us all look, you know, silly. &gt;&gt; We are saving every resident $325 on their property taxes, especially those median income earners who spend 9 to 14% of their income on uh their local taxes.</p>
<p>It allows every child in our community to go to college. Allows us to cover the cost of all their lead service lines. Allows us to provide every child a free bus ride. Anyone who wants to improve themselves with education.</p>
