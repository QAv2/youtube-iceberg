            <p>form the sort of little intellectual Collective where they&#x27;re going to defeat gravity so for example just because people are going to say Eric this is all nonsense and it isn&#x27;t Jamie is it possible to pull up a stone monument at Tufts universities to the anti-gravity that was done there so put in tough Stone anti-gravity these this guy littered universities all across the country with these monuments to prove that this anti-gravity stuff was actually taking place at American universities and he established an essay contest all right so check this out this Monument has been erected by the Gravity Research Foundation Roger Babson founder to remind students the blessings forth comes with science determines what gravity is and how it works and how it may be controlled this is about UFOs and the idea that we are going to harness the power of gravity and we&#x27;re going to get a supreme advantage and these stones are littered around the country here&#x27;s another one so this is not widely known that this research is being done this is hugely embarrassing to us hugely embarrassing because it hasn&#x27;t yielded results no hugely embarrassing because it carries the stench of pseudoscience see when people don&#x27;t like me coming on your program and saying things that nobody else in the world is saying they call me a pseudoscientist or that&#x27;s crackpot and these words like you don&#x27;t take them that seriously we had this discussion before with like Tim Dillon saying something about me uh you know what has he ever done academics play these games with each other where we try to push each other out of the ring like sumo wrestlers and the way you push somebody out is you say oh that guy&#x27;s a crack buddy he&#x27;s a grifter he&#x27;s a pseudoscientist right he&#x27;s nutty he&#x27;s a Nutter  this was the marriage of the ultimate nuttiness with the highest Prestige physics we know how to do and was this considered nuttiness in 64 though this is the interesting question in the middle of the 1950s this is mainstream in newspapers but for example Bryce DeWitt so here&#x27;s how this two stories cross okay you start off with Babson and Benson okay they&#x27;re they&#x27;re the money Babson found something called the Gravity Research Foundation in New Boston New Hampshire and he gets the Glenn L Martin company which is the precursor of Martin Marietta precursor of Lockheed Martin do you know this stuff no okay and he gets them to hire Lewis Whitten out of Johns Hopkins Lewis Witten is a respectable physicist who takes the position and forms something called the research institute for advanced study now you&#x27;ve probably heard of bell Labs or Xerox Park and you probably haven&#x27;t heard of the research institute for advanced study yet this has illustrious names associated with it uh Solomon left shets the great topologist comes out of retirement to work on this anti-gravity uh inspired project Rudolph Coleman of Coleman filtering there&#x27;s no shortage Sheldon glass show who discovers spontaneous symmetry breaking under Julian schwinger at Harvard is attached to the Research Institute of advanced study it has a campus in Baltimore Maryland that uh you know I can tell you the address at some point we pretend that it didn&#x27;t happen and doesn&#x27;t exist</p>
