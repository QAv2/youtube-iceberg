            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this channel is an educational Channel we look at theories of everything all encompassing theories Paradigm shifters uh Dead crackpots who put together Magnum opuses that are um all in uh in Jeopardy of being uh thrown on the trash heap of history and uh other things that I think might benefit your life uh maybe in the way that they maybe have benefited mine and uh today is our 358th video on dwey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory Mr Larson lived uh born in 1898 died in 1990 about 1930 he was crossing the street uh working on a uh chemistry problem he was um a mining engineer chemical engineer and uh living out in the Portland area and uh he&#x27;s trying to come up with some kind of a numerical equation for the interatomic distance of elements and uh he had an epiphany and he went home got on his Slide Rule and um was like Hey that gives me the answer to my problem a little bit later on he&#x27;s working on another problem and he had the idea why don&#x27;t I plug in that uh the solution that I come up with before and see if it works in this case too and Bam the answer popped out um he began to try to apply his principles to other questions and kept getting uh steady U interesting and promising uh answers So eventually he you know um turned his life around at you know toward uh trying to solve this uh uh larger problem he initially had just been trying to solve kind of like smaller problems within his field but he recognized that he might have some kind of a universal principle and so he answered the call and um got to work and it took him about 25 30 years before he worked out uh worked out the Kinks to the point that he could present his two fundamental postulates in about 1959 and uh first postulate U and the most important is that the Universe was composed of entirely of one component that being motion Motion in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and then his second postulate is the universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian now just to unpack that first postulate a little bit um he&#x27;s saying the universe is made out of matter uh not made out of matter not made out of energy not made out of force but it is made out of motion and other people have come up with that before Thomas Hobs being one also uh Renee deart tried to build their his Universe out of uh motion but did not succeed uh because they didn&#x27;t um they didn&#x27;t uh redefine motion the way that it needed to be uh probably one of the key things that Larson did with his concept of motion is that he recognized by the fact that motion is the relationship between space and time um that took space and time out of the running for being the container of the Universe um most people still today consider space and time to be kind of the container or the stage of the universe upon which the drama of the universe occurs the drama of the universe occurs in three dimensions of space and moving through time so space and time are the container of the universe for Larson space and time became the contents of the universe so they weren&#x27;t so much the container uh the stage on which the universe operated but they were actually also the players of the universe you know the the characters of the universe were made out of space and time now he called it the reciprocal system because of this reciprocal relationship between space and in time basically what he&#x27;s saying is that motion is a um fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator such as speed speed is measured as space over time the bicycle is moving at 15 M hour 15 miles of space in 1 hour of time speed now you can see the reciprocal relationship if you decide to double the speed if you double the speed you would then say the bicycle is now moving uh at 30 miles hour 30 mil of space in 1 hour of time or you can say equivalently that the bicycle is now moving 15 miles per half hour so you can multiply you can double the speed or you can half you can double the space or you can half the time get the same result that is characteristic of a reciprocal another characteristic of a reciprocal is just thinking in math terms go back to your you know uh sixth grade math class or whatever you know where the reciprocal of three is 1/3 the reciprocal of two is 1/2 they multiply to be one when you multiply two reciprocals you get one also reciprocals have the same characteristics so Larson is attempting to apply these characteristics of reciprocals to space and time now um uh one thing that he&#x27;s doing he&#x27;s saying saying that space and time do not exist separately they only exist together in motion and um they have the same qualities and so if You observe one quality in one it also exists in the other and that&#x27;s first where he&#x27;s getting the three-dimensionality you look at uh three dimensions of space coordinate space or volume uh XYZ coordinates that is a characteristic that we observe about space therefore Larson said that characteristic also adheres to time um that is what Larson calls coordinate time and then uh he observed time and notice that time progresses time is always getting later and later and later and later um but it&#x27;s not really getting later in any particular direction and so he applied this concept to space uh he calls this clock time and clock space uh space is always getting farther and farther and farther farther apart but in no particular direction and uh you can Envision this using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other um and even the spaces between the dots are moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction uh it&#x27;s actually the basically the surface of the balloon itself is expanding and it&#x27;s carrying the dots with it with it and that creates uh a what Larson calls a scalar motion that&#x27;s a motion with a magnitude but no specific Direction and uh that was that&#x27;s also been observed by scientists looking through their telescopes determining that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other now they use this to justify the um really shaky concept of the Big Bang uh that at some point in the distant past all of these all the matter of the universe was confined to one Singularity and then there was a giant explosion and the fact that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other as evidence of that explosion um or it could just be that space is expanding and uh the distant galaxies are going along for the ride so um and that so basically we&#x27;ve got the universe is composed entirely of one component motion uh in particular I I think Larson might have wanted to use the term scalar motion there the universe is composed entirely of one component Motion in three dimensions coordinate time coordinate space in discrete units now larsson&#x27;s discrete unit postulate is that uh space and time are not continuous they are discret there is no uh there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time you have to have a full unit of space or time before you have anything and um so and then he&#x27;s putting in also the concept of the reciprocal that they multiply to be one if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light which Larson refers to as unit speed so unit speed is the one 1 over 1 equal 1 unit speed is the one uh that unites all the reciprocals in Larson system so um this creates a boundary um it&#x27;s basically like the halfway point the null point the state of rest the origin The Ether the uh natural reference system what Lon calls the progression of the natural reference system and uh then that creates two different sectors of the universe the material sector which is moving slower than the speed of light and the cosmic sector which is moving faster than the speed of light Which flies in the face of the Legacy scientist determination of going along with Einstein that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe in Larson system the speed of light is the midpoint and half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light but even though the Legacy scientists are entirely ignorant of the cosmic sector they can catch up very quickly because they know a lot about the material sector and everything that they know about the material sector can be applied to the cosmic sector uh through the reciprocal postulate you just have to invert the roles of space and time so in the material sector you have um coordinate space three dimensions of space and you have clock time progressing time getting later and later and later well once you cross that unit speed boundary the speed of light boundary and you move into the cosmic sector then your relationships are that you have coordinate time three dimensions of time and you have clock space space is always getting later and later and later later so that&#x27;s um you know a little bit about how that first postulate Works larsson&#x27;s second postulate is much more general or just kind of Elementary uh but it was mostly rejected by uh some of his followers especially Dr Bruce paret who claims that the G geometry of the universe is not ukian or at least not entirely ukian that it is projective and ukian geometry is just a subset of projective geometry uh Dr Pratt also got rid of um the idea of uh primary magnitudes instead of just magnitudes and also he got rid of um uh Comm utive mathematics so the second postulate is uh if you if if you read Pet&#x27;s uh revision of the second postulate it reads more like the universe uh conforms to the relations of ordinary mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is projective now today is the third day that we&#x27;re reading one of Pet&#x27;s papers rs2 d107 uh which is called mass and gravity and uh we&#x27;ve been reading all of Pet&#x27;s rs2 papers rs2 is the thing that pet and Dr kbk neru formulated um after Larson died um as kind of the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system taking the spirit of the reciprocal system and U many of the Great ings that Larson has made but uh tweaking it a little bit um in response to some of the things that Larson tried to derive that didn&#x27;t exactly work out now what Larson tried to do is he tried to take his fundamental postulates and from them derive a theoretical universe and then compare that theoretical Universe with that of uh that the Legacy scientist had observed and measured measured uh in the past and uh Larson&#x27;s findings stood up very very well uh with uh especially with Newtonian mechanics and also provided Corrections in terms of the relativistic areas that were the same areas that the Newtonian mechanics were having problems figuring out and that what required Einstein to come up with this theory of relativity that the newon and mechanics weren&#x27;t working in certain areas of the very fast the very small and the very large um but there were still some sticking points and so Dr pet uh tried to come up with rs2 and try to like kind of almost modernize the reciprocal system using some things that Larsson didn&#x27;t really know about or knew about dimly such as uh non- idian geometry complex number um um computer Imaging um and uh a few other a few other um innovations that pret uh also um Yan psychology um a few other things that pet tried to inject into the reciprocal system okay so we&#x27;re uh so if you want to get the the start of this paper you go back two episodes but uh we will take over in this paper mass and gravity uh starting from the section that is called particles moving at the speed of light just because a particle is massless does not mean it is carried by the progression of the natural reference system at the speed of light and you know so this progression of the natural reference system that&#x27;s basically like the surface of the balloon that is expanding at the speed of light unit speed in natural units as photons are oh as photons are so like a photon that is why photons are constantly or they their speed is constant it&#x27;s always measured at the speed of light because a photon is actually not moving it&#x27;s not moving relative to the surface of that balloon to the expansion of space at the speed of light so it&#x27;s not moving so when we are measuring it from our um seemingly not moving uh reference point we are measuring the speed of light always at as the speed of light as a constant because the photon that we are measuring is actually not moving which means that it is expanding compared to where we are at the speed of light in order for a particle to be carried there needs to be a free Dimension a dimension at unit speed in one of the three scalar dimensions of motion for the progression to have effect uncharged electrons and positrons only use a single scalar Dimension leaving two free Dimensions to be carried by the progression um of the natural reference system now just remember there are three three scalar Dimensions but each scalar Dimension requires [Music] three dimensions of space to represent them okay so there&#x27;s a difference between a scalar Dimension and a spatial Dimension and um we really only can reckon one scalar Dimension at a time but there are three of them and so when we start to see motions in the second and third scalar Dimensions we&#x27;re seeing them uh from a distorted point of view and we only can see a a fraction of what&#x27;s actually going on uh okay he&#x27;s he&#x27;s uh incorporating too many different uh you know um Concepts here but photons as a bir rotation this another correction that uh pet is attempting to make about the photon Larson&#x27;s Photon was a combination of a translational Motion in Larson system there&#x27;s four kinds of motion there&#x27;s translational motion there is a vibrational motion there is a rotational motion and there is a rotational vibration and these motions can be in multiple dimensions and in the case of the photon they are combined the photon is a com combination of a translational motion and the combination uh with a vibrational Motion in a perpendicular Direction and so when you combine the two you end up getting a sine wave which is the signature of a photon now in Dr Pet&#x27;s estimation and Dr kbk neu&#x27;s estimation uh who came up with this concept first uh the photon is actually the result of a by rotation two rotations two counter rotations when added together uh they also create a sine wave so so he&#x27;s he&#x27;s saying that the photon is the result of a bir rotation photons as a bir rotation use two scalar Dimensions basically a positron electron combination with uh and positrons and electrons are rotating units a an electron is a rotating unit of space and a positron is a rotating unit of time and so when you combine the two you get a by rotation okay so a photon as a by rotation use two scalar Dimensions basically a positron and electron combination with the Third available to be carried by the progression uncharged electron neutrinos use a single magnetic and electric Dimension leaving one free Dimension to be carried by the progression muan neutrinos are a single magnetic Dimension analogous to a magnetic monopole leaving two free Dimensions to be carried by the progression charge the vibration created by a photon captured in a rotation occupies two Dimensions any charge particle will use all three dimensions so it cannot be carried at the speed of light and behaves more like a particle than such as the charged electrons of static electricity starting with the proton all three dimensions are occupied so atoms are never carried by the progression so as soon as you basically occupy all three scalar dimensions then you you are no longer being progressed by the natural reference system and you appear as a stationary particle okay uh now we&#x27;re at the next section um I&#x27;m sorry this this article uh is is kind of difficult because um there are just a lot of uh Concepts that uh Pet&#x27;s bringing in bringing to bear um all at once we&#x27;ll start this section it&#x27;s called directional reversals and the rotational base this is an article probably should have it probably should have taken him 50 pages to write this but he tries to write it in in five pages so um okay just to start this section Larson considered only linear velocity to be primary because he was thinking in spatial terms where the concept of rotation required two Dimensions but consider the case of an astronaut with a baseball out in the vacuum of space where no other forces are present he can do two things with that baseball throw it where it will continue to move at a linear velocity forever in a straight line or spin it and it will rotate uh an angular velocity forever in eastern philosophy linear motion is Yang and angular motion is Yin spin is Yin a primary angular velocity is every bit as probable as a primary linear velocity okay so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s another Innovation that pret attempted to you know impose on the reciprocal system is the uh DST Chinese um philosophy in particular yinyang Phil uh philosophy he he thought that Larson approached uh the reciprocal system way too much of a yin Manner and pet attempted to kind of inject more of a yin yang um Duality into the reciprocal system and he saw that the yin was rotation in Larson&#x27;s system um he built everything upon the photon you had to have a photon Larson considered a photon to be a you know a vibrating motion that then was also propelled by uh the reference uh system in a perpendicular Dimension um and he considered that you had to have that vibrating motion before you could in order to build matter like so in order to have rotation you needed to have the vibration first but peret is saying that the the rotation is every bit as primary as the vibration and so you don&#x27;t need to have you don&#x27;t need to First have a vibrating motion before you uh can have a rotating motion lson would say you can&#x27;t rotate until you have something to rotate and peret is saying yes you can you can have something to rotate or you can rotate without anything needed to rotate because rotation is primary just like vibration is and here he&#x27;s saying a primary angular velocity is every bit as probable as a primary linear velocity Larson in order to get rotation with a Yang only approach he needed something to rotate which gave rise to two devices that of the direction reversal and the rotational base the Direction reversal is simply a diameter on which to create rotation as an angular velocity resulting in the rotational base this rotational base supplied the missing component on which to build Atomic rotations that was not present in a purely linear system in rs2 the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system we assume that the yin angular velocity is a primary Ro a primary motion along with the Yang linear speed completing the Dow of motion taking this geometry into account the progression of the natural reference system is still outward at unit speed but with one aspect being a linear outward speed a translation and the other aspect being an angular outward speed a rotation therefore every location is potentially a rotational base and the concept of a direction reversal is unnecessary because rotation is primary and rs2 does not require something to rotate this infers that the concept of vibration which Larson Associates with his Direction reversal is not a primary motion but only arises as a sheer strain from oppositely directed motions such as the counter rotations of a bir rotation as expressed in Oilers Formula E to the iix plus e to the minus iix equal 2 cosine of x and that&#x27;s uh Leonard Oiler um one of his theories and that is the formula for a bir rotation uh you get two um counter rotations and so that gets rid of the whole idea of vibration as a primary motion but it comes out of the idea of by rotation okay we&#x27;re going to leave it there uh rotational Dimensions is the next section and uh thanks for tuning in for today hang in there with the reciprocal system and we will talk to you</p>
