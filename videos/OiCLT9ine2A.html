            <p>Did you know there&#x27;s a Nazi legend called Da Glocka, a bell that sounds like science fiction but grew from wartime secrecy in a single journalist&#x27;s book? The tale says it was a bell-shaped device about 12 ft tall. Two counterrotating cylinders filled with a strange purplish liquid nicknamed Zerum 525. Witnesses in later books claimed it spit out radiation, killed test animals, and even poisoned workers. Wikowski, a Polish researcher, first laid out the story in 2000, and writers like Nick Cook pushed it into the popular imagination. But here&#x27;s the important part.</p>
<p>Mainstream historians and skeptical journalists warn the evidence is thin. There are no solid wartime documents. Eyewitness reports are secondhand, and many details trace back to rumor and post-war sensationalism. Experts generally treat diglock as a myth or gross exaggeration, not a proven vunderafa.</p>
