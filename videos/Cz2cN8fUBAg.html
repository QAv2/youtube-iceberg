            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel focused on uh learning about theories of everything how we can apply them and uh what they are and uh looking at some uh specific theories of everything in great detail uh We&#x27;ve covered uh the ancient Egyptian tree of life and uh now we&#x27;re covering the reciprocal system of theory got several more on our plate but we want to uh get a little bit more here on the reciprocal system today is video number 308 that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Mr dwey B Larson Mr Larson uh was an American engineer who lived back in the 20th century died back in 1990 left behind a small um group of dedicated researchers who have tried to carry forward his work we&#x27;re looking at one of them today Dr kvk neru and um he uh wrote an article that we&#x27;re going to look at that&#x27;s called multi-dimensional SpaceTime and uh this is an article that&#x27;s going to go into some of uh looking at some of larsson&#x27;s work uh from a book that he wrote called beyond space and time uh which was his final book published pous uh and this was his foray into uh metaphysics including uh religion and psychology and philosophy and a little bit of biology and um Larson uh this book was seen uh by some of his followers as a little bit of a blaspheme because um they thought that Larsson would never want to have this published Larson was kind of a hard-headed scientist and he just wrote all this stuff as kind of his own private musings and he never want to have this published uh but his wife published it uh after he died and um I personally think it&#x27;s definitely was worth you know publishing it um and it looks like it&#x27;s a pretty complete work as well so um nrow is going to address some of that uh before we kind of get into what neru talks about just a little brief brief uh summary of Larson&#x27;s Theory itself um Larson contended that we live in a universe made entirely of motion uh not matter and not energy but motion and for Larson motion was the relationship between space time he in fact called it space time uh at the very beginning of his articulation of his fundamental postulates that occurred in the late 1950s he eventually uh decided to use the term motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time have no independent existence they just exist together in motion and uh motion is basically a ratio or a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator this brings out a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time um and space and time both have um the same qualities uh so space and time are both three-dimensional they have uh XYZ coordinates or with with time they have three separate independent coordinates and then uh space and time both have aspects that are progressing uh they&#x27;re uh Larson calls this clock time and clock space uh the clock is progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later but in no specific Direction that&#x27;s What lson calls a scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion with a magnitude but no Direction no specific Direction uh you can also apply that to to space uh clock space is the fact that everything is getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no specific Direction which you would use a a balloon with dots on it as a model there you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction and um then also space and time are both quantized meaning that there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you do not have space if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time then you don&#x27;t have time if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light and the speed of light in Larson system is what he calls unit speed this is the background or the origin or the uh ether the reference point of larsson&#x27;s universe uh which means that half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light which uh goes right against uh Einstein&#x27;s dictum that um the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe for Larson it&#x27;s the midpoint of the universe and half the universe is moving faster that he calls the cosmic sector the half that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light he calls the material sector the material sector and the cosmic sector are identical except that the roles of space and time are reversed in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and you have clock time time is always getting later and later and later in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and you have clock space everything is getting farther and farther and farther apart um and so uh you can extrapolate one to the other and if you cross that speed of light boundary the rules change the rules invert so those are things that you have to keep in mind now uh with his last book beyond space and time he moved into a a different realm and um I think nuu is going to address some of the new findings and the new discoveries of uh his book beyond space and time um basically Larson took those two fundamental postulates and then he uh he went through a deductive process 165 steps and he turned those two postulates well we really only talked about one of them the other one is just basically that the uh math it has to do with math and geometry of the universe and um he took those two postulates and uh through a process of deduction if if this then that kind of thing he derived an entire theoretical universe and that&#x27;s uh how he ended up writing his books uh the the the uh scientific books on the chemistry and the astronomy and the physics and um but then he went further than that with the beyond space and time book now I&#x27;ve done uh not only did I I do 15 videos on uh larsson&#x27;s deductive process those 165 steps that he went through uh to go from his postulates to a theoretical universe but I&#x27;ve also done about I think about 85 or 990 videos uh going through his book beyond space and time uh in its entirety so uh those are back in the archives if you want to check those out but we&#x27;re going to check into what Nar has to say about all this right now multi-dimensional SpaceTime I think this article was written in uh 2003 2002 and um here goes we have been working on a synthesis of the new discoveries relative to Larson beyond space and time the following is a summary report of the develop velopment in thought so far recapitulating space time and speed uh speed or motion are quantized there are several speed regions of the physical Universe which cannot be legitimately represented in the conventional three-dimensional spatial reference frame um so that&#x27;s coordinate space so so uh he&#x27;s talking about coordinate time um and maybe some other things as well in all the cases where Legacy theory is encountering serious difficulties the trouble arises because of the procrastinate attempts to fit all physical processes into the limited three-dimensional spatial frame there is a conjugate sector of the universe the cosmic sector which can only be represented in the analogous three-dimensional temporal reference frame most of the mysterious astronomical phenomena that have no proper explanation in the conventional Theory turn out to be the normal Cosmic sector phenomena as they appear to us high energy cosmic rays Cosmic microwave background and gamma ray burst are typical examples extrapolating the common sense View view of the universe around us to the far off regions the very large the very small and the very fast often does not lead to truth truth and again our human experience has shown this to us there are critical points thresholds and boundaries in the universe Crossing which the phenomena change radically uh this section is called 1 2 3 many in the universe of motion speed is the primary reality space or time individually can appear only derivatively starting with a point having no Dimension one can generate a line by moving it along a direction in space it is not possible to generate an area by a point moving the point simultaneously along two orthogonal directions in space with speeds u and v respectively for example still generates a line only not an area in order to generate area we have to start with the line as the generator this means that the line should already be present before the movement in an orth orthogonal Al Dimension takes place since to start with the line is generated by the movement of a point the availability of a finite line segment in zero time simply implies that either the speed U or the speed V has to be infinite but since speed is quantized infinite speed does not exist however since areas actually exist the requirement of the availability of a finite line segment in zero time can be met by another expediency namely the possibility of multi-dimensional time suppose the motion say speed V which generates the line segment from the point pertains to a Time Dimension T2 or orthogonal to the time Dimension T1 pertaining to the speed U then even though it takes time T2 to generate the line segment in the y direction it would be as though it took no time from the point of view of time Dimension T1 thus it would be possible to generate area and in reality the total process results in um cm squar per second squared rather than cenim squar per second or you know whatever time space units you want to use further since three-dimensional Space volume exists this could only be generated similarly by threedimensional speed uh centime thir to the 3 over seconds to the 3 with three mutually orthogonal dimensions of time available uh if you don&#x27;t remember from geometry and stuff orthogonal means at a right angle at least that&#x27;s what I think it means there is documentation of states of Consciousness experiencing four five and higher dimensional space this implies the possibility of n dimensional speed uh s to the N over t to the N composed of n dimensional space in conjunction with n dimensional time subsisting as a substratum for lower dimensional speed space and time in fact Larson does allude to this possibility in beyond space and time lson postulates that the third sector the metaphysical sector is outside that is not part of the material sector or the cosmic sector at the same time he posits an evolution of the ethical control units pertaining to the metaphysical sector but as I pointed out uh Evolution implies time if the metaphysical sector is outside time no change and therefore no evolution is possible but on the other hand the possibility of higher dimensional space time of which uh space to the thir power over time to the third power is a subset in which they exist not only renders them independent of the latter but also leaves the possibility of evolution in other dimensions of time open we have discussed the question of the dimensionality of space um space time in reference to we have shown that three dimensional space or time could be represented by the three orthogonal rotational operators i j and k uh the imaginary numbers with the following properties uh I2 = J2 = K2 = -1 i j equal Ji and uh equals K and J K equal KJ equals I and I uh and k ials i k equal J in a closed group of operators like one i j and k the result of the combination of any number of the basil elements is also a member of the same group the result of any such combination can be known only if all the possible binary combinations of the elements are first defined in terms of the basal elements i j and k themselves besides of course the identity operator one Suppose there are n basal elements excluding the unit operator 1 in a group then the number of unique binary combinations of these elements in which no element occurs twice is n * the quantity nus1 over 2 uh the whole quantity over two we can readily see that a group becomes self-sufficient or finite only if the number of binary combinations of basal elements is equal to the number of those basal elements themselves that is if n * the quantity nus1 the whole quantity over two equals n the only definite solution for n is three zero and infin and infinity are other Solutions therefore if we regard space uh or spa space and time as a group of orthogonal rotations its dimensionality has to be three in order to make it self-sufficient dimensionally otherwise the number of Dimensions either has to shrink to zero or proliferate to Infinity this means that only three-dimensional space or time is self- sustaining once created whereas the higher dimensional spaces or times have to be sustained from outside because some binary combinations remain to be supported or defined from outside the group structure um now he is I think here neglecting like uh tetrahedral coordinates uh because he&#x27;s insisting on the fact that these independent Dimensions have to be orthogonal but I mean if you look at the work of Buckminster Fuller uh he uses tetrahedral coordinates and those are four uh four-dimensional and they are um not orthogonal so I think he&#x27;s um making an assumption and it it may be correct but I don&#x27;t know but he&#x27;s making an assumption that these uh independent Dimensions um must be orthogonal okay uh we show this group property diagrammatically let the points or vertices represent the basic elements of a group namely The Operators other than the unit operator a line joining two vertices represents the binary combination the triangle is the case in point there are just as many base elements as there are binary combinations in the group BC the the only binary combination is BC but it cannot be defined in terms of either of the base elements since BC equals B for example requires C to be un operator which it is not uh he has a a figure that is supposed to be portraying this which I don&#x27;t have access to in the case of groups larger than three there occur binary combinations um that cannot be defined within the group and therefore require external definition it is interesting to note the cross the five-pointed star and the Seal of Solomon among these religious literature is replete with explanations of their symbology the cross represents the second person of the Trinity who stands for space and time not yet separated but potential the five pointed star is the symbol for the perfect man the interlace triangle angle U symbolizes the reflection of God in man there is a great science of chakras and mandalas known and practiced in India since the viic times concerned with the invocation of the powers of Consciousness through such forms the function of the living and the non-living uh is the name of the next section suppose we take uh log entropy logical entropy to be the measure of level of organization in three space in the material sector then the corresponding characteristic in the cosmic sector that represents the level of organization in three time could be called Cosmic uh log entropy now now since locations in threedimensional space are only randomly connected to Mo to locations in threedimensional time it is difficult to see how the log entropy level of the material structure of the cell could be maintained against its spontaneous tendency to get disorganized left to Itself by a spontaneous increase it of the cosmic log entropy of the cosmic control unit of the cell as lson proposes uh in larsson&#x27;s work he says that life is the result of a um combination of a material unit and a cosmic unit uh occurring in the proper proportions at the proper angle to be sure there are process processes in our material sector where order could increase like in Phase inphase changes uh like inphase change from gas to liquid or to solid speaking of the inversion of the S frame or spatial frame to the time frame uh that takes place on entering the quantum domain the time region uh now the time region is the region of um within the material sector of action of less than one unit of of space if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you do not have space and if you do not have space then you only have time because the universe is made out of space uh and time the universe made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time so if it&#x27;s not made out of space then it has to be made out of time it&#x27;s one or the other or both and uh so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you only have time and Larsson refers to that as the time region the time region is the region inside a unit of space and uh this is the realm of you know Atomic phenomena in and molecular phenomena and um the rules also invert when you cross that boundary just like when you cross the speed of light boundary uh you if you cross into the time region the rules invert the same is true of what Larson calls the space region and the space region is in the cosmic sector and it is a unit inside a unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time you only have space so the space region is also the region there for um realm of cosmic Atomic activity and um Cosmic molecular activity okay I think we&#x27;re going to leave it right there and uh we will take over tomorrow I know that this is uh also very difficult uh nou tends to go very fast he doesn&#x27;t really explain himself uh I think he just kind of assumes that you&#x27;re an engineer um and that all this language is is um old hat to you so you might need to rewind me and go slow um but you know you might be able to get something out of this if you kind of persevere and that&#x27;s pretty much what&#x27;s required for all of this stuff uh so it just comes with the territory you know if you want to learn quantum physics you&#x27;re you&#x27;re not going to really get it by you know just uh sitting around watching 20 minute videos um while while you&#x27;re you know uh eating lunch or something like that so uh you know all this requires study uh there&#x27;s a reward on the other end I think that is you know quite uh you know substantial uh learning quantum physics or chemistry or or physics or astronomy or any kind any of these subjects uh you know you don&#x27;t learn you know people go to college or graduate school or whatever for many many years to learn these things so um okay thanks for tuning in and we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow have a great</p>
