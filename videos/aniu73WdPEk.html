            <p>Hi people, as you probably noticed, I&#x27;ve been long talking about the need for the integration of neuroscurity framework into the national bio defense strategy as well as other policies is because of the threat that hasn&#x27;t received that deserved attention under the guise of secrecy. um it&#x27;s because it has been embedded in the system. And to be more specific, I&#x27;ll talk about the secret governmental programs and the concept of unacknowledged special access programs uh also referred to as black programs and how they actually define our today&#x27;s reality. This concept has long been associated with deeply classified government and military initiatives. They are often so secretive that their existence is denied or hidden from most of the executive and legislative branches including even the president or congress unless there is a need to know.</p>
<p>There are several classifications of special access programs uh SAP for short acknowledged unacnowledged and waved the ramification of unacnowledged. First one as name suggests is acknowledged and uh recognized um by the public but classified. The second one unacknowledged has enhanced security measures and as opposed to the first one is not acknowledged publicly. Meanwhile the waved SAPs um apply extreme limitations in access according with the specific statutory authority where reporting requirements are waved by the secretary of defense. if waved um or unacknowledged special access programs are those with minimal oversight not even disclosed to the congressional defense committees if not absolutely necessary then if targeted highranked officials like Tulsi Gabard for example wouldn&#x27;t be fully acknowledged of the situation I know many requests for information concerning the um Havana syndrome civilian cases under the foyer act were declined for the reasons of national security according to um Tulsi Gabbard&#x27;s interview on Fox News, she thought she was targeted by the TSA, which is in fact just a part of a much bigger operational environment.</p>
<p>Referring to my previous videos about the capabilities of the neurological cyber warfare, I want to emphasize that psychological manipulation with active remote neurological interference is detrimental and can change human perception and views which is in fact critical moment for someone positioned as high as Tulsi Gabbert. The Havana syndrome uh for instance with its um famous AHIS on the other hand looks like an artificially created precedent with a controlled burst in media. Uh and I will explain why the actual capabilities of the technology in fact allow for the covert execution with um higher effectiveness than what&#x27;s been described. As an example, strokes could be simulated uh or a common tactic is also mimicking one&#x27;s medical issue which is um extremely convenient for uh for such an execution. Technically, there is no need to create new symptoms uh if the attack can be masked under the symptoms that already exist in person.</p>
<p>In other words, old symptoms could resurface again in a more severe form and no one would um even try to prove a theory of a deliberate attack due to the plausible denability which is also extremely common in civilian cases. Such situation um could be refuted as a stress at work for example or literally anything else. But instead this was not only done in a clement manner but allowed to slide in the media. It&#x27;s extremely atypical at least for that time period. The initiation of Havana Act promoted by some members of the Senate Intelligence Committee then followed in 2021.</p>
<p>And still I can&#x27;t get over the fact that um it could have been done covertly without acutely determinable symptoms of the electronic magnetic exposure. So I basically incline towards the possibility of soft disclosure of cognitive warfare to introduce um neural manipulation into mainstream awareness without actually triggering the panic. um as well as for example normalize the concept of invisible non-kinetic warfare and expand neuroscience from medicine domain to national security and behavioral control. It makes much more sense. But now let&#x27;s see the repercussions of that disclosure.</p>
<p>Um look how it helped Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign. The majority of the general public might have not noticed uh these movements, but thanks to the statements about him supposedly planning to dismantle the deep state. Here&#x27;s my plan to dismantle the deep state and reclaim our democracy from Washington corruption. Trump won thousands of votes across the country. However, after the new administration took over the White House, what do we see? Trump acting like he&#x27;s about to dismantle the US government to reveal the deep state um like it&#x27;s going to happen any moment while finding himself just destabilizing the US economy, allowing the adversaries to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>All general aspects of targeting that I noticed across both government and public domains are reflected in new administration&#x27;s affairs and how they actually handle their business. Gaslighting, possible deniability, informationational offiscation, psychological manipulation, and discrediting of trustworthy parties. Hey, but look who else pushed the narrative about the deep state. The whispers have been coming from across the ocean since the time of the first Trump&#x27;s presidency till these days. So, do you think that&#x27;s a coincidence? They almost got me in the first part, though.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not going to lie. Supposedly, if Trump himself as well as his team know about uh covert targeting of the American population and are in one or the other way targeted themselves, referring to the deep state, they will finally help to address this issue. But they did exactly the opposite when they finally took their new positions. I don&#x27;t think it was their ultimate goal, but theoretically, if um anyone would ever want to take down the government, this is how it would look like. Disabling the governance structure, um dismantling key government institutions and offices, eradication of democracy, economy, destabilization, and undermining relationships with allies, effectively decapacitating the country on the global geopolitical landscape.</p>
<p>decreasing the defense and national education budgets, psychologically manipulating and controlling the national population by the means of neurochnological interventions and targeting. They&#x27;ve been talking about it for years, but in order to um notice that the information, you&#x27;ve got to be aware of its meaning in the first place. If even the high ranking government officials aren&#x27;t safe from this influence, then it&#x27;s a serious matter of national security. While the general population is being manipulated by AI curated content streams to shape beliefs in emotionally reactive social media feeds, people go out to protest what they believe is unfair. The new administration has given plenty of reasons for that.</p>
<p>And my personal uh takeaway from it all um is the fact that they started attacking specifically marginalized uh social groups such as LGBTQ community, veterans, immigrants, women in general, and specifically what pertains to women&#x27;s healthcare and reproductive health. What&#x27;s more disturbing is the accusations of the fake origin of these protests. All these supposedly organic handsoff protests scripted from down to the callbacks. Some say people freak out for no reason. Others state that protests were scripted.</p>
<p>Well, it may shock someone, but in order to get people out to protest, you&#x27;ve got to have a plan of coordinate actions for more effectiveness and guess what? Better safety. But this isn&#x27;t even the point. I once again want to point out yet another parallel with the Russian propaganda. Because guess who downgraded their recent protests calling them a deep state initiative? Geril Dmitri, the special envoy of the Russian president for investment and economic cooperation in the United States. The post says verbatim, &quot;When the hands-off protests are this well organized, it begs the question, is the deep state applying its playbook from color revolutions abroad to attempt one at home?&quot; End quote.</p>
<p>But hold on, degrading people&#x27;s sense of purpose and the will to fight the injustice. This methodology vividly reminds me of something. Oh, let me tell you whose playbook this is. It&#x27;s actually the one of Kremlin. Now, let me circle back to the waved unacknowledged special access programs.</p>
<p>Um, I mentioned it because that&#x27;s the only way to create a statewide ecosystem of mass manipulation andor surveillance with the help of classified military technology. Right? Whatever party, agency, or project is involved, there&#x27;s clearly a security breach that allowed the recent events to unravel. They clearly clash together people with different political backgrounds to create the internal chaos. Ultimately, the regular people suffer from injustice and targeting, entering traumatic experiences and um various financial hardships. It&#x27;s extremely important to be mindful and voice your true opinion.</p>
<p>If everyone stands up to the oppression, there will be no one to oppress. People have to realize that we are being provoked to fight each other. This isn&#x27;t right. Pardon my twisted language, but uh Americans have to remember how to stay united in the United States of America. Now more than ever, um I think it&#x27;s important to um be mindful and objectively analyze the real threat.</p>
<p>Now, while editing my video, I came across some positive news. Tulsi Gabbard initiated a task force aimed at restoring transparency and accountability of the national intelligence. She stated, quote, &quot;We are committed to executing the president&#x27;s vision and focusing the intelligence community on its core mission, ensuring our security by providing the president and policymakers with timely, aolitical, objective, relevant intelligence to inform their decision-making to ensure the safety, security, and freedom of the American people. I hope that safety, security, and freedom will also incorporate cognitive sovereignty of the nation when the director&#x27;s initiatives group gets to look into the anomalous health incidents and as stated the Biden administration&#x27;s domestic surveillance and censorship actions against Americans. So maybe there&#x27;s still some faith in those who challenged our expectations.</p>
<p>Soon we&#x27;ll see.</p>
