            <p>okay it&#x27;s a nice rainy day here in England and it&#x27;s about time I made this video so today I&#x27;m gonna show you how to make a basic scaler device so these are the things you want to eat in front of you and the most important thing is the wire okay so you want to have a wire that&#x27;s quite long the longer the wire the more bends and coils you can make into it and the stronger the field okay so let&#x27;s see if I can get this in focus it&#x27;s over this why here you want a coated wire so you want the white be insulated if it&#x27;s exposed it won&#x27;t work okay the other thing you want with your wire is that you want to be able to bend it bend this I dropped it so you want to be able to bend it and when you let go ideally it shouldn&#x27;t Bend back so this is bending back slowly as you can see so it&#x27;s not the most ideal wire but it will work for the purposes of this video so more of a waxy type of plastic you want so that it stays in place and it doesn&#x27;t Bend back okay and then to bend the wire into the coil that we&#x27;re gonna make you will at least need a pair of pliers so that we can twist the wire obviously this has para cutters on there as well if we ever need to cut but you can also use a drill to speed up the process if you do have a battery powered or plug in drill then you can actually speed up the process of twisting the wire and then what we&#x27;re going to use here to connect our wire to otherwise is we only use these very basic plastic connectors so you can see here if I show up closer there&#x27;s little screws in there when you just twist the screws the screws on the inside here press against the wire so the Y presses against the metal inside there look and it&#x27;s an easy way of connecting wire together without needing solder and then obviously we have a screwdriver to help her do that and we have a basic knife a sharp knife to cut open the wire sit to expose the wire and then some plastic tape so typical tape that you would find an electrician store just to hold things in place or of course you can use a glue we&#x27;re not going to use glue today and then there&#x27;s many many things you can put this wire that we&#x27;re about to twist around so for today we&#x27;re going to use a basic glass jar but of course at a later date I might show you how you can put the coil around other things like crystals for example to change the way the scalar field works but you can get very effective scalar field just from using a glass jar and then the last thing which is what we&#x27;re going to connect this Y to is to a basic headphone wire okay so I&#x27;ve already cut the end off here it&#x27;s gonna have to focus again there it is I&#x27;ve already cut the end off there so it&#x27;s a basic headphone thing there so you can connect the coil to a mobile phone or an mp3 player so that you can play lots of different frequencies through the Y okay so the first step is to grab hold of your wire and get the two ends and then when you pull it straight you can find the center point of the wire and you put the center point around a nail or a door handle that you can easily take it off afterwards because when we twist the wire if it&#x27;s not something you can take it off then the wires going to be trapped okay so make sure you put it around a handle or something that way you can take the wire off easily later and then as you stand back all the wire nice and tight okay so we&#x27;ve got the two ends of the wire here what we&#x27;re gonna do is put a pair of pliers around the center and then we&#x27;re gonna twist it counterclockwise okay here I&#x27;m just illustrating that I&#x27;m using a pair of pliers to twist the wire slowly counterclockwise okay and the key thing here is to keep holding on the Wyss the wire it&#x27;s got tension because if there&#x27;s no tension then why won&#x27;t twist evenly and what you can do to save time here is you can actually use a pair of an electric drill to speed up the process and do it very very quickly okay so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do in a second just to speed things up but as you can see with time that you can slowly do this yourself just with a pair of pliers okay okay so here we have the other example so I stuck the wire into the end of the drill bit here nice and tight so it doesn&#x27;t come out and then we make sure that it is spinning counterclockwise and then we just simply again maintain tension [Music] you can see it slowly builds up twisting the wife I can get that in focus you can see it&#x27;s starting to twist the wire a bit like DNA so hard to get this in focus here I&#x27;m showing you the very messy room here so you can see the the coil stop twist more and more and more and more in that we&#x27;re at a phase where we&#x27;ve got nearly 45-degree angle it&#x27;s incredibly hard together I could focus here there we go so you can see it&#x27;s almost like a 45-degree angle with the twists on the course which is gonna do a little bit more ok so this is the why we have ended up with this was the part that went around the door handle okay so it&#x27;s important to have this loop and here&#x27;s the other end so you can see naturally the because the wire isn&#x27;t that waxy type of plastic the stays in place it has unwind it quite a bit but the still works very nicely for forming a scalar field so the whole idea is that he pass energy through one wire it goes all the way along the coil around one way all the way to the loop and the electricity passes around the loop and then goes back the other way so the idea is that you are got electricity going in two different directions coiling around each other so two electromagnetic fields in equal and opposite directions and therefore it cancels out creating a zero-point field otherwise known as a scalar field interesting huh so DNA is a bit like this and the way the heart is designed to creates a scale I feel quite nicely because of this equal and opposite electromagnetic field so that&#x27;s the basis for the coil that we&#x27;re gonna make okay so we&#x27;re on to the next stage now so we&#x27;ve got our glass bottle and we&#x27;ve just used a bit of tape to hold the one end of the wire onto the glass to help us make it more easily on the next stage so let&#x27;s start creating our mobius coil as they call it so we take the wire around the bottle and we leave it a little bit loose and then what we do is we take the loop here at the end of the wire and we pass it underneath the other one let&#x27;s pull the whole thing through so really Italy a little bit loose and then with our second pass through you put the wire around again and then as we come over the top of the other one here we come under our end of the wire again they come under the first wire that we did earlier let me just pull it through again okay so you can see it gets a bit tangled sometimes there we go okay so that&#x27;s our second pass through that&#x27;s come away a little bit isn&#x27;t it my last form okay it&#x27;s not very pretty looking and then you can of course do it again bring it round and then that would go underneath there again so let&#x27;s bring the other end of the wire and again we pass it underneath all of the Y&#x27;s let&#x27;s go starting to get a bit tighter now yeah and I can pull it through I&#x27;ve done that bit to time all the looks of it there we go again just pull it forever hold that and place that and go through so what you will see is that each wire passes over the top and then underneath the original wire then what you can do is once it gets quite tight is you can hold that in place with glue or with tape and then you can go up higher up here and then you can start to create your second pass through so a second round so you bring the wire over the top there and then it goes underneath that one there as you can see the wire has gone over the top of the original wire there I hope I&#x27;ve got this on camera okay okay let me go around again above the other wire and then we go underneath the other two wires here so again pass underneath the other two wires there we go so we&#x27;ve got that wire that we just brought above the other two wires above the other two wires and then it goes underneath the other two wires and then out the other end and then round again above the other two wires and then it goes underneath so you cross over here again and then go underneath all the otherwise it&#x27;s starting to get a bit tired again but in place so yet again that last wire just passed through it was above all the other wires and then we cross over here underneath all of the Y&#x27;s and then it comes out the other end here and then if we had more space we would go round again above the otherwise okay so we can keep doing that&#x27;s creating more of these coils like this so if this is confusing to you you can&#x27;t just simply wrap it round you know like this without passing it over and it would still work and it would still create a very powerful field without it being overly complex okay so I&#x27;m just gonna finish off this last bit here so here we have our finished product so with the last coil the tip of the call I just tucked it underneath and if the layers here so as you can see when it&#x27;s finished you have lots of coils one above the other and then they cross over the one below underneath all of the cores and then come above again so you end up with this strange pattern it&#x27;s not the prettiest there are people who&#x27;ve made this prettier but um that&#x27;s basically it and like I say it doesn&#x27;t need to pass over and under like I showed you if you just want to wrap it around the bottle at doing in knots like I&#x27;ve done then that works just as well because it still creates an equal and opposite field just by wrapping it around the bottle so that&#x27;s the finished wrap and then what we&#x27;re gonna do with this end bit here is connect it to our headphone Y okay so we&#x27;re going to connect this wire here this these n bits here two of those and it&#x27;s there okay using these okay okay so with these things here you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s got quite thin plastic in the middle here so you can literally just snap these off usually a pair of pliers can do it for a pair of cutters you can literally break off individual ones like that ideally let&#x27;s try and break off two together you want to go off one by one but that&#x27;s fine not a problem okay so the next thing is to expose the metal of the Y so I already did mine earlier so I scored around the plastic here and then pulled off the plastic to expose the metal part of the wire and then I&#x27;ve just simply twisted it like that to keep these wires together same on this one here just twisting it doesn&#x27;t matter which direction and then these wires now we&#x27;re ready to go into the ends of these things okay so the wire will go in here and then you will use the screw at the top there to secure this piece of wire inside okay so you will put it on like that okay so in the wire goes into the little hole you want obviously this piece of Y here long enough to make sure it will get screwed inside and a little screen there so I&#x27;ll just show you how that works okay so if we get that in focus when we screw that down you can see the screw starting to go deeper and deeper in so you can start to see how the Y will get wedged in there and held nice and tightly okay so let&#x27;s unscrew that again let&#x27;s put the wire in then we just screw the wire we keep going until we know that the wire is nice and secure in there there we go and hopefully you can see if we look down the other end that wire is nice and tight in there okay and then if I pull it it&#x27;s not coming loose so I know that that piece of metal inside is connected and then what we do the next stage is to I&#x27;m going to need to cut this down a bit more just take the one end of the microphone wire bad phone wire sorry and then connect it into here and then the other end into the other wire let&#x27;s do the other wire first nice and quickly okay so I&#x27;ve just scored around this why come on come into focus please there we go so I just cut around the wire there and now I&#x27;m pulling off the rubber sheath again it&#x27;s not in focus yeah we&#x27;re just pulling in the sheath off there to expose the wires okay okay so once you take the sheath off the headphone wire it varies between different things but you can see there&#x27;s actually four different colors here the gold one is actually the grounding wire so we don&#x27;t really need that one and the blue wire we don&#x27;t need either and the red wire would be the one that would have gone to your right ear and the green one would have been one that went to your left ear so these are the two ones we want to put in okay so we want the one wire in here and then we want the other wire and there it doesn&#x27;t matter which way around because it goes around the coil and comes back either way so it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference so again we want to tighten the one wire in here and then the one in here okay so this is what we end up with so I&#x27;ve cut off the other two eyes and we&#x27;ve got the one red wire attached to one and the green wire the other hand if you pull it shouldn&#x27;t come loose if it does come loose then obviously the signal isn&#x27;t gonna go through the wire and the whole system isn&#x27;t gonna work okay so make sure you tug it to see if it works and I&#x27;ve done it this way to show you whether red and the green wires are but ideally you want these wires insulated so that you don&#x27;t short-circuit so you can wrap tape around there so that they&#x27;re not exposed like it is at the moment okay and the next thing you can do from here attach this to an mp3 player or a mobile phone something that plays music and the signal will come through the wire okay and then go all the way around and back out the other end okay so here&#x27;s our completed product I&#x27;ve actually put some water in there now because I find that water actually helps with the vibration and people seem to find that with water versus a crystal that it has a gentler effect it&#x27;s definitely a good place to start with if you&#x27;re not used to scalar fields I&#x27;ll just quickly say again about the Y here so you can see with this headphone wire it is a single wire and therefore when you cut that single Y there are four wires in it some headphone wires are split into two distinct wire so it&#x27;s easier to put one wire in one and one wire and the other it&#x27;s more obvious what to do there and it can be a bit confusing having one single going one way around in one signal going the other way around and a lot of people question you know how is that possible when you connect it to an mp3 player but it works so try not to get too confused with that okay so what we&#x27;ve got here now there&#x27;s a spare phone I have here I would use a normal mp3 player but ours has recently broken so we&#x27;re just going to connect it into a phone here okay let&#x27;s get back here so we just got a random frequency here on YouTube and it&#x27;s playing now so for those of you who are energy aware you may have noticed a difference there once I plugged in the phone and you might not possibly if you&#x27;re not used to tuning into energies at a distance well that&#x27;s simply it which is using an mp3 player the phones are more common these days to send a signal through the coil and then it goes back round the other way creating an equal and opposite electromagnetic field and that which cancels itself out and that&#x27;s how you get scalar energy or zero-point energy if you want to call it that and you can experiment for different frequencies different Hertz of music to go through the coil so you&#x27;re creating a different vibrations different frequencies in the scalar field again a bit of a complex thing to get your head around but different frequencies do have a different effect so they have it a very basic scalar device so even though it&#x27;s very basic even though the Y wasn&#x27;t perfect and it didn&#x27;t call slightly and even though we have a bit of an exposed Y here is still creating a lovely scalar field here which is negating a negative electromagnetic frequencies within a certain radius so a very simple lovely device for you to stop playing around and getting ideas on how to build bigger ones or ones with a wider radius and of course I can show different videos that on that in the future okay any questions
