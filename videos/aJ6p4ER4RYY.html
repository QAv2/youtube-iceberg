            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hey welcome to Dr Josh ax show I am Dr ax and each and every week on this show we dive deep into the science and principles behind how to grow in Body Mind and Spirit and take both your health and your life to the next level on today&#x27;s episode I will be talking about peptides peptide therapy now peptide therapy is growing incredibly fast in popularity due to people like Robert F Kennedy Jr talking about it Jennifer Aniston Hugh Jackman so many celebrities and professional athletes using it per for performance and one of the things that I want to share with you about peptides today is how it can help you heal issues like hypothyroidism issues like low testosterone in men low estrogen in women um autoimmune disease inflammatory bowel disease and so much more I&#x27;m going to dive in and talk about how peptides could be one of the greatest healing therapies of all time and it&#x27;s something the FDA and the government have been trying to keep from you for years now until finally Physicians uh functional medicine physicians and people like RFK are now coming out and saying no these peptides can have incredible healing benefits and be better than hormone replacement therapy for most people as well we&#x27;ll dive into that and more on today&#x27;s episode and I want to share with you how peptides personally transform my life maybe even save my life I was told by an infectious disease doctor that I might never walk again and I had a injection into my back back that happened it was a natural injection of stem cell and somehow my disc and my bone got infected and also had an abscess and I sat down with a doctor who said Josh listen best case scenario is you&#x27;re going to have chronic pain the rest of your life worst case is this is going to kill you and this infection is really spread he said there&#x27;s a chance you would have to have you know metal in your spine we&#x27;d have to do major surgery and you could be permanently disabled and I had about 48 Hours of feeling like my life was a wreck and then I just spent time in prayer and I felt like God really led me towards and told me just walk with me you&#x27;re going to heal and so I decided to pour thousands of hours into Research into how to heal my body and overcome the spinal infection and all the damage that was done to my Diss and my vertebra and my spine and one of the things I came across was peptides and I had a man this incredible man who who uh was uh I got turned on to who came over to my house and he said Josh I think you really need to try these two peptides bpc157 and tb500 and this was when I was starting my healing journey I was getting in a hyperbaric chamber every day I was doing ozone and IVs and I was just starting to be able to get to the point where I could crawl and get into a pool and I started taking bpc157 and tb500 and it accelerated my healing and I noticed a real difference in my body and healing from this and so I can tell you for myself I&#x27;ve used this for personal injury it helped me heal I&#x27;ve now used it with patients with inflammatory bowel disease it helped them see better results I&#x27;ve used it with patients with hypothyroidism men with low testosterone and the benefits have been absolutely incredible and so I want to share this is something not only that I&#x27;ve recommended to patients I&#x27;ve used peptides personally and saw an incredible breakthrough in my own health and healing that another doctor thought wasn&#x27;t even possible and maybe you&#x27;re in that place in life right now where you&#x27;re saying to yourself I need that sort of breakthrough I need healing that doctors doubt can happen maybe you even doubt that can happen and peptides could be an incredible part of your healing Journey so here&#x27;s what peptides are they are small chains of amino acids between 2 and 50 to be exact which are the building blocks of proteins and they play a crucial role in so many functions in the body including cellular communication now I want to compare the differences between amino acids peptides and proteins and how they typically function in the body amino acids are typically used for metabolic processes protein synthesis neurotransmitter production they&#x27;re basically building blocks in your body and some of the individual amino acids have benefits for different things for instance lysine is used to boost your immune system where El glutamine is amino acid that&#x27;s good for your gut microbiome for actually healing leaky gut whereas you have one like LR Arginine which is good for cardiovascular health and then you have of course some of the other uh then you have peptides these are tend to be the most related to hormones they are for cellular communication signaling and play regulatory roles in the body and so some peptides can include and some of these you&#x27;ve heard of bpc157 tb500 but here are some others you may not realize are peptides glutathione creatine collagen these are all peptides as well and then of course proteins we know these longer structural sources of protein that you&#x27;re going to find in a lot of things like chicken breast and grass-fed beef and eggs and wild cut fish these are structural components so these help build up your tissues in your body that also can act as antibodies they can act as enzymes and and there is overlap between all of these but generally amino acids are single peptides are shorter strands of amino acid where proteins are longer strands of amino acids and as I mentioned earlier with peptides these are growing in popularity due to their significant benefits now I do want to mention probably the most popular peptide today or at least the fastest growing is semaglutide uh which is found in products like OIC and wovi and this semaglutide while it&#x27;s a peptide and it&#x27;s more natural and can have some benefits well actually by the way OIC is synthetic as are a lot of the peptides people are taking today but it does have side effects in the body which we&#x27;ll get into with OIC later as I mentioned there are a lot of different peptides that are very popular that people are using today again bpc157 is probably the single most popular but I&#x27;m going to dive into a lot of the other benefits of peptides today regarding not just weight loss and muscle building but also balancing out your immune system to reverse autoimmune disease uh longevity mitochondrial healing having more beautiful healthy skin and a number of other things we&#x27;re going to get into today when it comes to peptides now here&#x27;s part of what peptides do as I mentioned earlier peptides stimulate the body to produce its own hormones or repair mechanisms naturally and here&#x27;s a an example of what this could look like if proteins are like long detailed instruction manuals peptides are the quick posted notes that give your body direct instructions to heal grow and function optimally for example taking CJC 1295 or epam Morin these stimulate the release of growth hormone whereas thymus and Alpha 1 modulates the immune system helping reverse and heal issues like autoimmune disease whereas bpc157 promotes healing in the muscles tendons and the digestive system think of peptides as keys that unlock specific biological processes in the body just like a key fits into a lock to open a door peptides bind The receptors on cells to trigger responses such as increased collagen production fat burning or enhanced Muscle Recovery so here&#x27;s how peptides work according to the Wisconsin Institute of functional medicine they say this peptides Precision allows for the development of treatments that can mimic or influence your natural biological processes offering a more targeted approach an example of this might be taking bpc-157 which tells your body to regenerate tissues faster while something like CJC 1295 signals the body to produce more growth hormone and so very very targeted precise approach for helping specific conditions and functions within the human body and according to John Hopkins medicine there are more than 100 peptide drugs currently FDA approved in the US to help treat conditions such as diabetes metabolic disorders cancer obesity digestive issues and more and there are an additional 170 peptides in active clinical development according to an article in the journal Nature now the article States peptide drug development entered a new era with the Advent of the 21st century due to the improvements in technology and the Journal of drug Discovery today states that the number of therapeutic peptides being developed is actually closer to 500 and the peptides industry itself is far far greater than 70 billion annually and this is going to grow massively over the next 10 years with the most popular of peptides being glucagon like peptides known as glp1 Agonist and other types used to manage and treat obesity and diabetes and I want to State something as a fact peptides just because they sound more natural and generally they can function more naturally than drugs in the body does not mean they&#x27;re all good and none of them have side effects now I think one of the things we are seeing is many peptides like bpc157 has far less side effects than uh other peptides okay so like like like the glp1 and part of it also has to do with your dosage uh in terms of we see this with glp1 if you were doing a micro dose of about 10% the recommended dose by most Physicians and you were eating following a healthy lifestyle you really are going to have very few uh side effects with those versus when you&#x27;re doing the very high dose that many people are taking we&#x27;re seeing mive massive muscle wasting a connection to thyroid cancer gastroparesis so poor nutrient absorption and stagnation in the body so we&#x27;re seeing all that with that peptide so again I just want to state state here that just because it says it&#x27;s a peptide does not mean it&#x27;s not a drug it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s automatically healthy however again I do think there are numerous benefits of many of the peptides I&#x27;m going to walk you through today and peptides have many benefits and if you have any one of the conditions or goals I&#x27;m about to go through you may want to consider peptide therapy now I do want to mention as a first line of defense even before peptides I tend to recommend healthy diet healthy lifestyle okay those primarily uh as a first line of defense and so if somebody has an issue like low testosterone I don&#x27;t recommend the first thing they do is go and take a peptide and I definitely don&#x27;t recommend they go and take hormone replacement therapy first the first thing I recommend is let&#x27;s look at your lifestyle let&#x27;s get better sleep let&#x27;s consume foods that are going to be a great form of medicine for reducing hot flashes and menopausal symptoms for helping boost testosterone and men who have that issue let&#x27;s do a diet let&#x27;s do herbs let&#x27;s do lifestyle let&#x27;s work out and then if you still need a little bit of an extra boost then let&#x27;s go to peptides next then after that if you still are having issues then try home replacement therapy and then if you&#x27;re still having issues maybe there is a drug that you consider but for the most part I found in almost every single case the body can heal and regenerate with just doing lifestyle diet and exercise followed by something like peptides and that is the best approach for longevity and for complete healing but you have if you have any one of these conditions I&#x27;m about to go through peptide therapy could have a massive benefit for you and number one disc pain low back pain and neck pain if you&#x27;re suffering with any sort of spinal issue peptides can help regenerate the tissues faster and reduce inflammation as I shared earlier for myself peptides I truly believe help save and transform my life helping me regain my health after a major major spinal injury also joint injuries and ligament damage whether it&#x27;s a torn ACL or a meniscus or a shoulder issue some sort of joint ligament or tendon issue it helps accelerate recovery in fact I have a Rec a close friend of mine his daughter tore her meniscus and we had her taking bpc157 tb500 uh and her recovery was much faster because of it and had more complete healing to get back to her sport as a high school athlete also as I mentioned Muscle Recovery and performance gut issues like leaky gut IBS IBD sibo it promotes int testinal healing and reduces inflammation autoimmune disorders it helps regulate immune function reduces flare up skin conditions like wrinkles scars and acne even psoriasis and rosacea metabolic disorders and weight loss so it improve they can improve insulin sensitivity mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic fatigue there are peptides that support energy production and cellular repair thyroid dysfunction in Hashimoto and other forms of of hormone imbalance there are peptides that can help with that neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline and so much more so there are numerous benefits of using peptides and I want to go through eight of the biggest benefits according to an article that was published in the bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry journal and they looked at various peptides and one of the biggest benefits they found was around anti-aging and Longevity specifically peptides like epitalon and thymoline have linked to anti-inflammatory effects extended lifespan and enhanced cellular repair and there are other peptides such as CJC 1295 uh Ms and epam Morin which help with skin elasticity muscle tone and fat metabolism that have major benefits number two healing injuries and tissue repair specifically doing the combination of bpc157 and tb500 can help you heal disc issues low back and neck pain tendon injuries ligament injuries as well so so there are major major benefits of those two peptides for that metabolism and weight management now of course we all know about semaglutide which I think in micro doses may have benefits but the larger doses it&#x27;s far too detrimental to people in damaging their body by causing them to lose up to 50% of the muscle that they&#x27;re losing in terms of their their overall weight loss there are other peptides that may have better better benefits for overall helping stoke your metabolism such as tesamorelin and it&#x27;s been shown in studies to help reduce abdominal and visceral fat around your organs that&#x27;s the fat you actually want to lose because it&#x27;s tied to chronic illness um one of the fourth big benefits of peptides is mitochondrial support and energy production there are two peptides in particular one is called mz- C it enhances mitochondrial function helps combat fatigue and S S31 this protects mitochondria from oxidative stress and improves energy levels and cognitive function and then we have number five performance and athletic recovery peptides this is where CJC 1295 and epam Morin boost your growth hormone production which improves muscle tone and strength and endurance and bpc157 supports joint and muscle recovery post exercise so doing those in combination together can have athletic performance benefits in fact one of the leading doctors I know his name is Dr seeds in Colorado he works with a lot of athletes and in Olympic athletes on using peptides to help them train and recover faster and get better results as well so we&#x27;re going to see these continue to grow in popularity by being used by athletes as well number six is gut health and digestive repair bpc157 is great for leaky gut and IBS where or kpv that stands for Lucine Proline and valine has strong anti-inflammatory effects for gut healing and then skin Rejuvenation there&#x27;s one called ghk cuu that stands for copper peptides this stimulates collagen and elastin production reduces wrinkles and scarring and then epitalon helps with cellular regeneration for younger looking skin so we&#x27;re seeing a lot more of these peptides being used for anti-aging and for beauty and for skin health and then for thyroid and hormone balance thymus in alpha 1 supports immune health and thyroid function I now want to take a closer look and walk you through some of these individual peptides how they work and how they can benefit your body so think about this as a master class on peptides so you know how they can benefit you and others in the future the first one again one of the most popular peptides my favorite peptide that helped me heal and regenerate my tissues is bpc157 this peptide is most known for its regenerative properties it aids in healing muscles tendons and ligaments it promotes recovery from injuries it is a synthetic peptide derived from something called body protective compound which is naturally found in the gastric juices of your stomach and your dadum where it plays a role in protecting and healing the gut lining now if you want to get compounds that are most similar to be pc1 157 via your diet your best bet is consuming stomach and deinum okay so those tissues followed by collagen-rich bone broth and fermented foods such as sauerkraut these have certain compounds that support the gut and help your body produce more bpc uh this body protective compound that helps you regenerate and heal this is also why keeping your gut microbiome healthy is so important but in that amazing bone broth and fermented foods like sauerkraut actually help your body produce more bpc on its own to heal more but overall if you want to get the most powerful dosage you want to do a bp157 injection that&#x27;s how most peptides are taken typically in a syringe similar that you would take insulin which by the way insulin is a peptide peptide hormone and it is injected into your fat tissue and then absorbed that way and redistributed in the body to help your body heal um but that&#x27;s the way most commonly people take these is via injections now you can take bpc157 in a capsule or as a sublingual or a nasal spray as well or other ways that people can get it but by far the highest absorption and the most powerful effect on the body is going to be in an injection into your um subcutaneous fat tissue now a second peptide that I love it&#x27;s thymus and beta 4 All also known as tb500 uh this peptide plays a major role in tissue repair and regeneration and it&#x27;s typically coupled with bp157 typically these two go together at optimizing healing and reducing inflammation it&#x27;s naturally produced in the thymus gland in your own body and it&#x27;s found in almost all human cells where it plays a critical role in immune regulation and tissue regeneration it also acts as a major actin sequestering protein which helps cells move to sites of injury which this is key when you&#x27;re when you injure a tissue or an area of your body one of the things that happens if you if you have poor cellular communication is your body isn&#x27;t getting enough healing factors there to fully heal the sight of injury have you this happens as we age more often too do you ever notice when you hurt yourself as a kid um two days later you were back to 100% or even the next morning you woke up and you were good again and as you&#x27;ve aged you like you injur this area and two weeks later two months later or two years later you still have that injury part of that is due to your body that cellular communication isn&#x27;t what it should be and this is one of the major benefits of peptides in general is they support cell signaling and BP and tb500 is maybe the single best at helping regenerate and heal an area by increasing cell signaling and cell communication to make sure the healing factors get to the area of your body that&#x27;s actually injured so major major benefits there and that&#x27;s why combining that tb500 with the bpc-157 is so powerful for healing is not only do you have all these healing anti-inflammatory factors and the tissue regeneration benefits of the bpc157 but tb500 helps direct it to the right site to make sure that area is healed I&#x27;ve had so many people I&#x27;ve worked with who&#x27;ve had major injuries shoulder pain low back back pain knee pain and they took that combination of bpc157 and tb500 those peptides and saw great results in the body typically the dosage of pairing those together is you&#x27;ll do about 5 milligrams of each per week for about eight weeks is the typical dosage and then you&#x27;ll take some time off and and um and do it so you&#x27;ll have 5 days on 2 days off and that&#x27;s 1 milligram a day if you&#x27;re injured now often times or lower dosages done around 250 to 500 micrograms but if you have an injury and want to heal from it more quickly typically people will do about that 1 milligram five times during a week uh in order to get maximum benefits and go anywhere from 6 weeks up to 12 weeks for maximum healing and repair next up is CJC 1295 this is a growth hormone releasing peptide that stimulates your own growth hormone which supports muscle growth and fat loss now this mimics the natural ghrh produced in the hypothalamus which regulates growth hormone release from the pituary gland and although there is no natural food source of CJC 1295 itself certain amino acids like Arginine and ornithine found in meat Dairy and nuts can support natural growth hormone production but again this is a good one if you are wanting to naturally build and grow muscle and a very simil one next up is tesamorelin tesamorelin is a synthetic growth hormone releasing hormone that stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete growth hormone leading to increased insulinlike growth factor in the body and it&#x27;s primarily used to reduce visceral fat tissue in the body and this is where again I just want to say if you&#x27;re taking a peptide whether it be gp1 or tesam Morin make sure you&#x27;re also following a healthy diet and lifting weights into doing the right things because the reality is this if you exercise while you&#x27;re using something like this you&#x27;re doing weight training you&#x27;re going to be actually building muscle long term and you&#x27;re going to have greater benefits than if you&#x27;re just taking a peptide and you&#x27;re not doing the other supportive things with it this is why even for myself when I was taking bpc-157 and tb500 I&#x27;m eating sauerkraut I&#x27;m drinking bone broth I&#x27;m taking collagen protein in a protein that has stem cells in it I&#x27;m doing these things regularly to get the maximum benefits and I want you to think about doing that very same thing when you&#x27;re using peptides and another peptide that&#x27;s often paired with tesamorelin is epom marelin and it is a growth hormone known as a secretagogue which basically means it helps your body secret more growth hormone which then AIDS in Muscle Recovery and repair now here&#x27;s a peptide not a lot of people are familiar with and it&#x27;s melanin 2 and it&#x27;s originally developed to promote tanning okay so after melanin or melatonin in a similar way as well it&#x27;s been explored for its potential effects on sexual function and appetite suppression and it mimics Alpha melany stimulating hormone which is produced in pituitary gland and plays a role in skin pigmentation and sexual arousal um while there are no foods that contain this melanin producing um peptide carrots and sweet potatoes have the closest thing in in enhancing melanin production if you want to couple it with something there so this isn&#x27;t really a peptide I I I typically usually ever recommend to people but it is a peptide that is available and then another growth hormon producing peptide is C Morin very similar to epam Morin and tesamorelin now you can increase this in your own body by getting adequate sunshine and vitamin taking vitamin D and magnesium so sunshine or vitamin D and then getting enough magnesium helps produce this in your own body and that&#x27;s one of the great things to know about this is that you can get the be benefits of peptides by simply changing your diet and your lifestyle however most people want additional benefits to those things which is why they&#x27;re going to use peptides as well via injection nasal spray or orally the next peptide is pt41 this is known for its potential to enhance sexual function and it targets the hypothalamus to activate sexual arousal Pathways without affecting the vascular system and you can in addition to taking this do things that will support and improv blood flow so it&#x27; be good to combine with something like beetroot juice and ginsing to support sexual function uh along with with this peptide now I want to head on another favorite peptide of mine and that&#x27;s thymus and Alpha 1 this peptide modulates the immune system and canceling immune response and offering potential benefits for immune related conditions like autoimmune disease or a a a weakened immune system if you have immune deficiency it&#x27;s naturally produced in the thymus gland and plays a role in te- cell development and immune regulation while it&#x27;s not found in food zinc vitamin C and selenium rich foods are good to take with this to help activate and balance your immune system along with eating foods like drinking bone broth doing more vegetable more wild cut meat and more medicinal mushrooms like myi mushroom they&#x27;re going to Aid and support the immune system this next peptide is the fastest growing and most popular P peptide today it&#x27;s glp1 Agonist it&#x27;s a semi glutide drug uh that you&#x27;d find in OIC and wovi and these peptides mimic the action of the natural hormone glucagon like peptide known as glp1 which is produced in the small intestine and plays a key role in appetite control and blood sugar regulation now there are certain foods that stimulate glp1 such as high protein foods high fiber foods especially vegetables fermented foods as well or high probiotic rich foods these these stimulate glp1 additionally omega-3 fatty acids in vinegar also help now I want to say this glp1 of all the peptides has the most negative studies and the most evidence proving it is not good to take long term so I glp1 is a hormone I typically don&#x27;t recommend unless in maybe a few small instances you&#x27;re doing a micro do and with it you&#x27;re also changing your diet you&#x27;re eating more protein and more fiber and more probiotic rich foods and more Omega-3s and more F again and vinegar that&#x27;s going to be very similar in that fermented food category but do those four things eat more protein eat more fiber like vegetables and berries eat more fermented foods get more Omega-3s do that your body will stimulate more glp1 that way and it&#x27;s more effective and much more beneficial for your long-term Health than taking a semi glutide drug long term in addition weightlifting and exercise okay if you exercised and did those four foods and that was the primary part of your diet I just talked about that&#x27;s great and then listen I I don&#x27;t have a problem with if you&#x27;re working with a functional medicine practitioner and they for a few months have you on a micro dose of glp1 along with all of these other things healthy lifestyle you maybe there&#x27;s a time and place for that but for most people you you just don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t even need the semaglutide you just need to change your lifestyle because here&#x27;s the reality the side effects are too severe for aging you think about this when you take semaglutide like OIC the the the the the weight that you lose according to one study 50% of your weight you&#x27;re losing is muscle and so if you lost you know 10 to 20 pounds let&#x27;s say I think I think in the study they referenced 20 pounds you&#x27;re aging yourself 20 years when you take a drug like OIC or wovi think about that do do you want to do that do you want to age yourself in your muscle 20 years your muscle is a longevity organ it&#x27;s critical for your your metabolism it&#x27;s critical for you not being frail and weak when you get older think about how hard it is to put on muscle mass how many of you guys work out and you know how hard it is to put on lean muscle mass and the fact that you could take a drug that&#x27;s going to cause you to lose likely double the amount of muscle mass you should be losing I mean I mean these are big big reasons that you should not take and would not want to take a semi glutide drug a gp1 Agonist like an OIC or a GOI you&#x27;re much better off doing those four things I just mentioned which actually boost your body&#x27;s own release of glp1 eat a high protein diet high fiber diet diet high in probiotics and a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids if you do those things and combine that with exercise you&#x27;ll burn fat you&#x27;ll lose weight you&#x27;ll optimize glp1 naturally in your body are you tired of doctors dismissing your symptoms or Worse even making you feel crazy even if your blood work comes back normal it doesn&#x27;t mean your health is where it should be think of blood like a delivery truck carrying nutrients and hormones but the real payoff happens when your cells open the package and use what&#x27;s inside if your cells are stuck in what&#x27;s called cell danger response triggered by stress toxins or infections they go into protective mode in this state cells close off and don&#x27;t properly take in or utilize the hormones or nutrients they need from the bloodstream now this makes the blood work often appear normal Al so doctors often miss the deeper issue leaving you feeling tired gaining weight experiencing mood swings and dealing with other symptoms while other cells remain in a state of limbo visit Beyond bloodwork tocom to learn how you can start changing this in as little as 30 days the next peptide I want to cover is one of my favorites as well it&#x27;s known as mz- C it stands for mitochondrial derived peptide and maty is a mitochondri boosting peptide that plays a key role in cellular metabolism energy regulation and even insulin sensitivity now what&#x27;s so unique about m c is that it activates something in your body called amk This is the master regulator of your metabolism and promotes fat oxidation and muscle endurance in fact in studies on longevity and increasing your lifespan and your healthspan to where you&#x27;re still active in your 80s and 90s one of the key Pathways was activating amk for lengthening your life and adding quality of years to your life and maty helps do that m c supports also weight management exercise performance and as I mentioned reduces oxidative stress so you age more slowly and although m is naturally produced in the body its activity can be supported through other things that we could talk about actually fasting tends to be very good for from M SE exercise is very good and then polyphenol rich foods especially green tea extra virgin olive oil and berries so this is a really incredible longevity and mitochondrial supporting peptide that is one of my favorite peptides that I recommend on a regular basis now here&#x27;s another peptide that you&#x27;re going to recognize if you&#x27;ve heard and you&#x27;ve been in the Natural Health industry a pretty long time it&#x27;s known as igf1 that stands for insulin growth factor an igf-1 is a hormone naturally produced in the liver in response to growth hormone stimulation and is crucial for muscle growth cell repair and brain health and it plays a role in mediating many anabolic processes so that means muscle building and growth in the body and igf-1 levels naturally decline with age leading to reduced muscle mass and slow tissue repair there are certain foods that have this peptide in it such as grass-fed Dairy is the highest followed by lean meats like grass-fed steak whey protein as well is a natural boosting source of igf-1 production but again of course this is also found in a peptide as an injection and oral uh or nasal spray as well and then here&#x27;s another popular uh peptide that has a lot of benefits for skin and for tissue regeneration sometimes this peptide is paired with bpc1 57 and TV tb500 it&#x27;s known as GH KCU it&#x27;s known as the copper peptides and it&#x27;s a naturally occurring peptide that binds to Copper ions which supports wound healing skin regeneration and anti-aging and it&#x27;s found in human plasma so in your blood in your saliva and in your urine but decreases as we age and it also enhances collagen production improves skin elasticity and has antioxidant properties that protect against free radical damage and though it&#x27;s not present in food maintaining healthy copper levels through foods like nuts and seeds and organ meats can support your body&#x27;s skin repairing benefits due to the Copper concentrations the next peptide I want to cover is ss31 now this is a great one to pair with m c when it comes to longevity and mitochondrial Health it&#x27;s also known as a Lumi preti it&#x27;s a synthetic peptide that targets your MIT Andria where it binds to cardiol lipin which stabilizes your mitochondrial membranes and improves your cellular energy production so this is a peptide that could be really beneficial for people with chronic fatigue syndrome lme disease or people wanting to promote longevity it also reduces oxidative stress on the mitochondria and prevents neurodegenerative diseases like heart failure and dementia though it&#x27;s synthetic it supports the natural function of your mitochondri RA in your body and a diet high in antioxidants like berries matcha green tea and dark green leafy vegetables can also help support your body along with taking ss31 and then I want to hit on a few just quickly here other peptides that you probably are aware of or maybe we&#x27;re not aware of peptides one of course you&#x27;re aware of it&#x27;s collagen peptides right so collagen peptides are found primarily in bone broth and Collen peptides are short chains of amino acids derived from collagen which is the most abundant protein in the human body it makes up the majority of your skin hair nails joints connective tissue and gut lining and these peptides are broken down forms of collagen making them easier for the body to absorb and use to repair your body and collagen as I mentioned is naturally found primarily in bone broth as well as in things like chicken skin or fish skin in your diet and of course you can supplement with collagen peptides as many people do today typically you want to do about 10 to 50 grams a day to support your joints and skin and gut health of collagen peptides and a few others I&#x27;ll mention here glutathione your body&#x27;s Master antioxidant is known as a tripeptide and so glutathione is important for liver detoxification so for your body to detox to heal people would get glut glutathione IVs or take something called NAC n acetylcysteine Orly which is the greatest precursor to glutathione and supporting the body that way and then creatine for building muscle supporting brain health that&#x27;s also a peptide and so many people today take creatine and and that&#x27;s a good peptide to pair with some of the other growth hormone peptides or bpc-157 and tb500 if you&#x27;re looking to regenerate and heal your tissue as part of whether you&#x27;re doing physical therapy or your daily workouts these are really powerful to take together you know as peptides are growing in popularity we are seeing so many more athletes biohackers celebrity and wellness experts who have shared their personal stories on how peptides have positively impacted themselves you know one a few of these people one is Sylvester Stallone he&#x27;s known of course for his roles as Rocky and Rambo and so many other roles he&#x27;s played over the years and he&#x27;s used some of the various peptides that support human growth hormone over the years he just recently stated Hugh Jackman to prepare for his role as Wolverine he used peptide therapy to Aid in Muscle Recovery and looking more lean and muscular and of course there&#x27;s a peptide that&#x27;s actually called The Wolverine peptide it&#x27;s known as bpc157 that healing and tissue repair uh and this is one that Hugh Jackman took in getting ready for his role as wolver Vine which if you saw him he is very very fit and jacked uh and peptides along with his and listen I want to say too Hugh Jackman didn&#x27;t just take peptides he worked out for hours a day he ate very clean and so remember if you&#x27;re going to get the maximum benefits of peptides eat a healthy diet and have a healthy lifestyle now here&#x27;s someone else who&#x27;s using peptides and she recently stated this Jennifer Aniston um she has revealed that she relies both on collagen peptides as well as peptide injections into her skin but also is using peptides like arelene tripeptide 1 and tetrapeptide 21 for keeping her looking younger and then Joe Rogan he&#x27;s a podcaster comedian that we all know of he uses bpc157 to Aid in healing injuries he said he had a recent injury and was astounded at how fast it helped him heal here&#x27;s someone else Robert F Kennedy Jr that&#x27;s right RFK has spoken about the potential of peptides for regenerative medicine and how they support Nur olical recovery and anti-aging now he has not come out publicly and said he uses him personally however I&#x27;ve had other people say they know he does uh he has said he wants to make them uh easier to get for people and remove some of the barriers that the FDA is creating in fact it&#x27;s in a recent social media post Kennedy accused the FDA of suppressing the use of psychedelics peptides stem cells raw milk and hyperbaric chamber therapies and so he came out and said he wants to remove the red tape related to these incredible healing therapies now I want to take a minute and compare peptides to HRT that&#x27;s hormone replacement therapy now hormone replacement therapy involves the direct supplementation of hormones such as testosterone estrogen progesterone or thyroid hormones that we know all decline as we age what HRT does is it directs replaces these hormones in the body so your body no longer produces sufficient quantities on its own and this is commonly used for menopause andropause or conditions like hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency but what happens as I mentioned with hormone replacement therapy it causes something in the body called a reverse feedback loop so here&#x27;s what happens your body is pre creating a certain level of estrogen or testosterone well when you start taking it exogenously so from the outside in your body says oh okay I&#x27;m getting it already so the reverse feedback loop is now it stops producing it on its own that&#x27;s what happens with hormone replacement therapy and in Chinese medicine this is known to be incredibly unhealthy because what it does it&#x27;s like taking a tap that&#x27;s in your own body you have your own water being created in your body you&#x27;re turning it off now you only rely on an outside Source well there are other things that happen in the body when you shut off your inside source and it&#x27;s known in Chinese medicine to cause stagnation which increases the risk of cancer according to Chinese medicine in certain individuals when it&#x27;s done for longer periods of time and so this is why I&#x27;m not a fan of hormone replacement therapy as the first thing you do now listen if you are an absolute wreck and you have major major health issues because of your hormone imbalance I think there&#x27;s a time in a place for hormone hormone replacement therapy okay I do think there&#x27;s a time and place for it but I think it&#x27;s all should be done the shortest dose possible and you should be doing all the other things with it so if somebody has a hormone imbalance like low testosterone for instance or or low estrogen the first thing they should do is start using food as medicine you know for women let&#x27;s do more organic soy and more flax and more black cohash and and these things that help naturally stimulate your body&#x27;s own estrogen production let&#x27;s get better quality sleep let&#x27;s start doing things that help build Yin in the body and and and and and a calmness let&#x27;s then try peptides after that that are going to support estrogen production that&#x27;s what somebody should focus on doing first or a very similar thing with testosterone men go and eat more red meat and organ Meats get more healthy fats like almond butter go and get walnuts right get get more of these Foods take panic jining in fena Greek and then take peptides like epor Tessa Morin and bpc157 and then go lift some weights do that and then if you exhaust those things and you&#x27;re still very very off hormonally then go and do hormone replacement therapy but not before you exhaust and do everything else you know you should be doing and so this is what and and and there are plenty of plants that I mentioned soy flax as an example um and and black kohos and many other herbs that are going to support progesterone that are going to support estrogen that can support thyroid hormone you really want to start there as much as you possibly can and the reason why peptides are better for long-term use is that they don&#x27;t have the reverse feedback loop for example peptides support the body&#x27;s natural hormone production peptides like CJC 1295 for example stimulate the pituitary gland to release to release more growth hormone which allows the body to adjust production based on natural feedback loops unlike hormone replacement therapy peptides do not suppress the body&#x27;s ability to produce its own hormones and the other great thing about peptides is they have F fewer side effects unless we&#x27;re talking about high doses of semi glutide you know hormone replacement therapy can cause side effects such as water retention mood swings acne or increased risk of hormone related cancers such as breast and prostate according to multiple studies and peptides when used appropriately are often better tolerated and have fewer side effects because they enhance natural processes rather than overriding them and peptides are targeted and specific peptides act on specific Pathways while hormone replacement therapy affects the entire hormonal system and may cause imbalances in other areas so again morala story is this try lifestyle and diet first and then peptide second and then third would be something like a hormone replacement therapy now I wanted to mention again you can find peptides in food in fact organ meats are your greatest source of peptides okay so you find it in bone broth we find it in the thymus gland if you have thymus you find it in liver kidneys heart adrenals throughout your entire uh body you have these peptides so in Chinese medicine and well throughout history people ate organ meats and if they had an issue with their heart they ate heart if they had an issue with pore detoxification they ate liver right and so organ meats are your greatest source of peer Tides out there today along with things like bone broth which of course is basically pulling it from the ligaments and tendons just getting it in that that liquid form but that is your greatest source of food-based peptides is organ meats and bone broth now there are plants that also support peptide production such as flax seeds beans and soybeans specifically they have phytoestrogens which can be great for the body um nuts and seeds also can and so can protein rich foods another great source of peptides is colostrum colostrum in raw dairy is loaded with peptides that support growth and tissue regeneration so if you want to get peptides via dietary sources organ Meats bone broth raw dairy products you know certain seeds and beans and and and many other Foods as well a lot of herbals also have a lot of these peptides that boost peptides in the body however for many of you what you&#x27;re going to want to do is you&#x27;re going to want to follow really healthy diet use food as medicine for supporting these peptides within your own body but in addition consider taking either these oral or injectable peptides as well to help take your health to the highest level possible you know one question I commonly get from people is well where do I get peptides well what I would recommend is you find a good practitioner a functional or Integrative Medical practitioner that can help recommend the right peptides for you and the right dosages by the way when you&#x27;re working with somebody with peptid es that same person if you know they&#x27;re really good they&#x27;re typically also going to recommend that you change your diet okay or or or other dietary or supplement protocols to help you optimize your health now I&#x27;m not saying that you have to do that but again if you truly want to be healthy you should be changing your diet and optimizing exercise and lifestyle along with taking peptides as well and if you want to look for good suppliers it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard you know there are a lot of people out there there selling peptides today I know that there are a lot of Brands out there one that I&#x27;ve used in trust is peptide Sciences but there are a lot out there but you want to make sure typically finding a good physician near you that uses peptides is the route you want to take now I want to go through some Miss and truths about peptides number one peptides are illegal that&#x27;s not true many peptides more than 200 are either available legally as research compounds and are in clinical trials but they are not FDA approved for medical treatment or read available in stores and the way this works today is just because the FDA is not approved them as medicine doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not legal for you to use themselves and in fact here&#x27;s how I would put peptides right now many of them are like raw milk you can take you know they&#x27;re marked for animal purposes or for research purposes now we&#x27;re all drinking raw milk right or maybe not all of you I&#x27;m drinking raw milk okay a lot of you that listen to the show you&#x27;re drinking raw milk but it&#x27;s not FDA approved and it&#x27;s different state by state but again there are many clinical trials proving their safety proving their e efficacy and their just Monumental benefits and so again peptides are legal they&#x27;re just not approved by the FDA for medical treatment currently here&#x27;s another myth peptides are steroids no peptides are different than steroids in artificial hormones peptides work by enhancing your natural biological processes not artificially increasing hormones like anabolic steroids steroids are a class of lipophilic organic compounds and their mechanisms and effects are very very different here&#x27;s another one peptide therapy is a new and untested treatment here&#x27;s the truth peptides have been utilized in medical treatments for over a century a 100 years for instance insulin a peptide hormone was first used for the treatment of diabetes back in 1921 and I mentioned glutathione creatine collagen there are many peptides that have been used that have numerous benefits that been used for over 100 years here&#x27;s another myth peptide therapy is only for anti-aging purposes here&#x27;s the truth while peptides can Aid reducing signs of aging they also play roles in metabolism tissue repair reversing medical conditions like autoimmune disease supporting thyroid W Health boosting immune function loads of benefits and people of various ages and health conditions can benefit from peptides many peptides are safe but still I do want to say there are some negative consequences for some people and so you really want to listen to your body and how you&#x27;re reacting to these under the help of a guided Medical Professional you know some people have noticed feeling nauseous diarrhea temporary redness increased hunger allergic reaction hormonal issues so again make sure to really listen to your body this is a form of medicine okay and so you do want to be cautious and wise when you&#x27;re using them and work with a practitioner and I think generally when it comes to safety the peptides that are the safest like the bpc157 the tb500 the kpv these peptides are typically used for tissue repair and healing I think that the safety of those or how people react tends to be even better than some of the peptides that influence hormones more directly uh but overall again if you&#x27;re working with a great practitioner they&#x27;re going to know exactly what to do with you the right dosage and and and and and basically monitor how you&#x27;re doing with these so as I&#x27;ve said you know peptides are sort of you know they&#x27;re not supplements but they&#x27;re not necessarily medicine per se they&#x27;re kind of live somewhere in between and how they impact your body and again I think first and foremost diet exercise lifestyle first and then if you want an extra boost then you can do some peptides with that and work with a trained physician on them and as I said peptides have helped me tremendously heal from an issue that a doctor thought I would never heal from and so they do have tremendous benefits and I&#x27;ve used them with so many patients and people I&#x27;ve worked with over the years and saw amazing incredible benefits so many times when people were kind of at wits end or saw a roadblock and what they wanted uh what they wanted heal and so I hope you&#x27;ve enjoyed this episode on the power of peptides I want to say thanks so much for tuning in here to the Dr Josh a show where each and every week
