            <p>What if we already had the technology to end world hunger, but it was buried? Imagine a machine that could produce unlimited food from almost nothing. It sounds crazy, but patents for atmospheric water generators, soilless crop growth, and lab grown nutrition have been locked away. We spend billions on food aid every year. But what if hunger was already solved decades ago? Would they tell us or would they keep it from us to maintain control? Sh. No one&#x27;s listening.</p>
