            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In 2023, a former US intelligence officer testified under oath before Congress. His name was David Grush, and his allegations hit a nerve because they weren&#x27;t just another light in the sky story. They were framed as a government oversight problem, a secrecy problem, a question of whether certain UAP programs exist outside normal reporting channels. But if you strip away the headlines and the social media heat, one question becomes the center of this case. What parts of David Grusch&#x27;s story are confirmed and what parts remain unproven? This is case file 002.</p>
<p>To understand why Grouch matters, you first have to understand what he is and what he isn&#x27;t. He is not a random witness. He&#x27;s a former intelligence official who says his job put him close to the UAP topic inside government. In public statements and testimony, he described his background as years of military and intelligence work, including serving at a high civilian level and working in roles connected to UAP review. That&#x27;s the foundation.</p>
<p>Now, the claim Grouch alleged that during his official duties, he was informed about a long-running UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering effort. He described speaking to numerous individuals who claimed direct knowledge of those programs. In the most dramatic version of the story, the allegation becomes recovered craft, possibly non-human, possibly kept from Congress. That&#x27;s the part most people remember, but it&#x27;s not the part that can be confirmed from the outside. So, we&#x27;re going to build this case the correct way.</p>
<p>Three layers. One, what is confirmed by records and government action? Two, what is confirmed only as testimony? Three, what is still an allegation with no public evidence? Let&#x27;s start with what is confirmed. Confirmed. Point number one, Grouch did testify under oath in a public congressional hearing in July of 2023. That is real.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s in the official record and it matters because under oath is not the same as proven, but it raises the stakes. In that hearing, Grush repeated the core structure of his claims. He alleged he had been informed of a multi-deade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program. He also indicated that he could provide details in a classified setting. Two other witnesses testified as well, former Navy pilot Ryan Graves and retired commander David Fraver.</p>
<p>Their testimony focused more on UAP encounters and flight safety, not crash retrieval programs. So, the hearing wasn&#x27;t just one man telling a story. It was a broader UAP transparency moment. But again, hearing confirmed claims inside the hearing, still claims. Confirmed.</p>
<p>Point number two, UAP investigative offices and programs exist. This is not speculation. The Department of Defense has created official structures to investigate unidentified anomalous phenomena. The UAP task force existed. Then Arrow, the all domain anomaly resolution office was created to centralize investigation and reporting.</p>
<p>Whether people believe in aliens or not, the government has acknowledged the UAP problem as something that gets tracked, reviewed, and briefed. That&#x27;s confirmed, but it does not confirm extraterrestrials. It confirms that unidentified incidents have been taken seriously enough to build formal process around them. Confirmed. Point number three, the US government&#x27;s public stance is that it has not verified Gush&#x27;s core allegations.</p>
<p>This is critical because when a whistleblower story goes viral, some people assume silence means confirmation. In this case, there has not been silence. A Pentagon spokesperson has publicly stated that Arrow has not found verifiable information substantiating claims that programs exist for possession or reverse engineering of extraterrestrial materials. And in 2024, Arrow released a historical report that again emphasized it found no empirical evidence for claims that the US government or private companies have been reverse engineering extraterrestrial technology. That&#x27;s the official position.</p>
<p>So, at the public level, we have two realities operating at the same time. A former intelligence official testifies and alleges hidden programs. The Pentagon&#x27;s UAP office says it has not found verifiable evidence of those programs. That&#x27;s the tension inside this case file. Now we move into the most misunderstood part of the Grouch story.</p>
<p>The phrase credible and urgent. This phrase is often repeated online as if it means aliens confirmed. That is not what it means. Here is the more accurate way to understand it. Grouch through legal counsel filed a whistleblower complaint and reprisal related filings.</p>
<p>Reporting around his case stated that the intelligence community inspector general deemed elements of his complaint credible and urgent. In federal oversight language, that does not automatically validate the most dramatic claims. Instead, it typically means the complaint met a threshold that required attention and appropriate routing. In plain English, it means the system didn&#x27;t throw it in the trash. It means it rose to a level where Congress or oversight bodies needed to be informed.</p>
<p>It means something worth examining was raised, but it does not equal public proof and it does not guarantee the underlying allegation is true. This is the first big trap in UAP discourse. People confused the process took it seriously with the claim was proven. Those are not the same thing. Now we move to the second trap, the word whistleblower.</p>
<p>When people hear that word, they assume it means the person witnessed the event directly. In many cases, whistleblowers reveal wrongdoing based on access to systems, documents, and conversations, not because they personally touched the evidence. In Grushia&#x27;s case, his public statements strongly suggest he is describing what he was told and what he says he learned through official channels, interviews, and investigation. That can still be extremely important, but it&#x27;s different than I personally handled a recovered craft. That difference matters because it changes what you can confirm.</p>
<p>If a claim is secondhand, the evidence must come from documentation, materials, or other witnesses who can be verified. So, the correct question becomes, did Grouch provide names, places, programs, and documents to investigators in a classified setting. He has said he provided details through appropriate channels. Members of Congress have suggested they want further access and briefings, but the public does not have the classified evidence. So, from the public vantage point, we cannot verify what was provided behind closed doors.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not a debunk. That&#x27;s just reality. Now, let&#x27;s talk about the three claims proven true idea. The version that performs well as a video. Here is the honest ACM files version.</p>
<p>What can be argued as proven with strong caution is not nonhuman craft. It&#x27;s the framework around the story. Claim one that holds up. The government has formal UAP infrastructure. Confirmed.</p>
<p>Multiple offices and processes exist. The topic is not purely fringe inside government anymore. Claim two that holds up. Congress treated the issue seriously enough to hold hearings and demand more information. Confirmed.</p>
<p>The hearing happened. The testimony is in the public record and lawmakers have continued pushing oversight language and briefings. Claim three that holds up. Grush&#x27;s complaint and allegations became an official oversight matter, not just internet folklore. Confirmed in the practical sense that attorneys were involved, filings were made, and the case entered official lanes.</p>
<p>But that is still not proof of the extraordinary claim. So what is not proven? The central allegation that the United States possesses recovered non-human craft and has a crash retrieval and reverse engineering program hidden from oversight that remains unverified publicly. No physical evidence has been released to the public. No independently authenticated materials have been presented. No documentation has been made public that definitively confirms a nonhuman craft recovery program.</p>
<p>Now, some people will hear that and feel disappointed. But here&#x27;s why this still matters. Because the verified parts of this case show something real is happening. Whether it&#x27;s misidentification, classified tech, bureaucratic dysfunction, or something more unusual, there is enough smoke for the government to build offices, hold hearings, and spend time on it. The file exists because the process exists.</p>
<p>And the most powerful detail in the Grouch story may not be the alien angle. It may be the oversight angle. If programs exist in the blackest corners of classification, even if they are not extraterrestrial, the question becomes who knows, who is accountable, who is in the chain of oversight. That&#x27;s why this case continues to attract serious attention. It&#x27;s not just do you believe, it&#x27;s can the public system track what is being done in its name.</p>
<p>So here&#x27;s the current status of case file 002. Confirmed. Grouch testified publicly under oath in July 2023. UAP investigative offices exist. The Pentagon and Arrow have publicly stated they have not found verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial reverse engineering programs.</p>
<p>Reported elements of his complaint were treated as serious enough to move through oversight channels unverified publicly recovered non-human craft. A confirmed crash retrieval and reverse engineering program. Physical materials verified by independent analysis. So where does that leave us? It leaves us with a file that is active, not closed. A case defined by one man&#x27;s sworn testimony and a government office saying it has not verified the extraordinary claims.</p>
<p>In the ACM files, we don&#x27;t close cases just because the internet picked aside. We follow what can be documented. And right now, what can be documented is this. The investigation is real. The claims are extraordinary.</p>
<p>And the evidence for the most dramatic parts remains out of public view. Case file 002. The investigation continues. Settings. Add clean subtitles with no outline.</p>
