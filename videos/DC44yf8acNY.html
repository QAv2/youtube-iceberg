            <p>does anyone know of people like miio Kaku that can explain String Theory like he does for people like me and I&#x27;m not a genius well I am mokaku and I&#x27;d be glad to answer that question first of all most textbooks say that an electron is a DOT particles that we see in our atom measures are dots but if I had a super microscope I can see that that dot is actually a rubber B band from a distance this rubber band looks like a DOT close up you see that it&#x27;s a vibrating string now this rubber band can vibrate in many different modes each mode can be called a particle so for example this might be an electron but if you twirl it in a different way it becomes a quark and if you twirl it this way you have to give it a different name we call it a neutrino</p>
