            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>This story has been moving fast in the last 24 hours. We had a presidential announcement, statements from Senator Christian Gillibrand, Congresswoman Anna Palina Luna, and Luis Alzando, all landing on the same day, and Ross Coltart to walk through what this actually legally means and its practicality. There&#x27;s a lot to go through, so let&#x27;s get straight into it. As always, I&#x27;m here to report all the information and you can decide what to believe. You can find the extended sources in my detailed articles at ufonnews.co along with the main sources in the description box below.</p>
<p>Hey you followers, I&#x27;m Christina Gomez and welcome to this episode of UFO News Updates. You already know what Trump posted on Thursday night. He directed Secretary of War Pete Hegsath to begin identifying and releasing government files on UAP alien and ET life and UFOs. Here&#x27;s the part worth slowing down on. He did not sign an executive order.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t use the word declassify. And what was announced is a review of records. Legally, those are very different things. And that distinction matters for what actually gets released and when. So without a signed executive order that specifically mandates declassification, federal agencies, including the Pentagon, have no binding legal obligation to open anything.</p>
<p>You couldn&#x27;t even file a Freedom of Information Act request today and cite Trump&#x27;s post as grounds for release. That said, Trump acknowledged that Obama allegedly breached protocol by speaking about aliens publicly. If there is nothing classified on this subject, that statement really doesn&#x27;t make any sense, and the contradiction is really just sitting in plain sight. On February 20th, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand released a formal statement responding to Trump&#x27;s announcement. She&#x27;s been an active member in Congress on the UAP legislation and was a very important and key architect of Arrow, the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, which was established through the National Defense Authorization Act to investigate UAP reports across military and intelligence domains, and it was created in 2022.</p>
<p>Her statement called this good news and said she is encouraged to see the president support the effort. She also noted there is more to be done and urged the administration to follow through. She specifically highlighted the need to reduce stigma about UAP reporting which has been a documenting problem. military pilots and personnel have historically faced professional consequences for reporting sightings, which means the data collected has never really been fully complete. One thing worth noting here is that Arrow, the office that Jillibrand helped establish, is currently more than 2 years overdue on reports that was mandated to deliver to Congress.</p>
<p>Then you have Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna. She went on Fox News and addressed something that hasn&#x27;t changed regardless of what the president posts. Take a listen. &gt;&gt; And I think the whole aspect that the federal government can deny access to members of Congress, of which has happened, not just to myself, but to other members of Congress as well is not just alarming uh but it&#x27;s also something that cannot truly exist in a free and fair society. Government should not operate in secrecy.</p>
<p>And so I look forward to the American people being able to determine their own conclusion after they&#x27;ve seen some of the evidence that we have seen. But most recently, Representative Gates actually came forward. He was on that initial Kodell with me and Representative Tim Burchett where we we were denied access. And uh he will tell you that if you&#x27;ve seen some of the stuff that we&#x27;ve seen, you will too become a believer. Luna, Matt Gates, and Tim Bashett were all denied access during a congressional delegation visit.</p>
<p>Brashette has spoken about this publicly multiple times. Luna also noted at the end of her Fox News appearance that Gates, who was on the same trip, had said that if you saw what they saw, you would become a believer. The question is, what did they really see? And there&#x27;s still so much more to the story. And the next part gets into what Alzando had mentioned and how this release could be more difficult than anything the government has attempted before. So stay with me.</p>
<p>Luis Alzando from the Pentagon&#x27;s ATIP program sat down with NewsNation and he was asked directly why this didn&#x27;t happen during Trump&#x27;s first term and why anyone should believe what is happening now. &gt;&gt; We have known as a nation for for over 80 de 80 years eight decades that there are things flying in our controlled US airspace frankly that um we don&#x27;t know what they are. Now let me caveat this for a moment. Everything technically is a UAP or a UFO until it becomes identified, right? We call these TNO, temporary nonattributable objects. Just like we saw with the Chinese spy balloon we see with drone incursions uh quite routinely.</p>
<p>Until you can identify what something is, it is of course always going to be unidentified. The problem is is that we&#x27;ve also been dealing with some fairly sophisticated advanced technologies that does not appear superficially anyways to be our own technology and and probably not foreign adversarial technology. So then the real question uh has to be asked okay if it&#x27;s not ours and it&#x27;s not theirs then then whose is it and what are we doing about it? And I think that&#x27;s a much more difficult conversation uh to have. And certainly if if the president is serious about this, which by the way I applaud for any president to take charge of this this this topic. Um now the real hard work begins.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He said what has been announced is a declaration of intent not a result. And the the real work in his words hasn&#x27;t even started yet. He also said there are individuals currently inside the administration who are genuinely motivated to get to the bottom of this based on private conversations that he&#x27;s had. But he made it clear that seeing action means watching for specific things. A signed executive order with clear legal requirements is essential.</p>
<p>and a national intelligence estimate sponsored by the director of national intelligence sections with a new nation intelligence strategy that addresses UAP by name would also be ideal. Those are the markers that Alzando said would signal that something real is happening behind the announcement. And this is also the same guy that sent a memo to Trump many months ago about appointing a UFO ZAR. We do know that the director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard does have an interest in UFOs along with vice president JD Vance. Both of these people mentioned this on the Pod Force One podcast when they were asked about UFOs.</p>
<p>Here is the gap in the current framework that doesn&#x27;t get enough attention. Trump&#x27;s review applies to government files, but according to Ross Colthart and multiple sources, a significant portion of evidence and recovered material is held not by government agencies, but by private aerospace contractors. One person that has mentioned this a lot is David Grush. A lot of the evidence that&#x27;s coming is from whistleblowers inside private aerospace, inside private companies. And the big corporations, Lockheed, Northre, Grumman, Boeing, Rathon, these companies that I know have got access to non-human technology.</p>
<p>They have knowledge about UFOs. They have technical information about these craft, if they can be described as craft. They&#x27;re not compelled under any expression of intention by President Trump at the moment to release any information. &gt;&gt; A presidential directive aimed at federal agencies does not automatically reach private companies operating under separate legal agreements. That is the structural gap that any serious disclosure framework would need to address.</p>
<p>And if it&#x27;s not addressed in what has been announced so far, well, that&#x27;s a problem and it hasn&#x27;t been addressed so far. Ross also laid out that his sources inside the legacy program have told him about why full disclosure hasn&#x27;t happened regardless of who&#x27;s in power. And it goes beyond military secrecy. &gt;&gt; I mean, we&#x27;re talking here about claims that have been made repeatedly by people from within the legacy program that the United States has cracked quantum free energy, zero point energy, energy from the quantum vacuum. If that&#x27;s true, if that&#x27;s true, that&#x27;s the end of the US pro dollar.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; If a free energy source becomes public knowledge, that economy foundation changes fundamentally. And this is not just a military secret. It&#x27;s a financial one and it cuts across every administration. It all boils down to greed and money. Here is what I want to leave with you.</p>
<p>Every layer of the story points to a structure that has resisted disclosure. Not because of one administration, but because of what full disclosure would actually cost military and economically and even politically. So the real question isn&#x27;t whether any order gets signed. The question is how deep any order can actually reach. What do you think? Has anything that happened in the last 48 hours change on how you read this situation as to what&#x27;s going on? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m Christina Gomez and that is it for today. I will see you again next time for another UFO news update. Be safe and remember, keep your eyes on the skies. Heat up here. Heat.</p>
