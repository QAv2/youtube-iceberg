            <p>so this this is a question about a topic that cannot be classified because it is illegal um but do you have any reason to believe that the US government has hurt or killed anybody connected to these programs American citizens there were concerns like I stated during the hearing of people um that have exposed that to me and of course I brought some of those officers uh to the Inspector General the intelligence Community Inspector General because I&#x27;m like this is serious and I&#x27;m like here&#x27;s here&#x27;s the law enforcement people want to talk to because I&#x27;m hands off if that&#x27;s true you need to look into it but allegation was murder uh yes and then physical harm and I will say well I won&#x27;t get into the specifics because it&#x27;s part of my open investigation you know besides the administrative stuff and I don&#x27;t know uh it&#x27;s an unknown enemy to me I do not know who did this but their displeasure in me was made known in my personal life and then you know it affected my wife and I and I had to report that uh to a certain Counter Intelligence element and a certain certain law enforcement element because right before I filed my whistleblower complaint you know I felt that my life was in Jeopardy and that&#x27;s what I was alluding to during the hearing because you know we&#x27;ll just say if you when you come home and you see something you know uh you made somebody unhappy and I to this day I don&#x27;t know who it was um I don&#x27;t think it was a foreign entity but there is some element that I extremely angered and I don&#x27;t say that flippantly I say that very very seriously because I thought my life was in danger you can&#x27;t get into details because it&#x27;s part of the investig it&#x27;s part of the investigation at some point I&#x27;m happy to talk about it publicly and also as they say in the intelligence business you don&#x27;t acknowledge your tale so I don&#x27;t want to acknowledge some other things I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve noticed that maybe supposed to be you believe you&#x27;ve been surveilled and threatened oh 100% it was obvious to me and you know I mean it was blatant we&#x27;ll just say what I observed and it was so concerning I I had I ended up reporting it to the authorities and and I asked my Agency for certain protective measures I can&#x27;t get into that that detail um but I was certainly petrified and the at the same time that those things were happening to me personally um they were happening at the same time to a certain other public figure um that is known to the world we&#x27;ll just say and another Former Intelligence officer near my home as well and it was some kind of um planned uh multi-person intimidation um activity that was very disturbing and I&#x27;ll just leave it at that but and so I I&#x27;m not doing this for fun I&#x27;m serious I&#x27;m doing this interview because this is protective for me I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t want to be anonymous so I&#x27;m not here for attention I don&#x27;t even this is a nightmare to even be public right you know I I&#x27;m used to working in a vault and briefing generals this is not me I&#x27;m not a public Communicator although I&#x27;m trying and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m doing very good communicator I appreciate it but this is a serious subject with serious consequences and I suffered a lot of serious consequences so as you know um you&#x27;ve totally convinced me that of your sincerity um there was a lot of whispering uh about your motives this is an OP why now why are we learning all this people think that I&#x27;m a part of some CIA scop or something like that first of all I&#x27;ve never signed any kind of paperwork to be a part of an operation in that regard unfortunately there isn&#x27;t the plan I&#x27;m not a part of a plan I ended up becoming a leader of a of a faction of um you know former government officials and current government officials that would like change in a legal way and you know I encourage if there are people watching that have participated in those programs there are multiple legal Avenues such as going to the arrow office going through the ICI like I did Intelligence Community Inspector General or another cognizant inspector&#x27;s General um to legally provide this information and there also illegal but morally defensible avenues like coming on this show and I&#x27;d be delighted to host anyone who wants to tell the truth about what he&#x27;s seen uh and there&#x27;s no justification for hiding this that that&#x27;s my evaluation so I&#x27;d be happy to uh to take that risk to have that person on um but it sounds like when so given your own experience when people say to you um US government employees say to you wow someone was killed by the US government for talking about this or planning to talk about it it sounds like you would have to take those claims seriously I did and I remember a very very credible senior intelligence officer precisely make those allegations in front of senior officials on Capitol Hill I was in the room elected officials uh their staff I&#x27;ll just say I don&#x27;t want to get into details that&#x27;s crazy I mean so it&#x27;s like at that point if somebody says the US government killed an American citizen without a trial uh because he was going to tell the truth about something that&#x27;s kind of when everything stops you can&#x27;t have that in a free country I mean I think people are just paralyzed in fear because that&#x27;s a reality and I remember the certain professional staff members being very upset in the room and uh I mean they&#x27;re rightly so but like we need to do something about that because that&#x27;s not good and most of the people that even I interviewed I&#x27;m like do you want to go to the Inspector General with me and they&#x27;re like we&#x27;ll back you up but we don&#x27;t want to name on any complaints cuz they were just living in fear you know so like for my whole life the you know I i&#x27; never even thought UFOs are real until fairly recently me either four years ago I I if you asked me four or five years ago if I thought UFOs are real I would have laughed I took completely agree um but the conventional explanation for the US government among those who believed it was hiding these facts the explanation for why was the government doesn&#x27;t want to show Panic doesn&#x27;t want to admit weakness um in the face of its adversaries etc etc those explanations do not account for the behavior you&#x27;re describing yeah at first they&#x27;re hiding something real that implicates them and if they&#x27;re talking to these entities whatever they are and I I believe on the basis of evidence that the US government has made contact and has had continuous or at least sporadic but over period of years contact UM you don&#x27;t need to nod or shake your head but that is my belief based on talking to people like what is that yeah if there&#x27;s certainly you know relationship that was cultivated with non-human intelligences hypothetically I guess you know to play off of what you just said good or bad it&#x27;s almost like we were afraid after 911 dirty bombs terrorists okay well that&#x27;s nature that&#x27;s life yin and yang of the universe if there&#x27;s malevolent non-human intelligences okay well that&#x27;s a fact of life don&#x27;t hide it because what if the US populist one needs to be prepared for something some hyp and it&#x27;s also not their right to hide it because they don&#x27;t own the government the public does actually exactly and it&#x27;s just I understand the reasons at first but like you said I think it&#x27;s just the moral Decay and the decay in leadership and once again well we don&#x27;t want to admit we did all this stuff years AG but also if the US government has had contact with these entities and again it is my informed belief that the US government has had contact what are they talking about what is that hey I would like to know too I mean I grew up watching Star Trek so I mean I say that kind of you know whimsically but like well great I mean of my generation under 40 that&#x27;s like we&#x27;re not shocked that&#x27;s cool like a genzer who&#x27;s 18 would want to study Physics if they found out this stuff was real yes like this is how you boost stem in this country for goodness sakes I mean this is like the most exciting yes a little scary but overall it&#x27;s exciting I mean nothing&#x27;s happened you know we&#x27;re still living I&#x27;m able to talk about this nothing&#x27;s happening you know to the you know the world if you will so it&#x27;s I think it&#x27;s exciting for for young people and I think it&#x27;s the right time to do this um going back in history I mean there you know there are all sorts of mysteries about history that we you know just can&#x27;t explain even now MH um but is it it sounds like it would not be surprising to learn that people 3,000 years ago had contact with these yeah I mean you look at the works of jacqu valet a famous um researcher his character was portrayed in as the French character in Close Encounters of the Third Kind by stepen Spielberg that guy exists his name is jacqu B and he has a PHD and he&#x27;s a smart scientist but looked at this and um there&#x27;s a couple books like passport to Mongolia and some other stuff I&#x27;m probably butchering the name um where he looked into Antiquity this phenomenon so when people say oh it&#x27;s probably Aerial Technology Etc we&#x27;ve been seeing the same stuff since Antiquity and this should also potentially enforce stories in theological texts say the Bible or whatever that people actually saw Exel ezekiel&#x27;s Wheels as Timber shett has exposed publicly maybe that actually happened now unfortunately you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re bursting maybe a worldview or a bubble for some people but it actually ultimately infor it might enforce people&#x27;s belief systems because stories in the religious text weren&#x27;t allegory or whatever they happened and I&#x27;m not saying all of them did but there might be evidence if we were openly and honestly studying the subject in more detail amazing last question small question but um there clearly some connection between nuclear weapons nuclear energy and the sightings of these things I mean they&#x27;ve been seen around US military installations with with nuclear so what is that yeah you wonder if the nuclear testing was almost like a beacon you know anybody observing from far distance like whoa the the monkey has the has discovered 10 to the six tons of TNT energy extraction they&#x27;re close maybe they&#x27;re only an order of magnitude away of energy dist you know extraction to develop technology that um maybe they have you know hypothetically right and it might have been just like a lighthouse we turned it on and now they became more interested U and it might be also a symptom of what we call collection bias where modern society we were more calibrated to look for that kind of stuff because there was like Sci-Fi movies in the 30s and 40s and maybe people were looking up more maybe but certainly there is some kind of nuclear connection what does it mean I don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re obviously performing some kind of um reconnaissance uh in surveillance of us as it relates to not only our nuclear weapons and nuclear facilities if anybody wants to read a book called UFOs and nukes by Robert Hastings he spent 40 plus years looking at um interviewing Air Force missileers other credible Witnesses and you know very famous incident in 1967 Bob Salis right shut down the Bas shut down the nukes and uh you know we should take those observers seriously they&#x27;re trained they have clearances they have their you know jobs on the line you know lying in that regard and so there is a nuclear connection I encourage people to read that book but what does it mean I don&#x27;t even know no idea well you&#x27;re a brave man and I&#x27;ll be honest I didn&#x27;t know what to think because there&#x27;s a lot of whispering about you but I think you&#x27;re totally sincere y people say the news is full of lies can&#x27;s motor 239 self death of Jeffrey [Music]
