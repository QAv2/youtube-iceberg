            <p>[Music] um so pilots and others who encounter uaps often state that their abrupt high-speed Maneuvers appear to be way beyond our physics is that a reasonable conclusion you know when you hear that that sounds very reasonable I After all you&#x27;ve got uh Pilots observing these craft coming from space dropping down to the Earth within a few seconds and then stopping on a DME time and then suddenly taking off at High mock numbers and doing a right angle turn so it&#x27;s very reasonable it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a natural thing for these Pilots to say you know this is just way beyond our physics on the other hand I approached it as a scientist in in a different way and I said okay if something is happening it&#x27;s got to somehow be part of our physics so what I did was I took a piece of paper and I made a list on the leftand side uh what were the bizarre things that were being observed you know right angle turns and mock chin um you know diving into the water with no splashes uh you know all the weird walking up to a craft that seemed small but they got inside and it was giant you know things that now for me the more weird those descriptions the better I like them because if somebody is just making up a story they want it to sound kind of rational and reasonable well my list of weird descriptions were not rational or reasonable they they&#x27;re all offthe wall I then took general relativity uh and said okay you know in or all of our ordinary electromagnetic uh applications with computers and Wi-Fi and so on we start out with a series of Max&#x27;s equations and outcome all the predictions and we do our our our technology developments in general relativity Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity now that&#x27;s used primarily for investigating uh astrophysical phenomena like mergers of black holes and neutron stars and so on so I said to myself suppose we could engineer Einstein&#x27;s equations for general relativity the way we engineer Maxwell&#x27;s equations for all our electromagnetic effects what would I expect to see and so I made up a list on the right hand side of the piece of paper and they matched hand and glove with the weird observations being given on the left hand side let me give you an example for example and say okay you&#x27;ve got this thing going at right angle turns at mach 10 if anybody were in there they&#x27;d be turned in a tomato sauce in the back of the ship but anyway uh when I appli the equations for general relativity general relativity affects time and space variables so it turns out that one of the consequences uh in this case is that time runs faster inside the craft when it&#x27;s engineered uh the way I&#x27;m proposing and so for them uh they&#x27;re just taking a leisurely turn of course when they look outside and see all of us on the ground we all seem to be going in slow motion but anyway what appears to be an absolute unbelievably right-hand turn at mach 10 for the people on the craft uh you know that&#x27;s not the case similarly in reports of people approaching a craft uh which is some particular size and then when they get really close craft seems either much larger or much smaller these are the kinds of things that general relativity would predict um another example would be um time running at different rates so that if somebody supposedly has been taken aboard a craft and they in there for a while and they come out and they find time has gone by much faster outside or at a different clip and they think well maybe I&#x27;ve got missing time or whatever anyway you go down this list of of weird things but they do match up with general relativity okay so if we physicist know how it&#x27;s working working in the princip of general relativity then you know why aren&#x27;t we building them why why aren&#x27;t they ourcraft well it turns out that the one requirement that is a real challenge is you have have have to have enormous amounts of energy collected in very tiny volumes extreme energy densities and and we can&#x27;t do that that that&#x27;s where we fall short so I would say the physics is straightforward it is within uh the physics that we know but it&#x27;s Way Beyond what we can do with our engineering [Music]</p>
