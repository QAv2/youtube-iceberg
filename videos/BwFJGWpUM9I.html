            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel where we look at uh different theories of everything primarily and uh usually things that you&#x27;ve never heard of before but uh things that I&#x27;ve encountered in my research and that I feel like I uh should pass them on to other people for further research and further study um and one of these things is the reciprocal system of theory today is video number 221 on the reciprocal system of theory and uh we just uh this is a theory that was first arrived at by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century and we&#x27;ve done a few of his books we just got done with his 1979 book called Nothing But motion which was the first of now uh first of a um Trilogy of books that&#x27;s called the structure of the physical universe so that first book nothing but motion is primarily on Atomic physics and then the second book uh that is called basic properties of matter is primarily on chemistry and we just went uh in the end of the last video we just went over the table of contents of that chapter what what that book is actually going to get into now I don&#x27;t uh we&#x27;re not going to go into that book right now um but we&#x27;re gonna skip um to well we&#x27;re not really even going to skip to the third book the third book is called Universe of motion and this book is on astronomy uh and it has about 31 chapters and it&#x27;s a a great book uh it&#x27;s uh really really difficult stuff um what we&#x27;re gonna do uh instead of going over that whole book for another 100 videos is we&#x27;re going to um look at a paper that I wrote a short paper that I wrote on Larson&#x27;s theory of astronomy called reciprocal astronomy I wrote this many years ago and I just actually reading through it and I&#x27;m like did I write this is this somebody else or did I write this um now I believe that I wrote this I&#x27;m not 100 completely sure but I&#x27;m pretty sure that I wrote this um and um it&#x27;s a summary it&#x27;s kind of a summary of his book on reciprocal astronomy and hopefully you know it&#x27;ll wet your whistle so that when we actually do look in detail at his book you&#x27;ll have a little bit of background okay so uh we&#x27;re gonna start uh right here reciprocal astronomy part zero background Dewey Larson&#x27;s 1898 to 1990. reciprocal system of theory states essentially that the universe is composed entirely of motion and that motion has two reciprocal aspects space and time the theory describes a complete theoretical Universe the basic phenomena and relations of the major fields of physical science have been verified by standard scientific methods the theory was developed strictly in accordance with standard classical scientific procedure a a careful critical and systematic re-examination of basic physical relations B the formulation of a universal theory expressed in the form of postulates see the development of the consequences of these postulates and D the verification of the theory by comparing the consequences with observation and measurement in the reciprocal system the common denominator of matter and energy is motion a great many scientists and philosophers including such prominent men as Eddington Descartes and Hobbes have tried but failed to construct a theory on this basis because they fail to recognize that the switch to a universe of motion requires a redefinition of space and time by redefining space and time Larson&#x27;s Universe of motion has brought the unity and coherence of physical science which theorists have uh tried for years to construct until they lost heart and gave up the effort space for many thousands of years has been something that we are in a setting in which the action of the universe takes place a container for the material objects that participate in this action it has been taken for granted that both space and time participate in the action of the universe that physical phenomena exists in space and time um existence base time has always been more elusive than space something ticking getting later and later just where when and how time differs from space has been difficult to specify especially at high speeds in the reciprocal system of theory for the first time in scientific history a totally new concept of space appears which recognizes the solution to these puzzles is implicit in a universe of motion motion is the relationship between space and time and space and time are reciprocal aspects of motion one of them is the numerator the other is the denominator and each can be multi-dimensional one consequence that follows directly is that the space-time relationship is a general one space and time are reciprocally related everywhere in the physical universe velocity space overtime is not the only relationship between space and time in fact all other phenomena of the universe can be described entirely and solely in terms of space and time energy says Larson is time over space acceleration is space over time to the second power matter is timed to the third power over space to the third power fourth is time over space to the second power permittivity is space to the second power over time pressure is time over space to the fourth power and so on currently establishment scientists are confused by the dazzling array of units and constants in their MKS System of Units that have no clear connection with one another having a coherent System of Units provides insights into the true nature of these scientific phenomena along with a check for the system as a whole as we move as we move forward from the well-known phenomena of our everyday environment to less familiar fields direct observation becomes illusory as we move into the Realms of the very fast the very slow the very small and the very large our our observation equipment our telescopes microscopes and atomic clocks become less reliable but Larson&#x27;s conceptual Theory stays in focus um now uh I have a number of visualizations that are built into this uh into this paper um the first one is sitting on Earth paper on a table on Earth doing geometry um I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the end of the visualization I guess it is now the idea is that if you&#x27;re um sitting on Earth doing geometry you feel like you&#x27;re doing um plain geometry but in actuality uh if you accept the um spherical Earth theory you are actually on the surface of a sphere and so you know you can&#x27;t actually be doing plain geometry um on a sphere so I guess that&#x27;s the general idea there of that visualization I think the visualizations become more specific to the actual reciprocal system but okay no longer are we limited to exploring the regions that are clearly visible and leaving all else to speculation and fantasy for insight we can apply Larson&#x27;s Theory to any topic visible or not okay part one the uh astronomical rules each dust particle is is composed of incredibly large in numbers of atoms each star is composed of incredibly large numbers of dust particles and each Galaxy is composed of incredibly large numbers of stars the sun is a pretty average star in a pretty average galaxy The Milky Way galaxies stars planets and moons all rotate around their axes Stars rotate around galaxies planets rotate around stars and moons rotate around planets all also participate in the background rotations and recessions a common unit of measure in astronomy is the light year the amount of distance light travels in one year approximately at approximately 700 million miles per hour this distance is about 60 trillion miles for a light year now um I will point out here that Dr Bruce Perrette has done uh he&#x27;s one of Larson&#x27;s uh primary uh followers and I would say um revisers uh he&#x27;s gone through Larson&#x27;s work extensively and he&#x27;s pointed out a few errors now Larson did say that the the reciprocal system itself is correct but whether I have applied it correctly in every circumstance is a different question and I may have made some mistakes in my application and peret uh has found a few mistakes and it has at least convinced me that uh a few of those uh Corrections are valid this one I don&#x27;t know but peret has kind of revised a lot of Larson&#x27;s calculations in terms of the astronomy now this is completely separate from the shape of the earth you know a flat Earth uh kind of proposal or anything like that I am personally kind of an agnostic on the shape of the earth I don&#x27;t know um and because I haven&#x27;t been to space I haven&#x27;t been to Antarctica and I haven&#x27;t done the proper measurements to determine for myself you know what the shape of the earth is so this article that I&#x27;m reading here is basically assuming that the Earth is kind of as NASA says it is which is a dubious but uh Bruce Perrette has actually uh kind of uh indicated that well yes the the planets rotate around the stars and the Stars rotate around the galaxies and so on but the scale is much much much smaller than what we are saying it is so where we&#x27;re talking about the uh a light year being 60 trillion miles and that the closest star is four over four light years away and in Larson&#x27;s theory he really says that the gravitational limit of star of our star is over three light years so that there is no not even a possibility that a star could be within three light years of our star peret has reduced that by a huge factor and he basically says that I think even the Andromeda Galaxy which is supposed to be 2 million light years from here um he says that the Andromeda galaxy is is actually less than a light year I believe uh I may have my numbers wrong but it&#x27;s a drastic drastic reduction in the size and I think he was inspired uh to make those uh make those changes by a lot of the observations made by a uh I believe he&#x27;s a Persian um Iranian um astronomer who&#x27;s now deceased named bahram qatarai and um he he makes some cogent arguments about how the size of the uh of the gaps between the various uh entities in the universe is much much much smaller than what the scientists are telling us um so that&#x27;s just food for thought and I believe that when peret goes through that he it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t upset the reciprocal system as a whole it just kind of upsets the uh the scale you know the the mechanism is still the same it&#x27;s the scale that he changes okay back to the paper we live in a universe made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time if we accept these premises then logically motion exists prior to anything else the primordial state of the universe is motion without their yet being anything that is moving to visualize emotion without anything moving consider the background motions okay this is the next visualization a background rotations uh zero train moving on the Earth&#x27;s surface at 30 miles per hour ball thrown at 40 miles per hour one from the Moon Earth&#x27;s axis rotation at 500 to a thousand miles per hour from the Sun Earth&#x27;s rotation around the Sun at 70 000 miles per hour three from the center of the Galaxy Sun&#x27;s rotation around the Milky Way galaxy at approximately 500 000 miles per hour four from outside the galaxy The Milky Way galaxies recession from other galaxies at up to 700 million miles per hour five from the outside edge of the universe recession from all other galaxies at 700 million miles per hour the speed of light only motion zero around the uh the moon around the Earth are we able to notice directly as motion or the moon around the Sun are we able to notice directly as motion numbers one and two we notice as change of time uh the time of day I guess number one is the Earth around the uh around the Sun the time of day and the time of year motions three and four are noticeable only with the most advanced instruments known to man even though the magnitudes of these motions are much higher than numbers one and two in all cases the primordial motion five that recession at the speed of light is pre-existing omnipresent and unobservable our observations can only be based on an alteration of that original background rotation to us it feels like complete Stillness and certainly these are uh this visualization here uh has been used by flat earthers to you know show that the Earth is actually flat and completely still so we&#x27;re either on a flat Earth that&#x27;s completely still like that or we have to basically posit all of these background rotations and that we are unable to really notice them in Larson&#x27;s Universe of motion the basic omnipresent pre-existing kind of motion is a scalar motion the existence of scalar motion is acknowledged but mostly ignored by scientists another visualization scalar motion has a magnitude but nor no Direction like dots on an expanding or Contracting balloon the dots are either moving out or in in but in no particular direction or rather in all directions the motion is either in or out distributed equally over all vectorial directions raisin bread to complete the visual um if you want to fill in the interior of that balloon as the you bake the bread the raisins get farther and farther apart okay uh let&#x27;s try to get to the end of this paragraph here it must be emphasized that even though this motion requires three vectorial dimensions such as Xyz coordinates to describe it is only a one-dimensional scalar motion meanwhile there are three dimensions of scalar motion but only one can be represented properly in our reference system at any given time or space scalar motion has been observed by the conventional astronomers in the recession of the distant galaxies all are moving farther and farther away from each other it is also observed as the flow of time always getting later and later okay we&#x27;re gonna leave it there and start up start up tomorrow with uh this paper this paper will probably take us three or four days to get through I think maybe five or six I don&#x27;t know um but that&#x27;s a start and thanks for tuning in I hope you tune in tomorrow for the next installment have a great day</p>
