            <p>all right how&#x27;s everyone doing out there today welcome to my channel this is a channel for educational purposes and we look at uh some great theories of everything and all-encompassing theories Magnum opuses and uh the esoteric and obscure things that can uh help your life um help you uh change adjust your paradigm uh your holistic uh Viewpoint and uh today is the 361st video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and the reciprocal system of theory is uh was authored by dwey B Larsson back in the 20th century in 1959 he put out his two fundamental postulates and and those are uh he used as a basis for uh deriving his theoretical Universe from which he wrote a number of books kind of uh comparing his theoretical Universe with the universe that the scientists had already observed and measured and um hypothesized and uh it&#x27;s all a very interesting study uh Larson larsson&#x27;s theoretical Universe Stacks up very well uh he made a lot of predictions that came true and uh he has been utterly ignored by uh the scientific establishment and uh he died back in 1990 pretty much unknown left behind a small amount a small group of followers uh he has a journal called reciprocity and a an organization um but you know they&#x27;re not out there um you know with any type of uh numbers but the uh research has um has improved and um people are making Headway so it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s promising but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot of work uh the reciprocal system is not easy to grasp uh it could be easier Larson was a great writer I thought but he wasn&#x27;t such a great teacher uh his Concepts and his uh arguments are all there but uh sometimes they&#x27;re not in the easiest place to retrieve them and uh you know how it goes these days people have an a very short attention span and they&#x27;re not able to wrap their heads around difficult unfamiliar Concepts uh without trying pretty hard and uh so Larson uh kind of Falls prey to that anyway the basic idea behind larsson&#x27;s reciprocal system by uh lies in those two fundamental postulates in particular the first postulate which uh can be paraphrased as the universe is comp composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions with uh indiscrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so the universe is made out of motion and not just any kind of of motion but in particular what Lara calls a scalar motion that&#x27;s a motion with a magnitude but no specific Direction um you might want to think of it as kind of like a non-local motion and uh that motion uh now you would en you can Envision a scalar motion uh using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other uh but in no specific Direction so you have uh just kind of a motion of every location on that balloon moving away from every other location on that balloon there is no uh specific motion it&#x27;s just uh everything is moving away from everything else and you might say what kind of em motion is that you know but um the fact that you can Envision it on the surface of a balloon uh shows you that it does exist but it was also has been observed uh through scientists telescopes uh in their conclusion that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and if we&#x27;re not so um you know uh uh I guess heliocentric or um anthropocentric to think that our galaxy is uh at the center of that uh expansion then we would also have to assume that our galaxy is also participating in that movement away from all of the other galaxies so this is a Bonafide emotion uh but the scientists have not given it any type of um they acknowledg its existence but they don&#x27;t give it any type of significance uh but Larson puts it at the center so the universe is made out of motion particularly a scalar motion and that motion exists in okay that is that is what Larson calls clock time and clock space clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but in no specific Direction the uh expanding balloon uh shows that the space is getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no specific Direction that&#x27;s clock time and clock space then we have coordinate time and coordinate space coordinate space space XYZ coordinates uh three dimensions volume and we&#x27;re accustom to that Concept in space But as reciprocal aspects space and time um both have the same qualities just like any reciprocals if you have uh the reciprocals 4 over one and 1 over 4 they have the same qualities 1 and four but they are just in uh inverse order and they multiply out to equal one and so uh if you have three dimensions of space you can also posit that there would be three dimensions of time Larson refers to that as Co ordinate time so um and then you have discrete units space and time and motion come only in discrete units you have to have a full unit of any of those things in order to have those things you cannot have half a unit or you know a fraction of a unit um you have to have a full unit and those units are very small um but the unit of space is about 500,000 of an inch unit of time is 1 6 quadrillionth of a second um even less than that uh but uh they do exist and so when you&#x27;re seeing a continuous motion you&#x27;re actually seeing a million a bazillion frames of still motion just like if you were looking at a cartoon you recognize that this is not a continuous motion there&#x27;s a bunch of still pictures that I&#x27;m looking at going by me very very fast and that is uh the nature of this reciprocal system Universe quantized discrete unit if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time keeping in mind that space over time is speed the car is moving at 15 miles per hour 15 miles of space and one hour of time and um basically all of our scientific quantities are Rel relationships between space and time or time and space and they can be expressed uh exclusively um through space and time units you don&#x27;t need mass units mass is in your Larson&#x27;s uh system is T the3 power over s the 3 power space space over time I mean speed is space over time energy is time over space acceleration is space over time to the second power force is time over space to the second power pressure is time over space to the fourth power uh you know it goes on like that uh every different one of our scientific quantities is a uh fraction of space and time uh either space over time or time over space in one or more powers and um but if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light which is what Larson refers to as unit speed one over 1 equal 1 and again as I was saying about one one is what you get when you multiply two reciprocals so it&#x27;s basically the center of the system now the Legacy scientist the center of their system the zero point the the midpoint the neutral point is zero and they measure plus plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 + 4 + 5 and -1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 the reciprocal system is a multiplicative system using reciprocals and so if you have a multiplicative system using reciprocals your midpoint is one and on one side on the positive side you have 2 3 4 and five but on the negative side you have 1/2 1/3 1/4 and 1 15 um it&#x27;s not a plus minus it&#x27;s a multiplicative system when you multiply those numbers uh with their uh balance on the other side you get one and so this 1/ 1al 1 unit speed the speed of light is the zero point of the universe of motion or it is the null point the neutral point the uh Larsson calls it the reference point or the progression of the natural reference system um The Ether the origin these are all uh the things that uh pertain to the speed of light outward in all directions and so there is an entire half of the universe that is moving faster than the speed of light and um then there is that that Larsson calls the cosmic sector and there is half the universe moving slower than the speed of light that Larson calls the material sector Einstein and his crowd only knew about the material sector uh evidence by Einstein&#x27;s dictum that the speed of light is the speed limit of the universe nothing moves faster than the speed of light well um that leaves out half of larsson&#x27;s universe fortunately that half of the universe can be kind of filled in real quick because um of the reciprocal postulate what&#x27;s going on in the material universe is exactly the same on a general level as what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic Universe except that you have to invert the roles of space and time so once you cross that boundary you have to invert the rules so in the material sector you have relations based on coordinate space three dimensions of space and clock time clock is always getting later and later and later but in the cosmic sector once you cross that speed of light boundary and move to faster than light speed then you have coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space the space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart um and um so it kind of works that way and then uh larsson&#x27;s second postulate is uh less important and more disputed but it is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian now one person who takes Larsson to task on that second postulate is Dr Bruce pet who uh was is one of the uh chief revisers of the reciprocal system um well Dr pret&#x27;s also passed away back in 2020 but uh he came up with a system called rs2 the reciprocal system 2 or the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system uh today we&#x27;re going to go over some of his paper that is called the lorence factor we started this paper yesterday so you might want to go back a day if you want to go from the start but uh you may know that the lorence factor is what Einstein used it&#x27;s the mathematical um uh equation that you use in order to determine the uh how much uh time slows down if you&#x27;re starting to move at nearly the speed of light and I believe it&#x27;s basically like the square root of 1 minus uh v^2 over c^2 where V is the velocity or the speed and uh C is the speed of light so you&#x27;re basically determining the kind of the fraction of the speed of light and uh using uh the uh square of that and then uh taking the square root of that one minus that uh so uh uh in the first p in the first day the first uh part of this paper he was he basically a determined that this was can also be mapped out as the hypotenuse of a uh right triangle uh also the um the radius of a circle so in a unit circle with the velocity on the x axis the lorence factor uh being the corresponding value on the Y AIS okay uh the speed of light unit speed is the fulcrum between the motion and space and motion and time as such it is the upper limit of both those motions essentially being the maximum speed of the universe which is referred to as the progression of the natural reference system you can only show you can only slow down from this speed in space you add time so the speed of um one space one unit of space over one unit of time becomes one unit unit of space Over N units of time and that so that equates to a speed less than the speed of light and in time you add space going from one over t uh one unit of time over one unit of space to one unit of time over n units of space and being a integer and remembering that when you cross the unit speed boundary inversion takes place and speed becomes energy so you&#x27;re not moving into uh so much um less than one unit of speed you&#x27;re moving into what less than one unit of energy if you&#x27;re over in the cosmic sector so it it it equates to greater than unit speed but it&#x27;s really energy so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s less than one unit of energy energy and speed are reciprocals of one another energy energy is time over space speed is space over time okay um this is indicated in the Lorent Factor because any value where V is greater than one becomes undefined there is no solution to the equation because you would be mov moving at a velocity that is greater than the fastest velocity possible for the universe the system is only solvable if uh one uh if uh V is between Nega 1 and positive 1 anything photons particles atoms molecules Etc being carried by this progression the progression of the natural reference system outward in all Direction at the speed of light will be moving at this maximum speed of the universe photons having no I I wouldn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t say maximum speed of the universe uh because uh if you go into the cosmic sector you really are moving faster than the speed of light but it&#x27;s measured in energy um and so speed I don&#x27;t think is the right word there um but I could be wrong I have to think about that F uh photons having no net displacement in space or time in a vacuum have no resistance to this speed or this progression that&#x27;s I think that&#x27;s the word that I would use instead of speed is progression but but to this speed and will therefore be carried at this maximum speed which is why we call it the speed of light or in the reciprocal system unit speed uh and why the speed of light is constant in all reference frames in relativity uh the speed of light is constant because photons are not moving they are the only things are one of the only things that are Motionless in this universe of motion therefore they are carried by the progression they&#x27;re basically on the surface of that balloon that expanding balloon they&#x27;re they&#x27;re moving outward at the speed of light in all directions because they are carried by the progression that is the progression the outward movement at the speed of light in all directions and other um manif infestations are uh moving compared to that uh expanding surface but photons are not and that&#x27;s why they are measured as constant in all reference frames because they&#x27;re not moving at all and the progression is constant in all reference frames photons are not actually moving on their own they are just being carried by the progression no relative motion to the speed of the progression this is why light speed the maximum speed of the universe cannot be exceeded by any velocity in space it has nothing to do with infinite mass or an object shrinking into non-existance which is how the Lorent factor is interpreted the relations in the Lorent Factor understood as a unit circle do occur in the reciprical system but under different names Larson unknowingly uses it as the ba basis of his initial motions the problem is better understood in the complex plane where the gamma function represents the imaginary um the imaginary and axis um 1 over uh gamma equals negative gamma by default the universe is expanding at unit speed having the coordinates of + one um comma 0er on the diagram Larson then introduces the concept of a direction reversal which results in a linear vibration this is moving inward or left on the um on the V axis uh that could be gamma uh I guess that is gamma moving left on the gamma axis to the coordinates 0 comma plus or minus one the progression velocity appears to stop at V equal 0 but there is now a split across the gamma axis which is imaginary and rotation creating the two oppositely directed rotations that are known as a by rotation the solution of this by rotation can be expressed by Oilers formula using the exponential functions uh which is e uh e to the I uh the I gamma plus e to the I gamma squared no no no uh yes squared equals cosine of gamma e plus I gamma plus e [Music] um to the minus [Music] one gamma squar equals cosine of gamma so all that all that uh totals out to be cosine of gamma and so the cosine is just um the vertical axis I think so this direction reversal results in a cosine function which lson defines as a photon the core of his rotating systems uh this is uh more or less Larson&#x27;s um or perets and his uh his sidekick not really sidekick but their co-researchers Dr kvk neru uh came up with this concept of the bir rotation that the photon is a bir rotation um Larson believed that the photon was uh the combination of a translational motion and a vibrational Motion in a 90 uh orthogonal to the um to the vibrational motion when you combine the two um you know you end up getting a sign wave which is uh signature of the photon um pet here is saying that you get a cosine function which is a sine wave um also if you uh use a bir rotation two counter rotating systems when they combin they also create a wave like that and uh so that also could be the solution for a photon that&#x27;s what uh neou uh um posited with his by rotation and so this by rotation um answers more questions than the um larsson&#x27;s version of the photon according to pet and um this by rotation kind of requires uh us to admit that rotation is every bit as primary as translation or straight line movement um and that vibration is just a byproduct of those two things um rotation and translation and um this is really what paret says is really putting the yin into a yinyang uh situation uh where Larson is really using mostly Yang energy where he&#x27;s focused on a um translational motion and he says that the uh he says you you cannot rotate until you have something to rotate and so he first posits the vibrational motion and then well I guess it would be he posits the vibrational motion and this is the basic Photon and then once you have uh and well then then that&#x27;s plugged into this progression and so one once you have that uh Photon then you can rotate the photon and that&#x27;s where you get matter from matter comes out of a combinations of rotations of the photon uh paret says that rotation comes before that and you rotation is every bit as primary as translation in a universe of motion okay we&#x27;re going to leave it there um hopefully tomorrow tomorrow we will um be able to wrap up this paper uh there&#x27;s just um couple more pages I think uh there&#x27;s there&#x27;s more well there&#x27;s some footnotes we&#x27;ll see we might not be able to get through the footnotes I think we should be able to get through the paper though and um you know just hanging there with this it&#x27;s not easy stuff uh but it&#x27;s very rewarding if you uh can kind of Pierce you can Pierce uh one Veil at a time and each time you do it gets you coming back for more because there is something very right about this Theory and uh it shows in the fact that Larson was able to make so many predictions and uh to be able to calculate um things strictly from his theory uh we&#x27;re going to be looking at his book called basic properties of matter at some point soon and that is his book on chemistry and the fact that he&#x27;s able to actually um use just his theoretical Universe to uh determine uh so many basic properties of matter such as the melting point and the compressibility the boiling point and the um specific heat and you know the uh uh veence and uh so many different properties of matter um were determined by Larson strictly from Theory so he&#x27;s definitely he definitely was on to something I don&#x27;t feel like he completed his work but that&#x27;s probably because he&#x27;s just one guy and he&#x27;s going up against an entire Army of scientists and winning so uh that&#x27;s why I uh dedicate a lot of time to trying to learn the reciprocal system I certainly am not uh I&#x27;m not there yet but I&#x27;m working on it and hopefully I can at least help you guide you to uh you know the same kind of Thrills that I&#x27;ve had about uh being able to at least penetrate a little bit of this okay uh thanks for tuning in today and have a nice day</p>
