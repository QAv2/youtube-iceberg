            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel we take a look at some great theories of everything uh and um do deep dives into them show you how um what their potential is how you can uh use them in your own life help you with your Paradigm shifting your Awakening to 5D Consciousness your formation of a whole IC worldview and today is our 57th video on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson Mr Larsson was an American engineer who lived in the 20th century died in 1990 in 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how the universe operated and um was um you know one of the few uh scientists who who attempted to construct his uh Universe out of not matter not energy but motion and his Universe of motion also known as the reciprocal system um was articulated primarily in his first postulate and then um he went through a process of deduction to turn his uh postulates into a theoretical universe what his Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then he Compares uh his theoretical Universe with the measured empirical universe of the uh modern scientist and he does that in several works but including this one here uh that is called basic properties of matter which we&#x27;ll be reading from chapter 19 on magnetostatic today uh we started this chapter yesterday and so uh you might want to go back and uh start fresh if that&#x27;s um your thing otherwise you also could get a um more thorough um briefing on the reciprocal system uh from me if you watch any of my first 474 videos on this topic I go into the uh postulates and their applications in a little bit more depth a lot more depth uh in those videos uh at this point I&#x27;m uh pretty much just assuming that you have some working knowledge of the reciprocal system and um we&#x27;re going to try to just get into the text and um you know turn some pages so that we can get through this book um and um just I will give you the uh that first postulate um the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so the universe is made out of motion in particular LaRon is calling talking about a motion that he calls scalar motion that is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction which you can Envision using a balloon that you put dots on and uh if you blow up the balloon all the dots will be moving away from each other and uh they won&#x27;t be moving in any specific Direction every dot will be moving away from every other dot so every dot will basically be moving in every direction outward and then if you contract the balloon they will all be moving toward each other and um again not in any specific direction that is a scalar motion and then a motion in LaRon system is the relationship between space and time motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator and Tim or space as the denominator and uh uh the basic example you can use is speed the runner is uh running at 10 mil hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time space over time is speed and uh every other kind of scientific phenomena is also a different kind of form of motion matter is a form of motion energy is a form of motion pressure is a form of motion acceleration is a form of motion force is a for a form of motion they all have their specific time space signature uh time and space can have multiple exponents so for example matter is time to the 3 power over space to the 3 power in Larson system okay um again uh check out one of my first 474 videos if you want to go a little bit deeper into the uh reciprocal system um derivation and right now we&#x27;re going to uh check in here with magnetto stat uh right now he was uh kind of talking about the different uh two magnetic poles and um we&#x27;ll start here these poles constitute scalar reference points as defined in chapter 12 the effective direction of the rotational vibration that constitutes the charge located at the North Pole is outward from the north reference point while the effective direction of the charge centered at the South Pole is outward from the south reference point the interaction of two magnetically charged atoms therefore follows the same pattern as the interaction of electric charges uh and uh he gives a figure here which is identical to the figure that he uses for electric charges except that it substitutes poles for charges two North Poles move move outward from North reference points and therefore out outward from each other two South Poles similarly move outward from each other but um a North Pole moving outward from a North reference point is moving toward a South Pole that is moving outward from a South reference point thus like poles repel and unlike poles attract on this basis when two magnetically charged atoms are brought into proximity the North Pole of one atom is drawn to the South Pole of the other the resulting structure is a linear combination of a North Pole a neutral combination of two poles and a South Pole addition of a third magnetically charged atom converts the South Pole to a neutral combination but leaves a new South Pole at the new end of the structure further additions of the the same kind can be made limited only by thermal and other disruptive forces a similar linear array of atoms with North and South poles at opposite ends can be produced by introducing atoms of magnetizable matter between the magnetically charged atoms of a two atom combination separation of this structure at any point breaks a neutral combination and leaves North and South Pole at the ends of each segment thus no matter how finely magnetic material is divided there are always North and South Poles in every piece of the material because of the directional character of the magnetic forces they are subject to shielding in the same manner as electric forces the gravitational force on the other hand cannot be screened off or modified in any way many of observers have regarded this as an indication that the gravitational force must be something of a fundamentally different nature this impression has been introduced by or has been reinforced by the difficulty that has been experienced in finding an appropriate place for gravitation in basic physical Theory the principal objective of the theorists currently working on the problem of constructing a unified theory or Grand unified theory of physics is to find a place for gravitation in their theoretical structure development of the theory of the universe of motion now shows that gravitation static electricity and magnetostatics are phenomena of the same kind differing only in the number of effective scalar Dimensions because of the symmetry of space and time in this universe every kind of force or every kind of motion has an oppositely directed counterpart gravitation is no exception it takes place in time as well as in space and is therefore subject to the same differentiation between positive and negative as that which we find in electric forces but in the material sector of the universe the net gravitational effect is always in space that is there is no effective negative gravitation whereas in the cosmic sector it is always in time and since gravitation is three-dimensional there cannot be any directional differentiation of the kind that we find in magnetism because of the lack of understanding of the true relation between electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena conventional physical science has been unable to formulate a theory that would apply to both the approach that has been taken to the problem is to assume that electricity is fundamental and to erect the structure of physical theory on this Foundation further assumptions being made along the way as required in order to bring the observations and measurements into line with the electrically based Theory gravitation has thus been left with the status of an unexplained anomaly this is Holy due to the manner in which the theories have been constructed not to any peculiarity of gravitation if the approach had been reversed and physical Theory had been constructed on the basis of the assumption that gravitation is fundamental electricity and magnetism would have been the undigestible items this the kind of a unified theory that the investigators have been trying to construct can only be attained by a development such as the one reported in this work that rests on a solid foundation of understanding in which each of these three basic phenomena has its proper place aside from the effects of the difference in number of scalar Dimensions the properties of rotational vibration that constitutes a magnetic charge are the same as those of the rotational vibration that constitutes an electric charge magnetic charges can therefore be induced in appropriate materials these materials in which magnetic charges are induced behave in the same manner as permanent magnets in fact some of them become permanent magnets when charges are induced in them however only a relatively small number of elements are capable of being magnetized to a significant degree that is have the property known as fer magnetism the conventional theories of magnetism have no explanation on of the Restriction of magnetization in this sense to these elements indeed these theories would seem to imply that it should be a general property of matter on the basis of the assumptions previously mentioned the electrons which conventional Theory regards regards as constituent of atoms are Miniature electromagnet electromagnets and produce magnetic fields in most cases it is asserted the magnetic fields of these atoms are randomly oriented and there is no net magnetic resultant however there are a few elements in whose atoms the fields from the different electrons don&#x27;t exactly cancel and and these atoms have a net magnetic field in a few materials the magnetic fields of the atoms line up with each other um now that is a quote um doesn&#x27;t really say where that&#x27;s coming from uh there&#x27;s a footnote there but um anyway such materials it is asserted have magnetic properties just why these few elements should possess a property that most elements do not have is not specified for an explanation in terms of the theory of the universe of motion we need to consider the nature of the atomic motion if a two-dimensional positive rotational vibration is added to the three-dimensional combination of motions that constitutes the atom it modifies the magnitudes of of those motions and the product is not the same atom with a magnetic charge it is an atom of a different kind the results of such additions will be examined in chapter 24 a magnetic charge as a distinct entity can exist only where an atom is so constituted that there is a portion of the atomic structure that can vibrate two-dimensionally independently of the main body of the atom the requirements are met so far as the magnetic rotation is concerned where this rotation is asymmetric that is there are n displacement units in one of the two magnetic dimensions and n + one in the other on this basis the symmetrical B groups of elements which have magnetic rotations 1 one 22 33 and 44 are excluded uh this has to do with Larson&#x27;s um notation for atoms uh in Larson system just like everything else an atom is a form of motion in in fact an atom is a combination of motions it is um so it has a three number um every atom has three number signature and um the first number is a two-dimensional rotation the second number is a secondary two-dimensional rotation and they alternate and then the third number is a one-dimensional rotation and so those first two numbers are the ones he&#x27;s referring to here 1 1 22 and 3 3 and 44 um so those atoms where the uh two-dimensional rotations are balanced they are excluded from magnetic um ferromagnetic charges um while the magnetic charge has no Third Dimension the electric rotation with which it is associated in the three-dimensional motion of the atom must be independent of that associated with the remainder of the atom the electric rotational displacement must therefore exceed seven so that one complete Unit Seven displacement units plus an initial unit level so eight um can stay with the main body of the magnetic rotation while the excess applies to the magnetic charge furthermore the electric displacement must be positive as the reference system cannot accommodate two different negative displacements or Motion in time in the same atomic structure the electro negative divisions 3 and four are thus totally excluded the effect of all of these exclusions is to confine the magnetic charges to division two elements of group 3A and 4 a in group 3 3 a the first element capable of taking a magnetic charge in its normal state is iron this number one portion is apparently favorable for magnetization as iron is by far the most magnetic of the elements but a theoretical explanation of this positional Advantage is not yet available the next two elements Cobalt and nickel are also magnetic as their electric displacement is normally positive under some special conditions the displacements of chromium uh 6 and mag manganese 7 are increased to 8 and N respectively by reorientation relative to a new zero point as explained in chapter 18 of volume 1 these elements are then also able to accept magnetic charges according to the forging explanation of the atomic characteristics that are required in order to permit acquisition of magnetic charge the only other magnetic in this sense elements are the members of division 2 of group 4 a magnetic displacements 4-3 this theoretical expectation is consistent with observation but there are some as yet unexplained differences between the magnetic behavior of these elements and that of the group 3A elements the magnetic stra strength is lower in the 4 a group only one of the elements of this group gatl linium is magnetic at room temperature and this element does not occupy the same position in the group as iron as the most magnetic element of group 3A however samarium which is in the iron position does play an important part in many magnetic Alloys galenium is two positions higher in the atomic series which may may indicate that it is subject to a modification similar to that applying to the lower 3A elements uh manganese I think he was talking about but oppositely directed no I guess that would be uh more like um Cobalt okay if we give vadium credit for some magnetic properties on the strength of its beh behavior in some Alloys all of the division 2 elements of both the 3A and 4 a groups have a degree of magnetism under appropriate conditions the larger number of magnetic elements in group 4 a is a reflection of the larger size of this 32 element Group which puts 12 elements into division two there are a number of peculiarities in the relation of the magnetic properties of these 4 a elements elements the rare Earths to the positions of the elements in the atomic series that are as yet unexplained they are probably related to the other still unexplained irregularities in the behavior of these elements that were noted in the discussions of other physical properties the magnetic capabilities of the division 2 elements and Alloys carry over into some compounds but the simple compounds such as as the binary chlorides oxides Etc tend to be non-magnetic that is incapable of accepting magnetic charges of the ferromagnetic type in undertaking an examination of individual magnetic phenomena our first concern will be to establish the correct dimensions of the quantities with which we will be working this is an operation that we have had to carry out in every field that we have investigated but it is doubly important in the case of magnetism because of the dimensional confusion that ad admittedly exists in this area the principal reason for the confusion is the lack in conventional physical theory of any valid General framework to which the dimensional assignments of electric and magnetic quantities can be referred the customary assignment of dimensions on the basis of an analysis in to mass length and time components produces satisfactory results in the mechanical system of quantities indeed all that is necessary to convert these mechanical MLT assignments to the correct space-time Dimensions is to recognize the t t 3r over s the 3r dimensions of mass but extending this MLT system to electric and magnetic quantities meets with serious difficulties Malcolm M makes the following comment quote very contradictory statements have been made about the dimensions of electrical quantities while some writers state that it is impossible to express the dimensions of all electrical and magnetic quantities in terms of mass length and time others such as genes and Nicholson do precisely that end quote the the nature of the problem that the theorists face in attempting to arrive at an accurate and consistent set of MLT Dimensions can be seen by comparing the dimensions that have been assigned to one of the basic electric quantities electric current with the correct space-time Dimensions that we have identified in the preceding Pages current in MLT terms is asserted to have the dimensions of um M1 2 L I 2t1 uh I guess one dimension of mass two dimensions of length and two dimensions of time uh not quite sure what he&#x27;s what that notation is when converted to SpaceTime Dimensions this expression becomes um T 3r over s 3r * the quantity to the 12 * s 12 * 1-1 equals t^ 12/ s the correct dimensions are s/ T the reason for this discrepancy is that the LT dimensions are taken from the force equations and therefore reflect the errors in the conventional interpretation of those equations the further error due to the lack of distinction between electric charge and electric quantity is added when the dimensions are assigned to the electric current and the final result has no resemblance to the correct Dimensions the SI system and its immediate predecessors avoid a part of the problem by abandoning the effort to assign MLT Dimensions to electric charge and taking charge as an additional basic quantity but here again the distinction between charge and quantity is not recognized leading to incorrect dimensions for electric current these dimensions are stated as uh capital Q over T the SpaceTime equivalent of which is 1 / s instead of the correct s overt both the MLT and MLT Q systems of dimensional assignment are thus wrong in almost every electric and magnetic application and they serve no useful purpose in our study of electrical fundamentals we were able to establish the correct dimensions of the electrical quantities by using the mechanical Di itions as a base and taking advantage of the equivalence of mechanical and current phenomena this approach is not feasible in application to magnetism but we have a good alternative as our Theory indicates that there is a specific dimensional relation between the magnetic quantities and the corresponding electric quantities the dimensions of which we have already established the basic difference between electricity and magnetism is that electricity is one dimens dial whereas magnetism is two-dimensional however the various permutations and combinations of units of motion that account for the differences between one physical entity and another are phenomena of only one scalar Dimension the dimension that is represented in the reference system no more than this one dimension can be resolved into components by introduction of dimensions of space or time it follows that addition of a second dimension of motion to an electric quantity electrical quantity takes the form of a simple simple unit of inverse speed t/s the dimensions of the magnetic quantity corresponding to Any Given electric quantity are therefore t/ s times the dimensions of the electric quantity the dimensions thus derived for the principal magnetic quantities are shown uh in this table so uh look at the table we&#x27;ve got um dipole moment t^2 / s uh [Music] for uh he&#x27;s he said separating out the magnetic and the electric um quantities um but uh he&#x27;s not always following his T overs rule I don&#x27;t think T dipole moment he has this t^2 over s whereas dipole moment uh for magnetic is t/ s um charge t^2 s^2 flux t/ s^2 potential t s s 3r Vector potential t/ s 3r um I guess the he&#x27;s saying that the factor there is just T flux density T ^2 over s 4th flux density uh for the would be t/ S the 3r there the factor is T S field intensity oh I I I I think I I see what&#x27;s going on here okay um okay dipole moment is T dipole moment for magnetic is t^2 / s uh charge is t/ s flux for magnetic is t^2 S2 potential potential electrical is T s^2 Vector potential for magnetism is T ^2 S 3 flux density for electricity is t s 3r for magnetism it&#x27;s t^2 / S 4 uh field intensity is T over s 3r for magnetism it&#x27;s T2 S 4 resistivity is T ^2 s the 2 t^2 over S2 for inductance magnetism t 3/ s 3r electrical resistance t^2 s 3r and permeability for magnetism T 3r over s 4th here then we have a solid foundation for a critical analysis of magnetic relations one that is free from the dimensional um inconsistencies that have plagued maget magnetism ever since systematic investigation of magnetic phenomena has begun was begun in the next chapter we will apply the new understanding of magnetic fundamentals to an examination of magnetic quantities and units and that is the end of chapter 19 um and uh tomorrow we will start up with chapter 20 which is called magnetic quantities and units and so please tune in then to um learn more about magnetic quantities and units and the reciprocal system of theory in general thanks for tuning in today have a great</p>
