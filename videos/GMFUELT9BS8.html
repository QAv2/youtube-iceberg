            <p>In quantum mechanics, the act of observation changes the outcome. Take a particle. Until it&#x27;s observed, it exists in a cloud of probabilities. Once measured, it collapses into a single state, but only because someone looked. The observer effect challenges the idea that reality exists independently of us.</p>
<p>It suggests that consciousness and observation are tied directly to the physical universe. This might not just be a strange quirk of physics. It could be fundamental to understanding reality itself. This is Black Hole One. Subscribe to explore the edge of physics.</p>
