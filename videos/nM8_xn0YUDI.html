            <p>all right everyone hello welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas and I do uh educational videos on many different topics um we are in uh the middle of looking at the reciprocal system of theory a system of theory originated by Dewey B Larson back uh starting about 1930 until he died in 1990 and uh theory has been uh updated as well uh by Bruce Perrette and others um over the last 30 years and that&#x27;s called rs2 uh today we are in the middle of looking at one of his uh addresses that he gave back in 1986. and toward the end of his life uh it&#x27;s called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system so this is uh his kind of step-by-step process of how he how he did it basically the reciprocal system is just um the universe of motion the universe is made out of motion not matter not energy but motion and that motion is the relationship between time and space time and space are reciprocals of each other and so they have all of the same qualities uh but any type of ratio between time and space is a kind of um an entity a scientific phenomena uh um a measurable unit of uh of scientific um Reckoning and um he basically starts with that postulate and another postulate has to do with like geometry and math uh that uh is in dispute but he starts with that and he basically builds his Universe his theoretical Universe out of this and then uh he and others can take his theoretical universe and compare it with the actual Universe including the universe that the Legacy scientists have come up with so he you know goes from one step to another and he says okay well if this then that if this and that and that is an atom or that is a photon that is uh you know an electron so he basically creates this theoretical universe and then he Compares it with the actual universe he gets into trouble sometimes because the actual universe is not actual it is the universe that the scientists of Legacy scientists have come up with and so if the Legacy scientists have come up with something that&#x27;s wrong um you know sometimes Larson can pick it up but sometimes he he he might try to shoehorn his uh his theoretical Universe into that Universe if he believes in it too much I think he did that a lot with astronomy he took a lot of the uh assumptions of modern astronomy and he kind of accepted them as being real when they probably were just um NASA okay so now um we are on uh statement number 84 here in the middle I think this is about the um 10th episode of us going through this and we&#x27;re about halfway through so uh you may not get much or any of this uh you probably need to go back to the beginning and uh you know watch them all the way through but hopefully I&#x27;ll try to um I&#x27;ll try to you know explain some things as we go along as well okay number 84 succession successive editions of units of positive electric displacement or the equivalent to the helium atom produce other members of a series of atomic combinations the series of chemical elements number 85 in as much as the two-dimensional or magnetic rotation is the basic rotation of the atom as indicated in statement 64. the magnetic rotation takes precedence over the electric rotation where both are possible it follows that some of the additions of the atomic series involve magnetic displacement in lieu of electric displacement if we let N represent the number of double magnetic units of displacement or units of atomic number the corresponding number of single magnetic units is 2 n when acting jointly in a motion combination X magnetic units are equivalent to x squared one dimensional elect or electric units the 2N single magnetic units are therefore equivalent to 4 N squared single electric units dividing by 2 to convert the double units of the atomic system we find that n magnetic displacement units in an atom are equivalent to two N squared electric displacement units number 86. successive addition additions of magnetic displacement go alternately to the two magnetic Dimensions since small numbers are more probable than larger numbers one magnetic unit added to helium 2 1 0 a 2-1-0 produces 2-2 Dash zero which we identify as Neon okay so neon is uh a noble gas um being at the I guess the far right side of the periodic table um and that&#x27;s kind of the characteristic of the noble gases is that they have um zero as their electric number like the third number helium is 2-1-0 neon is 2-2-0 helium already has one effective magnetic displacement unit in each magnetic dimension thus the increase from 2-2-0 involves a second unit in one of the dimensions from statement 85 this second magnetic unit is equivalent to two times two to the second or eight electric units it should be noted that this is the electric equivalent of the second unit not the sum of the two units the reason is that the progression in the region inside unit space takes place in time only and the succession of values is one over one then one over two then one over three all the way to 1 over n the number of time units involved is one two three eventually to n thus the value 2 applies to the second unit only not to the total of the first two units okay number 88 the first four editions of electric displacement units to helium produced following series of elements okay number three lithium displacement 2-1-1 number four beryllium 2-1-2 boron number five boron 2-1-3 and then atomic number six carbon 2-1-4 number 89 as long as the magnetic displacement the major component of the atomic rotation is positive the electric displacement or the minor component can be negative without violating the requirement uh stated in number 67 statement 67 that the net total rotational displacement of a material atom must be positive carbon can therefore exist with the alternative or alternate displacements of 2-2 Dash negative four as opposed to what he said earlier which is 2-1-4 so 2-2-0 is neon 2-1-0 is uh helium so carbon is halfway between [Music] um you know um helium and neon it can it&#x27;s four units away it could either take positive four from Helium or negative for from Neon so here with the 2-2-negative for he says the neon type magnetic rotation with net displacement 10 is combined with four negative electric displacement units for a net total positive of six the same as the net displacement of the 2-1-4 combination the probability difference between these two combinations is small and so both are found observationally Beyond carbon the probabilities favor the smaller negative electric displacement the normal forms of the next three elements therefore are number seven nitrogen two dash two dash negative three number eight oxygen two dash two dash negative two and number nine fluorine two dash two dash negative one number ninety another group of eight elements follows bringing the second magnetic Dimension up to two effective displacement units at Argon 3-2-0 so again this ending in zero is the sign of a noble gas so the next noble gas here is argon which is element number 18. a further one unit increase raises the effective displacement level to three units in one of the magnetic dimensions the third magnetic unit is equivalent to two times three to the second power or 18 electric units 2 18 unit groups of elements therefore follows increasing the displacements to 3-3-0 which is Krypton element number 36 and then to 4 dash 3-0 which is Xenon element number 54.</p>
<p>finally there are two groups of two times four squared equals 32 elements each the first of these carries the series of four dash four dash zero which is radon element number 86. the second would reach 5 Dash four dash zero or element number 118. but here another Factor intervenes so he&#x27;s basically building up the periodic table um starting with these magnetic displacements um that create the noble gas series and it&#x27;s all the electric displacements that create the gradations between the noble gases and so the noble get uh the highest noble gas would be element number 118. um but he says there another Factor intervenes okay so number 91 from 60 the maximum three-dimensional scalar rotation has a magnetic or sorry has a magnitude of eight units the significance of this is that at a speed displacement of eight net units the rotationally distribute distributed progression reaches the same scalar location the end of the spatial unit that a linear progression reaches in the same time interval the next unit of the progression then begins without any limitation on the nature of the coupling of to the reference system in the absence of such a limitation the motion takes the most probable form a unidirectional linear progression this means that at element 118 where the rotational displacements are 5-4-0 and there are a total of eight effective magnetic display displacement units for in each dimension the rotational combination of motions disintegrates and reverts to the linear basis um basically turning into a photon or maybe a group of photons the series of chemical elements therefore terminates at element 117. so you can&#x27;t really um complete the five unit thing you can have five for negative one but you cannot have five four zero so the highest element here would be number 117.</p>
<p>and as you may know uh I think Legacy science has only uh you know discovered um any every every element of Beyond uranium number 92 is uh unstable um really every element I think above number 83 bismuth is is somewhat unstable but the ones Beyond uranium are particularly unstable and I think they&#x27;ve only gotten up to like number 105 or something like that that&#x27;s back when I used to take chemistry classes so maybe it&#x27;s more now but Larson says that they actually go up to number 117 but there are reasons why um these elements are unstable and can&#x27;t be really isolated um for any length of time number 92 because the succession of speed displacements follows the definite pattern outline in statement 84 to 91. each element can be characterized by a unique set of numbers subject to some modification under special circumstances these are the values that enter into the various equations which determine the magnitudes of different properties of the elements and their combinations number 93 each successive element in the atomic series adds one double unit of positive three-dimensional rotational speed displacement to the combination of motions or the atom in paragraph or statement of 34 this three-dimensional speed displacement positive in the material system was identified as mass the atomic mass expressed in terms of atomic weight the unit of which is half the rotational Mass corresponding to the atomic number the rotational mass of an atom of atomic number n is thus 2N atomic weight units all right okay one more here number 94 when physical quantities are resolved into component quality quantities of a fundamental nature these component quantities are called dimensions since we postulate that the physical universe is composed entirely of units of motion a relation between space and time the dimensions of all physical quantities in this sense of the term can be expressed in terms of space and time only from statement 34 the three-dimensional gravitational motion of the atoms of matter has the dimensions of s to the third power space to the third power over time to the third power where s and t are space and time respectively okay um we&#x27;ll get into more of this next time um but he&#x27;s really kind of saying that gravitation gravitational motion of the matter as the dimensions of S3 S to the third power over t to the third power okay um now again just hold your head up and stick with it uh this is um you know kind of introductory material and it&#x27;s a little more than a little confusing but we&#x27;re really just trying to pin down Larson&#x27;s thought process as he goes through this and just how how the system was created in the first place we will kind of clarify all this stuff as we move through it more slowly um but we&#x27;re just trying to kind of lay the foundation here for anybody who wants to kind of like cross check and see where everything is coming from and uh so stick with it stay tuned uh and we&#x27;ll resume here with number 95 tomorrow have a good day</p>
