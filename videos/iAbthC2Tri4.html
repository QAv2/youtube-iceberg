            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What&#x27;s up everybody? Going to do a late night stream here on some of this new UFO news. Jock Valle comes out and says that we are now in contact with aliens and there&#x27;s there&#x27;s government agencies that are involved in a special secret program. Been around for I think he says 20 years. We&#x27;ll watch the clip here in a minute about how they&#x27;re actually contacting these entities. You know, not surprised.</p>
<p>This is the way of how things are going. The government&#x27;s coming out and saying this on a regular basis. We&#x27;ll watch a few clips um other government officials who come out and say same exact thing as well as this video clip where Kevin Latty, a guy who has talked and worked with um Lou Alzando who was working within the Pentagon said that he was being continually stopped, not this guy but Lou was for looking into UFOs because he was being continually told that these things were demonic. Demonic is probably not the best word. fallen angels, evil principalities, powers, spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the evil that that&#x27;s going on here with this whole manifestation in the sky. And Jock Valet just says, &quot;Yeah, there&#x27;s this program where they&#x27;ve been trying to actually contact and communicate with these things and they have made contact.&quot; There there are cases that I know uh where there were this happened in government facilities but nobody&#x27;s talking about that. So I suspect that that&#x27;s true based on the people I&#x27;ve met but uh they were not the people who are running the program so I cannot be completely sure but what they described to me is a very sophisticated process by which we may be able to interact with the entities. Those are not the antities that are described um at Trinity in in uh in you know in uh in in my book. Um &gt;&gt; so he said there in case you missed it that he that they have been able to contact the entities.</p>
<p>Good word for it because that&#x27;s [clears throat] probably the better word that these things are evil entities. That&#x27;s exactly what they are. What&#x27;s up Salta Paul Carefree Matt [clears throat] Junkie for Jesus. C dog truly, God bless you guys. Yeah, extradimensional.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re demons. They&#x27;re fallen angels. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re evil. You know, Ephesians 6:12 is exactly the best description uh from the Christian viewpoint that we have that we should be giving to describe what this whole phenomenon is. And we&#x27;ll see other video clips here in just a moment that that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s going on here.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re not wrestling against flesh and blood, these things with nuts and bolts, crafts, great guys from other planets. We&#x27;re messing with spiritual hosts of wickedness, principalities against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of the sage, and spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. There&#x27;s so many verses, and I know we say that one, I say that one a lot, but it&#x27;s really important because that&#x27;s exactly the description that it is spiritual forces at work in the world that that&#x27;s going on with all of this. And uh that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s playing into the massive um in governments around the world and in every single thing that we&#x27;re talking about today because as we go to move and to fulfill end times Bible prophecy, these deceptive forces are going to be at work in the world. Luke 21:11, Jesus says there&#x27;s going to be fearful sights in the heavens, men&#x27;s hearts failing them for the fear of the expectation of these things coming on the earth.</p>
<p>So yeah, probably these things are going to play a role in that one way or another in so many different possibilities. So, we&#x27;re we&#x27;re I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to continue to expose them. They used to deceive me, so I&#x27;m going to expose them since Jesus saved me from that deception. I&#x27;m going to just continue to expose them uh for all my days till we continue on in the future. &gt;&gt; Uh Lord willing &gt;&gt; with Pa Harris.</p>
<p>Uh they are not the entities that were uh caught in um that that are, you know, in that documentary. um they are they may be the controllers they may be the higher level entity and they if if what I&#x27;m told is true the communication with them is very sophisticated and it&#x27;s complex. So yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean that&#x27;s what the same thing that we&#x27;re seeing and I&#x27;m going to do a full length probably on my main channel expose I guess you could say exposing all this whole thing about how [clears throat] you know I&#x27;ve been trying to expose on this channel quite a bit recently this whole demonic uh summoning of UFOs which is what so many people are now doing and it&#x27;s like a common thing now like among so many different groups and not only just they&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re doing it there&#x27;s completely legit legitimate proof that this is going on.</p>
<p>I found a few more videos I want to expose in regards to that and just kind of expose the whole thing cuz these guys are going out and summoning. I mean, up until this phenomenon and even now, you&#x27;d have to just not be paying attention. But up until this phenomenon, this whole demonic summoning of these UFOs, up until this very day, all throughout history, if you ask somebody, &quot;What is summoning? What is summoning these things? What is that?&quot; It&#x27;s always attributed with the supernatural paranormal type of event of like a wizard or a sorcerer summoning some type of thing. So yeah, how do you summon a UFO? You know, these guys who say they or not only they say they can, they are they&#x27;re summoning UFOs, physical entities from another planet. Skywatch team says they can actually take control of these entities crafts and these ships and uh how come these guys don&#x27;t summon their family for for Christmas, right? I mean, if they can summon some being and some flying craft with the resources and everything it took for them to come through space and to fold space to come here and fly around their craft here, why don&#x27;t they just summon their family to Christmas? What? You can only summon the lights in the sky? How come you can&#x27;t land them? They There&#x27;s like one video out there they say, &quot;Oh, we landed.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s&quot; It&#x27;s like the worst video you could ever imagine. There&#x27;s a lot of deception going on within that skywatch team. I think that Jake Barber guy actually lied about his um special operations that egg green egg UFO thing. I&#x27;m pretty sure that ended up being fake, too. So, it&#x27;s like or or deceptive or something.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s so many deceptions. It&#x27;s just crazy. Isn&#x27;t it insane how many deceptions there are right now? And I mean, so many of these people, even a lot of people who I respected even as journalists and stuff right now, it&#x27;s like, why are all these people who are supposedly like great journalists exposing like the news that no one&#x27;s talking about? No one&#x27;s talking about these uh these things. And not to get off totally off subject, but this whole Somalia thing, you look at the whole page and no one&#x27;s talking about it&#x27;s like the biggest news story in America and these guys who are journalists. I mean, if your favorite journalist has not mentioned that, I would highly question that they could be being paid and funded by someone else where it makes no sense.</p>
<p>[snorts] Okay, not to get off subject here. Let&#x27;s listen to the rest of uh Jock Valet here, then get into a couple more clips regarding this. maybe a group that I would respect that has access to that. And this was from years ago, by the way. I mean, that report of of that that particular interaction was more than 20 years in a in a lab somewhere in controlled conditions.</p>
<p>If that &gt;&gt; so 20 years ago in a lab, controlled conditions, contacting an entity, you know, they&#x27;re doing it they&#x27;re doing it much more different than that obviously now. Now that people are learning that this is a spiritual thing, that&#x27;s why so many people are um actually going out and doing it. Like the Skywatch team who Jake Barber, the guy in News Nation with the Green Egg UFO, he was one of he&#x27;s on Skywatch. Same with um [clears throat] I can&#x27;t even think of the guy&#x27;s name. Uh Steven Greer.</p>
<p>Steven Greer is one of the first guys kind of coming out and saying that. And even the channel that this is on that we&#x27;re watching this clip from. I mean, this is from Weaponized Podcast, but this is unvetted. And you know, I I feel bad for actually some of these guys because they don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re they&#x27;re full on into a massive deception. He&#x27;s out trying to summon.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s posting a a video psionics trying to summon UFOs. Not only trying, they&#x27;re doing it. But yeah, uh Christian Crusader, the Skywatch team with Jake Barber and stuff, Jake Barber came out and said on News Nation 100% through meditation that they&#x27;re able to summon UFO and control the craft through meditation. So I mean kind of hard extremely hard as Christians to not understand uh how people are not seeing that this is a spiritual connection that&#x27;s being made with the manifestation in the sky and this thing is moving around and being controlled by that through an agreement made between the person and this thing. It&#x27;s a paranormal experience.</p>
<p>And yeah, Solid Paul for sure they should be summoning God and Jesus and his spirit. That&#x27;s the only spirituality people should be messing around with, man. For real. People are get mixing themselves up in this stuff and they don&#x27;t realize this is like evil forces just like yeah in the heavenly places spiritual host of wickedness of this age people are making a big mistake messing with this stuff &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s true &gt;&gt; Jesus is the only way to be free from this and the only true spirituality in the entire world everything else is a demonic lie &gt;&gt; then uh there is a process ongoing where we may be able to acquire information at a very sophisticated level. And that would be, you know, that could be a reason for stalling quote disclosure until there can be a a rational way uh that we&#x27;re not confronted with something so uh overpowering that it would destroy our culture and our society.</p>
<p>I mean, we have enough to deal with with AI these days, which is, you know, a foreign entity potentially. Um, so there you go. That maybe they&#x27;re stalling. Maybe they&#x27;re stalling with disclosure because they don&#x27;t want to destroy our society. Makes a lot of sense when we know the prophecies that are coming.</p>
<p>Huge deceptions, world takeover, Antichrist leader, somehow peace has achieved in the Middle East. How in the world are we going to get peace in the Middle East? I mean, if an alien landed and tried to show videos of, &quot;Oh, we created all the religions and there&#x27;s some truth and you have your connections, but we&#x27;re all just one big family and we all get along. Here&#x27;s the peace treaty. Just sign the peace treaty. Everything is acceptable and okay, except believing Jesus is the son of God and the Bible is the only way and Jesus is the only way to God.&quot; If you believe that, then the rest of Revelation is will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Eventually, people will be beheaded for rejecting the beast and his mark. I mean, he&#x27;ll probably actually more come out of the Roman Empire when you look at what Bible prophecy is. And there&#x27;s probably a connection to the Vatican. Hard to not make that connection, but you know, there are supernatural forces, signs and wonders, calling down fire, the false prophet, signs and wonders. This will probably be a human thing, but uh to not watch this whole thing going on with with the lights and everything and see that there&#x27;s, you know, spiritual forces at work in all this.</p>
<p>I mean, for sure that&#x27;s this is um it&#x27;s for sure a spiritual deception. These lights in the sky 100%. Whether they play into end times prophecy, no one knows, but we should definitely keep it on the table so we&#x27;re not deceived if that happens. Here&#x27;s another government official. Well, Jack Jo is not a government official.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s worked closely with them. But here&#x27;s a government official in the United States saying, &quot;Uh, well, just let him say it for himself.&quot; &gt;&gt; Um, I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve spoken to people who um who the intelligence community has a level of credible belief that they that they have the ability to talk to like mentally talk to um some some kind of entities. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the big thing right now. And again, as Christians, people should really see that. It&#x27;s like they it&#x27;s a mental thing.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a meditation. It&#x27;s frequencies. It&#x27;s all new age spirituality. That&#x27;s how they contact. It&#x27;s a mental thing.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like a connection you make with this spiritual force and that&#x27;s how these things are showing up. It&#x27;s spiritual. It&#x27;s not physical. You think that other physical beings from another planet will just drop everything they&#x27;re doing at the drop of a hat cuz a human being is meditating out in a field. I mean, that is just like that&#x27;s like just almost like prideful and arrogant.</p>
<p>Like to a degree that&#x27;s just crazy. like you are not like that&#x27;s like almost like leveling yourself up to like a god status like you can summon these things from other planets like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s prideful and when they and as they do it and it happens where does it lead it&#x27;s not leading them to Jesus I&#x27;ll tell you that spiritual dark spiritual evil spirituality that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a that was a conversation in my office that I&#x27;ll never forget I&#x27;m not saying that I believe everybody that I talk to but what I what I do believe is the people that come forward forward and the people that I do talk to, they believe what they&#x27;ve experienced. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, it&#x27;s true. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening.</p>
<p>These uh there&#x27;s a lot of this interdimensional thing coming right into our reality full on with with this stuff. Did one uh this was in the thumbnail. Interesting. Again, all the time now with how many people have good cameras now, we&#x27;re getting legitimate legitimate UFOs like this one here flying over NATO military installations. Shines bright.</p>
<p>right before vanishing. I mean, this was posted yesterday. Pretty sure. Not sure if it&#x27;s actually from yesterday or not, but it it&#x27;s a legitimate one. This is how they often appear really.</p>
<p>I mean, this is after experiencing them so many times for years, knowing that the spiritual deception after becoming saved in these things, leaving me alone. Finally, I feel like I have a decent eye for it. And you can kind of tell the difference between AI and this stuff, but it&#x27;s almost always they appear as like this star looking thing in the sky and then they just kind of fly around. They appear, they disappear. When you start to get into like the TR3B stuff, I mean, there&#x27;s literally US patents for the triangle craft with the lights on each corner.</p>
<p>That patent&#x27;s been around for for years now. [cough and clears throat] So, you know, but this is the most common one that I would say that we see. And this is for sure the type of one that I always saw 100%. [clears throat and cough] Thanks. Thank you for the super chat.</p>
<p>[clears throat] Order to be accepted by Jews. Apparently from the house of David prophecy of the savior come out as Jews. Not Yeah, really [clears throat] appreciate the super chat, man. Thank you so much. Um, sorry my thing kind of closes the Can&#x27;t always see the name.</p>
<p>I see. I think it&#x27;s Curtis. Yeah, Curtis. God bless, man. Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I believe I do believe, you know, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s verses in the in all of the prophecy that make it sound like he&#x27;s coming from the revived Roman Empire is the terminology that Christians use today. And that makes a lot of sense when you look at some of the prophecies in Daniel. Uh but either the false prophet or the antichrist will probably one way or another have to be somehow connected to to Israel for sure because just as you mentioned you know and just like the prophecy says you know it says that Jesus says that another will come in his own name and him you will accept they rejected Jesus another&#x27;s going to come in his own name so who is who will that be exactly well we don&#x27;t know But then the fact that he signs a peace treaty with Israel in the Middle East, I mean, says a huge deal that he&#x27;s, you know, a major player, almost certainly not Muslim. That&#x27;s when you start to think about, but there&#x27;s so many people involved here. So many different people when you look at the Christians, the Muslims, the Jews.</p>
<p>I mean, this we&#x27;re talking about billions of people here that are going to play into this. But it is definitely mainly focused on Jerusalem. So, uh, I think there&#x27;s definitely a high likelihood that he will somehow be connected to that. How they&#x27;ll prove he&#x27;s from David, the house of David, hard to know. Hard to know how the they get around a lot of stuff with the Talma teachings cuz the Talm is just like, you know, like a blog practically of rabbis talking through the years, like a little journal of that.</p>
<p>And they get around a lot of stuff with like, oh yeah, the Torah says this, but in the Talm they d. So, you know, [cough] they denied Jesus. They weren&#x27;t the savior to like So, I&#x27;m going to let this play. They were expecting a warrior king. Yeah.</p>
<p>No, they definitely missed the mark on Jesus. 100%. 100%. [clears throat and cough] What&#x27;s up, B-Rack? God bless, man. Yeah.</p>
<p>And we pray that many of them will have their eyes open. We pray that the prophecy will be true and the word will be true in Zechariah that they&#x27;ll look on, you know, and mourn for for the Christ, for Jesus as one mourns for his only son. But in the process of that, there&#x27;s for sure going to be a lot of people who are led astray. A lot of people who will not be entering into the kingdom of heaven because they decided to reject the Lord Jesus Christ. The salvation will be taken.</p>
<p>the salvation that was offered to them. You know, God sent his son, the vineyard will be taken from them and given to someone else. And the parable of how Jesus used the parable of the vineyard and [snorts] the vine dressers and thank God for that because their eyes were hardened so we could get salvation. Romans 11 kind of a lot what I ended on the stream on my main channel on last night. So, let&#x27;s see this uh video here.</p>
<p>This is u Kevin Zade. Sorry, not sure exactly who he is, but he says he worked at the Lou Alzando, a big guy who like works with the Pentagon, worked with these Pentagon Pentagon UAP programs and stuff, and said that a lot of their the work that was being done, a lot of the what was going on in the Pentagon was being said that these things were evil forces. It was like a pretty widely known fact. So, one thing that Lu Alzando told me, and that he&#x27;s told this to other people, and he said it in the show Unidentified, one of the biggest things, surprisingly, that he ran into with opposition within the Pentagon, within the Defense Department to the work that he was doing, is that there was a very large contingent of people that believed that this was a demonic force, as in demons, that and that we shouldn&#x27;t be doing it. We shouldn&#x27;t be investigating it.</p>
<p>We shouldn&#x27;t be poking the tiger in the eye. And that that was [music] not just a little voice in the Pentagon. This was a huge group of people. Wait, they thought the phenomenon that was being witnessed was demons? &gt;&gt; Yes. Within the military establishment, within the Pentagon, within DoD, there was a large number of people that opposed his work because they thought from a very very fundamentalist [music] viewpoint, they were dealing with demonic activity and that it actually affected his ability to move forward and get funding.</p>
<p>It was it was one of the biggest oppositions that he said he ran into. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, that&#x27;s why this whole possibility of like an alien savior, alien messiah thing could be a possibility. It could it could initiate the systems. You know, the 10 kings of the world give their power over to the antichrist.</p>
<p>I mean, again, it makes the most sense. I mean, we know at least the antichrist is the number of a man and uh his name and number are 666 and that&#x27;s what his mark is, physical mark on the on the right hand or on the forehead. But with the false prophet and then like these spirits of the that go out and they look like frogs similar to what we think aliens look like. They go out to gather the kings of the earth for the battle of Armageddon. There&#x27;s just so many spiritual and supernatural things that are going to be going on in the end times.</p>
<p>Whether we can even spiritually whether we can see everything or some of it is spiritual or if it&#x27;s just like these two men false prophet and antichrist have the power and there&#x27;s other forces at work. uh you know that could be a possibility. But I just think it&#x27;s important that we just keep all things possible and uh as a possibility so we&#x27;re not deceived. And I know that what&#x27;s going on here is for sure spiritual evil spirituality just like Ephesians 6:12 tells us. So we got to for sure always keep our our eye on that.</p>
<p>And yeah, always remember, you know, the world is looking for a savior. The the Muslims are looking for a savior. The Jews are looking for the Messiah. A lot of Christians who are just lukewarm are people who think they&#x27;re Christians and they&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re looking for something.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re not they&#x27;re not expecting Jesus. Jesus is the narrow path. The only way to heaven. Everything else is false. Literally everything else that is a teaching that leads you away from Jesus Christ is a denying of the sun.</p>
<p>Belief according to 1 John 2:22. It&#x27;s an antichrist teaching and that the only way to get to God is through Jesus Christ. That&#x27;s it. Everything else is complete copy and completely made up. Quran is copied and made up fallen angel deceptive evil antichrist teaching.</p>
<p>Hinduism is practically just worshiping the golden calf. I mean they were they really do they still even worship the calf regular calf still continued on just like from the ancient days the the false gods of the of the Canaanites and things like that. [snorts] The Jews miss the Messiah. The only true way is through the scriptures. It&#x27;s provable.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s obvious. That&#x27;s um that&#x27;s that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s going on down here. So easy to get me ranting about that when I&#x27;m trying when I&#x27;m not trying but just looking into UFOs. So sorry to get off topic there a little bit. But um so okay, we&#x27;ll see it rest of this &gt;&gt; and and he said that to me.</p>
<p>I have it. He said it on TV shows. You can find him saying it on the show Unidentified. So this is not something that I&#x27;m just making up. And then you have the other side of the spectrum where you have like Tim Burchett who is Tim Tim is a Christian man.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s a Republican. He&#x27;s a representative for the state of Tennessee. Very very salt of the earth. very, you know, conservative views. But when I sat down and interviewed him, his feeling was, you know, if you look in the Bible and you look at Ezekiel building the wheel, there&#x27;s a lot of people that think that that was a spaceship and and that&#x27;s okay.</p>
<p>And &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s not okay. That&#x27;s a huge, huge, huge, massive deception that really has to be completely cleared up. I don&#x27;t know, Tim Brucet, he comes off like a genuine dude, like a salt of the earth kind of guy from Tennessee, Christian, and he could just be tricked. I know there are Christians who are tricked by this by this understanding, but I just did a whole video on it, you know, talking about it, excuse me, on my channel, Sling and Stone about Ezekiel&#x27;s encounter. I mean, reading Ezekiel&#x27;s vision encounter and saying that&#x27;s a UFO experience is like the mo I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s for sure it&#x27;s even blasphemous really if you really I mean it&#x27;s hard to imagine how someone could really read that.</p>
<p>That would just be basic. I mean, that&#x27;s like just listening to, you know, Billy Carson say something like that and then not actually reading it and seeing it for what it says. If you read Ezekiel&#x27;s vision, extremely obvious Ezekiel just had an encounter of witnessing Jesus on his throne in the Old Testament and that the ofenim and the angels and the fire and all this stuff are just supernatural holy forces and creatures and entities and things that are surrounding God on his throne all the time. This is not a UFO from outer space. I mean to be a Christian and believe that I I would even say and I mean I mean God is gracious thank God to us all in our ignorance on things and he he won&#x27;t necessarily hold us against that if we&#x27;re truly just blinded by something that we don&#x27;t even see.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s obvious. It is so obvious. It&#x27;s a throne room vision encounter. It&#x27;s not a UFO. That&#x27;s truly it really is bordering blasphemy in my opinion.</p>
<p>[clears throat] don&#x27;t we should not be calling it that at all. [cough] &gt;&gt; So, you know, there&#x27;s another wing of of Christianity that is okay with the idea. The Pope, you know, the Catholic Church came out a few years ago and said there&#x27;s probably life on other planets. It&#x27;s okay. It It does.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wait, I didn&#x27;t even know that. I should know that. &gt;&gt; No, they made an official proclamation. &gt;&gt; All right, going to cut it off there. That&#x27;s about it cuz guy cusses and I can&#x27;t really blink it out.</p>
<p>Um, yeah, the Cath the Catholic Church has come out and even said that they would baptize aliens if aliens came and landed. Not sure what God would think of that, you know, even if these there&#x27;s these intelligent beings, you know, Jesus died for humankind. He&#x27;s we&#x27;re made in the image of God. That&#x27;s why it just doesn&#x27;t none of it fits in with the whole thing. None of it fits in with uh with any any of that stuff with with the Bible with any of the Bible.</p>
<p>Genesis to Revelation, these gray things from other planets that are more intelligent than us, smarter than us, and have dominion that over us just do not fit in with anything with the Bible at all. Uh it really just does not [clears throat] almost positive that it says the eyes look into the past, present, and future too. It&#x27;s just blasphemy. Like when they try to say aliens tell them that Jesus was also an alien. Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>Totally totally wrong. And that&#x27;s why so many, you know, of the newagers are obsessed with this. And it really is, you see them all the time. They astral project. They talk try to talk through Michael the Archangel.</p>
<p>They contact Jesus. You know, they believe Jesus is an ascended master, but just similar to like Islam pretty much. He&#x27;s just like, &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s such an amazing prophet, but he&#x27;s not the only way.&quot; We could see that type of Christianity in this system of deception coming in the world where um where people are like yeah you can believe that Jesus but you have but denying but uh if you believe Jesus is the only way the son of God then no that won&#x27;t be allowed that will not be allowed in the coming system. Yeah. Yeah, I don&#x27;t know Christian crusader exactly how to answer the 144,000, but I know that uh they&#x27;re from the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>So it, you know, to me that sounds like really 144,000 Jewish people who finally realize Jesus is the Messiah, give their life over, and they they are here for that whole part of either the great tribulation or the wrath of God. They&#x27;re protected with the seal of God and going out and probably trying to save as many people as possible. during the time frame literally in the last months of Earth. [snorts] And they&#x27;re from the 12 tribes of Israel. So maybe that&#x27;s the ones who wake up and see and accept Jesus as the Messiah.</p>
<p>They could even be alive today. Interesting. Interesting stuff. We&#x27;ll end off uh we&#x27;ll end off on this video here. Uh this this woman, she researches UFO stuff in in relation to religion.</p>
<p>Can&#x27;t think of her name at the moment. Maybe you guys know, doesn&#x27;t say here. Uh can&#x27;t it might come to me, but she&#x27;s talking about an experience she had with Jock Valet, the guy who in the beginning was saying, &quot;We have contact now with fallen with with these fallen entities.&quot; He didn&#x27;t say that, but with these aliens, which are, you know, demons, fallen angels, principalities, powers, they&#x27;re contacting them. They have been even 20 years ago in secret lab tests. And I just found this interesting uh in relation to all this &gt;&gt; fallen angel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was pretty shocked when I had when I went. I was we were going to have lunch and talk about the crash site and maybe talk about, you know, what I learned from Tyler and that kind of thing. And we went to lunch and then he said, &quot;Do you want to see the library?&quot; And I was like, &quot;Yes, of course.&quot; So, I saw the handwritten documents from Project Blue Book. Um, and that was just going into the library.</p>
<p>That wasn&#x27;t actually in the library. Then when we got in there, um, I noticed a big bookcases of these books. And of course I was drawn to them. And he said he picked out one and he opened it and it was about angels. And he said, &quot;This is the, you know, this is a book about angels.&quot; And I could see that and I was looking at I was wow.</p>
<p>And then I looked at the other bookshelf and that bookshelf was just as impressive. And then it was about fallen angels. He said, &quot;Oh, this one&#x27;s about fallen angels.&quot; And then he made a joke and he said, &quot;You can&#x27;t have one without the other.&quot; And I thought that Yeah, I thought that was really interesting. &gt;&gt; Fallen angels. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>We there could have been there could have been God gave everyone a chance. He gave us all an opportunity. He gave humans an opportunity. He gave angels an opportunity. Lucifer, you know, I mean, Lucifer had one of the highest ranking positions in heaven.</p>
<p>He closeness very close to God. Probably involved with the music according to some verses in reference to that we that we&#x27;ve that we know about him. High ranking close to God. He gave everybody a chance and they decided to turn to sin, to fall away. That&#x27;s why they came to the earth.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why humans sinned, fell away. That&#x27;s why the love story of God is just so amazing. It&#x27;s a story beyond even comprehension. And you can really see that when you read the Bible and you study the other religious texts around the world. None of them are similar in any way to the Bible at all.</p>
<p>You have this false claim that like this the story of Jesus is a copied story all throughout the years. Steven Bancars did probably the best job of anyone I&#x27;ve ever seen exposing that lie that Jesus is like just a copy of pagan myths of the past. Complete lie 100%. And not only that, but when you read these stories, you read stuff like whatever like uh one of them was Mithra was born from a rock or something like that. There there&#x27;s nothing in comparison to that to that.</p>
<p>and reading the story of Jesus, what the people said, the kings who came here, the history of the kings, Herod and the c, you know, the the stories of Herod sending people to try to take out the children in Bethlehem, all this stuff. And then even when you just read the words of Jesus, you can tell when it&#x27;s in a narration, and even that is amazing. The word of God still very powerful. But when you read the red letter words of Jesus, you&#x27;re reading the words of Jesus. It&#x27;s very clear to see and feel the difference between these two things when you&#x27;re reading the text.</p>
<p>And like even just the verse, one of my favorite verses when Jesus responds to the Jews who were questioning him at the time of his relationship and his power and how he said he was one with the father and Jesus said, &quot;Uh, you know, Abraham loved to see my day. If you followed Abraham, you would be happy that I&#x27;m here.&quot; And then they said, &quot;Oh, what? you you&#x27;re not even 50 years old and you&#x27;ve seen Abraham and Jesus says before Abraham was I am again reaffirming his connection being one with the father because God said to Moses I am who I am. This led the Jews to want to try to stone him. But I mean no human being could think of that before before Abraham was I am calling back all the way. And you see the map, I&#x27;m sure you guys have all seen it.</p>
<p>The like the rainbow looking thing of all the relations from one chapter to another chapter in the Bible and it looks like a huge colorful rainbow. I mean, the complexity of the Bible in the thousands of years, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the only truth. Everything else is false. Every other religion is 100% false. and um you know everything going on with um everything [clears throat] going on with this whole phenomenon and the world and all of this it&#x27;s the same thing we&#x27;re we&#x27;re just we&#x27;re in we&#x27;re moving towards the end times kind of hard to not imagine that we&#x27;re seeing all this stuff unfold we&#x27;re seeing that this is you know the way things are going manifestations all the time the love of many growing cold wars and rumors of wars nations gathering against Israel.</p>
<p>I mean, all of the prophecies are coming to pass. We just have a few left. God is gracious to to be very gracious to let so many people go on in their sin and their rebellion and their blasphemy, to give even human beings the breath in their lungs for them to even blasphe him every single day and to sin against him. He&#x27;s extremely gracious in his love to bring as many people to him as possible through Jesus Christ his son and believing in him as Lord. And so, I hope everybody listening has done that.</p>
<p>that if you haven&#x27;t, Jesus is the truth. Trust trust the Bible. Read it. Read the prophecy. I like New King James Version.</p>
<p>King James is very hard to read. If you haven&#x27;t read the Bible, read the New King James Version or these modern English versions because, you know, I&#x27;m definitely not a King James version person only. They&#x27;re hard to read. It&#x27;s hard to read. And I know some a lot of people have messaged me and said it&#x27;s just like impossible for them to read.</p>
<p>They have to read the modern version. I&#x27;m like that, too. But man, read it. Read the New Testament. Start in the New Testament, the Gospels, all of it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#x27;ll change your life. Jesus is the only way. He&#x27;s the son of God. He&#x27;s Lord of Lords and King of Kings. And I hope you guys will do that if you have not.</p>
<p>Thank you guys for stopping on. I&#x27;m going to end the stream here. Uh, appreciate you, man, in New Zealand. Stay safe there. God bless you.</p>
<p>Hope you&#x27;re well. Thank you guys all for being here. [clears throat] Yep. God knows. God knows.</p>
<p>God bless, guys. Thanks for the super chat again, Curtis. Really appreciate it. And again, just thank you guys all for being here. And Jesus has the only power against these dark forces, which is again in relation to this whole thing is uh when you when you call when you call Jesus on these or when you give your life to Jesus, these forces stop harassing you.</p>
<p>No coincidence either. No coincidence at all. God bless guys. Thanks for reading now. God bless you all.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>
