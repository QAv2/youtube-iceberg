            <p>hey guys welcome to Falcon space today we&#x27;re doing our first experiment inside the Faraday cage we&#x27;re doing a simple charge up of the capacitor to see if there&#x27;s any movement we don&#x27;t expect much to happen but we just want to see what happens [Music] I&#x27;m seeing activity we&#x27;ve got motion got a considerable amount of motion on the wires we&#x27;ve got an over flash what you go up to there you go learn what expected what are you right now alright another flash again we&#x27;re getting rotational motion on the unit it&#x27;s looking to me like I am in effect but I could be wrong you got another flash over are you recording the voltages 50,000 volts okay okay alright alright we&#x27;re getting a continuous flasher where I dropped the voltage to 35 okay there&#x27;s any flashover now we may have carbonization on some of the materials yep okay I&#x27;m seeing activity I&#x27;m not seeing any flashover what do you at [Music] what&#x27;s the voltage you&#x27;re setting it now that we could go up to 50 hmm you said it went up to 50 again I thought you were reducing the voltage yep okay we&#x27;re definitely getting forward motions more than I would expect from analytic air air flow on a mass of this size yeah we got a considerable amount of forward motion more than I would expect for it for an ionic breeze on a massive this week we&#x27;ve been about a kilogram of mass up there a lot a lot now that said charge effects can create those types of things and we might be getting a an effect on the wire if the wire is contracting due to an electromagnetic effect but this is such a fine wire I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to have the tensile strength to move it like that and also the also the currents that we&#x27;re doing extremely well yeah plumbing</p>
