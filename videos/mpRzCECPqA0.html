            <p>[Music] touching northwest [Music] approved. Top 10 secrets and mysteries. History is full of inventions and discoveries that caused a sensation at the time only to disappear a few years later. However revolutionary their potential temperature in every age there have been inventors whose battles with bureaucracy and the vested interests of giant corporations and self-seeking politicians were like Cephus pushing his boulder repeatedly up the hill doomed to fail. One advantage of living in the age of it, however, is that now we can save these apparently forgotten or discredited discoveries from vanishing forever.</p>
<p>Suppressed inventions 10. Project Warden Cliff. Project Warden Cliff, an experiment as enigmatic as it was controversial, started off as a cooperation between two of the best known celebrities of business and science of the time. On the science side was the brilliant physicist Nicola Tesla. On the business side, the powerful banker JP Morgan.</p>
<p>The monumental Warden Cliff Tower was to be the culmination of Tesla&#x27;s efforts in the field of wireless energy transmission. [Music] JP Morgan invested $150,000 in the construction of the tower, which was designed to transmit signals across the Atlantic. But as we know from Tesla&#x27;s correspondence, that wasn&#x27;t nearly enough, and he knew it. A more realistic sum would have been $1 million. So why did he accept Morgan&#x27;s offer and start building his tower regardless? As in his previous project in Colorado Springs, Tesla wanted to build a station that would be capable of harnessing large amounts of energy from the air and pump it into the ground.</p>
<p>The mushroom-shaped tower was 60 m tall, and the steel dome at the top weighed a staggering 55 tons. A huge shaft 40 m deep was dug underneath it where 16 metal tubes arranged in a star shape were installed 100 m below the top of the tower. A structure of such size and presumed output also needed a new power plant in its vicinity and that is where Tesla got a hard no from Morgan. [Music] One of the reasons he withdrew his backing was the success of Marone&#x27;s wireless radio and as the shrewd Morgan preferred certainty of a risk he invested in Maronei instead. Tesla looked for other backers but to no avail.</p>
<p>Tesla&#x27;s theories were based on the assumption that the earth carries an electrical charge which could be harnessed to facilitate energy transmission. By setting up a whole network of towers like Warden Cliff, Esler hoped to attain his dream of providing free energy for everyone. Of course, the idea of free energy was not terribly appealing to the big energy corporations. Why should they provide the masses with free energy when they could keep charging them for it as long as they liked? But who knows, perhaps Tesla&#x27;s genius and vision will still be appreciated by some future generation. The Warden Cliff Tower was demolished in 1917.</p>
<p>Over a 100 years later, its original location was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Nine. The suppression of UFO Technologies. One of the most frequently discussed aspects of UFO investigations and alleged contacts with extraterrestrial civilizations is the possibility of using alien technology. If these technologies were really available to humans, there&#x27;s no doubt they would be much more advanced than the most advanced technology developed by man.</p>
<p>It also goes without saying that any such technology would be highly desirable to any military superpower. It&#x27;s no secret that any information connected with UFO sightings or with attempts or information about attempts to contact extraterrestrial intelligence is strictly classified. This led some to speculate that some sort of agreement was reached between our political leaders and the alien visitors. Governments therefore turn a blind eye on the occasional abduction by UFOs and ignore the testimonies of those who claim to have been abducted in return for which they receive technical specifications that our own species might not discover till hundreds of years from now. There&#x27;s even some evidence for this hypothesis, such as the sightings of military prototype aircraft invisible to conventional radar systems.</p>
<p>In August 1989, Chris Gibson, a British flight expert, witnessed an overhead flight of two F-111 jets and one refueling plane in the company of an unidentified triangle-shaped aircraft not resembling anything terrestrial. The event took place over the GSF Galveastston Key oil rig in the North Sea. In the following years, there were also reports of triangular planes similar to the B2 Spirit being tested in the famous Area 51. Some of the prototypes observed seem to be capable of maneuvering in a way not possible for stealth type aircraft. There is evidence of planes hovering or hanging in the air without moving, then suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds.</p>
<p>We can only speculate about information that&#x27;s denied to the general public, be it about military tests or secret army bases. The question is whether the strange planes that random witnesses have observed in the sky were created or piloted by man. Eight. Meer&#x27;s water powered car. In scientific circles, the name Stanley Mer arouses secret admiration and open disdain in more or less equal measure.</p>
<p>What everyone agrees on, however, is that this man sparked a violent debate in the energy sector between those seeking the cheapest possible energy and those in pursuit of the biggest possible profit. What was it that Mia discovered? Standard chemistry textbooks tell us that water can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by using electricity, but that the process requires more energy than can be retrieved. Maya found out, however, that when water is influenced by its own molecular frequency using the system he invented, it can be broken down with only a very small electrical charge. The result is a significant energy gain. And we have calculated that if we take the dune buggy from Los Angeles to New York, we would roughly use 22 gallons of water.</p>
<p>Ma&#x27;s water fuel cell was subjected to tests by an independent patent revision board. The commission of scientists was convinced that Ma&#x27;s apparatus was capable of breaking down ordinary water into its constituent elements using a minimum of electrical current. Their conclusion after this first demonstration was that Stanley Alan Meyer had indeed found a way of obtaining energy from water other than hydroele electricity. Understandably, the discovery caused quite a furori in the energy industry as the prospect of massive financial losses loomed. Meer actually commissioned a prototype car and secured big investors who sensed the enormous potential of his discovery.</p>
<p>Before long, however, two of them pulled the plug on the project, calling it a colossal fraud. This was confirmed in a lawsuit that followed in 1996, during which Meer, after failing to prove that his invention worked, was ordered to return the $25,000 supplied by the investors. Undeterred, Meer continued to work on his invention until March the 21st, 1998, when he died suddenly during a meeting with two Belgian investors. The timing of his demise, needless to say, immediately attracted the attention of conspiracy theorists who claimed that just before he died, Mia cried out, &quot;They&#x27;ve poisoned me.&quot; The official autopsy, however, showed that Mia died of a brain aneurysm. All Meer&#x27;s patents are now in the public domain and can be used by anyone for free.</p>
<p>The fact that no one has yet picked up on his research, however, casts some doubt on its practical potential. Does this mean that his invention never worked and never will? Now that the automobile industry is looking in other directions, we are unlikely to know the answer anytime soon. Seven. Legally confidential inventions. Human ingenuity thinks up hundreds of new inventions every year.</p>
<p>Some never go into production because they&#x27;re impractical or simply go unnoticed. Others, whose purpose can only be guessed at, are deliberately kept secret by governments. And this is done legally through specific laws. The UK and US legal systems, for example, contain clauses permitting suppression of patents that could threaten national security or economic stability. American confidentiality legislation is covered by the invention secrecy act which was passed in 1952 at the height of nuclear bomb testing in the tense atmosphere of the cold war.</p>
<p>This raises the question whether inventions that were meant to serve humanity half a century ago could still represent a real security or economic threat today. From available analyses, it&#x27;s clear that the confidentiality law applied mainly to inventions in the field of armaments manufacture which could be discovered and stolen by the enemy as well as patents relating to the possibility of new energy sources. According to figures released by the Federation of American Scientists in 2017, this law was applied to 5,784 patents and that&#x27;s only in the United States. Understandably, the list of the patents themselves is also confidential. However, one such list was disclosed by a court order in the 1980s.</p>
<p>It included a laser tracking system, a warhead production method, an anti-raar jamming apparatus, and a type of barrier net. Clearly, it was not thought desirable for any innovations with military applications or relating to more effective energy sources to be widely available. Any inventor whose patent is placed on the list is obliged by law to maintain its confidentiality and forbidden to try to obtain a patent in another country. The patent is primarily offered to government institutions that are likely to have an interest in it. If the inventor fails to observe the conditions set by the law, he may face large fines and up to two years in prison.</p>
<p>Six cloudbuster man. One of the most controversial scientists of his time was undoubtedly the Austrian psychoanalyst Villham Reich. His field of research was so-called orgasmic energy or orone energy, which he believed could cure hitherto incurable diseases as well as control natural processes such as the weather. Although today his ideas may seem absurd, Reich was no second rate charlatan. His career started in 1919 in Vienna where he worked with Sigman Freud.</p>
<p>While Freud was undoubtedly an important influence, Reich ended up going his own way. Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, he moved to the United States. There he made his greatest discovery, Orone, a universal and omnipresent life energy. Reich believed in his discovery so strongly that he started constructing orone accumulators, special wooden cabins laced with metal through which his patients could absorb orone energy. His faith in the power of orone led, among other things, to his conviction that the accumulation of organone radiation in the atmosphere caused widespread drought.</p>
<p>So he proceeded to build his famous cloud buster. This device looked a bit like an anti-aircraft cannon with a system of pipes connecting it to a water source. Reich claimed it was capable of measuring orone energy levels and significantly altering local weather conditions. In the 1950s, Reich redirected his attention to UFO sightings. What first got Reich into trouble with the authorities, however, were his Marxist political sympathies.</p>
<p>He was placed on the federal watch list of people suspected of anti-American activities. There followed a campaign to discredit him and ban his orone energy devices. Eventually, the Food and Drug Administration put together a case against Reich that sent him to prison for 2 years and his orone cabins and publications on orone energy were destroyed or removed by legal order. On August the 23rd, 1956, six tons of books, documents, and publications, some on topics unrelated to Orone from Reich&#x27;s psychoanalysis practice, were burnt at the Gansovvort public incinerator. The event is often described as the worst example of censorship in modern American history.</p>
<p>Rich himself, meanwhile, did not live to see the end of his prison sentence. A year later, he died of heart failure. Five. Clark&#x27;s unrecognized discovery. When most people hear the name Arthur C.</p>
<p>Clark, they immediately think of his contribution to the genre of science fiction and his novel 2001 a space odyssey which he created in parallel to Stanley Kubri&#x27;s cult film of the same name. The movie was actually inspired by Clark&#x27;s short story, The Sentinel. But while the screenplay was being written, it grew into an entire novel. Clark was not only a man of literature, however. This British writer was also an inventor and a visionary.</p>
<p>His ideas of a future world were more than mere fantasy. They were the product of a solid scientific training and a keenly perceptive intelligence. It is well documented that aged barely 15, Clark was capable of building his own telescope. During the Second World War, Clark worked as a radar instructor in the British Royal Air Force. This gave him access to the most advanced technology in the field and inspired one of his most revolutionary ideas.</p>
<p>At the time, it definitely belonged in the realm of science fiction rather than science fact. In October 1945, Wireless World published his article on a system consisting of three satellites. It would provide television signals for the whole world. He correctly predicted the possible use of geostationary orbit and try to get his idea patented. And that was when he hit the stonewall of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>To secure a patent in Great Britain in those days, you had to provide two working prototypes of your invention. And this was quite obviously an impossibility for a civilian like Clark with no government backing. As he said in a New York Times interview years later, the article was written in the last year of the war at a time when it was unclear whether the world was going to see peace ever again. And I didn&#x27;t think that satellites could be launched until the end of the century. So I didn&#x27;t give the matter of a patent any thought at all.</p>
<p>He could then only watch from afar as one by one his predictions came true and in 1962 his satellite idea was put into practice. In response he published his famous article how I lost a billion dollars in my spare time. Although he was unable to patent his invention, he is known today as the inventor of the telecommunication satellite and the geostationary orbit is often referred to as Clark&#x27;s orbit. Four miracle cancer cure. Reports of alternative cures for cancer have been around for decades.</p>
<p>potent remedies of natural, chemical, or even spiritual origin that can end the suffering of millions of people every year. While mainstream medicine struggles to find effective high-tech cancer treatments, is it possible that simpler forms of medication already exist? In the 1920s, American scientist Royal Raymond Refe invented a machine which generated electromagnetic waves. According to Refe, every disease, including cancer, has its own electromagnetic frequency or EMF, and can be cured if counteracted with an identical signal, a theory often referred to as radionic. Although no conclusive evidence has supported Reich&#x27;s claim, conventional medicine has recently begun experimenting with radio frequency EMFs to treat cancer. It has been found that low-frequency EM waves do affect tumors but do not impact non-cancerous cells.</p>
<p>Could Reife&#x27;s ideas have been overlooked by the American Medical Association for almost a century? Barry Lines, an American researcher and author, believes they have and is continuing Reife&#x27;s work exposing the misconduct, fraud, and cover-ups behind his cure for cancer. But why would such a remarkable alternative treatment be kept secret from the public? Some blame big pharmaceutical companies for suppressing the cure and continuing to regard disease as a necessary source of financial gain rather than something to be fought with every available weapon. Others even go so far as to suggest that diseases such as cancer are a tool designed to keep the world&#x27;s population numbers deliberately under control. Could this be the case? And if so, who are the decision makers? The 21st century has already brought us some incredible advances in technology, medicine, and science. Is it possible that a cure for such a terrifying disease as cancer already exists and is being kept secret by a well-known pharmaceutical three project XA.</p>
<p>We all know the health risks associated with smoking. In spite of this, the number of tobacco users continues to rise with no signs of slowing down anytime soon. So, wouldn&#x27;t it make sense for a caring tobacco industry to try and create a safer product? Bizarrely, the answer is that they already have. In the 1970s, Dr. James D.</p>
<p>Mold, a scientist working for the Ligus and Meers Tobacco Company, was head of a project named XA. After 25 years of research, Mold finally came up with the XA or palladium cigarette, which drastically reduced the health risks of smoking and was a far safer product than what was currently available. But just as a product was about to be launched on the market, it was abruptly withdrawn and never reached the drugstore shelves. Why would a safer product be kept from the public? As Bold himself admitted, they felt that such a cigarette, if put on the market, would seriously indict them for having sold other types of cigarettes. Eager to hide the real level of toxicity in their products, big tobacco companies went to great lengths to suppress the idea of a safer cigarette.</p>
<p>In a later deposition, Mold said that he was forbidden by Ligot to publish his research on the subject, a life&#x27;s work up in smoke. Perhaps even more shocking are the confidential documents made available to the public in 1998, which show that not only the cigarette manufacturers, but the pharmaceutical industry, too, had been involved in blocking Dr. Mold&#x27;s project in order to safeguard their own financial interests. What ever happened to Project X A? Will it ever be made public? One day, perhaps, when the pursuit of huge profits is no longer the main focus of big corporations, we will at last reap the benefits of Dr. Mold&#x27;s achievement.</p>
<p>Two, cold fusion. Our dependence on fossil fuels is irreversibly damaging the planet&#x27;s ecosystem. Unless drastic action is taken, our very survival will be in jeopardy. Many believe there are clean, sustainable ways of producing energy that have not yet been exploited. One such technology is cold fusion, a form of nuclear reaction that can occur at room temperature.</p>
<p>In 1989, American chemists Stanley Pon and Martin Fleshman of the University of Utah reported that a quantity of anomalous or excess heat was produced in their cold fusion experiments, suggesting that a cheap and abundant form of energy could be obtained through this process. According to the two scientists, the procedure could be carried out using equipment available to any chemistry student. While these incredible results immediately attracted worldwide media attention, they were greeted with skepticism by the scientific community. So why should such thrilling news be received with suspicion and disbelief? Possibly because in the past there have been numerous so-called discoveries of free and inexhaustible forms of energy which in every case were debunked or remain unproven. Just as in 1951, dictator Juan Peron announced that a German scientist exiled in Argentina held the secret of nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>Or when in 1958, British scientists declared that they were very close to producing energy from seawater. Not to mention the age-old search for a perpetual motion machine. So why would two renowned world scientists at the height of their careers risk publishing false or unverified results? Both scientists maintained the integrity of the experiment, but to avoid further ridicule from the rest of the scientific community, they preferred to keep out of the spotlight. Could it also be that Pon and Fleshman&#x27;s results were purposely discredited by a well orchestrated plan devised by a fossil fuel industry that feared the idea of a new easily available energy source? Certainly, cold fusion, if it could be harnessed, would have a huge impact on the oil industry, dramatically diminishing its profits. Bon and Flechman&#x27;s conclusions continue to divide scientists to this day.</p>
<p>Some have successfully replicated their experiment. Others have tried but without convincing results. However we interpret this mysterious disparity. The fact remains that without massive energy resources to supply the needs of human civilization, the global ecosystem as we know it will eventually collapse. Could cold fusion be the silver bullet we&#x27;re looking for? One, the secret of the hundth monkey.</p>
<p>Although it is not strictly speaking an invention in the literal sense, more of a discovery and one that is often viewed with skepticism, we would also like to mention the hundth monkey in this series. Some indigenous peoples, among them the Australian Aboriges, believe in the existence of a kind of invisible envelope that surrounds and permeates everything on Earth. Scientists have been examining this idea for decades, though unfortunately it is as hard to prove scientifically as it is to disprove. The best known aspect of this inquiry is a so-called hundth monkey phenomenon. The research dates back to 1952 when a team of scientists began observing a colony of monkeys on the Japanese island of Koshima.</p>
<p>In one experiment, the scientists threw some peeled sweet potatoes in the sand. Monkeys love sweet potatoes, but obviously not covered in sand that gets between their teeth. One of the females in the group named Immo was the first to start washing the potatoes in water. Soon all her relatives acquired this skill and eventually so did the other monkeys on the island. After a while the number of ingenious monkeys reached what is called a critical mass.</p>
<p>The South African biologist Lyall Watson who later analyzed the findings of the Japanese primatologists rather arbitrarily designated this number as 100. After this number was exceeded, all monkeys became capable of washing the potatoes regardless of whether they were taught the skill or not. Monkeys from other islands also started washing their potatoes. Watson described the 30-year research project focused on the Macaka Fuscata monkey in his bestseller, Lifetime, a biology of the unconscious. In this book, he reached the conclusion that there has to be some sort of morphagenetic structure or field that envelops the islands and through which the monkeys are able to communicate.</p>
<p>Mainstream scientists express doubts about the quality of this research, calling it unscientific and thus generating even more public interest in the work of their unorthodox colleagues. [Music]</p>
