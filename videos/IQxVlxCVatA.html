            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>-TRAVIS: Oh, wow.  -We&#x27;ve been wanting to fly a pattern of drones over the triangle and the east field.  TRAVIS (over radio):  There are several drones  out of line we can see</p>
<p> from my perspective. They&#x27;re clearly out of place. Yeah, we&#x27;ve got eyes on that. I have 80 disconnected. They&#x27;re coming home.</p>
<p>Three, two, one! KALEB: We got something right there. TRAVIS: There&#x27;s a thing hovering over the launch site! PETE: So there&#x27;s a gap in the data from the triangle at the top of the mesa.</p>
<p>Somehow we&#x27;ve got to get inside the mesa.  NARRATOR:  There is a ranch  in Northern Utah.</p>
<p> It is considered the epicenter  of the strangest and most  disturbing phenomena on Earth:  animal mutilations,  bizarre UFO sightings  and unusual energies that have  proven harmful to humans.  For 20 years,  the federal government  tried to find answers</p>
<p> and failed.  Now a new team  of dedicated scientists,  researchers and experts  has taken over.  They are determined to solve</p>
<p> the mystery and reveal... ...The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch. -Pete! -Hey, Pete.</p>
<p>I want you to meet some friends of mine. -All right. -(Pete chuckling)  TRAVIS:  After our experiment</p>
<p> at the triangle last week  actually revealed that  there might be a connection  to the mesa, we invited  Pete Kelsey and his colleague,  ground-penetrating radar  expert Jan Francke to help us with a new investigation of that area.</p>
<p>Well, welcome to the ranch. Thank you. Happy to be here. TRAVIS: So, uh, Pete tells us</p>
<p>that you&#x27;ve got some interesting technology that might help us out at the mesa. Yeah, I make deep ground-penetrating radar systems and I&#x27;ve got one that I made for you guys that&#x27;s a really,</p>
<p>really small one. It can get up over some of that really rough rocks, rock face that you wouldn&#x27;t be able to drag a normal radar on. And I&#x27;ve got one</p>
<p>that&#x27;s a really deep penetrating ground-based system that looks like a snake actually. -We use this for the mining industry. -Okay.</p>
<p>JAN: What is it you&#x27;re actually expecting to see? What are you looking for here? -We&#x27;ve heard about caves inside of the mesa. -Okay. We&#x27;re actually looking for</p>
<p>also a-a structure that was impenetrable to our drilling. You know, as we went back into that mesa, we were using a directional drilling technique that should have been able to turn upward but could not,</p>
<p>we couldn&#x27;t get through that layer, so it was a dome shape there. And of course we&#x27;ll be especially interested if we see anything that looks unnatural.</p>
<p>-Absolutely. -Beneath that surface. In our ongoing efforts to find the answers behind all the strange phenomena that occur on Skinwalker Ranch, we&#x27;re now getting</p>
<p>focused back on the mesa. Oh, wow, look at that! We were all baffled one week ago  when the drone swarm  we launched over the triangle  to pinpoint an anomaly  between 300 and 5,000 feet  began malfunctioning. -Look at that one!</p>
<p>-One&#x27;s falling, one&#x27;s falling! -They&#x27;re running into each other! -THOMAS: They&#x27;re going crazy! Almost all of them are disconnected right now.  PETE:</p>
<p> What I&#x27;m going to bring up  now is the data from the terrestrial laser scanner.  TRAVIS:  And then the lidar data</p>
<p> that Pete recorded was missing a big chunk of data that somehow appeared right over that same spot where we drilled into the mesa last year,  and discovered a 400-foot-long  dome-shaped metal object. -Wow.  -A metal object made of  the same kind of material  that NASA uses to protect</p>
<p> the outside of space shuttles. So, now we&#x27;re hoping that Jan, who is a world-renowned expert in ground-penetrating radar, has the technology that can help us figure out just what&#x27;s inside the mesa and how it might be related to the strange things that keep happening</p>
<p>at the triangle. So, uh, how deep of a-a penetration can you get? Usually we get down to 200, 300 feet with this, so it&#x27;s pretty exciting.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> GPR works by sending  radio waves into the ground  that reflect off anomalies  like buried objects or voids  to reveal an image of their  shape as well as their depth. If there&#x27;s a discontinuity or a void, we definitely should</p>
<p>be able to see that. -What about metal? -(chuckles) Well, yeah, metal&#x27;s a great target for radar, so if there&#x27;s something metal there, we&#x27;d certainly</p>
<p>be able to see that as well. BRYANT: Sounds like we&#x27;ve got a lot to do. -We should probably get to it.</p>
<p>-Let&#x27;s do it. -All right, we&#x27;ll see you. Y&#x27;all just follow us down there. -Okay.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Even before we discovered  this mysterious metal object,  there were all kinds of rumors  about the mesa going back  to when Robert Bigelow  and the federal government  investigated here from  the 1990s to the early 2000s.</p>
<p>-X marks the spot, Pete. -X marks the spot.  THOMAS:  I&#x27;ve heard all kinds of  crazy stories about this mesa.</p>
<p>Spacecraft going in it, tunnels,  caverns, underground bases. What kind of mysteries lie inside? BRANDON: For decades, there have been reports of underground chambers  or tunnels beneath the mesa.</p>
<p>That may hold the key to understanding the secrets of Skinwalker Ranch. The deeper we can see into that pile of rocks, -into that mesa... -JAN: Sure.</p>
<p>Uh, the more we&#x27;re gonna understand what it is we&#x27;re messing with out here. Okay. It&#x27;ll be interesting</p>
<p>to see what&#x27;s underground. TRAVIS: So that&#x27;s the antenna? JAN: Well, it&#x27;s the entire radar. These are the antennas</p>
<p>right here, this is just a separator. It&#x27;s all fiberglass, keep it as light as possible. We can&#x27;t use carbon fiber because it&#x27;s conductive, of course.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  Jan has brought two devices that we&#x27;ll use to scan the mesa. One is a unit that Tom Winterton will actually wear  while he hikes over the area  where we drilled  against the dome-shaped</p>
<p> object last year.  And meanwhile, Jan and Kaleb  will run the other device  back and forth  on top of the mesa to see if anything else might be hidden inside there like we&#x27;ve heard about</p>
<p>in the past. Well, it looks like we&#x27;re just about set up so, uh, talk us through what you&#x27;re going to do. Okay, there&#x27;s a couple</p>
<p>of GPR systems here. So, this one here, what&#x27;s really nice about it, it&#x27;s a very long wavelength which means we&#x27;re gonna get good penetration. And because it&#x27;s handheld,</p>
<p>it gives us, uh, the ability -to get into areas that are really difficult terrain. -ERIK: Okay. So, we&#x27;re set up over here. -JAN: Yep.</p>
<p>-ERIK: We&#x27;re gonna be doing the usual data logging. We&#x27;ve got the SDR, we&#x27;ve got the, uh, Geiger counter running. -Okay.</p>
<p>-All right, man, well, let-let&#x27;s get going. Okay, sounds good.  ERIK:  With all that</p>
<p> we have going on  and to the extent possible,  I&#x27;m keeping a close eye  on the RF spectrum analyzer to see if any unusual signals show up. Are you centered on 45? -That would be 44.5 something. -Good enough.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Nearly every time we run experiments on the ranch, we detect mysterious energy spikes,  especially one  measuring 1.6 gigahertz,  which I think could be some  kind of communication signal.</p>
<p>Go ahead and turn it on. I&#x27;ve turned it on. Okay, I&#x27;ve got the transmitter and receiver -working right now. -Okay.</p>
<p>And it creates its own little website. -It&#x27;s like a little access point, so... -Okay.</p>
<p>-...even though we&#x27;re not on the Internet here, I&#x27;m gonna talk to it with my phone. Okay. And you are good...</p>
<p>...good to go. Um... Um... -Are you guys transmitting something?</p>
<p>-BRYANT: No. -No. -Hey, Erik. Travis. -Are you guys</p>
<p>transmitting anything? -Are you transmitting something? -TRAVIS: No. -ERIK: No. We&#x27;re not transmitting at all.</p>
<p>-What are you seeing? -JAN: Uh... Uh, I&#x27;ve never seen this signal before, uh... What the hell? This waveform is not supposed</p>
<p>to be happening right now. TRAVIS: Where&#x27;s it coming from? JAN: Yeah, that&#x27;s a good question. Where&#x27;s it coming from? Let&#x27;s-let&#x27;s...</p>
<p>Way back from the truck here just to be absolutely certain. Uh... Okay. Do you have a cell phone</p>
<p>on you or something? Well, I mean, I got one in my back pocket but I got it on... Yeah, let&#x27;s just take that out if you don&#x27;t mind. -Turn it off.</p>
<p>-Here, I&#x27;ll turn it off. Yeah. Okay. That ain&#x27;t it. JAN:</p>
<p>See, so that&#x27;s a normal wave- form there just for a second. -Right? -Mm-hmm, yeah, I see it, yep. But it&#x27;s freaking out.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  Jan actually built the systems  he brought out here, he understands them completely.  He is the guy for  ground-penetrating radar.</p>
<p> As soon as we got one  of his systems off the truck  and turned it on,  it was instantly detecting  a signal that Jan  had never seen before. In thousands of experiments</p>
<p>using this device, he was baffled and confused. I find that really interesting. So you&#x27;ve not seen that before? Uh, no, actually, I have not. And I tested it this morning, so...</p>
<p>I&#x27;m gonna go scroll through the spectrum analyzer over here. -You tested it this morning and it was working? -I did.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. It&#x27;s a little strange. Um, there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it. I think we&#x27;re just</p>
<p>gonna run with it and -see if we can filter it out. -Understood. When I first came on this ranch, I-I just thought, &quot;Look, there&#x27;s a lot of hype around it and I&#x27;m sure everything can be explained, right?&quot; Then weird things</p>
<p>started happening. I-I had that weird interference  that just has no simple  geological explanation. I&#x27;m gonna start recording this. -Okay, well, I&#x27;m gonna head</p>
<p>up the mesa so... -JAN: Okay. Careful.  THOMAS:  Having pulled metal</p>
<p> 400 feet inside the mesa  and now strongly suspecting  that there could&#x27;ve  actually been a cavern  that went deep into the mesa, I&#x27;m praying that the information that we get from this GPR is finally going to answer some of the questions  we have as far as what</p>
<p> was this object  we were bumping up against  with the drill last year? TRAVIS: Man, he&#x27;s up there. Look at him. What you&#x27;re gonna do for me</p>
<p>is drag this and it doesn&#x27;t have to be a straight line because we&#x27;re tracking exactly where you are -at all times, right? -Mm-hmm. And, uh, this is going</p>
<p>to be taking an image of the ground essentially. -It&#x27;s a representation of what&#x27;s in the ground. -Yep.</p>
<p>So, one&#x27;s a transmitter, one&#x27;s a receiver and it&#x27;s gonna stretch out behind you -about five, six meters. -Okay.  KALEB:</p>
<p> As Thomas is going  up the mesa there,  I&#x27;ve been tasked  with escorting Jan.  He&#x27;s got a very powerful GPR system that&#x27;s been used all over the world.</p>
<p>So, this is a very deep-penetrating radar. In fact, it&#x27;s probably the world&#x27;s deepest GPR system. I&#x27;m excited to see</p>
<p>what kind of results we get and I&#x27;m here to help him out with scanning as much as we can. All right, let&#x27;s hope the GPS works.  TRAVIS:  There are so many questions</p>
<p> I have about Skinwalker Ranch.  I want to know the answer  to so many things.  If I had to pick one  that I wanted the answer to like right now, it would be:</p>
<p>what&#x27;s inside the mesa? We&#x27;re just gonna have to see what we&#x27;ve got.  -THOMAS: Hey, guys. -TRAVIS: What&#x27;s going on, guys?  So, what you got here?  THOMAS:  I&#x27;m really interested in what you found, Jan.</p>
<p>-Absolutely. -Yeah, I can&#x27;t wait.  TRAVIS:  The day after we ran  ground-penetrating radar scans  over the spot on the mesa where we discovered the massive</p>
<p>dome-shaped metal object last year and also up on top of the ridge of the mesa, Pete Kelsey and Jan Francke joined us to present the processed data of what they had found. We&#x27;ll start off with the, uh,</p>
<p>small lightweight one. -This is the... This is my walking path? -This is your path, yes. Now, do you recall when we were out in the field we were getting</p>
<p>a lot of interference. Mm-hmm. I&#x27;ve not seen that before. The data is almost unusable. There&#x27;s just a huge amount</p>
<p>of interference in this area. Right, interference from...? -What? -Yes. What?  TRAVIS:  Usually good GPR data  looks like a slightly</p>
<p> textured surface  that might show subtle waves  that represent natural  ground features. So any stark changes or bizarre shapes that stand out  could be things that aren&#x27;t  natural like voids or objects.</p>
<p> But most of the GPR data  that Thomas got  over the drill site  was a checkered mess  of strange shapes  that didn&#x27;t make any sense. Which Jan believed were caused</p>
<p>by the mysterious interference that his device detected even before we ran his scans. So we were all at a loss as to what the interference could have been caused by. Could this signal be</p>
<p>coming from the ground? It could be coming from anywhere. We don&#x27;t know, right? It is something that&#x27;s strong enough to overwhelm the radar.  ERIK:</p>
<p> What exactly is responsible  for this interference?  I can&#x27;t help but wonder  is there something actually  within the mesa generating radio frequency signals  that could be  causing interference? THOMAS: What would be the cause of this kind of interference? Do you think it&#x27;s</p>
<p>an environmental thing? Well, the weird part is it works now. When I take it away from the ranch. That&#x27;s what</p>
<p>I was going to ask you. JAN: I know you were going to ask that. I wanted to know if we could do a control.</p>
<p>-And it sounds like you&#x27;ve already done it. -I can&#x27;t... I can&#x27;t replicate it. ERIK:</p>
<p>That is such a... That is such an interesting observation. We can actually recover a little bit of the data, literally like ten percent</p>
<p>of it, okay? -Ten percent of this data is usable. -And that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing. TRAVIS: We&#x27;ve detected a number</p>
<p>of weird frequencies and signals  during our experiments  on the ranch,  but never like the one  that interfered  with Jan&#x27;s GPR machines. And hearing that he was only able to recover ten percent of what was recorded</p>
<p>on the mesa made us all pretty nervous that we wouldn&#x27;t get any new information about just what may be buried inside there. JAN: What we can make out</p>
<p>of that remaining ten percent I&#x27;m trying to see if there are any hyperbolic shapes, or things that look like horseshoes. That would indicate that that could be a void or something discrete</p>
<p>in the ground. TRAVIS: And where do you see something like that? Well, well, there&#x27;s subtle hints of things that pop out like here.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s another one here. There&#x27;s quite a few of them that are just scattered around. So, what that tells us, uh, there&#x27;s a series of discrete anomalies.</p>
<p>These are something that&#x27;s different than rock, right?  TRAVIS:  I was amazed that the GPR data  over the area  where we&#x27;ve encountered  the dome-shaped object  showed numerous, and distinct</p>
<p> other objects or voids  that might not be natural. Now, I&#x27;m nowhere near ready to buy into the rumors that an alien base is buried in the mesa, but could there be a bunch of metal objects, or tunnels of some kind</p>
<p>in there? If so, what could they be? And who put them there? -I know you did another survey. -We did quite a few. -That&#x27;s actually got some data, right?</p>
<p>-Absolutely. -BRYANT: I would love to see that. -JAN: Right. Okay, let me switch to that.</p>
<p>In addition to the stuff that I did at the toe of the mesa, we climbed up to the top, and what I used is an even deeper penetrating radar, so this is a lower frequency and this is actually the deepest penetrating GPR in the world.</p>
<p>Wow. -JAN: It&#x27;s a very sensitive radar. -Okay. So, when we look at</p>
<p>the cross-section there, you can see where I am on the, uh, on the map at the top of the screen there and you can see where the cursor is. Okay? So, as we&#x27;re scrolling</p>
<p>along, everything&#x27;s fine and, uh, it keeps going fine until we get to... PETE: Ooh. Hello.</p>
<p>-Look at that. -JAN: Look at that. This is highly anomalous. And this is a good six, seven meters across.</p>
<p>It starts at about six, seven meters from the surface where I was and it extends down to about 40 meters which I guess about the height of the mesa. -Approximately, right? -To the base? JAN:</p>
<p>To the base. The height of the mesa. -JAN: Right, so... -Whatever this is, is as tall as the mesa.</p>
<p>JAN: Right. ERIK: What in the hell are we looking at here? This is six or seven meters across and the depth...</p>
<p>From the surface, I mean, there is a bit of surface expression but it&#x27;s about five, six meters. And we know that it&#x27;s about 120 feet deep, -maybe 20 feet wide, and at least 12 feet north and south.</p>
<p>-At least. All right? So it could be bigger. So, I can&#x27;t tell you what that is, but it is highly anomalous.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s also interesting is, you know, we did 300 meters of line, -we don&#x27;t see anything else like that. No. -You don&#x27;t see it anywhere else? So it&#x27;s coincidental</p>
<p>where your drill site is.  TRAVIS:  What in this world could Jan  have detected  with his GPR device? It was right next to where we previously detected the dome-shaped metal object and it was at least 20 feet wide by 120 feet tall.</p>
<p>Are they connected or related in some way? We have to figure out how to get inside the mesa to know for sure. I&#x27;ll tell you right now we know exactly -which boulders we need</p>
<p>to be moving out of the way. -JAN: Yep. We&#x27;ve got a map right now of where there is an anomaly and it&#x27;s only tens of feet into the mesa.</p>
<p>We should be digging, drilling, moving rocks right there to find out what that is.  ERIK:  We did horizontal drilling</p>
<p> last summer into the mesa.  Collecting strange  material fragments. Check this out.  ERIK:</p>
<p> Curious flakes of metal  from within the mesa itself.  These are materials  of unknown origin. Wow, look at all the metal.  ERIK:</p>
<p> It&#x27;s my ambition,  and all of our ambition,  to determine what  this material really is,  what it&#x27;s doing there. BRYANT: There&#x27;s no telling how much</p>
<p>of this metallic crap there is still in that hillside.  ERIK:  We have to continue searching  into the depths of the mesa. We know we&#x27;ve got a lot of iron-bearing material coming out of there with those</p>
<p>other elements, tellurium, europium... That seems artificially manufactured, -not a natural process creating it. -Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&#x27;s even been described as something -having been made in a furnace. -Yeah. ERIK:</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not natural. THOMAS: I could line up a crane company to come out and start moving those boulders off.</p>
<p>Uh, gonna have a little bit of site prep that needs to happen to get the crane back there. But I really think it would be beneficial to-to pull those boulders off and then let&#x27;s bring</p>
<p>in a drilling rig and let&#x27;s try to pierce the mesa a little bit higher. I mean, if we do that, maybe that gets us up above that hard metal disk that&#x27;s underneath.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m... I&#x27;m all for it. -Yes. -And, uh, so I mean, we got our work cut out for us and we&#x27;ve got some spots that we didn&#x27;t have before.</p>
<p>And, Jan, I really appreciate the work that you&#x27;ve done. -My pleasure. -It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. I want to get out there</p>
<p>and start throwing rocks.  TRAVIS:  Let&#x27;s go get a shovel  and pick and start. BRYANT:</p>
<p>Hey, Jake. -How are you? -Good to see you. -Good to see you. Hey, how you doing?</p>
<p>-Hey, man.  TRAVIS: A couple of days  after Jan Francke presented us with the GPR data showing numerous anomalies in the mesa near the dome-shaped metal object we discovered last year...</p>
<p>Getting ready to move some dirt.  TRAVIS: ...Thomas Winterton  brought local contractor  Jake Huffman back out to the  ranch to help prep the area for a major excavation so we can find out what could be buried in there.</p>
<p>THOMAS: So, uh, Jake and I can bring this crane in. Obviously, we&#x27;ve got to get it across the canal, so we&#x27;re just going to put a temporary little culvert in there.</p>
<p>Then we can get the crane across and start moving some rocks. The crane needs 30 feet to be able to spread its outriggers out and we need to get him as close to those rocks as possible.</p>
<p>Because we&#x27;re estimating some of these rocks are going to weigh as much as 50,000 pounds. TRAVIS: Oh, I believe it, yeah.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;re going to build a 30-foot by 30-foot pad back in there so we can get him right up next to those rocks. TRAVIS: Sounds good.</p>
<p>In order to get the giant, 175-ton crane over to where we need to lift boulders off the mesa, it&#x27;s going to be a massive project.  First, Tom and Jake will have</p>
<p> to move tons of earth to form a bridge over the canal  between the road and the mesa. Then, they have to clear and level off a good-sized pad,  where they can park  the crane close enough  to remove many</p>
<p> of the huge boulders. THOMAS: I think it&#x27;s going to take us a couple days to get the pad ready. So I think we start</p>
<p>slinging some dirt. Sounds good to me. Okay, we&#x27;ll get out of your way. THOMAS: Watch yourself.</p>
<p> ERIK:  In preparation  for our surgical  examination of the mesa,  there&#x27;s a lot of work  that needs to be done. Thomas is having to</p>
<p>put a culvert in place. -THOMAS: How does that look? -JAKE: Good to me.  BRYANT:  What we&#x27;re doing here</p>
<p> with these excavators  and this massive crane is by far the largest scale that we&#x27;ve ever done here on Skinwalker Ranch. ERIK: I&#x27;ll try to get across.  BRYANT:</p>
<p> This is a lot of work,  it involves a lot of digging,  but we need to get after it  and I&#x27;m anxious to find out  what&#x27;s inside that mesa.  It&#x27;ll hopefully help us  with some answers  as to what truly is going on,</p>
<p> on Skinwalker Ranch. BURDETTE: I&#x27;m going to take the color camera and we&#x27;re going to put it right up here. TRAVIS: I think just pull in</p>
<p>right in here. Yeah, that&#x27;ll be good, yeah. Since it was going to take several days to complete the prep work at the mesa... Hey, Burdette.</p>
<p>Everything okay? Yeah, so, who wants to operate the camera -while I tell them what to do back there? -I can do it. You want to do it?  TRAVIS: ...later that evening,  we welcomed Burdette Anderson  from a company</p>
<p> called Photron Cameras to help us with a new experiment at the triangle. Just hit the green button.  TRAVIS: He specializes in  a high-speed camera system that can shoot</p>
<p>thousands of frames per second. Everything&#x27;s talking correctly.  Our eyes basically detect  somewhere between  24 and 30 frames per second.  The advantage of using</p>
<p> a high-speed camera out here is if you have things that are moving that you&#x27;re just not quite catching,  if you&#x27;re ready for it,  you can get  a very good look at it. My camera will shoot at 100,000 or a million frames per second.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s load a rocket. -Red one first? -TRAVIS: Yeah.  Our plan was to launch rockets  up through the triangle  where we&#x27;ve seen numerous UAPs</p>
<p> and detected what we believe to be some kind of anomaly between 300 and 5,000 feet. -Okay, it&#x27;s on? -Yeah.  TRAVIS: While Burdette</p>
<p> photographed each launch at a thousand frames per second,  with both color  and infrared cameras. Whoa, whoa, wait, what&#x27;s this right here? What&#x27;s this? What&#x27;s this? TRAVIS: We got something! We got something!  When we&#x27;ve seen UAPs</p>
<p> here in the past... A UAP appeared and vanished.  ...we&#x27;ve gotten  quick glimpses of them. -Hey, look, UAP right there!</p>
<p>-Yep.  TRAVIS: But then they tend  to just disappear  before we can really see  what they are. -Are they always that bright?</p>
<p>-And it&#x27;s gone. Here we go. Let&#x27;s go straight up. Tell me when you&#x27;re good. That&#x27;s fine.</p>
<p> So we&#x27;re hoping  that Burdette&#x27;s cameras  will help us get a much better  look at anything  that might appear in the sky  during our rocket launches  tonight. I hope that works.</p>
<p>All right.  I learned  about the investigations  at Skinwalker Ranch  through, uh, Travis  and some of the things  they hadn&#x27;t done yet is tried to catch things</p>
<p>in high-speed, because there&#x27;s so many fast-moving things that happen here that you don&#x27;t get to grasp with your eye. And that&#x27;s kind of where our Photron cameras come into play.</p>
<p>We got it.  BURDETTE:  They slow down reality.  So anything you  can&#x27;t see with your eye,  we can catch with the cameras.</p>
<p> And anything you just  kind of saw with your eye,  we can slow it down so you can  get a very good look at it. TRAVIS: The rocket, it&#x27;s ready to go.</p>
<p>-All right, um... -Are you good? Yeah, it&#x27;s on. -We&#x27;re good, yep. -Hey, Erik, do you copy? All right, copy you.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Erik was stationed  in the command center  during the experiment,  so he could monitor  for any strange energy spikes  out at the triangle and keep a close eye on the ranch surveillance cameras pointed in this direction.</p>
<p>All right, here we go, here we go. -Okay. We&#x27;re hot. -All right, everybody ready? Is everybody ready? Erik, be advised the rocket&#x27;s</p>
<p>hot. We&#x27;re going hot now. Copy you, Travis. All right, here we go. In three...</p>
<p>two, one... Hey, did you see that? It turned before it could get to wherever the anomaly is. -How many times have we seen that happen?</p>
<p>-Yeah. It&#x27;s going to land right here behind us.  Right after the first  rocket launched,  I noticed that in midair,</p>
<p> it suddenly veered  a little off course  like it ran into something  invisible that deflected it. Now, we&#x27;ve also seen that happen numerous times with other rockets and GPS devices at the triangle, so I was really eager</p>
<p>to immediately launch another rocket to see what would happen next. Isn&#x27;t that crazy? Gosh, if it ain&#x27;t one thing, it&#x27;s another. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>Hey, Kaleb, why don&#x27;t you pull the Jeep around -and shine a light over here. -KALEB: Yep. ♪ ♪ Let me download this image real quick and then we can</p>
<p>look at it again later. Won&#x27;t take long because there&#x27;s not much in there. Okay, we&#x27;re as good as we&#x27;re gonna get.</p>
<p>Hey, Erik, you copy? Yeah. Go ahead, Travis. -We good? -Yes, sir. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>All right. Five, four, three, two, one. THOMAS: That is cool. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>Oh, that one was awesome. Boy, that went up pretty high. That one may end up in the east field. KALEB:</p>
<p>Hey, we got a light that&#x27;s right there that&#x27;s moving. -Where, where? -Right there, right above us. -What? Really?</p>
<p>-Right there. Where? TRAVIS: Yeah! We got it! There it is, right there. Nah, this one&#x27;s moving pretty fast.</p>
<p>What is that? KALEB: That&#x27;s not a plane. KALEB: That&#x27;s not a plane. Erik. We&#x27;ve got an orange light</p>
<p>across the river on the, uh, southwest side. Moving pretty fast about treetop high. Look at that, it&#x27;s still plenty bright.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Dang. Yes, I do, Travis. I will take a look. TRAVIS: I don&#x27;t know where it came from, but just after</p>
<p>we launched our second rocket at the triangle area, probably the most prominent UAP I&#x27;ve ever seen appeared over Skinwalker Ranch. Erik, we got something moving right overhead of us right now. It&#x27;s moving slightly</p>
<p>northeast, it&#x27;s orange. And it doesn&#x27;t look like a satellite. Do you see it in the cameras? I&#x27;m going to try to track it. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>You see it? Hey, come, hey, it looks like it&#x27;s sped up. Does it look like it just sped up to y&#x27;all? TRAVIS: It just sped up. Erik, it&#x27;s almost</p>
<p>right over you now and it&#x27;s moving really fast. All right. I&#x27;m not seeing it. Travis, I don&#x27;t have it. Ask Erik if he&#x27;s got anything</p>
<p>on the ADS-B. Erik, is there anything on the ADS-B? It would be going east-northeast right now directly over the ranch.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> I&#x27;ve never seen an aircraft  maneuver like this thing,  but Thomas was right  to have Erik check his Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcasting tracker. It monitors the signals</p>
<p>that airplanes and jets are required by law to emit. I&#x27;ve got eyes on the ADS-B map. ERIK: You know, I get aircraft as far out as 130 miles.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s nothing over us, there&#x27;s nothing near us. It was clearly going due north and then it dog-legged and it sped up. -Yeah, it came across</p>
<p>and then it like turned. -Yeah. It&#x27;s still going, look at it. THOMAS: So, if that was a satellite, you&#x27;d expect it</p>
<p>to start fading out. TRAVIS: By now, it&#x27;d be fading out. THOMAS: That&#x27;s no satellite.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Did it just...? It just vanished. That thing stayed bright and just went away. Well, I don&#x27;t see it anymore.</p>
<p>THOMAS: Well, I think we got to get that rocket up and see if we can make it... -TRAVIS: Yep, I hear you. -THOMAS: Replicate it. That was not a satellite.</p>
<p>So what was that? Right here over the ranch. Yeah, go ahead, Thomas. -We&#x27;re good? Okay. -TRAVIS: Yeah. One more sparky rocket.</p>
<p>Okay, perfect. We couldn&#x27;t wait to see if launching another rocket would evoke the UAP to reappear or stimulate another one or who knows what else. And also, I hoped that Burdette</p>
<p>was getting great pictures  that would help us  figure out what it was. Hook the wires up. Uh, make sure it&#x27;s off, hang on. -Are we good here?</p>
<p>-Yeah, yeah, we&#x27;re good. -Lights on? -Lights on. Hey, Erik, be advised: ...in about 15 seconds. Are you ready? I am ready.</p>
<p>Go ahead. Are you ready, Burdette? -BURDETTE: Yes, sir. -KALEB: Yeah, we&#x27;re good to go. All right. Going in five, four, three, two, one.</p>
<p>Oh, we got a malfunction. Everybody watch out. Oh. Oh. Oh, it&#x27;s on fire.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: We got a fire. We got a fire. Oh, dang.  TRAVIS:  We shoot the rocket up  and we-we&#x27;re ready</p>
<p> to launch this thing.  And as the launch starts,  it looks like  a perfect launch  from the beginning, and what we see is that  the rocket takes off,  clears the tower,  gets to somewhere  I&#x27;m estimating</p>
<p> between 30 and 50 feet,  and then suddenly there&#x27;s  a big flash of light  and, uh, what sounded  like a pop,  maybe even an explosion. -It-It&#x27;s burned out. -The motor burned out.</p>
<p>-Holy crap. I&#x27;ve yet to see that. -Yeah. -What the heck? -What would cause that? What would cause that? The motor blew up.</p>
<p>It-it deflagrated inside the rocket. -Wow. -Hey, Erik, you copy? -Well... -It was worse than that.</p>
<p>At about 30 feet off the launch pad... And started a fire. Well, let&#x27;s go look at the high-speed because it should be</p>
<p>right in that view. TRAVIS: We recovered it. -Holy crap. -Right? What a night.</p>
<p>What... What... That motor blew up. It literally... it exploded.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never seen, uh, I&#x27;ve seen experimental motors do that, Kaleb, but I&#x27;ve never seen a store-bought motor deflagrate like that. -Right there.</p>
<p>-Got it. -Hey, Travis. -Yeah? We caught the malfunction on the high-speed. -Oh, really?</p>
<p>-Yeah. Hey, check this out. There&#x27;s something on the camera.  BURDETTE:  It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never</p>
<p> seen before. Check this out. So, as it&#x27;s going, look what you&#x27;ve got... TRAVIS:</p>
<p>There&#x27;s something in the sky above the rocket, right here.  KALEB: Yeah, look at that,  look at the light... -No way. -Look at that (bleep)! -That&#x27;s crazy.</p>
<p>-There is literally something... We may be looking at the anomaly for the first time, guys. BURDETTE: That&#x27;s crazy.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Oh, my God. TRAVIS: There is literally something. We may be looking at the anomaly</p>
<p>for the first time, guys. Yeah, look at that. Look at the light. TRAVIS: All right, now the rocket gets there.</p>
<p>THOMAS: Look how it veers to the side. TRAVIS: And then the rocket blows up -right when it hits it! -THOMAS: Oh, my God! (cheering and shouting) Right on! Right here.</p>
<p>Look at that. Yeah! TRAVIS: Holy crap. All right, Burdette, could you play it one more time? I want to make sure I saw</p>
<p>what I think I just saw.  After four years  of investigating  Skinwalker Ranch as a team, we finally got good visual evidence of something incredible at the triangle.  Just as we launched a rocket, Burdette Anderson captured some</p>
<p>kind of blob-like feature  on his high-speed camera  that literally appeared  out of nowhere and caused  the rocket to explode. It was something that none of us could see with the naked eye.</p>
<p>That cloud remained intact. The whole thing. This isn&#x27;t an anomaly in the lens because it didn&#x27;t move.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Could this be the phenomenon  that causes the energy spikes  we&#x27;ve detected?  And is it related  to the UAPs we&#x27;ve seen? All I know is we may finally be getting closer to possible answers. Think about all</p>
<p>the rockets that hit about that same spot and veered off. So you can see it right there, there&#x27;s something in the sky. -KALEB: It&#x27;s already</p>
<p>illuminated by the light. -TRAVIS: Yeah. THOMAS: There&#x27;s not a cloud in the sky. TRAVIS: There&#x27;s not a cloud</p>
<p>in the sky. So what is it? THOMAS: And there&#x27;s no dust. And then, look, it&#x27;s almost there.</p>
<p>Right there it&#x27;s like it hits right on something or zap or whatever. -Boom. -Boom! -And it is exactly... -Oh, my God.</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: You can&#x27;t make it up. -BURDETTE: Oh, yeah.  Usually I can explain  everything I&#x27;ve seen  in a high-speed camera  when I record it.</p>
<p> But when we shot  the third rocket,  as soon as that rocket  started illuminating,  we saw something that wasn&#x27;t  there in the second shot.  I can&#x27;t explain what it is.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never seen anything like that come off a Photron camera. -Holy crap. -Oh, my God. Well, Travis, that&#x27;s only 30...</p>
<p>30, 40 feet above us. Oh, my God. 40 feet high. What are the odds of that happening right there with other</p>
<p>rockets in that same spot?  Last year,  we attempted to launch  a 15-foot tall rocket  through the anomaly,  -above the triangle. -Push and hold. ALLEN:</p>
<p>Uh-oh. That motor blew.  TRAVIS:  And it exploded in  nearly the same spot.</p>
<p>Oh, no. Oh...  TRAVIS:  Shortly after that,  we saw a UAP  appear over the triangle...</p>
<p>Look at that. Look at that.  ...which then vanished  into thin air. But what did it disappear into? BRANDON:</p>
<p>Is it a portal? Are we seeing portals open? Yeah. I couldn&#x27;t possibly know what this phenomenon was, but we now have a clear location to focus our investigation.</p>
<p>Okay, we caught something cool. (laughter) (cheering) (laughter) TRAVIS: That&#x27;s just more validation. We got to call Erik and tell him this.</p>
<p>Erik, you are not going to believe what the high-speed caught, there is a thing in the sky, the rocket hits it and explodes. That is unbelievable. I want to see that footage. My gosh! (laughs) (helicopter whirring) Helicopter, helicopter! Helicopter coming right over! Erik, we got</p>
<p>a helicopter right over the ranch right now, are you getting it? ERIK: I am getting no helicopter above the ranch on the ADS-B receiver here. TRAVIS: We have a helicopter</p>
<p>right over the triangle. KALEB: Hey, it just went dark. And it just vanished, but we still hear it. Ah, now it&#x27;s there again.</p>
<p>-There&#x27;s its light right there. -It went behind the anomaly! THOMAS: That&#x27;s a bigger helicopter. Why? Why right now? Why right now? (helicopter whirring) Erik, it came over us. We lost the lights for a second and then it turned</p>
<p>away from the anomaly and turned southeast. Well, whoever they were, they weren&#x27;t transponding. A helicopter that size not transponding? -Well, did you see...</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: Right after we did this! KALEB: The helicopter looks like it&#x27;s... -TRAVIS: The helicopter is turning around.</p>
<p>-KALEB: ...coming back around. Helicopter&#x27;s turning back around, Erik. I&#x27;ve got eyes on him. THOMAS:</p>
<p>Where did that just come out of? It&#x27;s coming back... Erik, that helicopter is coming back at us. Do you see that? Yeah, I&#x27;ve got him. All right, now you&#x27;re mine.</p>
<p>The aircraft is not transponding... And it&#x27;s slowing down. And it&#x27;s-it&#x27;s doing... It-It&#x27;s orbiting the ranch.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s doing surveillance right now of the ranch. We have a helicopter right over the triangle right now right overhead. It&#x27;s doing surveillance</p>
<p>right now of the ranch. (helicopter whirring) They&#x27;re definitely watching. They&#x27;re definitely over the ranch looking at us. THOMAS:</p>
<p>Shortly after this UAP sighting and after this rocket blows up, all of a sudden a helicopter comes flying directly over us. Look at &#x27;em, they&#x27;re turning again.</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: Yeah, they are clearly... -They are watching. KALEB: And then we also had that other</p>
<p>light that we saw, earlier. Yep.  As that helicopter is  sitting there hovering,  my mind is immediately trying to figure out who this could be  that&#x27;s watching us.</p>
<p>Hey, Erik, uh, are you sure that there&#x27;s nothing on the ADS-B? Travis, this helicopter is not transponding  as far as I can tell. Because I&#x27;m getting aircraft 100 miles to the south of here.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s not a connectivity issue. And he&#x27;s staying right over us and orbiting and orbiting. Well, someone&#x27;s taken</p>
<p>an interest in what we&#x27;re doing. There&#x27;s nothing over us. There&#x27;s nothing near us. And he has not shown up at all. This is an aircraft that is</p>
<p>deliberately not transponding while flying over the ranch. All I know is there&#x27;s an aircraft flying after night, which means they got night vision.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> There are not any  commercial helicopters  around here with  night vision capability.  The only thing this could be  then is a military helicopter.</p>
<p> What is the military doing  flying over Skinwalker Ranch while we&#x27;re doing this experiment,  and while we find something  that we&#x27;ve never seen before? I don&#x27;t like the feeling of that. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t like that crap either. Hey, Erik? Uh... Are you, do you have any of the ranch cameras  on that helicopter? Yeah, I&#x27;ve got multiple of the ranch cameras on him.</p>
<p>He is sitting still and hovering, watching us.  ERIK:  That is exactly right. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>It&#x27;s really spooking us and, uh, pissing us off at the same time. I&#x27;m right there with you, Travis. Well, Travis, it&#x27;s pretty</p>
<p>clear somebody has taken an interest in what we&#x27;re doing. It-it really... It&#x27;s a little bit scary. THOMAS: They&#x27;re leaving.</p>
<p>How long did they stay there, like four or five minutes? Oh, ten minutes. THOMAS: What the heck? -And now they&#x27;re headed back towards, uh...</p>
<p>Roosevelt. -Roosevelt. They are all but gone now. TRAVIS: It-it came by to show us that it knew we were doing something,</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s possible somebody saw rockets and they called, you know, the ATF or something and that was an ATF... ATF has a helicopter</p>
<p>in the Uinta Basin? Uh, they could have hired somebody, right? There are no helicopters out here equipped with night vision. TRAVIS: That&#x27;s a good point.</p>
<p>I mean, there&#x27;s not a military base nearby. -No. -I mean right here that has helicopters.</p>
<p>-We&#x27;re talking minutes. -Yeah. Who alerted them that fast? And where was that helicopter? Where did it come from? How did it get here so quick?  It&#x27;s well known  that the federal government  investigated Skinwalker Ranch  in the past.</p>
<p> But I&#x27;m not aware of any  current government  investigations here. So are we being spied on while we conduct our operations? I don&#x27;t know, but I want to find out.</p>
<p>THOMAS: What a night! Hey, look, uh, we&#x27;ve got a lot of equipment here, it&#x27;s getting late. Well, let&#x27;s get cleaned up, shall we? -Yes.</p>
<p>-All right. TRAVIS: All right, well, let&#x27;s pack up. THOMAS: Let&#x27;s get wrapped up.</p>
<p>ERIK: What the heck is going on  in that space above this area?  What are we seeing? Is there in fact exotic physics playing out in the space just above the triangle? That&#x27;s what we hope to find out.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> We may have found a real  unexplained phenomena  above the triangle that nobody has ever seen ever before.  Could this new anomaly,  this blob,  be the cause of each</p>
<p> of these incidents  over the triangle?  BRANDON: We are on the verge  of getting the very answers  that we&#x27;ve been  seeking for years. We&#x27;ve made incredible progress in documenting the reality of the phenomenon.</p>
<p> We are just getting started in scratching the surface of what we are really dealing with  here at Skinwalker Ranch.  THOMAS:  I&#x27;ve arranged for a crane  to come in and to lift a lot  of these big rocks</p>
<p> at the bottom of the mesa. This 1.6 gigahertz signal seems to be coming from right there where that big crane is. ERIK:</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to probe that space down at the triangle.  Kaleb will be releasing  projectiles. Holy crap.</p>
<p>This is a video recording taken from the triangle. -Right there. -Holy cow! CAPTIONING PROVIDED BY A+E NETWORKS</p>
