            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In the final days of World War II, rumors spread of a Nazi device called D Glocka, the bell. It was said to glow, spin violently, and defy gravity. Some claimed it was a secret weapon. Others believed it was an attempt at time travel or anti-gravity flight. Scientists who worked on it, they vanished.</p>
<p>When the Allies reached the site, the bell was gone. What really happened in that bunker? No one has been able to prove it ever existed, but no one has disproved it either.</p>
