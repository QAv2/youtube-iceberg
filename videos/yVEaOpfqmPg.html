            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is uh channel for educational purposes and we look at uh great theories of everything um in this case uh today is our 500 first video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson and Mr Larsson proposed his two fundamental postulates in about 1959 and uh from there he derived a theoretical Universe um what his Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then he uh in books like the one we have in front of us today uh he Compares his theoretical Universe with the measured empirical universe of the uh Legacy scientists um and this book today is called basic properties of matter and uh this book&#x27;s on chemistry LaRon arrives at equations for many of the basic properties of matter like the melting point or the compressibility and then um Compares his results with the scientific tables and and uh we are about to start chapter 17 of this book which is called ionization now if you don&#x27;t know anything about the reciprocal system uh you want to watch one of my first 474 videos on this subject uh where I go into at least a little bit of detail enough to get you up to speed uh to be able to follow along I think and um but for the purposes of this video uh I&#x27;m going to assume that you have at least some kind of working knowledge of the reciprocal system I&#x27;ll go over the uh the first postulate uh Larson was um uh a proponent of a universe made entirely of motion um other theorists have come up with that before but uh Larson made it work uh turned it into a generalized Theory uh because he defined Motion in a way that uh was unprecedented so in LaRon system uh the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with three uh with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so the universe is made out of motion in particular we&#x27;re talking about a kind of motion that Larson refers to as scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction you can use something like a balloon um that you put dots on with a magic marker if you blow up the balloon all the dots will be moving away from each other they will all be moving uh in every direction away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction and then if you contract that balloon they will all be moving toward each other but again not in any specific Direction in all directions inward um Larson refers to the outward motion as the progression the inward motion as gravitation the progression is really the source of everything in larsson&#x27;s Universe um and is manifested by taking that source and reversing it and uh you know turning that outward motion of the balloon into an inward motion uh which is um gravitation which is inherent in uh matter and um then Larson defines motion as the relationship between space and time so um for example you have speed speed is uh you know the person is running at 10 mil per hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time space over time so in this case speed is space divided by time all of our scientific phenomena are forms of motion and therefore they all can be defined in Sp uh exclusively in space time terms a fraction with space or time as the numerator time or space as the denominator uh but space and time can have uh exponents um so for example matter in en largon system is time to the thir power over space to the thir power and energy is simply time over space acceleration is space over time to the second power force is time over space to the second power and so on and uh since the universe is quantized everything is in discrete units all of our scientific quantities can be um quantized they are they come in units you can have a unit of um uh Motion in a unit of speed a unit of energy a unit of matter and so on okay now when uh we talk about his electronic Theory uh which we&#x27;re going to do here in this chapter um Larson&#x27;s electron is a little bit different than the Legacy electron because Larson&#x27;s electron is uh naturally uncharged uh so we have the uncharged electron which like everything else in Larson system is a kind of motion it is a rotating unit of space moving through matter matter is primarily M made out of time and so space the relationship of space to time is motion and so the unit of space the electron naturally moves through matter in the same way that matter moves through space uh they are mutual um motions and um the electron moving through through space is known as electric current this is an uncharged uh I&#x27;m sorry the electron moving through matter is electric current the uncharged electron moving through matter is electric current and so the electric current is uncharged now the electron can take a charge but a charge is not an electron uh charge is a kind of motion just like everything else in LaRon system and a uh charge is a rotational vibration and uh an electron can take an uh a charge an a rotational vibration in which case it becomes static electricity and it becomes charged and that static electricity tends to stay on the surface of the matter because it uh has more trouble moving through the matter because uh now the um electric charge is uh a time over space kind of motion and so it doesn&#x27;t move readily through time because the relationship of time to time is not motion it&#x27;s only the relationship of time to space that&#x27;s motion okay now with this background uh and again if you want want to watch one of my first 474 videos uh that will fles out a little bit more um but let&#x27;s start here chapter 17 ionization electric charges are not confined to electrons units of relational units of rotational vibration that constitute electric charge may also be imparted to any other rotational combination including atoms as well as other subatomic particles the process of producing such charges is known as ionization and electrically charged atoms or molecules are called ions like the electrons sorry I lost my spot there um I think I&#x27;m pressing the wrong button here let&#x27;s get back to the beginning here okay like the electrons atoms or molecules can be charged or ionized by any number of agencies including radiation thermal motion other physical contact Etc essentially the ionization process is simply a transfer of energy and any kind of energy will serve the purpose if it is delivered to the right place and in the necessary concentration as indicated above one of the sources from which the ionization energy can be derived is the thermal energy of the ionizable matter itself we saw in chapter 5 that the thermal motion is always directed outward it therefore joins with ionization in opposition to the basic inward rotational motions of the atoms and is to some degree interchangeable with with ionization the magnitude of the energy required to ionize matter varies with the structure of the atom and with the existing level of ionization each element therefore has a series of ionization levels corresponding to successive units of rotational vibration when the thermal energy concentration or the temperature of an aggregate reaches such a level the impacts to which the atoms are subjected are sufficiently energetic to cause some of the linear thermal motion to be transferred into rotational vibration thus ionizing some of the atoms further rise in temperature results in ionization of additional atoms of the Aggregate and in additional ionization um more charges on the same atoms um and in additional ionization of previously ionized matter thermal ionization is only of minor importance in the terrestrial environment but at the high temperatures prevailing in the Sun and other stars thermally ionized atoms including positively asteris charged atoms of division four elements are plentiful again Larson uses the asteris to uh denote that he is using the conventional terminology um but that in his terminology it would be the opposite so he uses that on positive and negative the ionization condition is in fact normal at these temperatures and and at each of the Stellar locations there is a general ionization level determined by the temperature at the surface of the Earth the electric ionization level is zero and except for some special cases among the subatomic particles any atom or particle that acquires a charge while in the gaseous state is in an unstable condition it therefore eliminates the charge at the first opportunity in some other region where the prevailing temperature corresponds to an ionization level of two units for example the doubly ionized state is the most stable condition and any atoms that are above or below this degree of ionization tend to eliminate or acquire charges to the extent necessary to reach the stable level since the rotational vibration that we know as ionization is basically a motion in opposition to the rotational motion of the atom the ionization cannot exceed the net effective positive asteris displacement or the atomic number in a region where the ionization level is very high the heavier elements therefore have a considerably larger content of positive asterisk ion uh displacement in the form of ionization at a given temperature than those of smaller Mass this point has an important bearing on the life cycle of the elements and will be given further consideration later in the nuclear theory of atomic structure currently accepted by the physicist the atomic quote nucleus is surrounded by a number of electrons equal to the atomic number of the element ionization is viewed as a process of detaching electrons from the from the atom on this basis the maximum degree of ionization is attained when all electrons have been removed moved and only the bare nucleus remains this is a plausible hypothesis and on first consideration its plausibility would appear to be a point in favor of the nuclear theory it should be realized however that any reliable theory of atomic structure will have essentially the same explanation of ionization differing only in the language in which it is expressed such a theory must identify entities that are added to or removed from the atoms as the atomic number increases successive addition or elimination of these entities then explains ionization in the nuclear theory which views the atoms as a collection of particles these entities are electrons in the theory of the universe of motion which finds the atom to be a combination of motions they are units of rotational motion any other theory that might be formulated would necessarily have to identify some entity that could similarly be added or removed unit by unit thus the ionization process would be consistent with any Theory consequently it gives support To None uh just to recall uh the um Larson&#x27;s theory in uh of atomic Atomic physics he uh does not have a nucleus in his atom the uh basically the nucleus of the atom is the entire atom and that all that what is known as the electron Cloud all of the space there that empty space where the electrons are supposed to be rotating is uh no such thing um it is actually the interatomic distance so that is actually uh in the solid state in um Legacy science uh the atoms are touching each other but in Larson system in the solid state atoms are a great distance apart um and they are um they find an interatomic equilibrium and an interatomic distance uh equilibrium distance apart um and that distance apart is what is uh known as the electron cloud by the uh Legacy scientists so one of Larson&#x27;s earliest books is actually called the case against the nuclear atom so uh in large system there is no nucleus the you know what&#x27;s what&#x27;s thought of as the nucleus is actually the whole atom so the atom is much smaller than um the Legacy science atom okay back to the text it in the terrestrial environment each ionization level of each element has a specific ionization potential that represents the amount of energy required in order to accomplish the ionization it is currently assumed that these values are fixed natural relations and therefore constant for all environments the theoretical status of this assumption in the context of the reciprocal system of theory has not yet been clarified it may be well it may well be valid throughout the Gest State however the measured ionization ation levels are obviously not applicable to ionization in the condensed gas State the state in which the gas molecules are within the equivalent of unit distance of each other uh in LaRon system you know space time and motion are quantized so there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time um and yeah you can can&#x27;t get any closer than a minimum minimal than one unit of space so he says that atoms are within the equivalent of unit distance of each other that basically means that there are one unit of space apart but then uh if they are one unit of space apart uh they can&#x27;t move any closer in space so what they do instead is they move farther apart in time um which is the equivalent of moving closer together in space because of the reciprocal relationship between space and time the outward Motion in time is equivalent to an inward Motion in space but the motion really occurs in time because it can occur in space because it&#x27;s already at the um minimum uh one unit of space the physical relations in this state are very different in this condensed gas state are very different from those of in an ordinary gas including reversal of all scalar directions uh Larson calls that the time region when uh you are in less than one unit of space then you&#x27;re no longer in space and you are in what he calls the time region um and when you go into the time region uh you get the reversal of um the progression and the progression is now inward in space or in equivalent space and uh gravitation is outward in equivalent space thus all that we can now say about the ionization potential in this state is that each successive level of ionization must involve an increase in energy as we will see in volume three the matter in most of the observed stars is in the condensed gas State the relation between temperature and the degree of ionization enables using the ionization which can be observed spectroscopically as a measure of the surface temperature of the stars for example below 12,00 ,000 K helium is not ionized at about 35,000 K it is mainly in the form of um helium 2 singly ionized at still higher temperatures it is doubly ionized H3 uh other elements have similar ionization patterns and the mixture of ions observed in the spectrum of a star thus indicates the range of temperatures at its surface the oars which are in the range uh up to about 880,000 deg Kelvin are reported to contain N2 nitrogen 2 oxygen 2 Carbon 2 and silicon 3 as well as helium and hydrogen ions it should be understood however that this relation between ionization and temperature holds Good only where the ionization is produced thermally references are made in the astronomical literature to ionization temperatures but these are merely the temperature equivalents of the ionization levels unless the ionization is thermally produced they do not indicate the actual temperature the level of ionization is a reflection of the strength of the ionizing agent agcy whatever it may be if that agency is the thermal energy then the ionization is a measure of the temperature but if the ion ionizing agency is radiation the ionization level is a measure of the strength of the radiation not the temperature in volume three uh which is on astronomy that&#x27;s a book called Universe of motion so in volume three we will encounter the same kind of a um misconception in dealing with the relation between temperature and the production of x-rays when the x-rays are thermally produced there is actually a relation between the X-ray emission and the temperature but here again if the x-rays are produced by some other agency the relation is between the X-ray emission and the strength of that other agency and it is independent of the temperature the importance of this point lies in the fact that the emission of x-rays is currently being treated as an indication of high temperature in cases where the nature of the X-ray production process is unknown even in cases where the conditions are such that temperatures are necessary that the temperature is necessary for thermal production of x-rays are impossible temperatures in the millions of degrees are inferred from xway x-ray observations in locations where the actual temperature cannot be more than a few degrees above absolute zero temperature without a qualifying adjective is a specifically defined concept and it is temperature as thus defined that enters into the various thermal relations the use of other kinds of temperature is entirely in order providing that each is clearly defined and is identified by an appropriate adjective in an expression such as ionization temperature in fact we will introduce such an alternate kind of temperature a magnetic temperature in chapter 24 but it should be recognize that these temperatures have their own sets of properties the thermal relations do not apply to them for example the general gas laws uh the general gas law applies only to temperature in the usual thermal sense this law is expressed as pval RT where p is the pressure V is is the volume T is the temperature and R is the gas constant from this law it is apparent that a high temperature can be developed in a given volume of gas only under high pressure in interstellar and Intergalactic space the pressure acting on the extremely tenuous medium is near zero and from the general gas law it is evident that the temperature must be at a correspondingly low level the temperatures in the millions of degrees that are currently being reported from these regions are totally unrealistic if they are intended to mean temperature in the thermal sense some of the existing confusion in this area appears to be due to a failure to draw a clear distinction between the two types of vectorial motion in which the particles of a gas participate these constituent particles share in the translational motion of a gaseous aggregate as a whole and it is generally understood that this is not a thermal motion that is a fast moving aggregate must be relatively cool an atom or particle moving independently in space is subject to the same considerations its free trans ational motion has no thermal significance the thermal motion is a product of containment it is the directionally distributed random motion that results from the Restriction of the motion to the volume within certain limits the pressure is a measure of the containment the temperature the measure of the thermal motion is therefore a function of the pressure as indicated in the gas laws high temperatures can only be attained under high pressures If part or all of the gas in an aggregate escapes from confinement its constituents move outward unidirectionally and the thermal motion is converted to linear translational motion the temperature and pressures decrease accordingly the picture of the nature of electric charges and ionization that we derive from the postulates of the theory of the universe of motion is very different from the currently accepted explanation of these phenomena which is an outgrowth of hypotheses formulated in the early days of electrical investigation on the basis of the limited amount of empirical information then available the early investigators in in this area identified negative asterisk charges with electrons and positive asterisk charges with atoms of matter meanwhile it was found that the atoms of certain elements undergo spontaneous disintegration in which electrons are emitted along with other products on the basis of these empirical findings the scientific Community adapted adopted the hypothesis previously mentioned in which positive asterisk charges are attributed to Atomic nucleus to anatomic nucleus and negative asterisk charges entirely to electrons positive asterisk and negative asterisk ionizations were then ascribed to deficiency or excess of electrons respectively one disturbing feature of this explanation was the great disparity in the sizes of the units of the two entities that were identified as the carriers of the charges the roles to be played by positive asterisk and negative asterisk charges in the theory were essentially reciprocal in nature yet the presumed carrier of the positive asteris charge the proton has nearly 2,000 times the mass of the negatively asteris charged particle the electron physicists were therefore greatly relieved when the positive asteris analog of the electron the positron was discovered it does not seem to be generally appreciated that this this discovery which restored the Symmetry that we have come to expect in nature has destroyed the foundation of Orthodox Theory it is now evident that positive asterisk charge is as much of a reality as negative asterisk charge it is not merely an electron deficiency as the theory contends okay we&#x27;re going to leave it there for today and uh resume um looking at chapter 17 on ionization tomorrow uh just remember that um this is a generalized Theory the reciprocal system is a generalized Theory and so we&#x27;re learning about chemistry here about ionization but what we learn in these lessons can be applied universally to other fields and uh so we&#x27;re not you know specifically learning about chemistry we&#x27;re learning about how the theory is applied and how to use it in your own life all right thanks for having uh tuning in</p>
