            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Okay. So, there&#x27;s a fair talk in commentary about the UAP subject that Hollywood is often used to seed ideas to acclimatize the public to ideas about UAPs. And the reason we know about this is because there was a guy who went by the pseudonym Chase Brandon from memory who was a CIA liaison with Hollywood who openly talked about the fact that his job was to essentially portray the presentation of UAPs, the phenomena of UFOs in movies in a particular way that fitted the narrative the US government wanted pushed. My former uh need to know podcast colleague Bryce Zable had an experience with his co-producer on his Dark Skies series where people from Navy Intelligence approached them both and essentially offered to craft the narrative to help them shape a more accurate representation of how aliens should be presented. And when they pointed out that in fact this was a fictional program, a series that had been crafted from their imagination, the people from Navy Intelligence told them that they could help them air something that was actually closer to the truth, which essentially is an implicit acknowledgement that there are people in the defense and intelligence community that know a lot more than they&#x27;re letting on, and they&#x27;re using Hollywood as a way of acclimatizing the Public.</p>
