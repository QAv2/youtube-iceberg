            <p>Edward Snowden, once a trusted NSA contractor, turned whistleblower in 2013 when he uncovered extensive global surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Agency. Snowden, working in intelligence, utilized complex data extraction and encryption techniques to gather classified documents amounting to thousands of files. These documents detailed the NSA&#x27;s covert operations targeting global internet communications and phone records, shaking the world&#x27;s perception of privacy. Facing ethical dilemmas, Snowden believed that public awareness transcended his allegiance to the government. Fleeing to Hong Kong, he executed a calculated strategy to disclose the documents and later sought asylum in Russia.</p>
<p>Snowden&#x27;s actions sparked global debates on privacy and governmental ethics, questioning the delicate balance between security and civil liberties.</p>
