            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel and we focus on great theories of everything ancient and modern and I try to do a deep dive into them so that you can determine how you can best use them to uh help you with your Paradigm shifting or your uh Awakening to 5D Consciousness your formation of a holistic worldview and uh just in general Healthy Living uh mental physical and spiritual so uh today is our 53rd video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and uh this is a generalized Theory of Everything from Dewey be Larson Mr Larson was an American engineer who lived in the 20 20th century he died in 1990 um before that he put out a dozen or so books and many articles and other um uh you know talks and he had many Associates um not not that many this is not a popular you know Theory I I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s not a whole lot of activity on the internet anymore or if ever on this um but uh in 1959 Mr Larsson proposed his two fundamental postulates about how he believed the universe operated and then from there he derived a theoretical Universe what his Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then compared his theoretical Universe with the actual Universe of our at least the measured universe of the Legacy scientists uh that they had uh you know put together from all kinds of laboratory experiments and compiled in scientific tables uh we have the results of one of those studies here uh basic properties of matter is the name of the book it&#x27;s primarily on chemistry we are about to and uh get to the end here of chapter 17 that is on ionization and I think we&#x27;re going to try to wrap that chapter up here today and then maybe move on to the next chapter uh chapter 18 which is called The Retreat from reality uh which is kind of stuff that Larson writes I really like uh where he um gets into the history of Science and uh shows many uh of the Legacy Sciences foibles along the way um now if you want a thorough rundown of how the reciprocal system operates I wouldn&#x27;t say thorough but at least semi thorough rundown about how the reciprocal system operates uh then you want to watch uh one of my first 474 videos on this topic um and then maybe come back uh because this video will basically be assuming that you have some type of working knowledge of the reciprocal system I we&#x27;ll go over the uh the two postulates here uh lson is um one of the few scientists who Embraces the idea of a universe made out of motion not matter not energy but Motion in particular Larson is referring to uh a kind of motion that he calls scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that has a MAG magnitude but it has no specific Direction you can Envision a scalar motion using a balloon that you put dots on with a magic marker if you blow up the balloon all the dots will be moving away from one another they will be moving outward in every direction no specific Direction every dot will be moving away from every other Dot and uh if you contract the balloon every dot will be moving toward every other dot again a scalar motion with no specific Direction only magnitude and that outward motion Larson refers to that as the progression you could also think of that as anti-gravity uh and the inward motion is gravity um and um basically uh that outward motion is what uh Larson calls the progression and that is really the source of everything in the universe um it is not uh it is nothing it is uh nothing in the universe but it provides the source for manifestation by basically converting that outward motion into an in inward motion through the reversal of that motion um that is the beginning of manifestation so uh once it becomes that inward motion gravitation then there is inherently um matter there um anyway that is um one difference that that is made by Larson in his um kind of attempt to construct a universe based on motion another is that he defines Motion in a different manner as the relationship between space and time this implies a reciprocal relationship uh motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator so for example uh the most basic motion that we may know of is speed the runner is running at 10 m hour 10 miles of space in 1 hour of time space over time is speed but uh in a universe of motion all scientific phenomena are forms of motion so matter is a kind of motion energy is a kind of motion force is a kind of motion acceleration is a kind of motion and they all have their SpaceTime fraction signatures so for example matter is time to the thir power over space to the thir power and um energy is time over space matter um force is time over space to the second power and so on so um this also works very well as a check um to be able to kind of check your units uh we can discard the MKS system or the SI system or whatever other system of units uh because this system only operates with two variables space and time and um Larson&#x27;s first postulate basically States the case of um you know what he&#x27;s contributing to the system uh his uh reciprocal system what he&#x27;s contributing to you know science or whatever and then the second pass the kind of States what the scientific background is that he is applying his first postulate to so the first postulate states that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and then the second postulate is that uh the universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative matter mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian and so Larsson takes that first postulate and then he plugs it into you know the rules of mathematics the rules of geometry the rules of logic and uh arrives at a theoretical universe that he then Compares with the measured universe of the um Legacy scientist uh Larson has many books on many topics uh we have gone over books that he&#x27;s done on metaphysics including philosophy religion and psychology biology uh also uh he has books on Atomic physics that we&#x27;ve gone over um astronomy not so much yet um and we&#x27;re going to go over one of his books on economics uh coming up here pretty soon so when we go over this work on chemistry it&#x27;s not so much to uh you know isolate or focus on the aspects of chemistry that he&#x27;s getting at that might be interesting to some people but it&#x27;s really um more broadly to look at larsson&#x27;s method and his procedure and his approach to applying this Theory of Everything to a specific subject so that you can kind of glean how to uh eventually be able to apply Larson&#x27;s Theory to your subject whatever subject that is that you&#x27;re interested in in delving into um the you the reciprocal system can be applied to anything so that&#x27;s the key is is that we are trying to um figure out how the reciprocal system works so that we can plug it into whatever subject we want to um and I I think that by you know giving it a broad coverage looking at how he applies it in many different fields will then um help us to figure out how to apply it to our field okay uh here we are in at the end of chapter 17 talking about ionization there have been many instances in the preceding pages in which a limiting magnitude of the particular physical quantity under consideration has been shown to exist we have just seen that the number of units of electric ionization of an atom is limited to the net equivalent number of units of effective electric rotational displacement for example the element magnesium which has the equivalent of 12 net effective electric rotational displacement units can take 12 units of electrical vibrational displacement or ionization but no more similarly we found that the maximum rotational base of the thermal vibration in the solid state is the primary magnetic rotation of the atom most of the limits thus far incountered have been of this type which we may designate as nondestructive limits when such a limit is reached further increase of this particular quantity is prevented but there is no other effect we are now dealing with a quantity the total outward speed displacement which is subject to a different kind of a limit a destructive limit the essential difference between the two stems from the fact that the non-destructive limits merely Define the extent to which certain kinds of additions to or modifications of the constituent motions of the atoms can be carried reaching the electric ionization limit only means that no more units of positive asterisk electric charge can be added to the atom it does not in any way imperil the existence of the atom on the other hand a limit that represents the attainment of equality with a basic motion of the atom has a deeper significance here it should be remembered that rotation is not a property of the scalar motion itself it is a property of the coupling of the motion to the reference system for example the basic constituent of the uncharged electron is a unit of inward scalar Motion in space this motion per se has no properties other than the unit inward magnitude but it is coupled to the reference system in such a way that it becomes a rotation in the context of that system retaining its inward scalar Direction when the electron is charged the coupling is so modified that an oppositely directed rotational vibration is superimposed on the rotation the charge positron is a unit inward Motion in time similarly coupled to the reference system okay we kind of referred to that a little bit before with the balloon analogy um you know when you have like say the inward motion of that balloon with the dots on it and every dot is moving toward every other dot there is no Direction every dot is moving toward every other dot so every dot is basically moving in every direction but if you arbitrarily decide to assign a reference point to one of those dots and say this particular dot we&#x27;re going to say that this particular dot is stationary then all of a sudden you can impute directions to uh the other dots you uh it will actually appear as if there is a field uh gravitation attraction from your dot to all the other dots that your dot is actually attracting all the other dots because they are now moving toward your dot but that is not uh that is not something that comes from the scalar motion it comes from the assignment of a reference system so the direction is a product of the reference system not of the motion itself and that force field that you&#x27;re seeing is fictitious there is no force field involved the um the gravitation uh Larson refers to as an as if Force so it looks like there&#x27;s a force and it behaves like there&#x27;s a force and even mathematically it behaves like there&#x27;s a force but there isn&#x27;t every dot is pursuing its own course moving toward every other dot but since you&#x27;ve decided that there is one reference point it all looks like they&#x27;re moving toward that dot but they are also moving toward each other so um just to clarify there um again if you want a um um more of a rund down on the reciprocal system watch one of my first 474 videos on this subject okay when brought into proximity a Charged electron and a Charged Pro positron are attracted toward each other by the electrical forces when they make contact the two rotational vibrations of equal magnitude and opposite polarity cancel each other the oppositely directed unit rotations do likewise this eliminates all aspects of the coupling of the motion to the reference system other than the reference point reducing the particles to radiation and bringing them to rest in the natural reference system as seen in the spatial reference system they become two photons moving outward in opposite directions from the point in the reference system at which the neutralization took place uh now just to review again uh Larson&#x27;s system is is much uh much of it is based on reference systems there&#x27;s a spatial reference system which is stationary and a temporal reference system which is also stationary in time um but then neither one of these references systems can really um account for um many phenomena and they are limited reference systems Larson also has what he calls the natural reference system and the natural reference system the system that nature is actually using is a moving reference system this is um what Larsson calls the progression the progression is moving outward and that is the natural reference system at a speed uh which is the speed of light which is one unit of space per one unit of time remembering that the universe is quantized you have to have a full unit before you have anything and so one unit of speed is a unit of space over a unit of time just like one unit of matter would be one unit of space and one unit of time to the third power over one unit of space to the third power or unit of energy would be one unit of time per one unit of space so everything is quantized the units are quantized space and time and motion are quantized and um speed the speed of light is a unit of speed and that is the speed of the natural reference system that is the the speed of the progression and that is the source of everything and that is the reference system that nature uses so that&#x27;s where Laren takes his measurements from uh what is your speed as related to the uh speed of the natural reference system okay um this neutralization and there so therefore you know your Photon your Photon it appears to be moving outward at the speed of light to us from our spatial reference system our stationary reference system um but from the standpoint of the natural reference system the photon is actually motionless it is not moving in uh reference to the Natural reference system okay so this neutralization or Annihilation process becomes more difficult to accomplish as the particles increase in size and complexity and takes place on a significant scale only in the subatomic range however full units of the magnetic rotation of the atoms uh of the atom units of inward rotational speed displacement can be neutralized by a combination with outward displacements of equal magnitude the outward motions available for this purpose are ionization and thermal motion when the total displacement of these motions reaches equality with that of a full unit of the magnetic rotation of an atom or any full unit of that rotation the existence of the rotational unit terminates and its speed displacement reverts to the linear Bas basis uh radiation or kinetic energy as we saw earlier the thermal ionization level is related to the temperature the total outward speed displac at which neutralization occurs is therefore reached at a specific temperature a destructive temperature limit full ionization is attained at a level far below this limiting temperature in as much at it as it is the total outward displacement that enters into the neutralization process rather than the thermal motion alone the temperature of the destructive limit of an element depends on its atomic number the heavier elements have more displacement in the form of ionization when all are fully ionized and these elements therefore reach the same total displacement at lower temperatures when the temperature of an aggregate arrives at the destructive limit of the heaviest element present this ele reduces to one with less magnetic um therefore two-dimensional rotation the difference in Mass uh T 3 over s 3r being converted to its one dimensional equivalent energy T / s so that&#x27;s basically your um uh eal mc^2 uh energy t/ s equals matter T 3r / s 3r times uh c^ 2 the speed of light to the second power speed of light being s over T and then s over t to the second power cancels out two of the t&#x27;s and two of the S&#x27;s and leaves energy t/ s um you know you can use that uh process for all of your C classical equations uh you can sub in the t/ S terms you know to determine the validity of those equations as the rise in temperature continues one after another of the elements meets the same fate in the order of decreasing atomic number okay so Larson is referring there to the destructive uh destructive limits of matter and uh he uses this then in volume three of this series The Universe of motion his book on astronomy or one of his books on astronomy that um is uh how a star Burns Stars Burn uh in Larson system not from the bottom up but from uh the top down meaning uh not from uh converting hydrogen to helium but from burning the heaviest elements the heaviest elements are burning uh in the center of the star uh the star is using um gravitation the heaviest elements sink to the center and at the center the temperature because of the high pressure the temperature gets so high that uh it reaches the destructive limit of matter and um the heaviest elements begin to um destroy each other or destroy themselves and um each element has a specific temperature that it uh is destroyed at and as the temperature uh the the higher the element the lower the temperature and so as the star gets hotter and hotter um more and more elements become subject to that uh burning process uh um so uh that&#x27;s just kind of a sneak preview of uh larsson&#x27;s book on astronomy the uh Universe of motion now uh I don&#x27;t believe that we&#x27;re going to go through that book um in its entirety um it&#x27;s quite long and it&#x27;s some of it is very technical um it&#x27;s kind of uh uh along with a lot of n&#x27;s work and some of larsson&#x27;s work um I would classify Universe of motion along with part of this work as well but um I would classify unit Universe of motion along with a lot of neb articles to be kind of like graduate school for reciprocal system like it&#x27;s kind of advanced um that you don&#x27;t really um you know that you really have to uh really go pretty deep into the reciprocal system to be able to understand what they&#x27;re talking about there um and um you know with the reciprocal system even the elementary stuff is pretty hard so um we&#x27;re going to uh defer uh studying the universe of motion uh for a little while um along with the fact that Dr Bruce paret has a pretty thoroughgoing critique of a lot of larsson&#x27;s stuff in there including some very fundamental stuff like um the uh gravitational limit and the distance between uh stars in the galaxy the distance between uh what we&#x27;re actually looking at when we&#x27;re looking through a telescope um Larson u i mean pet adopts a lot of the work from the Iranian um astrophysicist um baham karay if I&#x27;m pronouncing that correctly uh where he&#x27;s really saying that all of the galaxies that we see up in the heavens they&#x27;re all within like 3500 light years from us um like so everything is super tightly packed in compared to the you know billions of light years away that we thought thought we were looking that there that everything that we see up there is actually pretty darn close to us and that you know space travel is possible um you know the Andromeda galaxy that we thought was 200 million Lighty years away or 2 million Lighty years away is actually like less than one lightyear away or something like that so um that uh a lot of that work uh has caused me to re-evaluate some of uh larsson&#x27;s work and uh I honestly am marinating on that and I really am ambivalent about it right now I don&#x27;t really know um how to think about it and so until I um maybe go back and read univers of motion again and read it in light of a lot of Pet&#x27;s work um you know it doesn&#x27;t necessarily nullify larsson&#x27;s think on the on the topic but it uh but Larson brings you know some assumptions to the table um you know again just like in this work or in his work in general he is relying on um you know the scientific tables for his comparisons um and so you know he&#x27;s kind of you know and when he when Larson comes up with with terminology then he matches um the the things that come out of his theoretical Universe he matches them up with things that have already been discovered by Legacy science you know so if Larsson comes up theoretically he&#x27;s like oh well this is uh theoretically there should be this thing that is a rotating unit of space and then he you know says well uh Accord according to Legacy science that would be an electron so then he labels it an electron um so in a certain way Larson is Larson is relying on Legacy science to at least be in the ballpark um with things uh before he makes his identifications and he does that to a certain extent in the book on astronomy and so um you know paret is kind of tearing that whole edifice down and I&#x27;m going to have to kind of re-evaluate that over time and I don&#x27;t have time for that right now so we&#x27;re not going to get into studying larsson&#x27;s astronomy even though that&#x27;s my favorite book of his I mean that is uh his book on astronomy was my favorite uh works and so I uh struggled through to to understand uh uh Pet&#x27;s critique of it and um you know it&#x27;s kind of left me reeling I&#x27;ve been reeling about it for a few years now um and haven&#x27;t really gone back and Revisited it I&#x27;m still trying to kind of figure it out and there&#x27;s also you know questions about the shape of the earth you know I I&#x27;m not a full flat earther you know but um uh hollow Earth theory is definitely compelling and even platonic solid shaped Earth um has some Allure to me and I honestly don&#x27;t know so um I um I&#x27;m going to try I&#x27;m trying to figure it out uh so um that doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with anything that we&#x27;re talking about right now but we just finished chapter 17 on ionization and uh tomorrow we&#x27;re going to start up with chapter 18 uh which is called The Retreat from reality and uh stay tuned for that thanks for tuning in today and have a</p>
