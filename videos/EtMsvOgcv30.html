            <p>why are we talking about Zero Point Energy once again well because it&#x27;s basically the backbone of everything I&#x27;ve started to realize it is The Logical conclusion of the science and I think it&#x27;s vitally important that everybody understand how it works this video we&#x27;re going to watch today guys is incredible it explains every aspect that we need to know from 0 point energy so you can actually transmit energy through the ether longitudinally which is essentially like invisibly we can&#x27;t see it we can&#x27;t even detect it electromagnetically but we can still do it and this is the where Tesla had this all figured out and the reason why that&#x27;s controversial is because people don&#x27;t understand that there is an ether filled with energy and the moment you realize that there is all of this stuff comes into play so what do we call the ether filled with energy today they call it the Zero Point Energy field the quantum foam the quantum fluctuations but we just call it the ether cuz we&#x27;re ogs and we call it whatever we want to call it</p>
