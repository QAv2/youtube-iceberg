            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I want to talk to you about something else which you know let&#x27;s see where we go with this incel right and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard of incel I&#x27;m sure you know about it it&#x27;s the Trump tomorrow uh Trump on Thursday uh spoke at the is is at Arizona State University which is the president is Michael Crow the chair who is today and was since its Inception 1999 the chairman of incudal and by the way so what&#x27;s your point with that though my well my point on that is Arizona State University is this really interesting Hub in Arizona it&#x27;s where Obama gave his first commencement speech but it&#x27;s got a huge censorship program there through something called the center on narrative disinformation strategic influence that&#x27;s tied all the way up to the Arizona Supreme Court with this disinformation task force that that Center Center&#x27;s head was uh was spearheading the McCain Institute is highly active there with a giant censorship operation through its strategic Communications program there&#x27;s so much uh censorship of the Trump World that runs through ASU uh and it&#x27;s part of something called their glob GL security initiative the ASU Global Security initiative which is a formal intelligence program uh so it&#x27;s literally an a US Government intelligence funded domestic censorship program and they get a they get $1.6 million from the Pentagon to do this this censorship Black Ops they get uh another couple hundred thousand from the state department and uh and the National Science Foundation but it is just funny that Trump you know sort of like he&#x27;s always walking into the lion&#x27;s den when it comes to everything from the butler rally to going into you know uh neighborhoods that you know most people would think would be hostile to a Republican or going on doing these hostile interviews he&#x27;s he&#x27;s walking into the ASU Lions Den and um so let&#x27;s go through this for the average person that doesn&#x27;t know um if you don&#x27;t mind sharing the history of inel and what they do yep so inel was was created in 1999 uh the internet had been private for about 8 years remember the mil the the internet started off as a DARPA project it was arpa then it would Chang his name to DARPA the defense Advan research projects agency basically it was created in the 1960s by the military uh because the military gets so much paperwork they have to manage the entire American Empire abroad theyve to manage counterinsurgency situations with 300 different languages and dialects they&#x27;re getting inbound paper not just between different agencies within DOD but all of their connected tissue to civil society and universities they&#x27;ve to manage the huge amount of paperwork and so they thought the most efficient way to do that would be using this new digital technology of computers and being able to send digital Communications over a effectively an intranet um you know a DOD in internet then in 1990 we win the Cold War and we are trying to do soft power influence projection uh across the world we we figure that if we can make this internet thing a dual use technology where civilians can build on top of it we can uh we can effectively make this new internet this the same sort of powerful soft power projection tool that that radio was when the CIA created Radio free Europe Radio Liberty Voice of America all these were State Department CIA proprietaries to be able to pipe in uh you sentiment into foreign countries to influence the course of their events to Advantage us interests we had a first mover advantage in movies in film in TV in print so the internet came online in 1991 Google got its start you know at uh in like 1996 is uh when Larry Page and Sergey brenn were Stanford phds but their work that that resulted in Google was a DARPA Grant the DARPA Grant was a joint CIA NSA program for flock for for tracking how birds of a feather flock together because the CIA and NSA began to realize that internet traffic around web 1.0 which was which is blogs and forums and static websites could provide a political early warning radar system for the rise and fall of Insurgency movements who are challenging us interest overseas so that&#x27;s what created Google in from 1996 to 1998 1999 the CIA wants to wants to formalize this this is during the time of this you know Tech boom right you had this uh this this big Tech boom and then you had this sort of bust from 99 into 2001 but around that time the CIA saw how vast this new these new internet Technologies were becoming in terms of in terms of their Market size they&#x27; exploded so fast they began to rival Big Oil within a a decade of their existence where Oil had been around for hundreds of years at that point and so inel was was created so that the CIA could H could basically buy a back Channel influence over tech companies by being early stage investors a venture capital arms so they would get a little Equity stake but then they would also get the liaison back Channel network with all the tech companies that they invested in so they could be used as assets if necessary so they could be used as assets if necessary so if you look at in gra if you can go to iq&#x27;s website if you just go to iq.com and you look at uh maybe maybe it&#x27;s not iqt just type in inq tell and then go to their website there&#x27;s a there there you go what is a website about QT iq.org okay so if you go a little lower accept the cookies and go a little lower and you see the the the portfolio keep going lower keep going lower keep going lower okay so no go back Rob go back okay stay right there okay gitlab you see paler right uh which if I&#x27;m not is that Peter I think it is Peter data braks Advanced navigation and I think at one point qel in qel bot Keyhole which Keyhole was like the map right and then khole was sold to Google then Google I think in 0403 they bought it in 0405 they turn into Google Earth y so in other words Google Earth that we see now was once owned by the CIA and sold to Google and then the Google Sergey and Larry have connection through Stanford right which you were talking about earlier that they came about when I think about Google and and I see what they&#x27;re you know how they got started between all the other guys how how much you think CIA has access to everything that Google does access and influence to what Google does well I think they&#x27;re backchannel conversations but I think most of them are had through Civil Society organizations staffed by CIA people rather than CIA directly like you were talking about earlier yes okay yes and that&#x27;s what the function of a lot of these multi-stakeholder forums are or some of these you know uh private NOS that are often funded directly by the Pentagon or the state department there&#x27;s a few things while we&#x27;re on this actually on the incel if you look up I believe it was Lee Fang who was the author if you look up Lee Fang uh incel Instagram Twitter mining I pointed this out the other day because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s useful you know this is cuz you know I saw that you had the Global Security initiative from ASU pulled up and so this is and I mentioned they they do all this inter censorship work if you click that intercept article from April 2016 and you know this is this is part of what that is you know I mentioned that in the 1990s the CIA and NSA were basically paying Stanford to fund the research of Sergey Brinn and Larry Page for their mining of of uh search engine aggregation results in order to detect what people around the world were searching for and what communities they were forming and what they were saying well the well the CIA is doing the same thing through incel for the firms that do all the mass data scraping of tweets Instagram photos YouTube videos Facebook posts so that you have this kind of allseeing eye from the intelligence World about political sentiment on social media um the uh yeah the other thing that I was I was going to mention was was I forget if it was on the inel front it&#x27;ll come back to me but we can move on to the other if you go back to incel&#x27;s Wikipedia Rob just go to in&#x27;s Wikipedia I want to know the founders go go is this a so go to the founders Norm let&#x27;s see who Norm is if you can zoom in there zoom in uh so is a US Aerospace businessman who served as us under Secretary of the army 757 Aus was served as a chairman of locked Martin Corporation he was chairman of the review of the United States human space flight plans committee 83 he was elected member of the National Academy of engineering for imaginative blending of the skill engineer and if you go little is that it that was the career so where where is the and then go back to the other founder let&#x27;s see who the other guy is uh yeah he&#x27;s a little bit interesting as well American techn who got a start as a video game designer then Co founded okay can you freeze right there yeah so you notice the other founder came from Lockheed right and this one is the state Department&#x27;s Foreign Affairs policy board this is what I talk about all the time which is that the CIA is is because the the teup to this was you know how extensive is the cia&#x27;s back Channel or influence over Google and I always try to stress that this this the CIA is is second Fiddle in everything it does it is it only exists for for two purposes one is it is a plausibly deniable Support Agency for the state department to pursue State Department goals or it&#x27;s a plausibly deniable covert support unit for the military for paramilitary DOD activity anytime you go from CIA director to Head of the State Department like Mike Pompeo did under Trump or anytime you go from CIA director to head of the defense department like Leon Panetta under under Clinton that&#x27;s a promotion the CIA has to answer to the state department in everything it does if it&#x27;s doing forign if it&#x27;s doing National interest work it has to answer to the dod for everything that it does on the National Security front if it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s supporting the dod it is not the final boss in the room it is you know it&#x27;s it just does the dirty work but but the idea it&#x27;s not the brains of the operation it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the it&#x27;s sort of the low-level Hitman that Tony Soprano sends in to collect debt it&#x27;s not the head of the head of the of the of the mafia in that sense who&#x27;s the head well what you have is this apparatus that&#x27;s congealed you have this def defense diplomacy intelligence apparatus and so you have these corporate Financial stakeholders who work together with the Diplomat sphere and the military sphere to create a consensus and the CIA will Implement whatever plausibly deniable covert action consistent with the you know the plausible deniability NC 10-2 Doctrine in order to implement that but that that is that plan is made above the Ci&#x27;s head and they have to answer every step of the way to that so behind every dirty clo and Dagger CIA operation is a dirty assistant secretary at the state department or a dirty member of the state Department&#x27;s policy planning staff or a dirty Secretary of Defense or or a dirty person on the National Security Council who&#x27;s coordinating that it&#x27;s they are they are the the the functionaries they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re the arms they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re not the brains of it and but what you see here actually in incel is the representation of both the state department and the Pentagon and the other thing I want to stress though and I I just remember this is the second thing that I want to come back to was when when we were talking about uh Google and its early role with the CIA and the NSA and DARPA that sounds like an extraordinary story to people who got the typical sort of high school history lesson but in fact this is actually the same story as it has been for every major technology advancement in in the past Century and a half if you go to my X account you type in you type in history GPS I&#x27;m going to you you&#x27;ll see a video you&#x27;ll see a video by I believe it was George fredman who was the former head of stratfor stratfor is known as the private CIA it&#x27;s yeah this is the one so just yeah so just to tee this up real quick so this is the guy who you know was was the head of the the private CIA basically the career track that c there&#x27;s two tracks at the CIA there&#x27;s the analyst track and the operations track the analysts do intelligence the operations do you know overthrowing governments propaganda you know count counter Intel all that stuff but the analyst track they go on to jobs either at universities or or at private sector intelligence firms like croll or like uh or or like stratfor um you know the straford email leaks were actually a big deal with the with this the uh Assange wiked leaks but but this is George Freeman giving a talk I believe it was in Dubai but he&#x27;s basically counseling one of the one of the gulf uh Nation governments about how to create a robust technology sector because everyone knows the biggest game in town is tech tech big Tech is overt Big Oil even if you&#x27;re an oil Nation you need to diversify where your incomes come from and this if you if you&#x27;re not competing on technology you&#x27;re going to lose economically to those who do so he&#x27;s brought in to speak at this at this conference a few years ago and he&#x27;s telling them listen we believe in capitalism we believe in you know um you know in the power of the free market but you want you want a really kick butt free market capitalist Tech sphere to grow in your country you need to have the government subsidize it I know it sounds a little bit counterintuitive yes he&#x27;s saying you need to have your defense sector fund this and subsidize it and he says he basically says I know this sounds counterintuitive and it&#x27;s a little at odds with free market but let me tell you the history of how America got this way and then if you want to let this play this clip&#x27;s about 2 minutes but goes over the history of the GPS the cell phone the camera all this I want to begin with technology because there is a belief here that technology is the key to geopolitical power well perhaps it is but let&#x27;s first discuss technology so for example this is a iPhone you have you must have many of them it&#x27;s obviously a useful tool and you have no idea of its history I will now tell you its history the cell phone was developed by the United States Army in the 1970s was first deployed by the US Army so your cell phone is a military tool the microchip was commissioned by the US Air Force to fly the F14 and also cruise missiles GPS you use that to find your way around so did the US Navy which commissioned the building at the GPS Squadron so it submarines could know where they are there&#x27;s of course the camera we all love the camera I don&#x27;t but my wife does it was developed for space satellite so that the film did not have to be dropped to Earth it took pictures that could be transmitted as data to Earth and of course there&#x27;s the internet without which this wouldn&#x27;t have any place which is developed by DARPA defense Advance research projects agency to move information from one point to another quickly so we didn&#x27;t have to mail it in other words to understand the technology of this age you must understand the geopolitical requirements of the United States the military that it created and the technology that it create created as well so you cannot look at the cell phone phone the iPhone the very cute little thing the camera and everything else without understanding its military Origins who is this guy George Freedman this is the uh this is the head of Strat for the private CIA hi this is Mike Benz you can connect with me on Manet for any questions that you have on internet censorship foreign policy National Security The Blob or if you want to know what a particular institution is doing that you may have seen or have questions about in terms of its control over the information ecosystem so connect with me on man if you enjoy
