            <p>can toxic Mercury be made into a motor that&#x27;s exactly what Michael Faraday thought and tried to demonstrate back in 1821 Mercury is a liquid metal at room temperature and being a metal means it can conduct electricity through it so Faraday took a magnet and placed it into a pool of mercury he then placed a wire into the pool and another free moving one next to the magnet then when we pass electricity Through the Wire it creates a circular magnetic field around the wire this magnetic field interacts with the magnet&#x27;s magnetic field generating a force that causes the wire to spin around the magnet through this remarkable demonstration Faraday converted electrical energy into mechanical motion proving an important principle electricity into motion but this works backwards as well we can take motion and turn it into electricity in generators essentially big electric motors</p>
