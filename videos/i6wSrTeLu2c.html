            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>let me do this I&#x27;m going to see Mark Sokol is here I believe Mark is up next um and so the only way to top these two presentations is for Mark to blow stuff up but fortunately he&#x27;s got his pocket off impulse generator working so we should be able to blow some stuff up today uh Mark there we go can you hear me yes okay now are you ready do you have do you have the explosion sequence primed for us uh yes are you getting feedback sir turn the sound down over there so if I could and Mark needs no introduction I you know um but So for anybody who missed it last time over here uh so Mark you did a demo of the Pogba impulse generator right and you&#x27;ve been building this thing for quite a while you guys had um a leak in the vacuum chamber and if I remember correctly uh part of the problem there was it was letting the pressure equalize too much so you didn&#x27;t have enough pressure because of the leak and that came out of the fluid basically cracking it right the cryofluid cracked it uh yes so the cryo the cryogenic uh cracked uh the cryogenic um where the liquid nitrogen was entering the chamber it caused a crack in the acrylic um so instead of repairing that last one we just replaced it with a new um acrylic board with a different uh superconductor in this experiment uh another problem that we had with the so he um uh the high speed camera which is right behind me was too close to the experiment so this time we moved the experiment all the way down to the other side of the shop it&#x27;s about 30 feet away um there&#x27;s a zoom lens on the high-speed camera and if you check out on our other uh log into this conference um over there Falcon Labs there&#x27;s actually a still frame of the device firing this is without the helmholtz coil and without the superconductor being chilled uh we were just firing the um uh the marks generator you&#x27;re able to see uh the frame where it fired so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s pretty cool that that happened just a couple of um minutes ago so um I&#x27;m just you guys a rundown of the experiment well and thank you Mark thank you so much for redoing this also turn the audio back on over there if you guys want here Okay so here&#x27;s the high-speed camera setup uh with zoom lens and the experiment is all the way down here this time um basically we have little lead weights that are hanging from this uh setup over here um and supposedly this experiment&#x27;s close to um create a gravity impulse so if there is an Impulse we&#x27;ll see a movement in these lead weights uh what&#x27;s going on inside the vacuum chamber is there is a superconductor a small Gap um then there&#x27;s a silver popper Puck over there that&#x27;s acting as the ground these two coils are large comb Holtz coils that are providing a homogeneous magnetic field um across the spark gap so it&#x27;s basically essentially a large spark plug um and providing power is a one million volt March generator that me and Jeremiah pop built uh back a year or two ago specifically for this purpose um what&#x27;s powering the helmhole spoils is a hybrid battery from the Hybrid battery shop in the uh base of this chamber um so that&#x27;s pretty much uh the setup over here now if I can get the guys over here you can you can start setting it up it will take a couple of minutes to uh chill the superconductor down to cryogenic temperatures and uh once that happens we&#x27;ll be ready to fire um on you should highlight the second uh the Falcon labs um to you as well because that is going to be live with the high speed camera as soon as uh um the data comes in from that as well okay uh Tom can you pour some liquid nitrogen into one of those doors okay so Mark I have both cameras pinned okay perfect so perfect yeah it looks great man actually this this looks this looks awesome okay so here here&#x27;s actually the live view that&#x27;s what it looks like live right now um we have uh chachin over here he&#x27;s going to be uh the one triggering um the high speed camera you have to push the button within uh 0.3 seconds in order to get the image and uh for the action right now is we&#x27;re scooping out the liquid nitrogen so uh during the Apec anniversary this was all done off camera oh careful there maybe able to just pour it straight in just usually put this off to the side and use the entire uh entire bucket yeah you can pull the whole thing at once okay I&#x27;ll give you a hand with it okay start pouring it in recording on to that part where the uh marks oh you don&#x27;t need that you don&#x27;t need that and to The Copper end spot as much as it will take yeah Tom said he doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing if we knew what we were doing it wouldn&#x27;t be research that&#x27;s a good line for the professor Earl uh uh there starting to turn uh Frosty in there in this setup um I designed in a little pink in the pipe so that liquid nitrogen will tend to stick around closer to the superconductor this may take a while to pull it down probably about five minutes or so uh Tim how about you um can you give guys an overview about this experiment because you you were actually the person who interviewed uh professor potlanov um about his gravity being experiment um back in the 2000s Tim are you there I don&#x27;t think Tim is there but I can explain what the experiment&#x27;s about I&#x27;ll go for it all right so um yeah what uh doctor cutting off did back in the 90s was he has it&#x27;s a copper tube with a superconductor at the end and there&#x27;s a gap between it that&#x27;s the anode and the cathode the cathode is grounded and then these two uh Brown circles around it are our hum holds coils to create a uniform magnetic field so that when the charge leaves the superconductor and the spark crosses the gap it will go in a straight line it&#x27;ll follow the magnetic flux and um the uh the objective is there should be a camera on a Target that&#x27;s going to show us when this thing fires if these um pendulums swing because it would should initiate a gravitational impulse which should be able to swing the pendulums that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the goal um the theory behind it is that the gravitational impulse is related to the magnetic Vector potential and the greater the magnitude of a magnetic Vector potential you can get aimed at the pendulum the more coupling to a gravitational potential you&#x27;ll have so um it&#x27;s kind of like gravito magnetism you know I I really want to hand it to Mark too Mark you&#x27;ve done amazing setup on this the camera the pendulums all this looks really great um of course the team that helped us came out here and set up the pendulum setup uh it does look like we have another leak here I&#x27;m seeing like air flowing very rapidly so you might have to hurry up and just test this thing uh chatine are you ready uh keep pouring until you&#x27;re done yeah how much more do you have in the uh vacuum pump on the vacuum pump is on continuously yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty it&#x27;s about 28 a negative 28. I hear it so uh it&#x27;s not a very strong vacuum okay look up the uh The Conch coil what happened okay let&#x27;s stand back and we&#x27;re gonna fire it now okay where&#x27;s your target uh Target&#x27;s all that all set up just Jean you&#x27;re ready can&#x27;t see it uh you gotta see it on the other camera I don&#x27;t see another camera hey Todd it&#x27;s the Falcon space uh Falcon Labs Falcon labs oh okay good go to Gallery one second did you get ready to fire you got it okay let&#x27;s do one more time [Music] flowing into the chamber um doesn&#x27;t look like anything moved the difference here is that when Clinton off had supposedly according to the paper had a mega Jewel behind it we have how much Mark s [Music] in terms of jewels but we do have plans as soon as we perfect this setup to take it to a um to a lab here in Massachusetts that will be able to give us that Mega Jewel power okay so um we&#x27;re gonna head over to the high speed right now and um try to get a view of what we captured with that um I didn&#x27;t see a spark even on the regular camera so okay how many uh shots did you catcher so you got three oh okay it may have uh covered over a couple of them because there&#x27;s only four signs that were available uh Mark should why don&#x27;t I unpin the Falcon Labs camera yeah right that&#x27;s actually that&#x27;s actually where we&#x27;re going right now oh okay I&#x27;ll leave them both pinned then yeah I Mark I think that this was heads and tails heads and tails better than the last one and this this gives us an excuse the air leak gives us an excuse for next Apec yeah it is visible I caught it on my cell phone but with these kind of experiments things happen very quickly so um it&#x27;s great to have them going on live so this is from from sign one um basically I chop up the memory in the uh camera into four different sections um each one of those each one of those sections gives us 0.31 seconds at 7 500 frames per second um in full resolution with this camera so we&#x27;ll go on to sign two now this should have been ran with the uh with everything and see if we can find the uh Spark um if you don&#x27;t trigger it within 0.3 seconds then all you&#x27;ll see is uh the device just sitting there and try to no I don&#x27;t want to play record speed I don&#x27;t think we captured anything in science it looks like sign three see what that got you capture anything here um Mark there&#x27;s a white frame and that&#x27;s when the uh marks generator goes off so look for like a so you get an EMP on them oh there it is yeah I got I just saw it it&#x27;s right right around here is where it happens the thing is you&#x27;re looking for one frame out of uh a couple thousand if you&#x27;re running them at 30 frames a second in order for playback it&#x27;s pretty hard to even see the uh the spark it&#x27;s right over here there okay now some of this may not show up on Zoom until I slow it down a lot more oh there it is foreign there we go I&#x27;ll go back one frame at a time okay there it is so that that is it firing uh you can see the uh the airflow coming in around the pipe so we probably have to epoxy this again the acrylic didn&#x27;t break in this instance so it probably just needs a second uh thing of acrylic but that is just one frame out of uh like 10 000 or something like that no uh I&#x27;m sorry what are you able to share the screen yeah we&#x27;re sharing the screen right now can you see it no I can just see I can all I can see is you um Tim can you fix that it&#x27;s the Falcon Labs uh screen yes it and it should I&#x27;m not sure why that&#x27;s not showing right actually allow Mark to share screen or something no it&#x27;s the Falcon Labs uh screen so yeah hold on hold on hold on okay I&#x27;m sorry about that I had pins in place and it must not have been they must have been glitching or something in Zoom yes that is the high speed uh view I&#x27;m gonna Zoom it and sort of just grab those last few pictures you&#x27;ll see exactly what we&#x27;re talking about so what is this is this like a gravity of some kind of gravity wave this is a gravity experiment called the uh parcletino of gravity impulse experiment uh yeah I can I can put a link in chat oh is the how much coil power down check make sure the helm was called power down yeah unplug it make sure we don&#x27;t destroy the battery and burn up the cable okay so that is from sign three and from sine four let me see what we captured here uh we can do the analysis on this oh there it is that was pretty visible that was probably a larger spark from there&#x27;s a 12 volt power supply okay uh was it unplugged oh okay so so that helmets is probably pretty hot okay and are you guys seeing this yes okay yeah so now if we zoom in a little more should be able to get the actual image okay so that&#x27;s the actual image where it fired um we are seeing some ionization around the grounding wire as well so I guess probably need a better rounding cable if it&#x27;s powerful enough to ionize the grounding here well it may be a problem this is uh third attempt this is seconds attempt we didn&#x27;t capture much um this was without any uh without the helmholtz coil powered up um it&#x27;s spraying ions out vertically from the grounding part uh so there&#x27;s basically an alligator clip over here um attached to a copper rod and at the end of the copper Rod is a puck of silver that&#x27;s acting as the uh the anode in this case and without the helmholtz coil powered up um the ion beam just flows out in all directions but with with it on it seems to be going she used to be a lot more condensed and this is also with the cryogenics attached um in this last attempt it seems like we&#x27;ve got a much we&#x27;ve got a couple more Jewels powered into it that may be because I um charged up the uh the marks thing a little slower so the capacitors had a have had more time to accept a charge um and that is the end of the results of what we got from this run of the uh public experiment did take quite a while to set this up on its own we&#x27;re probably gonna have to fix there&#x27;s there&#x27;s an error leak coming in from over here you can see air flowing along the pipe and it&#x27;s probably somewhere right over there um where there&#x27;s air getting into the chamber um especially when we started applying cryogenics so it may be the shrinking um you know cause some problems but well we&#x27;ll get that figured out and give it another run yeah that&#x27;s wonderful so do you do you think you think you might be able to run this next Apec this could be a continuing Saga uh yeah I mean the thing is kind of like set up already so there&#x27;s not that much work to uh get going um and our our goal is to get this experimental point where we&#x27;re able to take it up to Massachusetts uh where they have a a mega Jewel like several million jewels of power available at 2.3 million volts and at that point we&#x27;ll come to them we&#x27;ll say hey we know how to do everything else give us the power let&#x27;s see what happens then um this is probably less than 100 joules it is at a million almost a million volts but it is less than 100 joules so the fact that we&#x27;re not seeing anything is not indicative of uh you know pure failure uh it&#x27;s definitely failure at 100 joules but um you go from 100 to a million that&#x27;s more several orders of magnitude do you think the do you think the magnets are strong enough in the helmholtz coils because they&#x27;re they&#x27;re quite a distance away how strong do they need to be I I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m not sure but you you talked to potlanov back in the day right you had an interview with him you&#x27;re fine for American it has to be that big to get a uniform field throughout the space where we&#x27;re uh trying to get it to work okay um also perhaps got applications are there for the program well so what what Parkland office said was he it and okay so in the chamber you basically have a a mostly evacuated chamber um with basically a spark gap onto a superconducting electrode and then you&#x27;ve got coils wrapped around it right so Mark is definitely you know and and poconoff put it in the paper I put a link to that in chat supposedly when you discharge I think it was five million volts or something like that um from a marks generator it generates a beam of gravitational energy and pogbanov specifically said that this um he said that it warps metals like hitting them with a hammer and he said that it would it would crumble brick and he said that it propagated he he said he followed the beam path of damage essentially after this thing I believe he said that it went close to a mile if I remember right or a kilometer I I don&#x27;t recall it was quite a while ago Columbus Ohio um that can&#x27;t be shielded against that can go several miles um probably uh military applications but if the concept is true and if we can get away from having to use superconductors and using uh maybe High electron drift velocity materials like graphene instead um it may have practical applications for uh space flight as well yeah yeah I I mean I I don&#x27;t understanding gravity understanding gravity on yeah the idea is Todd explained it was that it&#x27;s uh just a bunch of electrons that pair up become Cooper Pairs and then they they meet this uh vacuum and they push push uh space-time with them um I mean Todd can explain it a little better there&#x27;s several different theories about why this experiment would work um uh yes there is a vacuum there um the chamber the entire chamber that you see in front of you is a an acrylic tube uh with a vacuum pump attached to it um vacuum pump is actually still on right now and um is it an ion pump no no this is a two-stage it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not an expensive or high-end pump we&#x27;re not looking for a pure vacuum like Tim explained um this was a weak vacuum um somebody else recommended uh that we try a low pressure helium atmosphere in there which would be kind of interesting to try um well I was thinking something similar which is instead of uh instead of uh basically you back pressure it with the dry nitrogen from your that you produce from your ln2 tank because nitrogen so when I used to test the infrared sensors I would use cryogenic liquids and the big problem was that it would ice up really quick ice up and then the problem is that uh ice that thin layer of ice is that created that&#x27;s a point of uh leakage current so you&#x27;re basically leaking uh a lot of your your currents going into the into the the water vapor basically and so um by using dry nitrogen you that&#x27;s what you would use to keep the thing from icing up because then it&#x27;s not gonna have it&#x27;s not gonna ice unless you get below the temperature of uh you know liquid nitrogen which you&#x27;re putting in there so just a suggestion that you you have a tank of dry nitrogen and you just back pressure it went um balloons here that we&#x27;re thinking of uh putting in some helium inside because uh helium at uh around four Kelvin or at pretty low temperatures will become a super fluid um so there&#x27;s a possibility that with the impulse and the cold temperatures that we have which aren&#x27;t quite cold enough but perhaps we get some of the super fluid um yeah when helium is a lot more problematic than liquid nitrogen you have to have a a vacuum doer and I worked on a long way not not liquid nitrogen I&#x27;m talking about nitrogen from a uh from a happy birthday balloon okay and so you&#x27;re saying basically you just use regular regular helium gas essentially which is a nurse yeah a good idea since it&#x27;s a nerdcast another thing to try it&#x27;s back uh backfill it with um argon gas um that we use for our welding machine so that was another that was another concept isn&#x27;t that poison gas now argon no our argon&#x27;s not poisonous okay good you&#x27;re breathing argon right now oh okay Trace by now argon argon&#x27;s about one percent in the air I keep remembering something about the disc having to spin yeah that&#x27;s a different experiment but how are you going to get a disc like this to spin I I would I would Marvel at the engineering challenge on its own to get a cryogenic disc inside of a vacuum chamber with a helmets coil millions of volts of electricity and it&#x27;s spinning maybe a Lego Legos might come up with something that we could use you know just uh I&#x27;ve always been a fan of connects Mark I I think I think this is a really brilliant experiment you know it looks compelling I mean and you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s well constructed so you know I you guys have put a ton of work into this I in fact when you&#x27;re done here we need to do we definitely need to do an Applause when we reach when you&#x27;re done showing when you&#x27;re done showcasing this uh I think I&#x27;m done showcasing it for now um I&#x27;m probably gonna snap a couple of these uh little shots of the experiment running and upload them all together onto YouTube or you know we could put it on the uh the Apec Channel as well okay well let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do this then I let me remove the spotlight I want to put this thing on gallery everybody mark stokal and the Falcon space Falcon Labs team these guys deserve an enormous hand yeah we&#x27;re clapping I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll clap again oh Ted Pittman&#x27;s here as well oh Ted welcome sir Ted yeah yeah we we actually built something really cool with Ted but we&#x27;re keeping it on it looks really amazing it&#x27;s gonna be coming out later and uh you guys should stay tuned for the gravity diode that&#x27;s his um his gyroscope machine in Quad form we&#x27;ll put four of them together so that they balance out each other&#x27;s uh wobbles and uh right now we&#x27;re working through the Kinks of uh the motors control he&#x27;s actually on the computer right now trying to figure out the Kings um I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gonna be ready for it is it gonna be ready today he doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be ready today for our presentation but um uh my fingers are all chopped up from all the metal Tom as well he had very sharp edges on that when you machine stuff sometimes end up with really sharp 90 degree edges that can cut your fingers uh Michael you have your hand up yeah um just a quick question um while you&#x27;re on Club knob machines still set up more or less it&#x27;ll be interesting to try putting the weights in other areas around the thing just to see what would happen might as well while it&#x27;s all set up is is there a way to do that Mark I mean do you think you could limp it along in terms of sorry I will I&#x27;ll have to go back there and see how badly that leak uh is Maybe not today I mean yeah I don&#x27;t think I should do that live because because the setup alone would probably take a half an hour which all right you&#x27;re just gonna watch me you know organized stuff but I probably could do it but I I think it&#x27;s a brilliant experiment I think it&#x27;s a and so to my knowledge and modernist wrote the paper right they never did video or anything like that uh Claude power and I think you sent me to Claude Claude power in France did a replication if I remember correctly and he claimed produced results but he&#x27;s not going to share what he he believes is secret sauce and I think that&#x27;s it I think you were you were the third person in the world to attempt this so um let&#x27;s not forget uh Mr George Hathaway ran um a replication of this experiment um and he was using uh uh Van de Graaff generators two Van de Graaff generators uh which have a lot less power in terms of jewels than our current setup um and he used all glass and he was going crazy about getting the most perfect vacuum for his experiment um which isn&#x27;t true to the experiment because the experiment itself didn&#x27;t have a perfect vacuum it had a like you said a weak vacuum an imperfect vacuum okay okay you interviewed uh popcornov back in the 2000s right yeah I interviewed him to I I think I interviewed him three or four times overall actually but I and then the the force beam experiment if I remember right there was one and then I did a follow-up it&#x27;s it&#x27;s been it&#x27;s been a long time though um what is his current uh status is he able to uh come on Apec and talk about this no I I haven&#x27;t heard you know I can reach out to him I haven&#x27;t heard from him in about two years since since the since the end of the pandemic actually uh probably December 2020 so just about two years old has an explanation for popular from gravity being generator in um his book subconetics oh and Brandon should we mention uh Paul Paul is very ill also Brandon mentioned that before the before the conference um Paul was I&#x27;m very ill with cancer and he&#x27;s had it for a while but he had he hadn&#x27;t wanted it known about before and that he he may have only a few days to live so he&#x27;s increased at the moment with his wife and family live long Paul Paul is actually one of The Inspirations that got me into uh anti-gravity his his book uh anti-gravity uh propulsion um was the first book I ever got on this subject and I read it thoroughly so yeah Brendan thank you for sharing that I I didn&#x27;t I wasn&#x27;t aware of that either I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll just reach out an email and you know okay thank you I see uh Robert Tobias has his uh hand up oh yeah Robert go for it sir yeah um have have you been in contact with uh Dr thorsten Ludwig you met him at uh the uh Albuquerque New Mexico conference according to Thurston anyway but uh he has some interesting historical information on pod Clinic both pod Clinic his father and some Austrian physicist whose Name Escapes me uh who provides some historical background um the name doesn&#x27;t ring a bell I meet a lot of people at these conferences and uh don&#x27;t necessarily reach out to them that&#x27;s okay I can give you his email address I can put it in the chat if you could put that in chat um you know I had Robert if if I think if if I think you&#x27;re alluding to what I think you&#x27;re alluding to there was this idea that uh paulov&#x27;s father might have gotten some of this from secret weapons research during World War II that&#x27;s that&#x27;s correct yeah I I and I&#x27;ve heard that I&#x27;ve heard that from a couple of sources as well I I&#x27;ve never had any confirmation of that but well any at any rate uh thorsten uh might provide some additional confirmation on that okay wonderful okay well Mark thank you sir thank you so so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do this uh let me let me go back into my website here and see where we&#x27;re at I think next was um I think Todd was next right um yeah so Todd actually and that comes back with Mark here it&#x27;s another experiment yeah with pod um using the same high voltage okay well but before we do that though let me let me put this thing again a gal review Mark I gotta give him another Applause I want to do this real quick I mean he he has been working like crazy he&#x27;s working on a ton of different devices to park them off device though is it brilliant I mean you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot to try and build and they they&#x27;ve had all sorts of little technical quirks and stuff like that so mark thank you sir I can&#x27;t thank you enough it yeah I mean yeah that&#x27;s a lot to pull off you know there&#x27;s gonna be bumps along the road but but thank you for demonstrating that</p>
