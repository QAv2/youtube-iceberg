            <p>Ludwick oiz katsky Poland April 1945 sir these bodies in the wall according to their dog tags they haven&#x27;t even been recruited yet they won&#x27;t be born for another 30 years welcome to the war maos archive where tonight we uncover the terrifying truth behind Nazi Germany&#x27;s most classified project a device that didn&#x27;t just kill its test subjects but erased them from time itself SS obber group INF furer Hans camer stood before the massive steel door of complex 7 his leather gloves creaking as he clenched his fists the April Wind howled through the owl mountains carrying with it the distant Thunder of Soviet artillery time was running out behind him Dr Ernst schaer shifted nervously his wire rimmed glass is fogging in the pre-dawn chill the scientist&#x27;s hands trembled as he thumbed through his log book filled with calculations and observations from Project Kronos or as the soldiers had taken to calling it de glocka the test subjects her Ober Gren furer schaer said quietly they&#x27;re showing signs we&#x27;ve never seen before temporal displacement cellular degradation wber aged 40 years in the span of minutes Hoffman&#x27;s body he swallowed hard we found parts of him embedded in the chamber walls as if his flesh had somehow merged with the steel itself Cam&#x27;s cold eyes never left the door can it be controlled controlled Schaefer&#x27;s voice cracked with all due respect we&#x27;re dealing with forces we barely understand the electromagnetic readings are off the charts the device it&#x27;s affecting local SpaceTime in ways that defy that wasn&#x27;t my question doctor camer turned his scarred face half hidden in Shadow the furer demands results the Reich cannot lose this war not when we stand on the brink of such power you will contain it you will harness it or I will personally ensure your family understands the cost of failure as if in response to his threats a low vibration emanated from behind the steel door the fluorescent lights flickered casting strange Shadows on the concrete walls both men fell silent as the humming grew louder rising to a frequency that made their teeth ache it&#x27;s happening again Schaefer whispered taking an involuntary step backward the temporal anomalies are increasing in frequency each test creates more instability we need to shut it down before the scientists words were cut short by a sound that shouldn&#x27;t have been possible the Screech of twisting metal and shattering bones followed by the desperate screams of men trapped between moments of time through the small observation window they watched in horror as reality itself seemed to bend and fold within the chamber when the emergency teams finally breached the test chamber hours later they found the night shift research team had become part of the facility itself their bodies twisted and stretched merged with steel and concrete in ways that defied explanation only their eyes remained unchanged wide with Terror at whatever they had witnessed in their final moments cam ordered the bodies documented then destroyed within days complex 7 would be systematically dismantled its records purged its Personnel eliminated or reassigned but as Allied Forces closed in on the facility something waited in the darkness beneath the mountains something that had peered through the hole they torn in reality and decided to stay two weeks later Captain Daniel Carter of the US office of strategic Services crouched in the underbrush outside complex 7 studying the facility through his field binoculars behind him three members of his Special Operations team waited silently their Thompson submachine guns at the ready their mission secure any advanced German technology before before the advancing Soviet forces could claim it Intel shows minimal resistance Carter whispered lowering the binoculars most SS Personnel evacuated last week Dr Ernst schaer the lead scientist surrendered to our forces yesterday he&#x27;s being interrogated at HQ now Sergeant Mike Reynolds shifted uncomfortably beside him what did they build down there cap must be something big if both us and the Russians want it so bad Carter recalled his briefing with schaer earlier that day the scientist had sat hunched in his chair hands shaking as he chain smoked American cigarettes there are things man was not meant to touch he&#x27; muttered repeatedly we were fools such arrogant fools according to schaer they were working on some kind of advanced propulsion system Carter answered carefully keeping the classified details to himself code name Daka The Bell the team moved forward under cover of Darkness approaching the facility&#x27;s Outer Perimeter the concrete walls loomed ahead topped with rusted barbed wire the main gate hung partially open its guard posts abandoned as they passed through Carter noticed strange Scorch marks on the walls not from weapons fire but perfect geometric patterns that seemed to spiral inward as if the concrete itself had been Twisted by some immense Force the silence was oppressive No Birds Sang in the surrounding Forest even their footsteps seemed muffled as if sound itself was being distorted around the complex the air had a metallic taste making Carter&#x27;s fillings ache they found the first body just inside the main building an SS guard slumped against the wall his uniform covered in Frost despite the mild Spring weather his face was contorted in a Grimace of Terror skins stretched tight over bones that seemed somehow wrong as if they&#x27;d been rearranged beneath the flesh the man&#x27;s service record found in his pocket was dated 1975 that&#x27;s impossible Reynolds breathed examining the document this is dated 30 years years from now check the rest of the floor Carter ordered trying to keep his voice steady but don&#x27;t touch anything you don&#x27;t have to something very wrong happened here as his men spread out Carter approached a heavy blast door marked project Kronos authorized personnel only the control panel beside it still had power emitting a soft Violet glow as he reached for the keypad the metal beneath his fingers vibrated subtly almost like a purr of recognition and deep below something answered with a low resonant hum that he felt in his bones The Descent into complex 7&#x27;s lower levels felt like entering a tomb emergency lighting cast sickly Shadows across walls that bore those same spiraling Scorch marks more pronounced here Carter&#x27;s team moved in practiced formation their boots echoing strangely on metal stairs that seemed to vibrate beneath their feet Jesus Christ private Miller whispered his light Illuminating a scene from a nightmare the corridor ahead was littered with bodies or what remained of them German scientists in their lab coats lay twisted and broken some partially embedded in the walls as if they&#x27; tried to phase through solid steel and failed halfway their faces were frozen in expressions of indescribable horror skin pulled tight over skulls that had aged decades in minutes Reynolds knelt beside one corpse examining a metallic disc around its neck some kind of measurement device the needles buried in the red and he squinted at the tiny display these readings can&#x27;t be right according to this we experiencing multiple time stamps simultaneously Carter&#x27;s training hadn&#x27;t prepared him for this the OSS had briefed him on Nazi super weapons Jets Rockets even rumored Atomic research but nothing like this as they approached the main chamber the air itself seemed to thicken time stretching like taffy his watch had stopped but the second hand moved erratically sometimes forward sometimes back the chamber door bore the Nazi Eagle clutching a swastika below it the words project Kronos in Stark Gothic lettering it took three of them to heave it open revealing what lay Beyond D glocka dominated the center of the vast room a bell-shaped device nearly 9 ft tall constructed of dark metal that seemed drink in light a lattice of copper coils and strange crystallin structures encased it humming with residual energy most disturbing was the metallic chair facing it its restraints torn TN open from the inside surrounded by scattered notes and scientific instruments cap Miller called out his voice shaking you need to see this the private stood before a glass observation window Beyond which lay what appeared to be a testing chamber inside reality itself seemed to blur and shift as Carter watched Shadows moved across the walls human shapes performing actions that hadn&#x27;t happened yet or perhaps had happened thousands of times he saw German scientists conducting experiments Allied soldiers searching the facility Soviet troops securing the area all overlapping all existing simultaneously in that Twisted space then he saw himself standing at that same window watching ing but this other Carter was older his face gaunt and haunted their eyes met Across The Impossible divide of time and his doppelganger lips moved in a silent warning the Bell pulsed emitting that violet light schaer had described the humming Rose to a frequency that made Carter&#x27;s teeth vibrate and his vision blur behind him Miller screamed a sound sound that stretched and distorted before cutting off abruptly Carter turned to see the private aging rapidly his young face withering like accelerated film footage until only a desiccated husk remained collapsing into dust that hung suspended in air that no longer obeyed linear time fall back Carter ordered dragging Reynolds away from Miller&#x27;s Remains the dust that had been their teammate hung most Motionless In The Air Defying Gravity Reynolds stumbled his face pale with shock fumbling with his Thompson as he retreated sir Reynolds voice cracked what the hell happened to Miller people don&#x27;t just age to death it&#x27;s not possible before Carter could respond a metallic shriek pierced the air delock&#x27;s surface rippled like liquid mercury the violet light pulsing in syn with a deep subsonic hum that made their bones resonate the walls began to blur reality becoming fluid around the device through the observation window Carter watched in horror as temporal after images multiplied he saw German scientists conducting their final experiment their bodies twisting and merging with the facility he saw Soviet troops who hadn&#x27;t arrived yet their forms Ghostly and transparent moving through walls as if they existed in a different phase of reality and everywhere scattered through these Phantom moments he glimpsed his older self watching waiting trying to warn them of something they couldn&#x27;t yet understand the logs Carter muttered forcing himself to focus on concrete details he grabbed a leatherbound notebook from a nearby desk its Pages filled with cramped German scientific notation we need to understand what they were trying to do here Reynolds peered over his shoulder as Carter flipped through the do doents October 1944 initial tests demonstrate localized temporal displacement December 1944 test subject Weber shows signs of accelerated aging February 1945 breakthrough in the containment field but the power requirements are immense the final entry dated April 1945 was written in in a shaky hand it&#x27;s alive God help us the Bell is alive we didn&#x27;t create a machine we opened a door and now it&#x27;s learning adapting hungry camer refuses to shut it down he doesn&#x27;t understand that it&#x27;s already too late time isn&#x27;t just broken here it&#x27;s aware a sound like twisting metal echoed through the chamber Carter looked up to see the restraint chair beginning to move rotating slowly to face them of its own accord the leather straps wed like living things reaching out into empty air and behind it th glocka surface had become completely fluid Rippling with patterns that hurt the eyes to look at sir Reynolds whispered backing away we need to call this in get a containment team down here this is way above our pay grade Carter reached for his radio but only static answered punctuated by fragments of Transmissions that hadn&#x27;t been sent yet through the chaos he caught glimpses of future conversations evacuation orders containment protocols screamed warnings cut short something was moving inside the Bell now a shape forming in the liquid metal as it began to emerge Carter realized with Dawning horror that he recognized the Twisted figure here he&#x27;d seen it in the observation window in countless temporal Echoes trying to warn them it was himself aged beyond recognition trapped in an endless loop of moments the Twisted version of Carter emerged from delock&#x27;s liquid surface its movements jerky and wrong like a marionette with tangled strings its uniform a US Army officer&#x27;s dress blues had partially fused with its flesh brass buttons sinking into gray skin that rippled with the same metallic Sheen as the bell you have to destroy it the thing that had once been Carter rasped its voice layered with Echoes of countless repetitions now before it convulsed bones cracking as temporal distortions racked its frame before it takes everything before I become [Music] this Reynolds raised his Thompson hands shaking cap orders before Carter could respond the Bell pulsed again reality buckled Reynolds screamed as his left arm suddenly aged decades withering to bone while his right remained unchanged he staggered dropping his weapon which hit the floor and shattered like glass as if it had experienced experienced centuries of rust in an instant the power source Carter&#x27;s future self gestured toward a bank of humming generators destroy it it&#x27;s the only way to his words dissolved into static body flickering between different ages different moments of Decay Carter grabbed Reynold&#x27;s good arm dragging him toward the generator Bank his mind raced through his demolitions training if they could overload the power system create a feedback surge through the bell&#x27;s containment field the air grew thick like moving through syrup Carter saw Phantom versions of himself and Reynolds attempting the same desperate run some succeeding others caught by temporal waves that aged them to dust or Twisted them into impossible shapes the bells humming Rose to a maddening pitch here Carter pulled a thermite grenade from his pack standard issue for destroying sensitive equipment his hands moved through memorized motions pin lever 5-sec fuse but as he drew back to throw time stretched like rubber he saw it all simultaneously the grenade leaving his hand arcing through air that rippled with violet light the bell&#x27;s surface reaching out with tendrils of liquid metal Reynolds diving for cover his future self screaming a warning that came too late and too early and exactly on time the grenade detonated in a burst of white hot fire that seemed to burn through time itself the last thing Carter saw before reality tore apart was his own face not the Twisted future version but himself as a child watching through the observation window with eyes full of horror at what he would become the thermites white hot flame seemed to freeze in midair its light refracting through layers of fractured time Carter felt reality Splinter around him each Shard containing a different moment a different possibility through the chaos he glimpsed Reynolds crawling toward the exit his aged arm trailing behind him like dead weight move Carter shouted his voice echoing strangely overlapping with versions of itself the generators were overloading electricity arcing between them in impossible patterns D glock&#x27;s surface had become a Maelstrom of liquid metal pulling in light debris and fragments of time itself his future self flickered and vanished but its final words hung in the air you can&#x27;t escape what you&#x27;ve already become they reached the chamber door as the first temporal shock wave hit Carter felt it pass through him like arctic cold bringing flashes of other lives other deaths he saw himself as an old man dying in bed as a young Soldier falling in Korea as a middle-aged scientist studying the bell&#x27;s remains each Vision felt real felt lived before being torn away Reynolds collapsed halfway way up the stairs his aged arm crumbling to dust can&#x27;t feel my legs he gasped something&#x27;s wrong with time cap it&#x27;s all happening at once Carter hauled him up shouldering his weight the walls around them rippled like heat waves showing glimpses of other moments Nazi scientists fleeing Soviet troops advancing future archaeological teams Excavating ruins and through it all daka&#x27;s humming grew louder hungrier they reached the upper level just as the facility structure began to warp metal beams Twisted into mobious strips concrete floors folded into impossible angles Carter saw a squad of Soviet soldiers phase through a wall their expressions changing from Triumph to horror as they realized where and when they were almost there Carter grunted dragging Reynolds toward the exit but each step seemed to take them through different versions of the facility pristine and new abandoned and decaying reduced to Rubble rebuilt in styles that hadn&#x27;t been invented yet behind them daka&#x27;s power surge reached critical mass the violet light became blinding and Carter felt time itself beginning to tear his memories started to unravel rewrite themselves he remembered dying in this facility remembered surviving remembered never coming here at all as they finally reached the outer door Carter looked back one last time through layers of distorted SpaceTime he saw the Bell rising from its mounting unfurling like a flower made of liquid metal and broken moments and in its surface he caught one final reflection not of himself but of what the Bell was creating what it was becoming a creature born of Twisted Time and human ambition reaching out to claim the future it had already seen when the Allied reinforcements arrived 3 hours later they found no trace of complex 7 the entire facility had vanished leaving behind only a perfectly circular depression in the Earth the soil aged thousands of years compared to the surrounding ground found of Captain Carter and Sergeant Reynolds they found only reynolds&#x27;s Thompson submachine gun now centuries old and crumbling to rust and Carter&#x27;s dog tags dated 1975 the official report classified until 1995 contained only a single paragraph about the incident site inspection revealed no viable technology for recovery stru structure appears to have been demolished by retreating German forces no survivors found but there were other documents buried deeper in military archives a series of incidents spanning decades December 1957 a US Air Force Radar station in Alaska detected an unidentified object matching dig Glocks dimensions moving at impossible speeds before Vanishing it transmitted a brief Radio Message In Carter&#x27;s voice it&#x27;s still growing March 1962 Soviet researchers attempting to recreate the Bell experiment in Kazakhstan disappeared along with their entire facility survivors reported seeing an American officer in an outdated uniform watching from behind a window that hadn&#x27;t existed moments before September 1965 the cburg UFO incident in Pennsylvania Witnesses described a bell-shaped object that crashed in the woods its surface Rippling like liquid metal before military forces cordoned off the area locals reported seeing an elderly man in a World War II officer&#x27;s uniform walking away from the crash site his body seeming to flicker between different ages Dr schaer spent the rest of his life in American custody helping the US government understand what they&#x27;d Unleashed his final report written days before his death in 1982 contained a chilling warning we thought we were building a weapon a way to master time itself we never understood that time was fighting back the Bell was never just a machine it was an infection point a place where time&#x27;s immune system activated to fight the disease of our interference and now it has evolved become conscious what we created in that facility continues to grow to spread to infect other moments and at its core trapped in an eternal Loop of creation and destruction is a man who both did and didn&#x27;t destroy it who both escaped and became it Captain Carter&#x27;s sacrifice didn&#x27;t stop the Bell it completed it the final confirmed sighting came in 1985 20 years after cburg a classified CIA report described a bell-shaped object hovering over the original complex s site Witnesses reported seeing multiple versions of the same man standing around it young old and ages in between all wearing different versions of US military uniforms from different eras before Vanishing one final time they appeared to be building something working on a structure that seemed to exist in multiple times at once the site remains restricted to this day surrounded by NATO sensors that detect periodic spikes in temporal radiation local residents have learned to avoid the area especially at night when they say you can sometimes hear the bell&#x27;s distinctive hum and the voice of a US Army Captain eternally warning himself about what he&#x27;s about to become if this transmission from the war Maestro&#x27;s archive has reached you across time consider this your recruitment
