            <p>In the 1920s, this device was banned by the FDA. It was taken outside of the clinics in which it was used and smashed to bits. The multi-wave oscillator was invented by a Russian French engineer, George Lovski. This was an extremely popular treatment during the 1920s and 30s. Lakovsky&#x27;s multi-wave oscillator consisted of a series of concentric rings or antennas connected to a highfrequency Tesla coil.</p>
<p>When activated, the device emitted a wide spectrum of electromagnetic waves, including radio waves, microwaves, and infrared frequencies. According to Lakovski, these waves would interact with the body&#x27;s cells, promoting health and vitality by restoring their natural resonance. This device gained significant attention and popularity, particularly in Europe and the United States. Lakovsky claimed the device could rejuvenate cells, enhance the immune system, and even destroy cancerous growth by simply resonating the cells with their natural healing frequencies. [Music]</p>
