            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I was talking to about a thousand scientists and a man came up to me afterwards, a physicist, and he said it was very interesting all that talk about God, but he said, &quot;Do you know I detect you&#x27;re a Christian?&quot; And I said, &quot;You&#x27;re very astute gentleman.&quot; Yeah. Well, that&#x27;s what I said. I said, &quot;You&#x27;re pretty sharp.&quot; And he said, he said, &quot;Come off it.&quot; He said, &quot;Now look, as a Christian, you&#x27;re obliged to believe. that God is a triunity, that Jesus was God and man. And he said, &quot;Now, come on, you&#x27;re a mathematician at Oxford.</p>
<p>This is absurd. Can you explain it to me?&quot; Well, I said, &quot;Can I ask you a question first?&quot; He said, &quot;Sure.&quot; So, I said, &quot;Tell me what is consciousness?&quot; And he thought for a second and then he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; I said, &quot;That&#x27;s okay. Okay, let me try an easier one. What is energy? Well, he said, I&#x27;m a physicist. I can measure energy.</p>
<p>I could use it. I said, you know, that&#x27;s not my question. What is it? He said, I don&#x27;t know. Oh, I said that&#x27;s very interesting. You don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Tell me. I said, um, do you believe in consciousness? Yes, he said. Do you believe in energy? Yes, he said. So, I said, you believe in these two things and you don&#x27;t know what they are. I said, &quot;Should I write you off as an intellectual?&quot; And he said, &quot;Please don&#x27;t.&quot; And I said, &quot;But that&#x27;s exactly what you were going to do with me five minutes ago.&quot; Now, I said, &quot;If you don&#x27;t know what energy is, and nobody does, and if you don&#x27;t believe that, you physicist, read Richard Fineman.</p>
<p>If you don&#x27;t know what energy is, don&#x27;t be surprised if energy, light, gravity, and consciousness are a mystery. Don&#x27;t be surprised if you&#x27;re going to get an element of this in God. You&#x27;re bound to get it. But now I pushed him a bit further. You see, and I said, why do you believe in these things if you don&#x27;t know what they are? And that was a bit difficult.</p>
<p>So being kind chap I try to help him out. And I said um you believe in these things because of their explanatory power as concepts. And he said that&#x27;s exactly right. And I said look of course I can&#x27;t explain to you how God became human. But I said it&#x27;s the only explanation that makes sense of the evidence as I see it.</p>
<p>Now I said I&#x27;ve got a simple analogy that might help you. It&#x27;s a very low-level analogy, but at least is biblical.</p>
