            <p>In-Q-Tel of Arlington, Virginia, United States is a not-for-profit venture capital firm that invests in high-tech companies for the sole purpose of keeping the Central Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies, equipped with the latest in information technology in support of United States intelligence capability.</p>
<p>History Originally named Peleus and known as In-Q-It, In-Q-Tel was launched in 1999 under the direction of Gilman Louie. In-Q-Tel’s mission is to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve United States national security interests.</p>
<p>Originally associated with the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science &amp; Technology, In-Q-Tel now engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and venture capitalists to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA, DIA, NGA, and the wider intelligence community.</p>
<p>In-Q-Tel concentrates on three broad commercial technology areas: software, infrastructure and materials sciences. Former CIA director George Tenet says, We [the CIA] decided to use our limited dollars to leverage technology developed elsewhere. In 1999 we chartered ...</p>
<p>In-Q-Tel. ... While we pay the bills, In-Q-Tel is independent of CIA. CIA identifies pressing problems, and In-Q-Tel provides the technology to</p>
<p>address them. The In-Q-Tel alliance has put the Agency back at the leading edge of technology ... This ... collaboration ...</p>
<p>enabled CIA to take advantage of the technology that Las Vegas uses to identify corrupt card players and apply it to link analysis for terrorists [cf. the parallel data-mining effort by the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger ], and to adapt the technology that online</p>
<p>booksellers use and convert it to scour millions of pages of documents looking for unexpected results. In-Q-Tel sold 5,636 shares of Google, worth over $2.2 million, on November 15, 2005. The stocks were a result of</p>
<p>Google’s acquisition of Keyhole, the CIA funded satellite mapping software now known as Google Earth. As of August 2006, In-Q-Tel had reviewed more than 5,800 business plans, invested some $150 million in more than 90 companies, and delivered more than 130 technology solutions to the intelligence</p>
<p>community. In 2005 it was said to be funded with about $37 million a year from the CIA. Former board members include Norman Augustine, William Perry, Anita K.</p>
<p>Jones and Gilman Louie. Governance In-Q-Tel is a Virginia-registered corporation, legally independent of the CIA or any other government agency. The corporation is bound by its Charter agreement and annual contract with the</p>
<p>CIA, which set out the relationship between the two organizations. In-Q-Tel&#x27;s mission to support the Intelligence Community&#x27;s technical needs is promoted by the In-Q-Tel Interface Center, an office within the CIA that facilitates communication and relationships between In-Q-Tel and government intelligence organizations.</p>
<p>While In-Q-Tel is a nonprofit corporation, it differs from IARPA and other models in that its employees can profit from its investments. According to public records, In-Q-Tel&#x27;s current principals include: Christopher A.</p>
<p>R. Darby, President/CEO Bruce Adams, Secretary Michael M. Crow, Chairman Paul G.</p>
<p>Kaminski, Director Jeong H. Kim, Director Investments Many companies listed on In-Q-Tel&#x27;s investment website page are secret. In-Q-Tel functions partially in public;</p>
<p>however, what products it has and how they are used is strictly secret. According to the Washington Post, &quot;virtually any U.S. entrepreneur, inventor or research scientist working on ways to analyze data has probably received a phone call from In-Q-Tel or at least been Googled by its staff of</p>
