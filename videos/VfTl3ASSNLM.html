            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>uh my name is chelani I work in pascali National Laboratory and I was in I was involved in a ction study since the beginning but at the beginning I was very strong skeptical because I suppose were some mistake somewhere in Bona so I try to disprove the fleshman PA results and Jones so I make experiment I just experimentalist I found something I cannot explain for myself and I continue up to now at the beginning the enthusiasm was really giant about such Discovery the main magazine in the United States times new week Bru weeks speak a lot cover cover story but as be shortly come enthusiasm mediately back come the delusion because re problem why the people is Enthusiast if you look to prin on toak you can see very very big machine this is the men there you compare to freshman is is the device big machine small small machine so the people think okay maybe there is another possibility to produce uh the dream of the man the sun in the earth so the problem is uh the effect of freshman is it was my own problem it is real mistake some very complicated froud everything is possible has to be very very cold about so we try to make experiment this is one of typical experiment of uh cold fusion at the beginning this was performed from El malov but after he he died he was killed um he walks at MIT this is the most simple experiment using B calorimeter just to watch what happened very very simple primitive if you want something more reliable user oriented you need flow calorimetry this I make a list of the progress about heat I will speak mainly about anomalous heat is what the normal people want eat to make the room warmer in the winter time time and the later electricity so it starts in 1989 pressure pressure on pawns this is the maximum power that they get about one wat usually one 0.1 wat they gain 25% temperature 30° historic Paladium Platinum electrolysis the Sal is a leide concentration 0.1 mol they use according to me primitive isic calorimetry that need a lot of calculation so the physics don&#x27;t like calculation in the field far from physics is typical for for chemistry so it was not accepted later M step Institute and make make some uh some progress he get up to three vs he is always the best value but introduce flow calorimetry so everybody can be sure something exist without using very complicated calculation two years later Tash using a special kind of plate prepared from Tanaka company get giant value respect six up up to 60 wat 25% uh several weeks it was like a revolution because use flowetry so no D large power long time everything was good so sorry okay now we are going from from the DT froud mistake no real but real there is is nuclear reaction or chemical reaction we have to go this a summary of of some of the main experiment performed as was found Alum alium 4 from M gods in Italy preparata Arata was found Trum from Indian people and letter Los laboratory was found even Neutron B but a very low level Los Alamos SAS laborator myself United States energy partic every every particles Alpha usually from now laboratory mured new elements transmutation the first one was Miley in the United States later iura from mitubishi a industry made a I think a wonderful experiment very expensive very sophisticated Mally wonderful I will show three page of this m result with zuno in Japan again another arm arm yuk from uh German from Berlin Electro nuclear laboratory demonstrated it&#x27;s possible to get enhanced electron screening with some specific material like Paladium stonum so on so the specific material of cusion give large electron screening and they published a historical paper in physicaly 20 Page similar result from Kaji in Japan and Li in in russan now di died so the conclusion all give the feeling our nuclear reaction and the database is quite robust thousand of paper published in referee journals moreover H if you remember tagashi show wonderful result 60 so on so the Japan government ask to the community involved in this field to the test if the experiment of farada have some mistake some error somewhere three people accepted to make replication myself in Italy Theo and Meo in the UN United States we make our test we get results lower than Tashi but even good result and we later we found there was a very big problem you to the batch to to the batch different of the Paladium means surface eff as very strong uh effect but at that time nobody understood we understood later so partially replicated but positive payed from Japan government in 93 pantel in Italy changed from paladim to Nel more ch from deuterium hydrogen was the first to work at with the gas high temperature 350 he get some CH heat but very poor reproducibility okay beginning is normal AR in Japan almost similar in similar time using a hrid procedure uh that he developed about 20 years before for cold for hot Fusion you use a dou struct Cod and he he got good result and was the first use nanometric sub micro Paladium powder the fish in the water so red Kimu from to Toyota make a systematic work done International Tri replicated I told another Point very important just 9 months after uh FL P&#x27;s demonstration was done a wonderful result at Nasa December 89 they get a normal HS eat using derium and not hydrogen this experiment was really wonderful very simple no calculation nothing for stupid people like me just experimental you watch okay read something really really good but this wonderful result was not the disused the explanation was the NASA was looking for neutrons not it so because they don&#x27;t find neutrons they decide to put the document in some place and work a letter about it but if you look one things and find another maybe more important why don&#x27;t say to the other people mystery um over the time the experiments continue with s involved company like Capelli morati group give support to preparata we make some some variation of why introduced from prata we use that very large PSE current in order to introduce not equili condition according to me is one of a key parameter we have current density up to 150,000 amp per square cm for microc time usually use flow calorimetry so safe data and was published at from nuclear from um f letter say 16 page very long story about later Miley University of Chicago use a plastic Nano beats alloy plastic n palum again pal and multilayer key Point fluorimetry even lower lower level but large gain 200% even not stable in Italy again the know the prepar group before he died use very a a um Paladium Co on Silicon on on sof used about 1 M long very thin and long they get the chest seat and alum for but the problem this material very easy to be self distracted anyway there was scientific proof alum for and heat even at a low level again the story um Arata used through nanop particles with some material to avoid the cering the weak point of nanom material when you increase the temperature the self centering are not nanoparticles anymore so it&#x27;s a good idea is to mix with some inert material like zonia to reduce the cering problem and they get very good result Arata was replicated this time from uh s institutes have enough uh instrumentation and full conferment so the replication is our style of the best result obviously we make some changing because okay I rather make with the derium I will make wire I make mix with rather idea of Wes instead of using theum use hydrogen my chip but the surface Nano coated so means in wi nickel wide coated with some specific material at Nano Dimension about 50 layers very boring procedure but we get good results but only for 30 minutes after the one fire was s deed but 200% of gain very large gain 300° Arata again competitor he use nanop particles theonia Paladium work at 180° for several days not only 30 minutes several several hours not only 30 minutes and you get very very interesting result so the point is why Nano materials because the Nano dimensionality is the key Point as claim s and V iron from MIT or may be linked to energy localization phenomena as discovered for a chance from byy past Paradox on the 54 it keep secret for several years so still open point I think are both effort all together so this is the NASA paper they make reconfirmation of her data of 89 to check if really was a CH so very large group well good budget is October 29 209 they get this the confirmation this wonderful result they get anomaly on the the loading only when was used D and notrogen in short when you load hyrogen you have chemical reaction due to the formation we have positive temperature when you Delo negative hogen all as expected normal everybody can do this one when you use diarium always at 300 cus you are positive as expected but when you de load you expect negative balance of zero still positive so this Accord to me just this event this behavior is enough to give a lot of funding to C Fusion this one has no chemical no physical explanation happen only with the and notrogen using Paladium this document keep secret again and I found by chance Last AUST because I am not so clever with the computer I was looking for the old P 89 I put something wrong in the research and I find this paper I suppose mistake but was real they reproduce and they gain secet I continue in uh so the point of AR critics H you have you put some heat in order to have chess power so can be some mistake somewhere so we decide to have an experiment without input power no in power using differential calorimeter means our TW calorimeter exactly the same one hyrogen one with duum with deum you get H power from up from about half the middle so the point you have to have a nanop particle with this dimensionality that is exactly the dimensionality of fairy some intriguing coincidence this is the good dimensionality we try obviously to overcome marata we are Italian the one the word my character is very bad so we use it paradium one Nano with the detarium at extremely large temperature 550 and we get at that time um the power density in HS the largest it was like a record in 2008 400 watt per gram of Paladium for 12 hours just considering conventional lucra power plant as a power density all together or than 30 50 watt so maybe it&#x27;s about eight times larger of a good nuclear power plant Arata because so good the result was replicated and payed from Toyota and Japan government they make together coll collaboration and they replicated the material but because Toyota is a company and don&#x27;t want to be under the control of any University because will collaborate with University ask to a very clever company in espe nanom material santu in KOB to make a material similar to Arata just reading the publish it document no nothing secret they just keep the documents from publish it and they try to get similar material they spend one year okay not not so easy but they succeed the most important the pschological barrier of transferred irreproducibility in condensed m s experiment was broken for forever two reason one different competely experiment from rata to K University different apparatus different material just reading the formula so it was really a big success and P letter gave large overview or cover the story later laboratory laboratory improve the original Coria nickel Paladium material developed from marata five years before and give to a Toyota group and they get the larger heat three always at a large temperature room temperature so gain infinite because no power inside we try to overcome we are very bad people so one year later we use a mixit of nickel wire Nano coated uh with uh at six bar pressure theum gas mixing with argon in order to reduce the termal conductivity and we work up to 900 celus for 6 days so this is equivalent the power density 1,800 Wat gr of nickel and this was H this experiment controlled from other people from not from my group from other extern people from a company recently Ros have a company claims 10 kilowatt so no comparison fact 600% temperature larger than 100 he claims over 6 months but no independent test in some later some months later this SC group link to Russi before collaborat after they fight because of money reason they claim gain 2,500 over 200 degree operation over 101 months both use some secret catalyzer not not uh not known and nobody up to now can check their apparatus anyway the scallion promise with a letter letter me that I can check but still now not scheduled the timing so I hope it will be done so the database I think is robust we have better instrumentation calibration control the the systematic error found and eliminated weed the nuclear Ash correlated with it production many new experiments more attention to materials especially Nano material in laboratory rep improv it cross cross and check and was Contin activity and International Conference so now what do we can say the effect is is real it&#x27;s not chemical it&#x27;s nuclear but nuclear fusion or other new or other nuclear reaction may be Yogi before try to answer to this point we have up to now 16 International Conference several in in Europe Italy and most in Japan because the Japan government give a lot of money to called Fusion and the Japan company give money and rumor even the emperor give money because he want healthy the Japan people so cold Fus can help to reduce pollution at International Conference Workshop 18 in Russia 11 in Japan 10 in Italy 18 United States and the several session in to National Society so now where where we we stay if we look at all the science all the procedure we say we have some effect is agreement with Theory no maybe not even close repr problem yes big so it&#x27;s wrong impossible so cut out cut new science new Theory so new Theory new knowledge the experiment are difficult okay very very difficult we need more experiment why not different approach so the three mainstream of experiment was loading historic PS the gas loading started with Italian pelli lat n or Nano particles byata mixing with and the Nano coating myself so mixing now the most used are prods into nickel because nickel has very low cost hren into normal water rosi claims such giant numbers are not independent so nothing to say about ER C to him are sub micro particles and second catalyzer there are several new groups worldwide working this way to get larg seat recently what happened Rose is one my friend um fardi in front of his energy catalyzer they claims such big numbers uh I I asked to rosi please I want to check for enough long time one of your device I will never open just measuring input output energy you can stay with me when I work but he refused it because in some way he told you are you are too much expert if you work you will understand my secret so I have to get money from this device so please wait when you will after I get money you can you can check even no La Brian Josephson has my same idea so we wrote a open letter in Italian magazine H to ask him to please give one device toah blah blah nothing happen R said will start a company at the end of 2000 to sell small kind of of the device now NASA what about NASA I make a talk last January at the S meeting World sustainable energy conference and I I told okay very P that NASA so important so honest company keep secret some wonderful result so just one day later I finish my my talk now it&#x27;s my friend gusta is he a present make a like advertisement video where they say oh the learn can solve a lot of our problem Aviation Space energy energy generation some days later one of the experimental Joy Zod say okay this video is is correct but some are my opinion some not mix it but anyway it&#x27;s good the scallion increase climate now to have increased temperature from 200 up to 650 celsus I ask in public again to test to say okay after our patent will be filed we don&#x27;t wait for money just patent filing complete so it&#x27;s better February for Peter Ausin Lawrence Howard so some important people very very clever works at MIT ER put his face to experiment electrochemical old style Michael Schwarz and uh the gain was Factor 10 several hours even at low power 0.1 L but so important people okay I am convinced Theory so now recently what happened we have behavor like Russi we work in secret we use said a commercial alloy we have no we have very few budget so we have to reduce our cost for several theoretical consideration we decide to use a commercial alloy from Germany kaer nle manganes we modify strongly with our procedure ER producing nanomaterial nanom M materials on the surface we add some Paladium in order to improve the relativity and after long operation we get some CH power up to 10 temperature larger than 20 260° gain about 50% they we start at November January so there some think okay the number is the best usually two three vs but very long time one month operation but we found a I think very interesting point when there is a chest seat the material that before be a standard POS temperature coefficient material the resistivity versus temperature when start to produce HC ter we have negative negative so very very B okay very very strange from positive battery battery out caput okay still so a this marker like another okay sorry I don&#x27;t know or may be conventional long long wood okay people coming thank you sorry okay so the material from positive come to negative similar material from Toyota and C group get they work up to 300 degree usually I work 500 600 so I get this result at a larger temperature they get something maybe similar and with TN calorimeter hogen alium Dum Androgen they found the reaction is endothermic very strange at a low temperature and exothermic over 200° this is some special threshold Nano powder same the same they use a caper nickel zonia we use this cap manges but Nano wi Nano so different procedure but the main material is almost the same and we work secretly each other nobody know ER last January because the meeting at E I asked to ja people you have some new result say yes we have with this material but it&#x27;s the same mind so for some reason we have studying the same material and this study was really secred nobody can speak about even when I go away from the the lab I keep away the book lock book to avoid leakage anyway similar result so I think it&#x27;s very very good and so I ask to Tashi group ja people to give me some transparency of the latest result so they prepare for me a short just to to show to you um I want to keep help me please okay yes this one okay I go quite quickly okay no sorry this is the TW reactor hogen and duum sorry I lost my my voice and the conventional cusion experiment very very chaotic simple but very very chaotic because sever instrumentation all at the same at the same time a sketch of what chamber is the powder is vacuum calorimeter some aspect are two chamber exactly the same one fill it with hogen gas other with nuum gas H they use 2 G of powder two G of a material B chamber U I go to the most final results okay over time this is experiment this is the loading HS power quite low but over time the Dum decrease and long another experiment the hyrogen filled with nickel get two V after about 8 days of operation and the hyrogen filled before negative about is operation and that&#x27;s slowly come back to almost zero so to go to zero is very important for the calibration if we make some mistake you never go to zero so this data are real diarium hydrogen with nickel reverse effect you get anomalous itat with hydrogen and for transion time negative with deuterium so nuclear F can sink a lot I think it&#x27;s a resuming after 3,000 minutes about 3 days of operation the balance kilo for ground Niel per hour about 2.3 and the negative for D experiment at the beginning always negative so need some conditioning some strange I don&#x27;t know we have to study deeply yeah the transient phase okay this is the important with hran gas the balance of electron volts for atom of nickel about 300 over 300 or here almost 400 remembering that the chemical reaction is about from two up to four electron volts for atom it means at least 100 times larger than any chemical reaction 10 days so no mistake no Transit nothing okay comments Now teacher okay maybe escape this one the main again yeah okay down back okay do no first ah okay now H one really a wonderful experiment is a nuclear measurement by S singon right from misubishi they have a ler of nanometric always nanometric Paladium Calum over deposited Chum barium tungsten so on is the St you can see 2 nanom 20 Nom is the prop range of the elements this experiment the chessum flowing time and theum decrease over time and the prium r increase so the balance is about about one this was done without taking off the sample from the chamber always close so no contamination it&#x27;s very important I want to put the other three sorry have and wait a moment for yeah sure wait wait a moment was very okay the second the experiment from misubishi was crosschecked from the strongest competitor of mitubishi Toyota and they have something similar they make the experiment with their own material with their old instrumentation but they have to say okay it is this right it&#x27;s some anomaly the Chas go to and later group University I University so on reconfirmed this eff we have done something similar 2000 is old experiment with with electrolysis we get something more or less similar but this is very clean experiment gas experiment we have electris so dirty and now the results using spring gate sign on light the chessum go to pum the strong to M and very important the m has isotopical composition different from natural one so very strong proof this one only one one line so nothing you can say with barium not there are several isotop there are reaction two kinds with 138 vum to samarium another R Earth and samarium with different isotope so from this this one always adding seems adding six neon and this can be interesting to the to the woman because if they want a platinum ring so better to to save the tungen from the lamp hold the lamp from the Tung stand and spending using a very expensive instrumentation you get PL Plum sometimes you get AUM not not good but if if you are lucky Platinum okay next H by the way this experiment in very primitive way was done from Italian group and another group in saor Muno group so but they don&#x27;t have So Sophisticated instrumentation to be sure they just say oh we serve this one PL don&#x27;t but maybe few people believe they are honest but not enough good quality okay go TI like okay okay uh this is just a overview of our cartic experiment in pasca so B posi reactor gamma gamma Rector is some instrumentation but the typical cion experiment so nothing stret the state of Earth what is the Freshman eff confirm it not too bad uh this kind of reaction happen in the crystal l ltis or near the surface has to be clarified there are some radiation weak not stable but something happen very low level key point the reaction start only when the surface has some proper geometry or uh poisoning so controlled by the surface perhaps when theface works even in the laes inside come so increase the power um okay just by en experiment similar to catalysis erogeneous catalysis the best result is done from people but they don&#x27;t want to show details because money reason or maybe because they are not able to reproduce still under problem I don&#x27;t know so the reaction are nuclear Atomic both Theory we say there are one mechanism or several approaches at the same time I think it is one uh thetion me start from the materials and go to the bu uh there is something common between Electro electrochemical and uh gas experiment I think something common happen why not which one is the root uh the reason of the irre I don&#x27;t know which one the external Factor can be used to start the reaction we have some idea about but need more work anyway learn are uh confirmed produce a little radiation so safe almost no residual retive material are green almost nothing greenhouse gas green can can be distributed this one to be more in detail studied so can be distributed loal localized all of these are important all together better so can be commercialized conclusion the problem of reproducibility the beginning was very turbulent um uh the work was improved step by step quality reponsibility understanding very important the most experiment since beginning 92 was CR those controlled from other groups not linked to the scientist that make the claims not linked this is important because I stand shenic medal and ethics very important other people check what you&#x27;ve done and and you don&#x27;t know what they will say until the the public show of the day the gas environment seems the most important was the one and Nano materials so emper price and the manone to to work beginning working a 60 bar it bit dangerous now only 10 bar seems enough so gas mean you can increase the temperature up to 300 500 degree means electric power production for the application very very important okay the best one we are Italians for the best 9 900 drogen aror but not stable for a long time so we need I think uh okay we can in some way neglect the situation about the result of Ro as and the scallion because if they are right okay we just say the experimental aspect big steps are performed anyway even they have some mistake the experiments have now performed worldwide are so good quality crosschecked rep people relable people honest so I think it&#x27;s time to start international program in order to improve the result we need money Manpower everything the point is is multidisiplinary approach physic physicist chemistry engineer so on so at the beginning with Gen gentic heat electricity obviously the theory has to be boosted we have to understand to be sure to avoid accident and then uh if this program will be will be performed be St point for a new a new era so one point I forget beginning some of my transparency as this a strange symbol dollar and Euro because some were prepared Professor Nel of United States and was partially revised from engineer cavalero and my myself to change from IND this was in devoted Orin for industrial people to sign people so we have change something so I want to take caval help organizing everything I finish thank you so we can have some short session of questions to both speakers</p>
