            <p>[music] What&#x27;s up humans and welcome to collectivo. Happy Wednesday everybody. Okay, I just dropped a video about Tim Taylor and Chris Bledo that I hope you guys like. I&#x27;m not taking any position specifically, but I did want to talk about something that just happened. Um, I was just doing my interview and while that happened, David Grush did an interview with Megan Kelly and you gotta hear what they spoke about here.</p>
<p>I want to give a major shout out to UAP James for clipping this because it&#x27;s shocking because you guys know that Corbell said that David Grush decided to not be an age of disclosure. So, we finally know why. And what he is claiming does leave a lot of these people from this film in a very precarious position because of what David Grush claims that James Clapper did, which is to actually run a crash retrieval program from the legacy program. That&#x27;s what he said. Let&#x27;s listen to what he said and then we&#x27;re going to listen to what David Grush also says about the CIA and the bodies in their closet.</p>
<p>That was a tongue and cheek kind of reference from Mega Kelly. That was good. Uh but we all know what they&#x27;re referring to. And also we&#x27;re going to take a look at a different idea that contradicts a little bit what uh David Grush is claiming because uh Megan Kelly also had Anna Paulina Luna talking about the moves she&#x27;s making in order to get amnesty for these people u who were involved in the film. You already know who that is.</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s been a lot of different uh reactions to for example people like Lu Alzando over the past weeks. Now that we know that potentially Clapper did this, according to Grush&#x27;s claims, this implicates Lou directly, and I just want to see what people who defend Lou and who have been doing anything for Lou have to say about that because apparently, yeah, Lou was also involved in the legacy program and he may have even been involved in a crash retrieval operation by James Clapper&#x27;s orders. So, let&#x27;s see what Grush did. I think this is a major development. I kind of felt like Grush was going to do something like this.</p>
<p>He wasn&#x27;t going to hold back and he really didn&#x27;t. So, let&#x27;s take a look. Yeah. So, let&#x27;s see. First, UAP James&#x27;s quote.</p>
<p>He says, &quot;David Grush tells Megan Kelly that James Clapper managed the UFO crash retrieval issue while serving as director of national intelligence.&quot; and I quote, &quot;When he was the DNI, USDI, and DIA director, he placed people in critical roles to manage this issue, both publicly and I&#x27;ll just say nonpublicly as well.&quot; And he mentioned the IIA there. That&#x27;s Dr. James Lacatsky. That&#x27;s Jay Stratton. Everybody who&#x27;s involved in that, they may have been involved in all of it.</p>
<p>So, here&#x27;s Grush. Thank you to DAP James. And a major shout out to David Hay who right after I got off my interview, he sent me the interview. So, shout out to both. &gt;&gt; General Clapper, the former DNI in the documentary.</p>
<p>Um, I certainly applaud him for at least speaking out in general. Um, he goes on, I believe, I&#x27;ve only seen clips of Age of Disclosure, not the whole thing. um where there was a program when he was the director of national intelligence uh where they were tracking these vehicles over Area 51, of course, the famed uh classified test location. And I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed as a fellow Air Force officer and certainly General Clapper rose to the ranks as three star general. Uh that&#x27;s all he said in the documentary that that was uh a program he was aware of.</p>
<p>Uh, in fact, uh, without being inappropriate, I will say that General Clapper was well aware of the crash retrieval issue, managed the crash retrieval issue, and when he was the DNI, USDI, and DIA director, he placed people in critical roles uh, to manage this issue uh, both publicly and I&#x27;ll just say uh, non-publicly as well. and I&#x27;ll allow the audience uh distill what I&#x27;m saying uh at the at the risk of being inappropriate or going too far with my uh discussion. So, uh General Clapper, Stephanie Sullivan, other folks in the IC that are well aware of this issue that were in rooms discussing this issue. Um I ask you to be uh greater leaders on this. I should not be the only former uh military officer and intelligence official uh that is uh being completely candid with the information that they were exposed to.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And here was Dan Farah uh thinking that he was going to do a sequel. Well, I don&#x27;t think that was going to happen now. Now that Grush completely exposed the intention of this film really, which was yeah, to get that amnesty. But listen to what Grush says also about the CIA. And I just got to show you this one, too, because this is a tongue-in-cheek uh reference from Megan Kelly, but it was pretty funny to see.</p>
<p>So, here it is. Um, unfortunately, the CIA has a lot of skeletons in its closet. Um, other things I know about that I can&#x27;t talk about that are conventional national security issues. Uh but the crash retrieval issue unfortunately is is certainly one of them and they&#x27;ve um done a lot of concerning things. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s being alleged by you and many others is that is that they have literal skeletons in their closet [laughter] or whatever &gt;&gt; they do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the CIA. &gt;&gt; So yeah, and oh man, let&#x27;s see what Anapolina Luna said now contrasting what Grush said and also on Megan Kelly. So, here it is. &gt;&gt; Talking earlier about whistleblower protections. One of the things that we&#x27;re going to have to do because what I did not want to do is host just another hearing with more witness testimony without providing the documents and evidence.</p>
<p>I think that that would probably be a waste of resources unless we can provide that directly to the American people. And we have received the list. I think it&#x27;s over about 40 different documents um to actually be able to get that information to provide it, but also to to bring forward legislation out of oversight and actually just left a hearing earlier talking to the chairman about it to actually bring forward immunity for all of the people um some of them in the in the film, some personally that we know of to come talk with us um in a skiff about locations or specifically more information pertaining to this without you know being in fear of basically being hit with espionage. man. And remember, Luna was part of this film.</p>
<p>Uh, she&#x27;s supporting the Amnesty thing. And Grush is saying that people should be more honest about what they actually did, which they weren&#x27;t. They made it seem like this legacy program was something outside of them. They really did made it seem like that. And turns out, according to Grush, there&#x27;s a lot of people involved in it in that film.</p>
<p>So, what&#x27;s going to happen now? I don&#x27;t know. But this was a complete nuke to the whole age of disclosure narrative courtesy of David Grush. I don&#x27;t know what you guys think about this one. I do want to remember and reiterate that for me the people that are trustworthy in this space are very few. Over two years that I&#x27;ve been doing this, I found out things, for example, this that they&#x27;re trying to essentially cover their own ass.</p>
<p>uh people like Clapper, people like Brennan from things that they were implicated on and the people that I&#x27;ve seen that are completely against the system really and they truly are looking for answers, not just try to be the first in line for when disclosure happens and the contracts start rolling out with new technology, if that even happens. are David Grush and Grush&#x27;s case. I think that when he first got into this, he didn&#x27;t realize at first um the level of involvement that many of the people collaborating with him had on these programs and I think now he does know a lot more and that&#x27;s why he came out to speak up in this interview. And the other people that I think are really going against the system are Matthew Brown and Dylan Borland. And these two guys are essential to understand this because all you have to do is see how the powers that be and the people that are trying to control the narrative and putting out the news um with the official narrative about this topic um you got to see how they treat people.</p>
<p>for example, like Chris Bledo, who is approved by people from NASA. And you got to see how they treat people like Dylan Borland and Matthew Brown who in a sense and in many cases almost seems like they&#x27;re [ __ ] radioactive. And I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case. I think they&#x27;re just not playing along with the narrative that is in front of their faces. And I really appreciate how they are really risking a lot by trying to get the real truth out.</p>
<p>And they&#x27;ve been attacked viciously by many parts. And they&#x27;ve been uh ostracized by the people that are supposedly in favor of disclosure or in favor of finding out what our reality truly is. And I consider Grush part of them too, but Grush has to play ball a little more because he was in a higher position than they were. They were at low levels, so to speak. And Grush was he even uh briefed executive level people on this issue.</p>
<p>So those are the ones that I would put my attention on. and the other ones. Well, now that garage came out to say this, I wonder what their response will be. Um, I hope that it&#x27;s not some sort of action that fractures the movement even more than it&#x27;s already fractured, but I I&#x27;m sure that David Grush did this because he feels like it was necessary to flesh out the stuff that wasn&#x27;t mentioned in that film. And I applaud Grush for once again being brave and speaking up what other people are not daring to speak up about.</p>
<p>It would be okay if we could follow his example or Matthew&#x27;s example or Dylan&#x27;s example. They care about the people. That&#x27;s what I genuinely think. All three of those. And I would put George and Jeremy there too, to be honest with you.</p>
<p>They get a lot of flack, especially Jeremy. And I think it&#x27;s not fair that they get this flag. they really are like at the center of all this. I would say that yeah, they they must have a lot more information that than they&#x27;re comfortable sharing. And if people keep coming at them like that or Dylan or Matt or Dave, they&#x27;re going to run out of patience.</p>
<p>And if they keep getting pushed like that, they&#x27;re just going to drop everything. I I would do that. Like if I have like a member of my family threatened, stuff like that that I know has happened and I&#x27;ve seen it online, I wouldn&#x27;t care. I would release the whole thing because for me, my family is first, my well-being is first. And yeah, that&#x27;s what I wanted to say about that.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think about this contrast of narratives and David Grush ousting James Clapper as a crash retrieval chief like he ran the thing. And how do you think this leaves people like Jay Stratton, Lu Lando, and others who were part of the film and are actively seeking amnesty? Would you give it to them knowing now what Grush has just revealed or not? Let me know in the comment section down below. I&#x27;ll be reading everything. And by the way, I don&#x27;t think this means that they&#x27;re bad people. I just think that they weren&#x27;t completely honest about the level in which they were involved in in these in these programs.</p>
<p>And I think that that&#x27;s what probably angered David Grush and that&#x27;s what kept him away from this film. Now that he&#x27;s out, we can talk about it. So, let&#x27;s talk. Let me know what you think in the comments. I&#x27;ll be reading everything.</p>
