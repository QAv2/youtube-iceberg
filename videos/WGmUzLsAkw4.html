            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel we take a look at Great theories of everything ancient and modern and uh try to check them out try to figure out how to use these things in our lives uh overarching cosmologies theories of everything Grand unified theories um they can be beneficial helping us with our Paradigm shifting our Awakening to 5D Consciousness our formation of a holistic worldview or just getting some grounding so that we have a solid base from which to make decisions in our lives and uh today is our 5008 85th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory um don&#x27;t quote me on that it might be 584 but um it&#x27;s a lot of videos um there aren&#x27;t a lot of videos on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson out on the internet that I know of um but I&#x27;ve now done 580 something and um that&#x27;s because I see it as the greatest theory of everything that&#x27;s out there right now um and it&#x27;s um got a bright future as well um it hasn&#x27;t reached its full potential and that&#x27;s uh partially due to circumstances but also partially uh due to uh not it hasn&#x27;t you know congealed it&#x27;s not been out there long enough Mr Larson just died in 1990 and uh it&#x27;s taken a little time since he&#x27;s passed away to really pick up the pieces a lot of that work has done by Dr Bruce pet and Dr kvk Neu um unfortunately Dr pet passed away um back in 2020 and um you know I guess that leaves it to to people like me and people like you to um you know uh talk about the reciprocal system and try to learn it and then be able to um make contributions because the reciprocal system depends upon uh you you have to understand how the theory Works in order to be able to apply it and it isn&#x27;t an easy study you have to really uh dig uh um the information is is generally there Larsson is a good writer but he&#x27;s not a great teacher and so uh really in order to understand the reciprocal system you you need to have read a few of his books at least uh in order to kind of get the full picture and um that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve read several of his books right into the record here on uh um streaming and um in those 580 some videos and several of his articles along with um articles from pet and Neu um and um the basic gist of it is that Larson is one of the uh only scientists to propose a universe made out of not matter not energy but motion universe is made out of motion and um motion comes in three dimensions in discreete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so um that&#x27;s more or less Larson&#x27;s first postulate he plugs it into the second postulate which states that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry Tre is ukian I actually dispute uh several of those points in the second uh postulate but I I I don&#x27;t really think it really matters that much it&#x27;s that&#x27;s basically just what he uses to plug the the original first postulate into and you can probably plug it into if you want to go with a different kind of geometry uh as like Dr pet uh was prefers projective geometry which also includes ukian geometry um regardless Larson uh then uh derived a theoretical Universe from his postulates through a process of deduction and um compared his theoretical Universe with the empirical Universe of modern science that they have spent uh thousands of man hours um and trillions of dollars compiling uh their scientific tables their astronomical tables um and Larson in many cases able to recreate their scientific tables strictly from theory on his uh you know living room table with a slide rule for no money so um uh Larson has written books on chemistry physics and astronomy where he goes over those comparisons Larson explains how he&#x27;s able to derive various equations for example for the basic properties of matter which is the title of his book on chemistry and uh where he arrives at equ equations for the melting point of uh matter or the specific heat or the compressibility and then plugs all of the elements and many compounds into his equations and you know finds himself within 1% of the values that are published in the scientific tables um LaRon also has a book on metaphysics called beyond space and time his final book uh published posthumously uh that includes sections on philosophy and religion uh Larson States his case on religion uh really he refers to God as a sector 3 and um that is very interesting that is uh you want to go back in the archives about a year and a half to get to that full uh reading of beyond space and time um basic properties of matter is also um in the archives just a few months ago today we&#x27;re wrapping up uh probably our coverage of Larson for a little while um because we&#x27;re going to finish his book uh one of his two books on economics today uh this book is called the road to permanent prosperity and uh he&#x27;s able to write these books based on that same Theory the universe of motion with two reciprocal aspects in Larson&#x27;s uh economic world the two reciprocal aspects are production and consumption um the um fruits of which are purchasing power and goods or I would say goods and purchasing power um no purchasing power and goods and um Larson uses scientific principles for economics which is kind of a new thing for the sociologically inclined economists um that Larson rails against throughout the book um he also uh arrives at a flowchart which you can see in the thumbnail about uh how this Dynamic economic system um can be charted out and he arrives at about 17 different principles uh that are mathematically exact um that uh govern the um economics system his other book on economics is called the road to Full Employment and it&#x27;s interesting that lson uh states that these are two separate books because what you need to do in order to address the employment problem is independent of what you need to do to assure that the uh economy stays humming so that there is a feeling of permanent prosperity and not this boom and bust um you know cycle of up up and down and up and down uh you&#x27;re trying to like lower the amplitude of the wave so that uh it&#x27;s always kind of on an pretty even Keel anyway um we&#x27;re going to uh try to finish this book right now and uh we&#x27;re reading from chapter 26 that is called the comments and um recommend ations and we&#x27;re about halfway through in applying scientific techniques to the economic field we have first separated the factual a aspects of econ economics those aspects that can be treated by the Precision methods of the physical sciences from the matters of opinion and judgment which which with which the present a socially oriented e Economist is mainly preoccupied we have then analyzed those factual aspects of economic life in terms of the flow and interaction of quantities that are capable of specific definition and are conserved by dealing with quantities of this nature that can be followed from process to process with quantitative accuracy in the same manner as energy mass and the other basic quantities of the physical sciences rather than using the vague and IL defined quantities in terms of which Orthodox EC economics operates such things as demand Pro propensity to consume Etc we have have been able to establish the basic laws and principles governing the relations within the economic mechanism on a definite and unequivocal basis application of these principles to the fundamental economic problems then enables us to see clearly what objectives are realistic and attainable and what actions are necessary in order to achieve these objectives with the benefit of this information we are then in a position to analyze the various measures for dealing with economic problems that have here to for been proposed or that may have been suggested by the investigation itself and to determine specifically what contribution if any each is capable of making toward the designated OB objectives in some respects the task that has been carried out in this work resembles that of building a house on a steep hill side the preliminary work on the site and the construction of the foundations may be far more of an undertaking than the erection of the house itself the most tedious and time consuming phase of this economic project has been to clear away the underbrush of erroneous Concepts and beliefs that characterizes so much of modern economic thought once this Tangled mass of misconceptions was removed so that a clearer view of the true situation could be obtained the cause of and remedy for the particular problem under consideration in this volume the stabilization of business conditions was practically self-evident just as soon as we understand the operation of the auxiliary stream of purchasing power created by the introduction of money and credit into the economic organization and the role that this money Purchasing Power Stream plays in the economy it becomes obvious that variations in the flow into and out of the reservoirs located in this stream are the cause of the economic fluctuations that we call booms and recessions it is then likewise obvious that these fluctuations can be eliminated by controlling the reservoir flows in such a manner as to equalize total input and total output the foring simple as it is contains the essence of this entire work so far as as the stabilization problem is concerned when we undertake to develop practical methods for putting these findings into effect however the situation becomes more complicated because each of the Practical programs has collateral effects of one kind or another selection from among the various feasible Alternatives involves not only the question as to how effectively each accomplish es the primary objective but also an appraisal of the advantages or disadvantages that will be experienced as byproducts of each program the Alternatives have been analyzed from these standpoints in the two preceding chapters and our conclusion is that the necessary control can be exercised most effectively and efficiently by an interchange between credit goods and credit money that is by the open market trans open market operations of the Federal Reserve System modified to operate on the basis of counterbalancing the net Reservoir input or output since it is evident that any supplementary measure that has the effect of reducing the amplitude of the fluctuations that are to be neutralized by the control system will contribute to the ease of operation of the controls various possibilities of this kind have been studied and two of these are recommended as part of the complete stabilization program it should be understood however that the use of auxiliary measures of this nature is not essential it is merely helpful and if there are too many objections to one or more of the proposed mil auxiliary measures these can be modified or even eliminated the only absolutely essential feature of the program is the Direct Control mechanism not necessarily the particular mechanism herein recommended but some effective control The Interchange between credit goods and credit money by means of the open market operations could be replaced by some other Direct Control measure an appropriate program of tax flexibility for example but an effective Direct Control is essential with this understanding as to the nature of the recommendations that have been made in the forging Pages we may summarize these recommendations as follows one set up the necessary Machinery to make a continuous measurement of the flow of money into and out of each of the purchasing power reservoirs two dampen the cyclical movements of the reservoir input and output by a basing the maximum legal loan value of Securities and real estate on the long-term trend of value rather than on the current Market appraisal and B utilizing the credit control facilities of the Federal Reserve System to reduce net reservoirs net Reservoir input or outputs when these movements become or threaten to become abnormally large three eliminate the remaining fluctuations in the aggregate Reservoir Levels by putting the open market operations of the federal Reserve System on a definite and automatic basis requiring the system to purchase or sell Securities to individuals or non-bank agencies at frequent intervals in amounts just sufficient to neutralize net transactions into or out of all other consumer money reservoirs four be prepared with a program of flexible tax rates for use in the event that stronger measures are necessary to meet a temporary situation if these recommendations are put into effect the alternation of booms and recessions that we call the business cycle will be eliminated this will not cure all of our economic ailments indeed one of the most serious weaknesses of of present policies is that the Federal Reserve System which has only one kind of weapon monetary Management in its Arsenal is being expected to take care of a whole range of economic problems as stated by JS dusenberry quote the Federal Reserve System has been concerned with four major objectives of Economic Policy one full employment two price stability three economic growth and four a satisfactory balance of payments at times different objectives appear to be in conflict with each other end quote the reason why it is not even clear whether such a conflict exists why it can only be said that they appear to be in conflict is that monetary policy has only an indirect and uncertain bearing on three of the four objectives list listed the exist existing difficulties in these areas can be effectively resolved only by measures specifically adopted adapted to each separate situation the requirements for Full Employment and for the optimum growth rate were discussed in the road to Full Employment Larson&#x27;s other book on economics the actions that are necessary to correct the present adverse balance of payments have been defined in chapter 17 monetary management is not capable of achieving any of these three objectives and the attempts that are now being made in these directions are simply reducing the effectiveness of the monetary Tools in accomplishing the significant task to which they are well adapted the stabilization of the economy if the nature of the stabilization problem is clearly understood the misdirection of effort in pursuing objectives that cannot be reached by monetary policy is discontinued and the monetary tools are properly applied in accordance with a program of the kind outlined in this volume the cyclical fluctuations can easily be smoothed out in the resulting stable economy business enterprises will not experience the artificial kind of prosperity that now exists during an inflationary boom when even very inefficient operations are able to earn profits but they will have a good consistent and predictable working situation in which it will not be necessary to worry about the possibility that their calculations may be upset by a downward turn in the general state of the economy cyclical unemployment including both the severe loss of jobs that occurs during major depressions and the significant but less drastic increase in unemployment that accompanies minor dips or recessions in business activity will be eliminated The Chronic unemployment that now exists even during periods when business is relatively prosperous will still remain but the way will be cleared for the development of additional measures of a purely employment character to take care of this remaining problem the previously published volume the road to Full Employment is devoted to an examination of the cause of this quasi permanent type of unemployment and to formulate uh and to the formulation of a program that will provide self-supporting jobs for all inflation will no longer be a a problem for the economy as a whole that is the real purchasing power of the average consumer will remain stable at the level established by average productivity the problem of an equitable allocation between different economic groups will still remain but the question questions involved in this problem such questions as to whether the present bargaining method of wage and salary determination should be replaced by a system that is less biased toward certain favored groups will require some additional Decisions by the general public and are beyond the scope of this work it should be understood that this stabilization program is specifically addressed to the elimination of money inflation cost inflation the type of inflation due to increases in wage rates and business taxes will not be affected by the proposed measures money inflation has adverse effects on the economy as a whole mainly because it must inevitably be followed by deflation elimination or reduction of this type of inflation is therefore clearly desirable and is already already a recognized National objective the application of economic science to the problem is therefore definitely in order cost inflation on the other hand has little effect on the general economic situation and does not alter the ability of the average consumer to buy Goods the increase in money wages does not change the average real wage nor does the increase in business taxes which is passed on to the consumer alter the total tax burden which is determined by the amount of government expenditure the objectional uh objectionable feature of cost inflation is that the actions which cause this type of inflation especially the wage increases favor some individuals or groups at the expens of others while this policy is certainly discriminatory it has strong support from those who gain or believe they gain from it the question as to whether or not cost inflation should be eliminated is thus a social and political issue rather than the kind of a factual problem for which economic science can provide an answer is therefore up to the community at large to decide whether the fruits of increasing productivity should continue to be allocated mainly to certain special groups or whether Market forces should be allowed to exert more influence whatever decisions are made on these issues can easily be implemented without any significant effect on the general economy okay in his uh kind of typical cold endings that is the end of Larson&#x27;s book on economics called the road to per permanent prosperity and um for now that will also be the end of our presentations on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson uh We&#x27;ve covered his books um beyond space and time um nothing but motion basic properties of matter um road to full employ road to permanent Prosperity I believe we did another one of larsson&#x27;s books maybe I don&#x27;t believe we did new light on space and time um we also covered his deductive development of the reciprocal system uh where he goes over the derivation of his theoretical universe and um we&#x27;ve gone through a number of his articles and uh some articles quite a few articles from Dr Bruce pet as well couple things from Dr kvk Neu now we will eventually return to the reciprocal system and cover some more um territory but um a lot of those articles from nou uh a lot of uh larsson&#x27;s book on astronomy called the universe of motion uh I&#x27;ve just kind of decided to put them on the back burner because they&#x27;re a little bit Advanced um even more advanced than what we&#x27;ve already gone through and um uh there&#x27;s there are some issues with the astronomy stuff as well in my mind um Larson kind of Applied his astronomical Theory I think he he trusted NASA a little bit a little bit too much with the data and so he kind of adapted his system to already existing data um in a certain way and um I&#x27;m still trying to parse that out myself so you know Larson himself stated that the reciprocal system itself is correct but the application of it his application of it could be incorrect in certain respects and so uh lson did make some mistakes in applying his theory very particular with the photon um a lot of his work on electric um charges is um you know due to be Revisited we&#x27;ll say uh we&#x27;ll probably also look at some of the work of Ron SATs um as we move forward with the reciprocal system but for now we&#x27;re going to kind of take a u-turn and um I think tomorrow we&#x27;re going to start um kind of looking at religion East and West so we&#x27;re going to try to kind of uh compare and contrast easn and Western uh Notions of religion and see if we can find some common ground there and maybe some um what I would say using some Eastern Concepts in order to to um salvage some of the western Concepts that are untenable um I think if you look at history you will see that uh a lot of the um Western religions the uh judeo-christian religion um has been tampered with in a major major way and that uh in in spite of all of that uh has been able to arrive at some um creditable some uh notable uh laudable results but that uh many of the concepts that are being used um may be um better articulated by some of the Eastern religions and so tomorrow we&#x27;re going to start by going through uh starting to go through a book from Daniel Ingram an American who has spent a lot of time in a Buddhist monasteries in the Far East and he has written a book called mastering the core teachings of the Buddha and uh this is a book where he puts together a lot of maps about consciousness and uh we&#x27;re going to try to parse out these maps and figure out what he&#x27;s talking about so stay tuned for that um in the meantime thanks for tuning in today</p>
