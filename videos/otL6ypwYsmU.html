            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Welcome back to the Cosmic TUS podcast. I&#x27;m your host, George Howard, and today we&#x27;re joined by my friend and twotime Cosmic Summit speaker, Mr. Bob Grineer of the Martin Flechman Memorial Project. We will explain who Mr. Flechman is shortly.</p>
<p>Bob is an emphatically open-source researcher who for decades has shared everything he discovers in the extraordinary world of humaninduced cold fusion. Its natural production is ball lightning and evidence that ancient people knew of or transmitted information regarding these unnowledged arts but are today secretly available. He can see it in their art, their architecture, their myth and a number of other domains of the past. You will come to see this in this podcast that Bob is the rare communicator that&#x27;s fluid in the deep past, modern science history, current experimentation, and stuff we don&#x27;t even know about yet. So, he lives in the past, the present, and the future.</p>
<p>Um, since 20 2012, he&#x27;s been advancing research into what&#x27;s called low energy nuclear reactions, and he&#x27;ll give us a good uh definition of that. But what makes MFMP extraordinary is that he&#x27;s committed to sharing it with everybody. And that&#x27;s part of the reason he goes on podcast and runs a fantastic YouTube channel that I&#x27;ve watched for years before the cosmic summit. In fact, I think I watched it more before the cosmic summit because now I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s so many things you got to watch. But uh Bob is a wonderful friend.</p>
<p>I have traveled uh to India with him and his family, his wonderful wife and children who are incredibly intelligent and and also to Switzerland. So I consider him a close friend. I look for him to come to him coming to Cosmic Summit 2026 again. And uh as people who are listening to the podcast know, I always say, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;re going to have a Cosmic Summit 2026 or maybe seven. We&#x27;re going to have another one.</p>
<p>It ain&#x27;t going to be seven, but I just got to get the sponsors first.&quot; And we had a lot of progress on that today, which I&#x27;m going to do a live stream on tomorrow. Welcome, Bob. Sorry for the long introduction, but I hope it intrigued people to the wealth of knowledge that you will bring to them in this recording. How are you? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m very good, George. Thank you.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s good to hear that you are making progress in the Cosmic Summit 2026. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I should do I&#x27;m going to be do some more communicating about it because it&#x27;s all good news. The bad news is that I wasn&#x27;t I&#x27;m just not going to schedule another one until I fix this sponsorship piece because everything from a bake sale to a golf tournament has sponsors. It&#x27;s actually you can&#x27;t run the financial model without it.</p>
<p>But the funny thing is, if you don&#x27;t have a sponsor, it&#x27;s the only damn thing the audience doesn&#x27;t care about. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; They just don&#x27;t care. So, I knew if I didn&#x27;t do it and it kept falling through the cracks, falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>And if I didn&#x27;t do it, nobody give a damn except me. And I give a damn this year. It is I have got to make it happen, man. &gt;&gt; So, we&#x27;re going to do it again. Question is when.</p>
<p>And I think we&#x27;ll let everybody know right about the beginning of the year. Probably that first week or two of January. We&#x27;ll absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, people don&#x27;t understand how much it costs to run a conference.</p>
<p>I know the ICCF conferences have been uh struggling in in recent years. Um and the uh the other condensed matter uh science uh conference in Europe that also has difficulty. So um it it it&#x27;s it is the financing because those hotel rooms those those uh yeah transportation the the venue hire everything it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not getting cheaper each year. No, it&#x27;s not getting cheaper and there&#x27;s no peeling it back at the last moment and all that kind of stuff. You commit to a lot of costs that are going to happen whether some number of people come or not.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But our future is not so much in attendance although we&#x27;d love to see it grow. &gt;&gt; Um and our it&#x27;s in our blessing which is the growth of the social media and you have been a big contributor to that. You&#x27;ve had some very successful videos.</p>
<p>We put out three a day at CosmicSummit on all platforms and we just crossed 750,000 cumulative followers. Wow, that&#x27;s awesome. Well done. &gt;&gt; I mean, just just organizing anything of that kind of magnitude, full respect first. Um, and second, um, you know, it&#x27;s building a community of, uh, partially, I would say, like-minded in the sense that they&#x27;re open-minded uh, people uh, but also from disparate disciplines and research backgrounds and, uh, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really a unique conference in that regard.</p>
<p>Um, so you&#x27;ve made it, so full respect. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you. No, you you&#x27;ve been quite the contributor and it it you you span our interest in kind of unnowledge history and things that could be coming. Everybody&#x27;s got a sense that there&#x27;s maybe something different coming than the 20th century. &gt;&gt; You know what? I&#x27;ve always been interested in the past.</p>
<p>Uh um I&#x27;ve always been interested in the oldest person I could find in the room because they&#x27;ve always always the most honest often and and the most interesting and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re often the most ignored uh unless they&#x27;re a celebrity which just irritating for them. They still don&#x27;t want to speak to anyone in that case. &gt;&gt; You know, you&#x27;re gonna make a very interesting old man. I just want that. You&#x27;re gonna be the most interesting old man for the grandkids.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead.</p>
<p>What else what else were you thinking? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I mean my my coming into this was really I wanted more kids actually. It was about children and I had bought into this sort of global warming narrative that was basically invented before I was born in 1971 I think in Tanzania. Um and uh whatever it was called back then, climate change, global warming, global boiling or whatever global freezing it is now. Again, it&#x27;s back to global freezing this week.</p>
<p>Um uh but but I bought into it. You know, I didn&#x27;t have any proper furniture in my bedroom. I had recycled stuff. I I made a solar panel uh and and and had a it was just a one panel because they were very expensive back way back when in the in the 19 uh late 70s and early 1980s. And I had a like a thing that would multiply that by having mirror tiles.</p>
<p>And that ran my fan and my light in my room. And you know, I had one of the first smart cars, those two little seater things imported as a the wrong-hand drive into the UK. Uh because I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t have a car. I just cycled um uh from university for the best part of a decade and hired cars when I needed them for business business meetings. I was that into the, you know, saving the planet and you know, I bought into all of that.</p>
<p>And then this research which I stumbled upon because I wanted more children and I wanted to find a solution to the energy problem and I was b basically going I can&#x27;t self-limit myself until I can&#x27;t have a child anymore. Um so I&#x27;m going to have to do something active about this and I&#x27;ve always been interested in energy and science. And so I took myself to South Korea uh in ICCF 17 in 2012 and I met f four other guys and I said look I want to do some replication because all these people they&#x27;re dying or if they find something someone comes in and gets them to spin a plate until they die or tells them they can&#x27;t tell you anything that that&#x27;s of any use to anyone. So we need to replicate this and uh we need to do it openly. Break the mold of doing it behind closed doors.</p>
<p>And these people uh they were up for it. We managed to find Franchesco Chelani of the Italian National Frascati Institute, the one of the nuclear authorities in Italy to uh give us his active material and the schematics for his uh device. And to cut a long story short, we replicated it and on our second attempt when we actually did what he did, not tried to do what he was going to do and uh that led to European funding ultimately and to American RP funding uh for this field. Uh and so it was a very worthwhile exercise and uh um large numbers of people around the world have uh um been able to seek funding for doing research in this field uh because essentially we were working in an open way and people could see that the process uh uh um or something was there and that was what got me when I went to that conference. I could see that all these people were seeing whether in a solid system, a liquid plasma or gas system, they were they were seeing the same kind of synthesized elements out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, of course they had 70 different theories and at least 69 of them must be wrong because, you know, but they had little parts of the puzzle. Um and and so um you know and after doing that first replication I actually felt confident enough to go ahead and have another child because not only had had I seen multiple people seeing the same kind of things. I realized there was a way forward for humanity and we do have this long buffer with hydrocarbons and there is no normal nuclear fishision and there were obviously the renewables available at that time. So we&#x27;re going to be able to bridge this gap until we can use this or normal fusion uh technology uh to provide the energy source for humanity. So um it&#x27;s been a very cathartic and and enabling exercise uh to find a a way forward at least so that I&#x27;m convinced and then the job became when we&#x27;ve replicated it how can we um explain it that became a lot harder &gt;&gt; and once we felt there was a a good replication and an explanation for the process it then came about uh um that we could do the third goal of the project which was to try and uh help uh potential implica implementations of this technology wherever they might be whether it&#x27;s in material processing um pollution reduction um energy production elemental production radiation remediation all these kind of potential avenues propulsion so many things came out of this and then along the learning the journey um I met a a guy in um uh Italy called Franchesco Pientelli and he was a biologist.</p>
<p>Uh he was a professor at the Sienna University and he was doing a an experiment on um a little mouse cell and he was keeping it alive by having it on a piece of nickel and electrically stimulating it. And the idea was to find drugs that would stop the brains cells in a an animal dying uh if they had a lack of oxygen. and to understand the chemistry and what chemicals you could put in there to prevent the chemistry that causes the brain to not be able to kickstart itself back. So what they did is what he was doing is he stimulating it with this uh um electrical signals and then he would flood it with liquid helium and liquid helium is basically the coolest stuff known to man. It&#x27;s like 400 Kelvin and this would freeze the chemistry when sorry first he would flood it with hydrogen and that starts the death process of the cell and then he would fill it with uh the helium and that would freeze the chemistry uh at certain points after the the um the triggering of the death and then they could analyze the chemistry in the otherwise dormant uh processes going on in the frozen uh brain cell.</p>
<p>And what he found was he kept doing this, you know, stimulating with electricity, flooding it with hydrogen, killing it, and then putting in the cryogenic cooling. And one time it suddenly started boiling the helium. And it was 250 watts of cooling going into this little chamber and it was boiling the helium. In fact, it boiled it so fast it broke the the device. And he&#x27;s thinking, &quot;Where on earth is this heat coming from? All I&#x27;ve got in there is nickel and hydrogen and a little bit of electricity stimulation.</p>
<p>Where is it coming from? &gt;&gt; And so he then worked with uh Ficardi uh Sergio Ficardi University of Bologna who&#x27;s one of a brilliant genius of a nuclear scientist. And then they did these particularly uh um uh um successful series of experiments with nickel rods sometimes with processed nickel on there and um they published in illoo cement which is the one of the primary physics journals in in Italy. Um, and when I started this whole process, I wanted to go and see him and I tried to reach out to him. And it was only when we uh were starting to uh look at a a rather colorful character called Andrea Rossy. You probably know only too well.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, I followed every bit in 2011. &gt;&gt; Right. So, yeah, I I put my uh deposit down uh for two my name in line for for two two devices. And since then, I&#x27;ve had two replacement boilers. So, it would have been great if I COULD HAVE HAD ONE.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; THAT&#x27;S CRAZY. I remember when all that was going on. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s almost 15 years ago now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. I was I was considering selling my house and putting some money in to support the effort and and since then I met Roger Green who practically did that who was the initial investor. &gt;&gt; Just just so people know like like like this is a secondary interest of mine on a personal level and has been almost as long as the younger dryest event, &gt;&gt; right? In fact, it precedes it because it goes back to 88 with Pawns and Fleshman. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go. &gt;&gt; And we go back to 94 with the Younger Das event, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they&#x27;ve always been, you know, I got a lot of fascinations like all of Cosmic Summit people do.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re curious as hell, but I got to say my top two were Younger Das and Cold Fusion. And then they they kind of merge a little bit, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, we might get on to that, George. Yeah.</p>
<p>So basically um I wanted to uh I I I wanted to meet him and and there was no communication no no feedback and this went on from best &gt;&gt; this was Martin Flesman &gt;&gt; no Martin Fleshman had died in a few weeks three weeks before ISIS Jeff 17 in 2012 um so I unfortunately I remember &gt;&gt; me and that&#x27;s why the project is called the Martin Fleshman memorial project we wanted to come up with a name at the conference and the death of Martin Fleshman and it just seemed fitting and uh respectful to try and find a way to understand what what he at least in the west initiated the process of thinking about. And anyway, so this was this was uh uh late 2014. We were just starting to replicate uh um analoges of Andrea Rossy and we got contacted by Pientelli. He wanted to meet us because essentially the story was Rossy originally went to Pientelli. Pantelli refused to work with him because of his past and so he then went to work with Ficardi that really angered Pantelli.</p>
<p>Okay. And and uh he he didn&#x27;t like Rossi as a as a character and he thought, you know, this was going to bring disrespect to um uh to Ficardi and and Ficardi was suffering mentally um at that time. So he thought that he was using him. Anyway, to cut a long story short, we we went there. We went there again in January, having raised the money to bring people uh in in six weeks, we raised enough money to bring people from seven different countries to come down and do tests.</p>
<p>Of course, he he wasn&#x27;t so keen to do tests there, but he did spend five days with us and he went through the entire process in a way that he&#x27;d never done before. He revealed secrets he&#x27;d never done before, things that aren&#x27;t even in his patent. Um, and I&#x27;ve made those all public since. Um but essentially he said don&#x27;t tell nature what it is let it show you. And from that moment I switched from looking at what I was told to look at which is neutrons, gamma, uh x-rays and so forth and excess heat to looking at what I can see in the process and after the process.</p>
<p>And it was um and maybe we&#x27;ll get on to this. I I was invited. We&#x27;d done a couple of replications in the the following uh year or so, 2016. Uh and it it was early 2017. I had realized um basically it was something to do with wall lightning.</p>
<p>And in early 2017, I was in in uh asked to go and speak at Stanford MG Club&#x27;s inaugural um uh kind of like meeting with uh Carl Page uh was organizing it. and and &gt;&gt; Larry Pa&#x27;s brother, the founder of Google. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The founder of Google&#x27;s brother. And and um I talked first that was the first time I introduced the fact that I thought was ball lightning going on.</p>
<p>But actually when I as I was going in, I actually said to my colleagues Brian Alston and and uh Alan Goldwater at the time, I said, I think this is to do with exotic vacuum objects, Ken Shoulders&#x27;s work, and I think it&#x27;s the same as John Hutcherson&#x27;s work. So that was in January and then by the third week in February I was sitting in my house and I won&#x27;t go into the full story. I&#x27;d been invited by Mahadeans of Azan who was the one of the two lead authors. He was the lead author on the initial first six months replication of Martin Fleshman and Stanley Ponds at the Braberto atomic research center. he had invited me uh in 2017 to come and work with some of their scientists, some students and some people that were willing to come and have a listen to the talk &gt;&gt; um about how um to get nickel hydrogen reactors working.</p>
<p>So I I was doing the responsibility of the project and at project&#x27;s donor&#x27;s expenses uh I didn&#x27;t ask for any money from him. Uh we paid for the flights. I went over there and um I was sitting down in my kitchen and I realized um that uh this process was the same as Ken Shoulders Evos, the sh same as John Hutcherson&#x27;s uh Hutcherson effect. And if that&#x27;s the case, then um and I was considering these concepts that that Dr. George Eagley, one of the world&#x27;s greatest experts in bull lightning, was telling me about how bull lightning can go through windows sometimes or even metal and not do anything, but sometimes it can go through and it can leave a round hole.</p>
<p>And to cut a long story short, I had I as a child, we had a farm and then we had a a a campsite and we were able to uh rent out this campsite to caravaners and they they would um sometimes leave their caravan behind or because it was shot or a broken car, they they wouldn&#x27;t tow it to the dump. And my father was quite liberal and allowed me to and my my brothers to um break these down for scrap. And sometimes we just set light to them or we used Molotov cocktails and threw them at them and watched them explode or put bombs in them and stuff. And essentially &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve heard a lot of stories about your upbringing and you did not have helicopter parents nor a trauma mama. &gt;&gt; No, I didn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Y&#x27;all grabbed that settling torch and your dad lit it for you and said, &quot;Get &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Actually, one day he gave me a a a flamethrower, a World War II flamethrower brass museum piece. He said, &quot;Go around the field and and light light the uh the weeds up because they were all dry at the end of the summer iron fence.&quot; Anyway, to cut a long story short, um I had seen cars that had not uh that had burnt completely out and I&#x27;ve seen many since here from Ukraine. I&#x27;ve seen them here. They&#x27;ve been parked here as like this is what&#x27;s going on in Ukraine and here&#x27;s a burnt out car and they had a story about it.</p>
<p>But this was this was in my childhood and I&#x27;d never seen the steel melt or anything. And I came to the conclusion that and I was had in the back of my head that what I saw on 911 were some of these things with that I call the event and uh this is like the last great taboo the last great this only remaining conspiracy theory that hasn&#x27;t been pro proved true right and and it&#x27;s getting a lot closer and I&#x27;m glad you got into 911 because that&#x27;s kind of what inspired me to bring you on the show. &gt;&gt; Yeah I know. So so I&#x27;m getting to getting to the point where I love it. I never even told you that.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m glad you got to it without me having a question. You go go. &gt;&gt; So, so yeah, I I I I got to this point where I&#x27;m sitting down and I&#x27;m going, &quot;Oh my god, right, maybe 911 was done with this technology.&quot; I said, &quot;Right, I&#x27;m going to do a scientific test, right, on on evidence-based. We know ball lightning will make round holes in windows if it I if if it was involved, right? And microb ball lightning is an aspect of the technology. So I sat down and I typed into Google.</p>
<p>I said I said uh round holes, windows, 911, ground zero, something like that. And it came up with all of these pictures and they were from buildings around ground zero with windows with round holes in them. And I go and and I just I was in a state of shock. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to be going to India. I&#x27;m going to be speaking to people in the nuclear authority over there.</p>
<p>Uh and I have to completely change my presentation. I&#x27;m going to lose a massive amounts of respect that I&#x27;ve built up in the community. But I I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have a filter that says I&#x27;m willing to lie about how I feel about how something works. Um I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have that. I don&#x27;t have a tenure to lose.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have a big fat salary to worry about. I don&#x27;t have, you know, kids being paid for at college by some someone else that would ask me to walk if I said something untoward. Um, so I thought, I&#x27;ve got to say this and and I and I and and I thought, okay. And then down the bottom of the picture, it said Dr. Judy Wood.</p>
<p>I thought, who&#x27;s Dr. Judy Wood? So I and and and I and I did a search on it. It came up with this website called Where Did the Towers Go? And I thought, okay, okay, so she&#x27;s made a connection that this does this and blah blah blah. Yeah, but she doesn&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s uh Ken&#x27;s shoulders and then she has three whole pages on Ken&#x27;s shoulders. And I go, &quot;Yeah, but she doesn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s anything to do with John Hutcherson effect.&quot; And that time I didn&#x27;t know one had come from the other uh in such clarity and she has pages on the John Hutcherson effect.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m going, you are kidding me. She had come from as a structural engineer all the way through to realizing that this was explained by Ken Shoulders&#x27;s work and John Hutcherson&#x27;s work and and Ken Shoulders&#x27;s work was born out of John Hutcherson&#x27;s work to a degree. I&#x27;ve since found out uh uh that and I made this public in the second presentation at Cosmic Summit &gt;&gt; that actually Ken shoulders worked with Winston Bostic on plasmmoids &gt;&gt; which is a fascinating story. I recommend Robert Temple&#x27;s book. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So, so basically uh and this picture emerged and uh I was going oh my god I&#x27;m going to have to change this. So I had three days of trauma. I I presented the first two hours on how how this technology works and the second two hour uh second two hours on the fact that 911 was done with this technology and mad shinasm was like like this and some of the other nuclear scientists were like were like this the seven students that were there like what did I just watch but there was a guy in the room uh called Su house Ralcar and immediately I finished my presentation he chased me he tapped me on the shoulders he says we need to talk M &gt;&gt; and basically I was meant to go out with the students the following day uh to have a tour around Mumbai because I tend to just fly in somewhere work and then leave. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s just another hotel room and another presentation room. So but they wanted to show me around and then this guy invited me to his lab and I saw some of these effects in the lab in the following morning &gt;&gt; that I was predicting was possible.</p>
<p>and he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve spent four years of my life and nearly a million dollars of loan to work out what you just said.&quot; And he like he&#x27;s a world expert in ultrasonics and his wife is an expert in chemistry and they&#x27;re in their 70s like this is the sum total of their knowledge from their life and and building technologies. And they observed when they were doing this cleaning of this animal fat off iron sheet that was going to be zinc dipped, they used an ultrasound thing. And he found these white spots and the white spots had oxipite in there. And he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where this is coming from. It big splot of transmutation caused by intense sound.</p>
<p>How how how are we making new elements that are not in the fat and they&#x27;re not in the water or whatever? Where where is it coming from?&quot; And so that started his journey on transmutation. And in it was in his lab that I had some high-speed cameras with me that I took um some video of this column with this large uh 19.46 kHz uh um tube with loads of uh sound transducers at the top to putting in about one and a half kilows of 19.46 kHz sound. And it had these bubble and these tooidal structures coming out. And I I I did it at 240 frames a second so I could see how they would flow into each other. And that completely changed my uh uh journey from that point on because I could see what nature was doing.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like a smoke ring coming out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Bob, I knew about the involvement with 911. I want to speak to that a little bit more in just a second personally why why I wanted to talk about it. &gt;&gt; But I didn&#x27;t know that you that you discussing 911 &gt;&gt; Yeah. kind of inspired someone to come to you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; If I had not discussed 911, I would not really know how it would work and I would not know how antigravity would work. I would not know how cold fusion would work and I would not have been able to connect it to ancient uh iconography uh symbol. I thought it was just tangential to your story, but it actually led &gt;&gt; absolutely my my literally potentially blowing my reputation and ending my career such that it was in this field was the the door through which I had to go to be shown that one it&#x27;s real and and two that that uh it gave me that initial view on hydrodnamics in m middle of 2017. I then was able my brain was cued to seeing it under the lion experiments to see the the fractal hydrodnamics running under the the cold fusion which is a diamond nickel dutarium oxide based cold fusion reaction reactor that worked four times in a row um by Neil Crime Gold, the late Neil Crime Gold. Sadly another person that probably died from the jab.</p>
<p>Um &gt;&gt; Bob, I&#x27;d like your in just a moment your wildest speculation on 911 because here&#x27;s kind of where I was on this. When we went to India, we had plenty of time to talk as you do at such things sitting around the hotel &gt;&gt; and you got into 911 and I didn&#x27;t know you carried an opinion on it. I think we talked about it once subsequently, but I was horrified because you were just becoming my guru and you want all the gurus things to fit with where you I was like, &quot;Oh gosh, God, he&#x27;s a 911 conspiracy guy and he&#x27;s tied his wonderful science and esoteric knowledge into this thing that I can&#x27;t swallow.&quot; So, it was out of I think Overton window is the term, you know, but that&#x27;s my personal Overton window. It fell out &gt;&gt; and and that is not an uncommon reaction by far and I&#x27;m a little bit I embarrassed to say or whatever it making amends now but the Tucker Carlson opened the Overton window on this subject very wide in the last month or so &gt;&gt; and did a little effort. I mean I&#x27;m not so interested in who did it and why they did it.</p>
<p>I mean the the why you can see from what happened afterwards, right? So although I think a large proportion of that other than the restricting of freedoms and and the more spying uh were an utter failure. &gt;&gt; Well, give me your speculation, you know, and then your evidence in a minute, but but if you will just for the sexy part first that your conclusions based on the evidence lead you to speculate what brought down the towers, what happened? So, um, if you&#x27;re going to have an explanation, the explanation must explain the magnetometers in Alaska. &gt;&gt; Okay, please proceed, sir. &gt;&gt; So, so what Judy Wood did was Judy Wood uh put together a book of evidence. Now, she&#x27;s not saying necessarily what did it, although she does show that the work of Ken Shoulders explains the work of John Hutcherson.</p>
<p>and John Hutcherson&#x27;s actual artifacts, physical artifacts, uh some of which I have in this room &gt;&gt; show the same kind of thing going on uh uh as was observed which cannot be explained by normal engineering. Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, uh one magnetometers.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s seven magnetometers in Alaska and the those uh were showing at the point of the impact of the first plane all the way through to the collapse of building seven severe anomalies before returning to uh normal. It must &gt;&gt; just so people understand it a magnetometer is what &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s showing the earth&#x27;s magnetic field. &gt;&gt; Okay. And so the magnetic field saw a flux in &gt;&gt; seven different things thousands of kilometers apart miles apart a long way away. This is in Alaska.</p>
<p>This is not this is not next to New York. &gt;&gt; So like you you would want magnetos to to be nor near near a pole of the earth. So it&#x27;s it&#x27;s sensible that they are in Alaska or or you know in the northern hemisphere there and not necessarily around the equator. You know your magnettoers are going to give you a better reading. Uh so you would site them there.</p>
<p>But they all all seven of them uh in these disperate locations showed these uh fluctuations. And you can see the events, you know, the first plane hit, the second plane hit, the first building fall, the third the the the the uh second tower falling and then building seven and then it returns to normal. &gt;&gt; Well, I want to distinguish it from a seismometer when someone could believe that the tallest building. &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, when you come to seismometers, the buildings falling didn&#x27;t really leave a signature. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. But you would have seen it at a, you know, Ruckers in New Jersey or something maybe, right? I mean, you could there might be a little shake. Okay. it just to distinguish it. This is a wave not of you know earthquake like kinetic energy but a flux in magnetism.</p>
<p>Why would that occur? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll come to that. I&#x27;m telling you the things that you must explain in any theory that uh is not the government theory. So the government conspiracy is a a a bunch of people whose passports don&#x27;t burn and who some of them apparently are still alive after the event even though they were taking place they were actually flying these planes although there&#x27;s no evidence of them getting on the planes. Um there&#x27;s all these things that&#x27;s not my bag. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That is the government conspiracy theory. Okay. A person that&#x27;s already dead and another one that&#x27;s still flying in Saudi Arabia. They apparently flow and flew the hijack planes. Right.</p>
<p>So, and they&#x27;re still on the list as the people that did it even though, you know, all these anomalies have been found which make the whole official conspiracy theory totally absurd, right? Um and and that Tucker to be to be fair did not go into those aspects, right? T Tucker Tucker opened a crack on the door to the Overton, sorry, on the window. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he opened the crack, but really it it it it you can&#x27;t stop there, Tucker. You can&#x27;t just stop at the start. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You need to delve into that in a little bit more detail.</p>
<p>Um and he went into areas that are really no real material difference. You can&#x27;t go back and change who who did it and why. You can you can fix what happened afterwards uh to the best of your ability. You can&#x27;t bring back all the people that died as a result of it, which is the bit that I really care about. All the death and mayhem that was sanctioned by that.</p>
<p>Um but anyway, so the second thing is is the global consciousness project. If you cannot explain their observation that atomic clocks around the world change their decay rate uh uh with planes going into a building, then you&#x27;ve got a problem, right? &gt;&gt; Change the decay rate of atomic clocks which they &gt;&gt; said regular. &gt;&gt; Exactly. They they say it&#x27;s because there was humans focusing their attention and it was a a a conscious con uh change in the way that the thing works. That is not the explanation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Who is they there? Not certainly &gt;&gt; global consciousness project. They said it was the attention of so many humans on the events that day that literally warped time. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Fair enough.</p>
<p>And also it has a completely different explanation to what I would have. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; The the the next one is the spark on the building of the planes.</p>
<p>As they&#x27;re approaching the building, you see from multiple angles there&#x27;s a spark. Okay. Now, this is actually a very easy one to explain. Um uh it, you know, a lot of people have said it&#x27;s some explosion that goes off before or some sort of whatever. a guy called Russ George visited me a number of years ago um when he was interested in some of the work that we were doing and he talked uh I did a video and it&#x27;s on our Soundcloud um uh which I called muons in a bottle and the reason I called it muons in a bottle was because uh he said that they have these special devices which can collect muons and when a plane lands a plane must be grounded because it check collects massive massive amounts of static charge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; But he said they&#x27;re actually collecting the new ones, not the static charge. I think they&#x27;re collecting charge clusters. And to put it into context, Henry Marray went into the desert and put up a big panel to collect static electricity. Nicola Tesla went into the desert and put up a very big copper sphere to collect static electricity.</p>
<p>If you go to the top of a mountain in an arid place, your hair stands on end. Why? Because there&#x27;s a lot of static electricity. If you go to the top of the Great Pyramid of Egypt, you will get a static effect. There is an electrical potential between the top and the bottom. Okay? So, a plane which is a piece of metal can aggregate charge clusters as it&#x27;s flying through the air.</p>
<p>When the plane gets close to the building, it&#x27;s a sheet of aluminium all the way down to earth. It&#x27;s literally a lightning conductor. So, this is the most easy thing to explain. as it approaches the building, there&#x27;s a discharge of this uh charge between the plane and the building. Okay, so that that&#x27;s an easy one to explain.</p>
<p>Uh now, if you want to do the effect that that I believe may explain all of the above, um there&#x27;s hurricane Aaron. Hurricane Aaron, we&#x27;ve known since um the Boeing patents and probably from Tesla time that there are ways to manipulate weather systems. Um there&#x27;s a guy um uh uh who well essentially basically this weather system, it was a category 4 storm. It came all the way to New York, parked itself off New York, and then once the the buildings had fallen, it then moved away, right? And it wasn&#x27;t reported on the day because it was off the coast. But but what it&#x27;ll do is it&#x27;ll produces a a large uh potential in the sky next to ground and it polarizes the vacuum.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s it&#x27;s exactly what goes on in the Hutcherson effect. You need to polarize the vacuum to create the flux in the in in a particular direction. Okay. Um and then you have cases of uh levitation going on. There&#x27;s David Hanschurch uh New York Daily News.</p>
<p>He was carried a block and lost his cell phone and cameras. Uh there was the loss of the mass of the building, large amounts of the dust. Uh &gt;&gt; that didn&#x27;t make sense to me right off the bat. I just &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re able to walk around in the subterranean levels. The idea that it all went into a hole is just nonsense because they&#x27;re able to walk around in the parking lot and in the the the the metro system and it&#x27;s basically not collapsed in.</p>
<p>So h what&#x27;s happened there? Clearly, a lot of dust floated away. And in fact, one of the pictures that Judy would was looking for was a satellite picture. And she in her book, Where Did the Tales Go? She actually shows this satellite photo on by NASA on the day of 911 with this huge plume of dust going away. &gt;&gt; And that is when she found Hurricane Aaron because it&#x27;s sitting there on the same satellite photo, this massive, massive hurricane. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s sitting off the coast. &gt;&gt; September 11th, that&#x27;s hurricane season. Never heard such a thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think &gt;&gt; explain the planes to me. I think I asked you that in India.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, you know, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the government conspiracy theory, isn&#x27;t it? Is that the planes were involved? &gt;&gt; They may have It doesn&#x27;t matter. Here&#x27;s the thing. I the the day of &gt;&gt; Were there actual planes involved? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know. I wasn&#x27;t there. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a good answer.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I wasn&#x27;t there. I saw &gt;&gt; And actually, you never speak to anything that you don&#x27;t see yourself generally. Well, I I know that at the time I could have faked those very very easily because I had a DPS edit bay. I literally had the skills and the video equipment to fake those videos. &gt;&gt; India and I and I don&#x27;t mean to play skept or anything but people were asking these questions that are listening.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um yeah, you can fake fake video and you used to be in the business of animation. &gt;&gt; I mean CG &gt;&gt; Yeah, CG and video manipulation. So you can actually speak this stuff. But doesn&#x27;t that presume that aren&#x27;t there a number of people in Manhattan that happen to be looking up that did see something in the sky? &gt;&gt; Some people, if you look at some of the testimonies, a lot of people&#x27;s testimonies are are what they were told to think. And if you want it, some of the people say, &quot;Well, it didn&#x27;t really look like a normal passenger plane.</p>
<p>It was blacked out and there was no windows.&quot; This is all irrelevant. On the day of the event, I have t taken delivery of a Mexicanstyle chimnia for my garden. It&#x27;s literally come to the door in the morning of 911 and I&#x27;m building in my garden and the phone goes off and I I it&#x27;s Fate. Fate was a Libyan football player and he became a diplomat and came to the UK. He married an English woman and that English woman&#x27;s uh uh their daughter was my girlfriend for about five years.</p>
<p>And he phones me up and says, &quot;Bob, terrible news, terrible news.&quot; I said, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong, Fatty?&quot; He says, &quot;Oh my god, terrible news. Turn on the news. Turn on the news.&quot; And so I turned on, this was before the second uh uh &gt;&gt; uh tower had been hit. Now that chimnia was made of mild steel, cast iron, basically. I could burn anthraite, the hot hottest burning hydrocarbon you can get, and I could burn it in there till the end of time, and it would never even get close to melting.</p>
<p>Right. Right &gt;&gt; now, I visited the 911 museum for the first time. The first time I&#x27;ve been to New York since I stood on the South Tower uh in 1999. &gt;&gt; Right. Or 1998, in October the 10th, one of those two years.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I went to the 911 museum. Some of the steel there is like 4 in thick. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s at the bottom. It&#x27;s like a wedding cake. It&#x27;s like having a piece of paper at the top and saying that that piece of paper at the top can crush a Titanic at the bottom because it gets thinner and thinner and thinner all the way up. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; It reminds me of the Carolina Bays.</p>
<p>Now, that&#x27;s a stretch, but it&#x27;s like if somebody just said, &quot;What happened to that building?&quot; and showed you just a generic video of it or whatnot, you&#x27;d say, &quot;Well, it went poof. &gt;&gt; It didn&#x27;t fall down. It kind of just &gt;&gt; poof is the right right phrase. &gt;&gt; It went poof.&quot; &gt;&gt; And but then you are explained like the Carolina Bays. Oh, no.</p>
<p>That isn&#x27;t something that came from above and hit. That&#x27;s a combination of wind water, but intuitively you look at it and you say, &quot;What went poof?&quot; So, &gt;&gt; there are testimonies of people saying that there are basically no pieces of glass found from the buildings. That is two 110s story buildings which had a lot of windows &gt;&gt; covered with glass and there&#x27;s no Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now there&#x27;s a very interesting experience uh in the 1980s by uh uh a guy who discovered Ormas. Um, and he was trying to work out what was and he bought this uh tungsten arc uh crucible and it basically has a big copper uh um sort of bowl that you put your sample in and you have a big tungsten uh uh electrode and he he shot it and what happened was the whole piece of tungsten immediately disappeared &gt;&gt; and it was meant to be good for 2,000 smelting events, right? And then we thought, well, okay, well, let&#x27;s try that again.</p>
<p>So, we put a new electrode in the size of my thumb and did it again and it disappeared. And you know what? The glass in the laboratory outside of the furnace through him on the back wall of the laboratory. All of the glassear had started to crumble, &gt;&gt; fragment and crumble. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Now, whilst some people had said there was no glass there, in the central part of the museum, there was about six pieces that they said were from the towers, and they were about that big.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, up until going to the museum, I the the testimony was there was never any glass found. Okay. There was no computer CPU units.</p>
<p>There was no uh um uh filing cabinets except for one. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; There was something like 40,000 filing cabinets and the paper was all over New York. But where are the filing cabinets gone? Okay.</p>
<p>This one that was found was actually in the subterranean level. Remember the level that wasn&#x27;t completely destroyed. They walked in and basically it was from Ben and Jerry&#x27;s &gt;&gt; and Yeah. And it would look like a spaceship that had crumpled up. It literally looks like an alien spaceship.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like like this. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a file cabinet. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a filing cabinet. And when they took this filing cabinet apart, they found all of the coins, despite the metals in the coins, having massively different melting temperatures, had fused together, but still kept their embossing on them. &gt;&gt; Absolutely impossible with normal physics.</p>
<p>If your planes melting at 70 story up does not explain how the metal fuses together with all different melting point metals and you know what the paper in the banknotes were not even uh singed and they were returned to the Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s owner. So how does all the metal fuse together but the paper which burnt ignites at Fahrenheit 451? How does that happen? &gt;&gt; Well, how does it happen, Bob? That&#x27;s why we we have you here with us today. &gt;&gt; The other thing is when you&#x27;re coming out and you can&#x27;t take any photos in that central zone of of the museum, &gt;&gt; they have a Bible and the Bible was recovered from a a um according to the only person who was able to go into ground zero, it was a a Jewish chap. He was able to take uh photographs. He was the official photographer.</p>
<p>This fireman came up to him and said, &quot;Look, look at this artifact.&quot; And it was basically, and this is the description of the photographer, it&#x27;s a Bible fused to molten steel. Right? That is actually impossible because I&#x27;ve seen the Bible physically in front of me in this part of the museum and the paper is not singed. And you know what&#x27;s really spooky about it? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s on the page. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. and I say unto you, turn the other cheek essentially.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, quite a coincidence and probably a fitting one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But they they didn&#x27;t arrange the &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; Believe that. &gt;&gt; You have very fine.</p>
<p>You know how you get those Bibles where the paper is basically tissue paper? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Some of the thinnest paper you ever read. &gt;&gt; How on earth can that not ignite when you&#x27;ve got steel molten on it? &gt;&gt; It makes absolutely no sense. But but what why does that suggest something that involves no low energy nuclear? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ll come to that. We&#x27;ll come to that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. I&#x27;m not rushing. Yeah. I just &gt;&gt; as you&#x27;re coming out of the that area, you&#x27;re not allowed to take a photograph.</p>
<p>Right. &gt;&gt; There is some of this extremely thick steel and is bent like a noodle without any cracks or fractures on the welds or on the length of the box frame. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a box frame that&#x27;s bent like that. It&#x27;s so surreal. You look go, &quot;What on earth happened there? How is that even possible?&quot; &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Then there are these things called the seismic signals. We talked about those. So if your plane going into the building with the jet fuel, now bearing in mind anthraite cannot burn normal mild steel, right? That&#x27;s the hottest hydrocarbon. It cannot burn. It cannot my my my chimney that day when I set it off it&#x27;s it never failed.</p>
<p>It never failed, right? Uh let alone kerosene. And when I was given a flamethrower by my father as a young teenager, it burned all the cellulose, but it didn&#x27;t burn the thin wire on the barb wire fencing. All the cellulose. Right? So a thin one 3 mm barb wire piece of wire does not melt and all the cellulose burns. Right? I&#x27;m I&#x27;m putting a big uh kerosene.</p>
<p>He has said kerosene. It was so so surreal. My dad never It&#x27;s called diesel in the UK, but he said kerosene. It&#x27;s the most weird thing. Um and then basically uh you you have these noodles.</p>
<p>Um then you have these things called the the seismic signal. Where was the seismic signal? So if if the planes going into the building does not explain the seismic signal, then you&#x27;ve got a problem. Um, and then &gt;&gt; seismic. Hold on. You&#x27;re differentiating that from the the magnometers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally different. One one is the vi the vibration that comes out when a thing falls onto the ground, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Magnetometers are measuring a magnetic field fluctuation in the magnetic field of the earth. &gt;&gt; But but that&#x27;s right. But the the magnetism showed a fluctuation. The seis there was no seismicity.</p>
<p>It was very much less than the kingdom which was only like I don&#x27;t know very much shorter building. You don&#x27;t have to think about whatever took it down. The seismic signal was not sufficient for the height of the building. &gt;&gt; Whatever took it down. &gt;&gt; Not a gotcha.</p>
<p>I gota say it didn&#x27;t even occur to me to &gt;&gt; I was in DC to testify to Congress the following day. &gt;&gt; Right. And we were on the PTOAC at the closest hotel to the Pentagon and we were watching the first tower, you know, damaged. &gt;&gt; So, everyone was looking at the tower. They weren&#x27;t watching at the Tomahawk cruise missile going into the Pentagon.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. Then the second one fell. I don&#x27;t know. And then whatever. My wife and I felt the damn thing hit the Pentagon.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; And and then started seeing smoke and I said, she said, &quot;What happened? What happened? what happened? I said, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s just the elevator. That&#x27;s why the room shook. They got a bad elevator around here.</p>
<p>I heard it all night. It&#x27;s making no sense.&quot; You know, she newlyweds and and she said, &quot;But look, there&#x27;s smoke over there. There&#x27;s smoke. There&#x27;s smoke.&quot; And I said, &quot;They&#x27;re burning leaves. They&#x27;re burning leaves.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s September 11th, you know.&quot; And I sitting there making up. &gt;&gt; You were trying to uh calm her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Trying to calm her. And then she said, um, uh, or then we were watching the TV and they said to the thing, &quot;Oh, oh no, we saw a helicopter and then a jet and then boom, it was on the TV and I said, &quot;We got to get the hell out of here.&quot; And I immediately went out because I didn&#x27;t have any gas in my truck.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Go get gas, honey, and we&#x27;re going to get you back to North Carolina. We got to get the hell out of this town.&quot; And got out there and immediately got stuck in gridlock traffic &gt;&gt; in the car and she&#x27;s back in the thing. So then I turned just to tell the story. So then I turned onto the median, this road out of median that runs through southeast Washington, southwest and drove down the median like Mad Max back to the hotel to my newly wet and then we we posted up there, you know, for the rest of the evening. But but if I felt it hit the Pentagon, some things had to fall.</p>
<p>I mean, what were they doing? &gt;&gt; I mean, there was there&#x27;s General Stubble and he was an expert in doing satellite reconnaissance. uh he&#x27;s dead, but he said that his assessment of the photos that the turbine in there was a cruise missile turbine. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So, that&#x27;s not necessarily an energy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There were some people that were like right next to where it went in the building and and and uh they walked out. &gt;&gt; Uh I know some of them because the US Army Corps of Engineers was right on the edge there and I was actually laying in my bed that morning all mad at myself saying, &quot;I wasted the day in DC. I should have gone and seen my regulators at the Pentagon because that&#x27;s where they regulate wetlands, believe it or not. But strangely enough, I was worried about not being in the rooms that were right beside what fell apart. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that was the problem.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And and and that&#x27;s right. They could walk up to the edge or whatever, glance out of the thing. Nobody was like sightseeing, you know, but but yeah, it was that kind of thing. It just was either there or what. &gt;&gt; So weird.</p>
<p>I did not mean to insert myself into 9/11. &gt;&gt; You know, you&#x27;ve got a personal visceral memory from that. I think probably everyone that was of certain age have their own memory. Like I say, my my memory was, you know, building that iron chimney and literally having an Arab phoning me up and and who was from formerly from Libya. And by the way, he hated Gaddafi.</p>
<p>This is all before you you know, people died. um sort of thing. Um but yeah, so whatever it&#x27;s it&#x27;s is all kinds of trauma in the world and I think that was the entire point of it that you know uh whichever conspiracy theory it turns out to be true in the fullness of time. Um, you know, but I I&#x27;m meeting increasingly people who were not even alive when it happened. And and in fact, we we&#x27;re going to get to the point very soon where most people on planet Earth were not born before 911.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; God, that makes makes you feel old. So, uh, the time is now because anyway, what I will say is, and I I feel for all of the people that died, uh, or suffered because they lost a loved one, the millions of people that died as a result of the wars, the trillions of money that was spent uh, from the UK and the US that the taxpayers are now suffering for and having to make difficult decisions over, um, and all of the millions of people that were displaced. Um, that said, if it wasn&#x27;t for whoever did whatever, regardless, I would not have been able to understand the technology that I&#x27;ve been able to uh share with people. &gt;&gt; Go through a little bit more of the the evidence. I mean, everything from melting cars.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. So, so there&#x27;s things called there&#x27;s a noodle thing which is like how how do things turn to jelly and and and and lose their structural integrity. There&#x27;s another thing that that Judy Wood calls Cheetos. He calls them Cheetos because they&#x27;re basically sitting there and glowing orange. &gt;&gt; Um this is basically glowing metal uh right next to unburnt paper.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m going to say something publicly for the first time now. I&#x27;ve been testing a technology uh that&#x27;s been replicated by a maverick and genius called Griffin Brock. &gt;&gt; And Griffin Brock has replicated the Tesla shadow graph tube uh for the first time uh in over 120 years. Uh he&#x27;s also done it in a way that it produces live X-rays. That is to say they&#x27;re not real X-rays, they are shadow graphs.</p>
<p>Um and they&#x27;re much better than X-rays because they don&#x27;t produce a divergent beam. So in the case of an X-ray, you have to be very close to the source and the the detector has to be very close to the thing that you&#x27;re passing the X-rays through. It&#x27;s why because they fire a high energy electron beam say into a piece of tungsten and it produces a spray of X-ray particles. In this it produces co-limited rays that is basically columns like like light coming from the sun that produces hard shadows and so it produces high contrast even at 50 feet away you can produce good X-rays. That&#x27;s how co-limited it is.</p>
<p>Now, in one of our chats, because I&#x27;ve been looking at this technology for radiation remediation, and I&#x27;m going to be talking about what our findings are, and it&#x27;s absolutely stunning, by the way. Um, uh, but it is producing these energy solutons, uh, this, uh, etheric matter, this dark light that Tesla called it. Um and uh essentially uh he was talking about his experiences and he talked about how uh in one of his experiments the electrode uh uh glowed bright orange or orange and I said just say that again it glowed orange. I said that&#x27;s not possible. He said why? I said because alum melts before you can visibly see its color glowing.</p>
<p>Hm. Yeah. Never seen anything aluminum glow. &gt;&gt; You can if you go into a dark room and aluminium is just below its melting temperature, you can just see a faint glow. But in any other lighting conditions, it&#x27;s not glowing.</p>
<p>Now, when you heat it up as a liquid, it&#x27;ll glow like anything else like black body radiation. If you have aluminium and it&#x27;s at 1,200 or 1500 degrees then but it tends to ignite um you know you can even ignite aluminium at 600 and something degrees some people have found. Okay. You just need to remove the oxide layer and it reacts very powerfully with air &gt;&gt; like magnesium. &gt;&gt; Not like magnesium.</p>
<p>Mag magnesium is a little bit more uh &gt;&gt; but same thing a metal that burns. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It&#x27;s a It&#x27;s a metal that burns, especially if it&#x27;s uh vaporized. Okay. So So the thing is that this is what Judy Wood found evidence for in the NIST photos.</p>
<p>These are publicly released photos. You have these objects, these what look like metallic objects and they&#x27;re glowing orange. There&#x27;s even a photo of like a a digger pulling a piece of metal out of the ground and it&#x27;s glowing orange. Now, this is what John Hutcherson observed. He observed metal that was glowing orange but not hot.</p>
<p>And in one of those cases, Alec Pazaro, who was working with him at the time, came over, he turned off the electromagnetic system and that glowing orange thing stopped glowing orange. And as he went over, it wasn&#x27;t just that it was not hot. It was actually cooler. He could feel it be, you know, how you approach an ice cube and it feels cold. This is how it it felt cooler than his hand.</p>
<p>Like it&#x27;s sucking IR photons from your hand. And then when he went to pick it up, his fingers went into the metal and it left fingerprints in there and it smeared as he went out. They went in about 4 mm into the alum. Now this is interesting because I was recounting this story back in 2017 on the third trip to go and see uh Su House Ralcar in India because he was not playing ball &gt;&gt; and so we got to talk about stuff to make sure we were using the time effectively. And he talked about this anecdote because for two decades he was instructed to go around and then when the electricity board said someone had a lightning strike or a bull lightning strike, can you go and investigate? he would go and documented these things in Hungary.</p>
<p>And one of the cases he documented was this guy, he was in a train and he&#x27;s going along in the train and this bull lightning like structure comes along and it&#x27;s kind of moving along with the train and it then just touches the window frame which is made of aluminium and the the account is that for about 20 minutes he was able to manipulate the aluminium with his fingers. &gt;&gt; Really? Tell us what ball lightning is. The history of ball lightning research particular. &gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s an extremely long history. Uh they did a study back in the 80s or 90s or something in the past and they found that like one in 10 people have seen some form of thing that could be described as ball lining.</p>
<p>It ranges from extremely small like millimeters across up to something that appears to be the size of a barn. Um there&#x27;s a very very good and I think very authentic ball lightning structure that that was captured in Canada very recently. It got a lot of uh press. &gt;&gt; Oh really videoed. &gt;&gt; Really good video.</p>
<p>And when it when it dies just after it dies it reveals three small ball lightnings inside that then fade away. &gt;&gt; No kidding. Absolutely. Because there&#x27;s there are some great ball lightning videos but not enough. It&#x27;s kind of like you can see &gt;&gt; there are some really terribly fake ones which people seem to roll out repeatedly even when you know.</p>
<p>So anyway, but this one &gt;&gt; that one that jumps along the railroad track. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the fake one. &gt;&gt; Is that the fake one? That&#x27;s why I brought it up. Okay. &gt;&gt; Done by a a Scandinavian.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s easy for me as a C CG artist to see when something is fake like that. But the one is is in my view very real and and it&#x27;s very real for secondarily because when it dies it breaks into three small structures uh h which are the right quantization and scale size for the macro object that that first is is observed. So it&#x27;s a very very good uh um you know demonstration of the phenomena at work on a macro scale. Now it&#x27;s it&#x27;s scale invariant but the the fields inside are much higher when it&#x27;s smaller. Well, what does it look like? Again, for people that kind of new to the subject, you know, ball lightning is what kind of phenomena is it? Why could it ever? &gt;&gt; Ball lightning is a thing that no one wants to talk about in the mainstream physics community because they have no explanation for it.</p>
<p>But &gt;&gt; I realized that it is the key to fusion. Uh, and it is the key to uh faster than light transportation, to anti-gravity, to teleportation, to transmutation. uh to all of the magic, all of the all of the important magic that would that they call complete magic. &gt;&gt; Excuse my French. You&#x27;ll have to put a beep in there in in military circles.</p>
<p>Um and then after I gave my presentation at ICCF26 in in Maroka in Japan in May, I have been given another 60 kilograms of Dr. Taka Akim Matsumoto&#x27;s work. Uh it&#x27;s interesting in the first 142 kilograms that I got he had three things exper his experiments some videos from the late 1990s or mid no early 1990s on crop circles &gt;&gt; and the only other videos he had in his collection that he handpicked for me were videos of 911. &gt;&gt; Really? I didn&#x27;t know that Matsumoto picked up on that, too. &gt;&gt; Tell us who he is and why he&#x27;s important.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve done great work preserving his I I&#x27;m doing a it&#x27;s called he he wrote this book in 2000 called steps to the discovery of electronuclear collapse. &gt;&gt; He started out as many people did after Martin Fleshman and Stanley Ponds doing uh the kind of replications of palladium dutarium. He found that inside his electrodes there was metal being consumed and disappearing. right inside the electrodes when he cut them open there&#x27;s metal disappearing and around the disappeared metal you had trans transmuted elements that were not in the original electrode he also observed when you heated that up in a residual gas analyzer he was finding tritium helium neon other elements gases gases in there that were synthesized as well um so not only uh uh solid elements but gases being synthesized and these are not your normal elements other than helium that you would expect from DD fusion. Okay.</p>
<p>So, uh cut a long story short, by 200 by 19934, he had been told by uh um a guy called Ed Lewis who worked with some of the pioneers of cold fusion that uh these are the same things as plasmoids uh and micro ball lightning. And he realized that that was the case. And then after he started talking about microvool lightning the fusion technology journal of the American nuclear society stopped making it possible for him to publish his work. Uh and that&#x27;s very interesting because the following year in uh May 1995 the air force under RR Roth published a paper saying what the fusion community can learn from bull lightning. This was in May 1995.</p>
<p>Now what &gt;&gt; let me guess it&#x27;s not still available. What happened in 1995 is right as as as Matsumoto was showing how this works and repeatedly showing the process was he was sent something uh by uh two Californian researchers um uh uh I can try and remember the name but I don&#x27;t remember offic but Bennett and Kulie right these Bennett and Kulie &gt;&gt; and uh I found these documents after I given my presentation in Maroka in this extra 40 kilograms. Okay. And I&#x27;m having to scan this because between me and the people traveling with me that were willing to take bags back to Europe, I didn&#x27;t have enough space. And so I had to take the documents that weren&#x27;t so important and scan them and and and and basically dump them.</p>
<p>They they were like other people&#x27;s papers which he had annotated for instance from other cold fusion conferences all the way up to 2019 actually. um uh he w read everyone&#x27;s papers meticulously and in this work there were a whole bundle kept together of documents from Koulian Bennett and in there uh he&#x27;d kept the actual postdated stamped envelopes as well stapled to each of the documents in sequence there&#x27;s this absolute level insane levels of documentation and what they were doing was citing Ken shoulders work via Hal Fox who had actually bought the patents. Matt Takaaki Matsumoto a couple a Russian and Italian group has having getting very close to what they had Koulian Bennett in their patent application in early 1995. And in this briefing document that they sent to uh Bill Clinton, to the press secretary of Al Gore, to all of the heads of the national labs, to the editor of fusion technology, to uh all all of the major energy journals and the major press uh was this in our system. It creates a uh self-confining uh plasma structure magneto hydrodronamics bull lightning fusion technology like a mini sun.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re literally saying what I found out and the diagram that they show is exactly what I&#x27;ve shown at cosmic summit in the last two years as the key basis. And the point which they say is where the fusion occurs is literally where I&#x27;ve identified from looking at stuff under a microscope. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s this guy called Steven Kvet. Steven Critic had an 11year crusade &gt;&gt; and he managed to get the people that are working on the ITA the the international fusion project in in uh uh uh Europe that&#x27;s being funded by the US for Russia by China by Japan whatever South Korea and UK &gt;&gt; these rude Goldberg machines that are &gt;&gt; massive massive 40s story or whatever it is structure I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s absurd he managed that to get them after 11 years to admit it will never produce produce more power electrical out than goes in. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. It doesn&#x27;t always it&#x27;s always been a an obfuscation I keeping people from the truth. So, uh this guy I find that he had published one of these documents that I that was in the Matsumoto archive and it was it was within two weeks of Matsumoto receiving a document which was a transferral of technology in such a way that it wouldn&#x27;t impinge upon the patent rights. So Matsumoto was going to get some a kit to be able to replicate the technology. He just had to sign on the dotted line.</p>
<p>Right. Two or three weeks later, Steven Civet publishes one of the earlier documents that was sent to Matsumoto, which is this brick uh which is an abstract from the patent. And at the bottom, because Steven Civet is like a bull in a china shop, if he want if if someone tells him he can&#x27;t do something, he&#x27;s a journalist. He&#x27;s going to do it. At the bottom, he says, &quot;At time of going to press, this patent has been bumped up to the Department of Energy and Department of Defense for classification review.</p>
<p>It was classified in 1995. We could have had unlimited energy for 30 years.&quot; &gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s right. But let&#x27;s wind back if you will. Tell them &gt;&gt; it is ball lightning. It is fusion technology.</p>
<p>And the way that I have worked out you can do it is you can do it very simply in a cavitation device &gt;&gt; which is just sound resonant standing wave sound interfering sound. What? There is some Italians uh and uh um Cardoneal they have found that they could cause transmutation in stainless steel by putting sound into it and on the standing wave nodes they get transmuted materials. This is this is to say they can get fusion in metal using resonant standing wave sound. &gt;&gt; Is that like the star in a jar experiment? Does that have any relation to it? I was always &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve got no jar. It&#x27;s a lump of metal.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like a building. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re producing that same heat within metal instead of a jar of water. &gt;&gt; Well, what it&#x27;s showing is that on the standing wave nodes effectively what I&#x27;ve derived is you get a yin-yang structure forming around it. And one very specifically is gravity.</p>
<p>That is the yin. That is the condensing force. And the other one is anti-gravity. It&#x27;s the yang. It&#x27;s the de deconstructing force.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay? And they work together to create balance. Gravity and anti-gravity waves. And what&#x27;s literally happened in the last few weeks is because I I proposed that in my 2022 paper presentation rather in Azizi in Italy to the cold fusion community. I connected it with the anapole moment, the tooidal moment. The toroidal moment is absolutely critical to this process.</p>
<p>But I showed that in cavitation you&#x27;re getting this uh gravity anti-gravity structure forming and then depending on the formation it can ultimately be a gravity or an anti-gravity macro structure at the top level depending on its fractalization. What&#x27;s happened recently is I&#x27;ve done a series of presentations. Uh, one is is o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ode day uh coher and the next one is fly me to the moon and the the the last one I did as an emergency uh uh for my first ever emergency transmation which is which is um uh project time those last three presentations what&#x27;s happened is that um in Russia there&#x27;s a guy called Chisoff Chisoff is a absolute genius okay He won the uh one of the most senior and most important prizes of the Soviet Union. Why? Because he developed the technology to grow large quartz crystals that enabled for the first time for the Soviet Union to produce high-powered lasers and everything that comes from that. Everything that comes from that.</p>
<p>Okay. So, he won this incredible award. So in this presentation which I shared, I did a detailed translation of it and I shared the slides and so on. Uh he shows that using a laser and an angle grinder in acceleration only in acceleration only in one way rotating one way it pushes the laser beam up and if you turn the angle grind over it it pulls it down. That is changing the refractive index of the medium in the same way that occurs when light is trying to go around a sun or a black hole.</p>
<p>That is saying it is producing a gravity effect one way and an anti-gravity effect the other way. This can be done by students. I&#x27;m in the process of replicating the thing myself. I was absolutely blown away because this is exactly what&#x27;s going on in a cavitation experiment. You&#x27;ve got a vortex one way and a counter vortex going the other.</p>
<p>One is going one way. Now, why does it work? In my view, very very simply, I would argue that all weak processes occur with with left-handed kerality electrons and left-handed kerality nutrinos. And nutrinos, relic nutrinos, they are a model of gravity according to Bob McLarath of CERN theory group in 2008. Okay, their standard model compliant model of gravity. And so you&#x27;re able to use the electrons spinning, but it&#x27;s only when they&#x27;re accelerating.</p>
<p>And the what that does, it creates a drag frame in the the medium of the ether. And this proves Mickelson and Mley wrong. This is absolutely earthshattering that I that I&#x27;ve been sharing. And then I find someone sends me this video of this guy called um uh uh Dr. Joseph Farrell.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never seen this guy&#x27;s work. I think I saw a presentation. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He he he&#x27;s great. He&#x27;s &gt;&gt; Anyway, so I&#x27;m seeing this presentation this person sent me.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going, &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s all this stuff about did the Germans make the nuclear bombs and blah blah.&quot; all sorts of crazy stuff. &gt;&gt; Then the second part of the presentation was talking and he talked about this guy um uh who&#x27;s essentially um worked for General Electric. &gt;&gt; Yeah. His name is uh Gabriel Cron and he was a I think he was a Jew from uh um the Transian part of uh uh it was it was a it was part of Hungary or became part of Hungary but anyway &gt;&gt; he came to work in the states but before he came to work in the states in fact he had been there before um he wrote this paper in I think 1934 uh uh and it basically unified electromagnetism and gravity under the in under the circumstance of of accelerated rotation. &gt;&gt; BOOM.</p>
<p>GOTCHA. Absolutely freaking nailed it. Right now, what happens? &gt;&gt; Bob&#x27;s signature boom. Okay. Any of his fans are quite familiar with it? You want to go? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to give you another boom here, and this is exclusive for the audience here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Lay it on us, buddy. But but tee it up. So you are creating a topological monopole in these structures and in the fractal substructures of them. Okay. What the Nazi bell was trying to do was to try and accelerate a mass.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Some people say he says it has thorium in there. Thorium&#x27;s heavy. He gave some reasons for it. I&#x27;m not really interested in those.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just accelerating a mass. Right. So you you have Eric Laithweight and he&#x27;s moving this uh uh gyroscope around. Okay. &gt;&gt; And he&#x27;s able to lift this very very heavy gyroscope above his head, right? And people say, &quot;Oh, how is that even possible?&quot; The what what what Chisoff has done is settled what is going on as it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s accelerating then it changes the gradient in the ether so that as you move so so that uh it produces this anti-gravity effect which you can see by moving the laser beam.</p>
<p>Okay. If you&#x27;ve got the um the uh gyroscope static and I want to move it, when I move it, what what happens if you if when you when you spin up a gyroscope, you have to accelerate it and then it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s doing the anti-gravity effect. Okay. The problem is is that very soon the anti-gravity effect uh settles down.</p>
<p>It floods in the the the ether corrects itself, right? &gt;&gt; It corrects itself. And so, uh, when you reach a terminal speed, you don&#x27;t get any more anti-gravity effect. Okay? But if I move that gyroscope into ether that hasn&#x27;t stabilized and start churning it, then you get the anti-gravity effect back. That I&#x27;m saying for the first time on this podcast, I believe that&#x27;s how Eric Laithweight was able to demonstrate a so-called anti-gravity effect. He&#x27;s pushing it into fresh ether that had and it produces a new accelerated gradient and so he&#x27;s able to move it around above his head and stuff.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What do you mean fresh ether that he&#x27;s moving it through 3D space? &gt;&gt; So what what&#x27;s happening is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the actual change that&#x27;s important up to a threshold and I&#x27;ll come to that. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So, so uh as you&#x27;re accelerating it, you get this effect where electromagnetism and gravity is combined. And in the chisoff world, this shows itself as effectively a gradient in in in the the uh uh it changes the the um uh the medium basically and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the normal medium outside uh in everywhere and then a gradient to the point.</p>
<p>But what happens is when you reach a terminal velocity are you&#x27;re not continuing to accelerate it then that starts to flatten out. The the gradient gets to normalized. &gt;&gt; Now that&#x27;s only for where that thing is. Now you got to imagine that the the bit of ether next door to it hasn&#x27;t normalized. And if you push it into that you gain your anti-gravity effect back because you haven&#x27;t you&#x27;re starting to spin that ether and it has to normalize itself.</p>
<p>And if you continually push it round then you get this anti-gravity effect. Now I think what the Nazis failed to do is that they were spinning metal. Now there there are you can go and see these experiments where they take mercury in in a in a tooidal type electrode and they put electricity in it and it spins around. Okay, it&#x27;s lenses law and things like that that&#x27;s causing it to do that. And I think something like that was what was going on with the bell.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter. They have a physical limit by mechanically doing that. Now, at the cosmic summit, I argued um that the the um the Philadelphia project and I explained in uh uh um Fly Me to the Moon, how I think that was born out of an 1889 patent of Tesla where he was creating a new type of homopolar generator which had two uh uh discs, but he changed the magnetic field so he could only he could take the current off. Weirdly, weirdly, in 1993, just after the uh uh end of the Cold War, the people that wrote some of the 911 report and were responsible for some of the security there and did psychological operations, a company called SIC. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. They repatented in two 1993 and got awarded &gt;&gt; a subsection but basically the same thing for the same reasons as Tesla patented in 1889. Now why did they feel they needed to do that? I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s just a weird thing. But I&#x27;m saying that Tesla in 1911 in the sun New York said that using the application of this principle we can produce a flying machine uh the world with no screw or the the kind of which the world has never seen before.</p>
<p>uh it has no screw propellers or control surfaces of any kind and uh it can uh travel it can carry any weight be made of any shape and and and travel in any weather conditions fantastically fast. That was in 1911. So 1889 he has this pattern. I believe what he found was rather than rotating masses you rotate electromagnetic fields. And this is literally what Eugene Pod Klitnoff is saying he&#x27;s doing right now.</p>
<p>and he&#x27;s got things levitating in the lab in in uh Finland &gt;&gt; that gets us, I would imagine, to the magnetic toroidal moment &gt;&gt; that gets it to the the the Philadelphia experiment. Uh but it&#x27;s the acceleration. Now, the thing is with the electrodnamics, you have a limit there up to a point. But when you&#x27;re looking at these little ball lightning structures, you have matter in there. The matter becomes coherent and it forms current loops.</p>
<p>and the current loops. What what they had a problem with the bell is they haven&#x27;t got the fractal component because you need a wheel within a wheel within a wheel in order to stabilize the structure. You need to get all the vectors stabilized so that then it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s impervious to gravity. It it doesn&#x27;t affect it. And that&#x27;s what the bubble is in a ball lining.</p>
<p>It produces this non-radiating boundary. When you have a minimum of a wheel within a wheel within a wheel structure, the electromagnetic waves cancel at a boundary because it&#x27;s the electron interaction in the tooidal moment that interacts with the dark matter which is the real nutrinos which has an anopole moment. It basically excludes that piece of spaceime from the ordinary rules outside it. What you were looking at there, can you see my mouse pointer? Yeah, &gt;&gt; we can. &gt;&gt; This is Metin R&#x27;s work on bubble structures in acoustic cavitation.</p>
<p>Okay, this is this middle one here. You can see there&#x27;s a point here in which this ring element comes into and stops. And then there&#x27;s a little bit going through and comes into this ringing element and stops here. Okay? Then there&#x27;s this m material coming in from the outside and this material coming in from the outside. This is pulling in matter from the open environment and then it&#x27;s forcing it into a closed loop and this is just standing wave sound.</p>
<p>Now the same process is going on here and this is on the copper oxide of the late Neil Kryton Gold&#x27;s uh cold fusion experiment. You have the two spots in the middle. When you do the actual structure, these two spots in this ring and you line it up, it actually comes out of the beams. These beams are extending out beyond the non-radiating boundary here because you don&#x27;t get it closing into the uh uh substructure. Okay? And I&#x27;ll show you how that works.</p>
<p>And and so you have these beams and they eject out. This is a disruption beam. This is a disruption beam, but there&#x27;s another disruption beam that&#x27;s going through the center. Okay? And that&#x27;s producing this hole that&#x27;s producing these two spots here. Okay? And this is in a plasma reactor of Hank urine in Holland.</p>
<p>Again, this is a two-order structure. And it produces a paisley. So all of the symbols of the old religions and everything, they&#x27;re all related this. So you always get a paisley with a two or three order structure. You don&#x27;t get it with a with a four order structure because the the fourth order structure is where the f the first structure where the power of God comes under control according to Samaritans.</p>
<p>Okay. Um here this is a paisley in a um a water spout in 1969 uh t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t taken by your weather service just off the coast of Florida. And this is water which is being lifted uh by anti-gravity and it&#x27;s being lifted and it&#x27;s being vaporized because the water is being overenergized by chi that is relic nutrino condensate clusters um that are causing the weak hydrogen bonds to uh uh move the water from being water to water gas without it boiling. Okay. And this is the whole process is able to do all these amazing things because it overexites the matter.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Why do they appear at sea like that? Why do you end up with that phenomena? Just &gt;&gt; Well, because water is polar. Water moving around as a polar object produces a charged ring. It carries static electricity. If you&#x27;ve ever looked at those experiments where um is it Faraday or I don&#x27;t know it drops water and and it it takes charge and they&#x27;ve done a recent thing on YouTube where they found that if they charge water droplet up and it hits a piece of glass then it will not splash but if it&#x27;s not charged it will splash. &gt;&gt; And so water is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. So critical. And what you&#x27;re seeing here is down the bottom you&#x27;ve got two flares and the flares are showing the direction of the air currents and the you&#x27;ve got waves on the sea. But here this black water is because it&#x27;s extremely fast. And the weird thing is you have these waves immediately and then you have an event horizon here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Right where this is moving this way but these are still moving that way. &gt;&gt; Weird. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s because you have a chlux in here which makes it super fluid. And so it it there there&#x27;s literally event horizon.</p>
<p>And what you&#x27;re seeing here is the vortex going through on the next fractal up in in the ether and there will be a counter uh you have a cyclone and anticyclone. The anticyclone will be pointing up into the sky. You don&#x27;t see that bit. You only see the bit that comes down. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So this is the the the process going on on a macro level. You can see with a plane, right? And it&#x27;s all scale invariant. Now if I go to the next slide here, it&#x27;s going to give me the next slide. Is that the next slide? Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>So here we can see in our experiment here if it&#x27;s going to play. Yeah. Um you can see that the a ball forms on the end of this copper tube. The copper tube goes into steel tube which goes to the outside of the reactor. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>This is if we change the uh um camera specifics, we can look through the non-radiating boundary of the sphere and we can see to the Taurus inside which is this. And it has a cone which is the vortex coming out of the bottom of the Taurus. Okay? And that sends a tornado through this copper pipe and through the copper pipe here. And then it&#x27;s touching down here on the outside of the reactor. And what it&#x27;s doing is it&#x27;s energizing the metal and turning it orange.</p>
<p>Now, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a big temp temperature change there. I think that it might be being excited, but that is because of the flux of chi that&#x27;s being pulled through by the vortex that&#x27;s going in here. &gt;&gt; Are plasmoids being shot from? Is that a plasmoid gun? &gt;&gt; When that when that fl That&#x27;s a plasmoid being formed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a stable structure. And &gt;&gt; but does it continue on? Is it a coherent structure outside of that little &gt;&gt; when that when that flashes on this thing? It it it launches itself towards the anode and the anode is cased in a fused quartz sheath and we hear see the impact marks and we have three order structures, four order structures, five, six, seven all the way up to like 30 or something and in subdivisions. &gt;&gt; So it depends how long it spends here before it reorganizes into different structures. But we literally have triangular impact structures or squares with with lines coming off them. Literally it produces a swastika.</p>
<p>It goes boom and there&#x27;s a swast sticker there. &gt;&gt; Why would it produce? Is that a coincidence? Is that just a way of describing another coincidence? And you&#x27;re going to see why. Basically, the swastika is in the salvaster. So the the swastika is breaking matter up and it&#x27;s projection of energy. So for instance, at the governmental building down the road here in Berno for this region of the Czech Republic, which was built in the early 1900, right? It was 1903 or something that that it was built.</p>
<p>Okay. All the way around the building, it has swastikers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because it&#x27;s projecting the power out, right? &gt;&gt; In the building in in uh Croatia where uh Nicola Tesla first met the electrician that inspired him to do electricity. I went and visited this the year before last.</p>
<p>As you go into that school around the doorway, it has salv stickers. This is the nurturing force, the mother force, the female force, but it&#x27;s bringing you in and it&#x27;s giving you stuff to condense into your brain. You&#x27;re you&#x27;re giving information. So the salva sticker and they come the yin and the yang, the yan being the swast sticker, the salva sticker being the yin, they symbolize and one&#x27;s one&#x27;s one rotation and one&#x27;s the other rotation. The the crazy thing about the Nazi flag is it if you look at one side, it&#x27;s a swastika and you look at the other side, it&#x27;s a sava sticker.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Why? because they turn the different direction. &gt;&gt; Well, because you&#x27;re looking at it through the other side, aren&#x27;t you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If if if you if you put it on and put it you staple it in as fabric, it&#x27;s going one way when you look at it that way. But if you look at the other side of the flag, it&#x27;s the other way. It&#x27;s got the swast sticker sticker.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You actually have to put two pieces of fabric, one on either side, differently to make it something different. &gt;&gt; Well, what is the intellectual of this math though? If if the Nazis were using it, they probably didn&#x27;t fully understand where it came from. It was just a symbol that had other meanings within cultures. I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>That that&#x27;s where they had this uh &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh uh Rasputin guy that worked for Hitler in the top of the SS and he he was into all the esoteric and and hidden technology, the occult technology and he was driving this technology. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So they &gt;&gt; but not everyone that uses those symbols and it&#x27;s reflected in all sorts of other ways in art not just the SWAT sticker in &gt;&gt; in in apicious symbols.</p>
<p>So when I was living in India, every single truck I was driving behind on my my ebike on the way to my work for eight and a half years, they they had these swast sticker and salva sticker on them, right? They&#x27;re in every temple. You see salva stickers marking all of the temples in Japan that there it swastiker and salva sticker is the fabric of all Hindu temples. If you walk into the temple, the walls are covered with them. When do you think if that&#x27;s knowledge being reflected of advanced physical understandings that we&#x27;re just now rerealizing, when was it used last, do you believe? &gt;&gt; Yeah. In other words, um these motifs are carried out through thousands of years and have always existed, but at some point they presumably the culture who used that motif forgot of the importance of it.</p>
<p>Or did everybody that had those ancient geometries within their art and architecture, did they understand that it was a power gener? &gt;&gt; I think what you&#x27;ll find is that all over the world, these structures were seen in the postc cataclysm uh uh uh major sites. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what I was about to get to. That was it. Well, not about to get to, but what I hinted at. Did did was it the technology only available before the cataclysm or did &gt;&gt; this technology is eternal.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the way the universe works. You only have to pay pay attention for a small amount of your life to realize that this is the how the universe works. This is just how it does. It&#x27;s written in our faces. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Explain that. &gt;&gt; We are designed after the technology that runs the universe. &gt;&gt; As is the Tesla symbol. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I now have it here around my neck taken from this this is a souvenir from the Finland Museum.</p>
<p>And in that Finland Museum I took and I showed in my first Cosmic Summit presentation uh uh year before last that the Tesla logo is a complete and 100% ripoff with all aspects of the original uh 1600 year old symbols of the Ukan Sara the the Finnish Thor&#x27;s hammer. And as you see here, this susta and sav sticker symbolizes lightning bolts. Bull lightning because a lightning bolt is bull lightning. The bolt itself is is bull lightning. There&#x27;s always a bull lightning that leads the the discharge channel for the lightning to go through representing the thunder god and the king of the gods such as Indra in Vadic Hinduism, Zeus in the ancient Greek religion, Jupiter in the ancient Roman religion, and Thor in the ancient Germanic religion.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. That&#x27;s straight off Wikipedia. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. And so this is from Coptic Christians in old Mongolia, the capital.</p>
<p>This this is in Sudan, just uh up the Nile from Egypt. And you see the symbology here. You&#x27;ve got the Christian cross with the vortex and anti vortex. You have the the Maltese cross or or the Samrian uh symbol of God controlled power here which is on the uh clothing of the pope, &gt;&gt; right? Uh and over here you have a a more accurate version where it has the additional um circles showing the the the spheres that are produced in the subours. Okay.</p>
<p>This this shows that thousands of years ago they were they knew this well enough to show various representations of how you can show this technology. &gt;&gt; Do you believe they used it? I I believe that this is key to all of the the the production technologies that are that are confusing people. It&#x27;s only a matter of time if someone doesn&#x27;t get there first that I will show how to do it. &gt;&gt; How to do what? &gt;&gt; Uh carve rock which doesn&#x27;t look like you can carve it. Sculpt rock, turn rock to jelly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Because we&#x27;ve had experiments where uh the exotic vacuum object will travel straight through fused quartz or or or aluminum. &gt;&gt; Mhm. And a fuse squirts melts at just over 1,700 degrees. Aluminina 2,73 degrees or something, right? But what Ken shoulders showed is that you can go through aluminina and it leaves a fully vitrified channel, nice smooth coating on it, and then it comes up under beeswax, which melts at less than 60° C, and lay and puts aluminina out in a thin layer. So, it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not hotter than beeswax.</p>
<p>This can disintegrate refractory ceramics. That&#x27;s where your glass disappears in in your your experiment in the two thou in the 1970s when they were trying to do oras that degrade or okay. So here is the two order structure which is the wheel making two wheels of those make that wheel and then two wheels at this level make that wheel. Okay, that&#x27;s a wheel wheel within a wheel within a wheel. Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And and some people may have that may be familiar from their Bible study. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is what it is. And the eyes. So, so the the the structure here, the four order to structure here is a 44 with a N level one uh structure.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Revelation Ezekiel, the wheel within the wheel. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s in the book of Revelations. We&#x27;ve been in Revelations for quite some time. That&#x27;s just the reality and people need to deal with that. &gt;&gt; Um uh so essentially, &gt;&gt; drop the mic.</p>
<p>I said that in on the on the 1st of March 2017 very very clearly and absolutely equivalently &gt;&gt; we are in revelations that these things are proceeding. &gt;&gt; Yes they&#x27;re proceeding. Yeah. Yeah. I don&#x27;t know what the time scale is but like after we get through the trials and tribulations which I think we&#x27;ve done a few of them because they&#x27;ve been trying they&#x27;ve been trying to do scorch positively.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve done war and pestilence, right? They&#x27;ve really gone gone to town on those. Uh and they failed in both cases because humans are resilient. Uh uh and when the technology is revealed, we&#x27;ll have a thousand years of glory time. We&#x27;re in the next epoch. That&#x27;s what I mean very literally by the uh new dawn of an old age.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What what a great phrase. I should have led with it because it&#x27;s an well it was the cosmic summit&#x27;s tagline two years ago because &gt;&gt; it was the title of my presentation before that when I was talking about how this defines how the great pyramid is structured and why &gt;&gt; so so here this &gt;&gt; prologue &gt;&gt; yeah so what happens here is what what they were trying to do in the Nazi bell is they&#x27;re trying to spin matter around well this spins matter around relativistically moreover as you uh uh keep feeding this energy, it goes into the face singularity both at this core but and in the subcores and in the sub subcores and they stabilize the whole structure so that it doesn&#x27;t fall apart. So you can keep feeding energy keep so it keeps accelerating, keeps accelerating, keeps accelerating and you have a topological monopole here. Okay? And the topological monopole in the center, this is the Christ center, right? They&#x27;re still quite calm. um where all the forces are unified, the mass goes up and up and up and you just don&#x27;t stop it.</p>
<p>And when it gets to a certain mass density at a point, it goes through what&#x27;s called the swinger limit. And the swinger limit then provides a permanent gradient in the ether. It cannot stabilize because as soon as the ether tries to stabilize the matter, it then sucks it all in faster than it can stabilize. And this is when you can go faster than light. So this when David um Adair produced this thing with a Nazi scientist there when he was 17 years old in in White Sands and he spun it up and it disappeared in something like Mac 37 or whatever.</p>
<p>It disappeared and they can only see it on radar. Um this is what was going on. It was getting to the point of uh um self- sustaining on the uh point where there was always a gradient in the ether. And so you you you just accelerate and as fast as you accelerate, you keep accelerating. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s it&#x27;s instantaneous because you produce a non-radiating boundary and and there&#x27;s no no inertia because it can&#x27;t go in. The thing that causes inertia can&#x27;t go in. So this is the god&#x27;s control power and every single aspect of it, every fractal level is golden ratio. So you have a golden ratio vortex. This is the sic triangle always associated with the yank.</p>
<p>The loop of the ank is the tooidal moment. the the tail of the ank is is is the the the flux in and the ank goes from here to here. Okay. Um the top between the top of the apple and the apple is is is gravity. It&#x27;s a symbol of gravity but by Newton but not for any other reason than it literally is &gt;&gt; showing how this universe works.</p>
<p>The the top of the ank sorry the top top of the apple to the center of the apple and then from the center of the apple to the point of destruction down here. And the point of destruction is where the torsion field interacts with the tor at the fractal level above this whole structure. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And so and this is very precisely the golden ratio and there&#x27;s golden ratios and everything here. So this explains why our fingers are the ratios they are, why the face is the ratios they are. It&#x27;s is why it&#x27;s all across nature because this is the root level access to how nature works.</p>
<p>So when when you get the topological monopole uh you basically have you can convert matter. So Matsamoto says it produces a mini bank. It it resets the universe. The matter that goes in there becomes completely denatured and then when the confinement field collapses the matter spews out as newly synthesized elements. And what it is is they they are it&#x27;s pure energy coming out and it hits our vacuum energy density and it gets immediately compressed into a range of elements and it depending on the density of material in there the elements you get.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s like how do you how how much do you put in there and how much do you bake it and this is this is all basically stated in uh uh uh controlled nuclear synthesis by SVAnco in his 20067 book uh having done 20,000 experiments sequentially in a row and produced every element in the periodic table from each of the elements metal elements in the periodic table 20,000 experiments sequentially all produced all of the elements in the periodic table and in his 2003 patent he shows an ironrich cranated sphere which is split in two that&#x27;s the image he chooses from SEM with a hollow space inside and in the hollow space in 2005 article in in uh Kiev in Ukraine in a newspaper article he says the nuclear transmutations occur inside this hollow space with dark matter the dark matter is raising nutrinos he doesn&#x27;t say that but that is the key dark matter because it allows the weak interaction okay and so you are able to transmute matter you are able to produce a fantastic amount of energy and it&#x27;s like a cold effect you do not see an explosion but it disintegrates matter and it pulls its energy in by manipulating magnetic fields because it produces this massive topological monopole that explains your gra magne magnetometers. Okay, it ch when you have a change in the flux of relic nutrinos uh uh you change beta decay. This was shown by it was it was predicted by uh um Yakov Zeldovich. Jakob Zeldovich was the principal in the Soviet nuclear weapons program and he predicted uh that beta isotopes could be uh um a method for detecting uh um uh relic nutrino flows and this was proven by Alexander Parkov who I translated his book his 2009 book I translated it in 2019 and so it&#x27;s the reant nutrino foes when you manipulate those they they are the thing that gets sucked in to do the work and they are the thing that is gravity and they are the thing that causes magnet mag magnetism and because it is beta isotopes that they change that&#x27;s why the radioucleide clocks over all over the world changed because it changed the local uh uh gravitational and and magnetic flux density uh around the world those two signatures the magnetometers and the the uh um the uh nuclear isotope beta isotope based uh uh nuclear clocks changing are perfect signatures of this process in action. You don&#x27;t even have to look at what happened on ground zero.</p>
<p>Those two things cannot be explained by planes and jet fuel. They can&#x27;t be that the government theory cannot explain those observations which are real and seen. Okay? So immediately the government theory needs some extra theory to explain those things. &gt;&gt; Right? I remember in uh Robert Robert Temple&#x27;s book, New Science of Heaven, which I highly recommend, he goes through the history of the suppression of ball lightning research. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I&#x27;ve added a few more layers to that. &gt;&gt; Well, right. Okay. I was going to say, are you I know you&#x27;re familiar with all of this stuff, but can I just thought it was surprising because it&#x27;s a natural phenomena and it seemed like anybody that studied it, they&#x27;d have a conference or whatnot and then it would all kind of disappear and go dark. Is that a good way to &gt;&gt; No, not entirely because um what happened in 2000 uh the Dennis Abersonson model of ball lightning came out and this was where an arc discharge goes into the air.</p>
<p>It vaporizes some silicon and carbon. It goes up into a toidal vortex and that burns in the air producing the light. But of course, this is nonsense because ball lightning can often form directly in the air. So, how&#x27;s that happening? In fact, the only spectrum of ball lightning captured uh and it&#x27;s on Wikipedia and it was in nature, I think. uh you can go and see it.</p>
<p>Uh it has iron, calcium and silicon in there other than the elements that are already in the air and it formed in the air. They were looking at lightning and one formed right and so they got that spectrum. Okay. Now uh when the Abom and Dennis model came out, these are two Israelis that came up with this model in 2000. The BBC ran this article and the BBC uh uh they went to of all the people on planet earth of all of the people on planet earth they went to Dr.</p>
<p>Graeme Hubler. Dr. Graeme Hubler. Who is Dr. Graeme Hubler? &gt;&gt; He was the lead scientist at the condensed matter nuclear science lab or another major lab in the US Naval Laboratories.</p>
<p>Okay. Of all the people on planet Earth, the BBC go to him for his opinion. and he says, &quot;Well, the US Navy has been very interested in bull lightning for a long time.&quot; This does explain some of the phenomena, but not everything, but it&#x27;s one to keep an eye on. Something along those lines, right? This is from 2000, 2001, early 2001, late 2000, some sometime around there. You&#x27;ll have to look when the Abs and Dan model came out.</p>
<p>Of course, that didn&#x27;t stop there because in October 2001, this is like the following month after 911, the US Air Force commissioned Eric W. Davis, a com a colleague of Hal Putoff, the guy that found Ken Shoulders to look at John Hutcherson. Right. Ken Shoulders had &gt;&gt; well known in UFO circles as the man and the no. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right. Okay. So, so he Eric W. Davis writes the bull lightning study which was released on the black bolt.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve done a videos on it in the past and in there he talks about ways forward and he gives two ways forward. They&#x27;re the most reliable and practical ways. He says Ken shoulders exotic vacuum objects research and United States Air Force research done in the 1950s to 1960s. But that is the only part of the document that&#x27;s fully classified. &gt;&gt; H &gt;&gt; right.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait. &gt;&gt; And when it has the classification terms under there, you know what? It&#x27;s classified under space and aerospace. &gt;&gt; Oh, really? And it was ball lightning research. &gt;&gt; It was ball lightning research. The most practical way to explore the effects and and and how to manipulate ball lightning was done in the 1950s and60s under space.</p>
<p>And it was classified in that I think it reported in 2002 uh the year after 911. uh um and it was under space and aerospace. Now, why would someone commission that report at that specific time shortly after 911? And then you have to look at the uh Russian um uh statue, the Russian sculpture that was given to America to commemorate the loss of life at 911. It&#x27;s over in New Jersey. And if you look at it across the water, and do you know what it is? It&#x27;s a fractured piece of steel with a a drop of aluminium in the middle &gt;&gt; symbolizing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Do is that the Russians going wink wink? We know how you did this. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m saying. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because apparently according to Tom Beard in the 1970s, it was Cruchef and the then US president or something. They made an agreement not to develop this technology which is far far far uh more serious than nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, that gets to our friend Ashton Forbes. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Now, if we hadn&#x27;t set off every disinformation bell in the system by these terms, regardless of whether it&#x27;s well communicated, it will be noted. Um, did you and Ashton get a chance to talk at the cosmic summit? And is there seems like there&#x27;s a certain amount of cross fertilization of your ideas or not fertilization, but there&#x27;s some overlap. The the difference with myself is I&#x27;ve literally seen three plasma balls being produced in our reactor and self-organizing and rotating around their common center of mass.</p>
<p>Okay, which again on video &gt;&gt; for those who don&#x27;t know &gt;&gt; disappearing &gt;&gt; Ashton Forbes is the proponent of the idea that the supposedly CGI video from 2015 of the um um MH70 plane &gt;&gt; so before I ever spoke to Ashton &gt;&gt; disappearing just so the thing that the plane that disappeared Ashton believed it was &gt;&gt; so MH7 uh MH370 &gt;&gt; 370 yeah &gt;&gt; yeah 370 MH17 was the plane that apparently disappeared over Ukraine and apparently was &gt;&gt; well it did disappear. &gt;&gt; Well that that no that sorry the one in Ukraine didn&#x27;t disappear. It fell to the ground. Um &gt;&gt; yeah no no but but some people actually said they took the plane to Ukraine but but the one the the Malaysian airliner &gt;&gt; Yeah. So so &gt;&gt; disappeared really disappeared.</p>
<p>So, what happened was before I ever knew Ashton Forbes, uh, my former co-director of the Martin Flash Memorial Project, uh, Matthew Valat sent me those two videos and said, &quot;I think you know what these are.&quot; And so, I did a video on it immediately and I explained and I do not need to change a single thing I said in that video. It&#x27;s as valid today as it was. And then a couple of weeks later, I spoke to Ashton Forbes about it. Hm. &gt;&gt; Ashton Forbes was already talking about it, but I I came in at look in the videos and and my take on the videos is it doesn&#x27;t matter whether this was faked because I I could probably fake that.</p>
<p>I actually modeled a plane uh quite similar in the early 2000s and and uh I I&#x27;ve done um kind of like false color images in part of my CG work and stuff. Um, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not going to bother doing it because my view on it is it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s real or it&#x27;s faked. Whoever did that was either knowingly producing a video of the effect. &gt;&gt; It is a real video or they were remote viewing because creatives are the best remote viewers. &gt;&gt; It doesn&#x27;t my my take on it.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t actually matter the provenence. What matters is what is shown and what is shown is an effect that we have seen in the laboratory. We have seen matter disappearing. We have seen three plasmoids coming together and self-organizing into and orbiting around themselves common center of mass. We got that on video and I published that in 2021.</p>
<p>I think &gt;&gt; Bob is this is the mature technology that we assume that the government for lack of a better better word has. Is it being kept from us um for safety reasons or uh uh pecuniary reasons? Are they making money, keeping us safe or both? &gt;&gt; Uh I think all of the above. All of the above. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Um so here&#x27;s the thing.</p>
<p>John Archb Wheeler and I shared this video at my uh first cosmic summit presentation a couple of years back and I shared actually at ICCF25 before Ashton even started looking at those videos, right? &gt;&gt; Uh and and and I said this was practical applications of the fractal tooidal moment. That was my presentation in Stitchin in Poland in in uh ICCF25 years ago. &gt;&gt; Mh. And I showed a video by which I shared also at the first cosmic summit that I gave the international conference on cold fusion folks IC in Poland. Um and I and I I did a video before that because they gave me 20 minutes to to to to impart 12 years or 13 years of research.</p>
<p>So that that wasn&#x27;t going to be enough. So I did another video at the same time uh publicly to share in more detail what what I was trying to get across. But that particular video is John Archer Wheeler who invented the term black hole and wormhole. By the way, uh he was a principal on the Manhattan project. He would have been working on the directly or on this periphery of those programs that are classified that are in the ball lightning study.</p>
<p>Okay, he&#x27;s clearly talking about magneto hydrodnamics and a lot of works he does and plasmoids. But in this thing, he talks about how uh if you got light going around in a ring, this is his 1954 Geon paper. uh uh where he believes that all subatom particles all the way through galaxies are basically on this framework. This is in 1954. &gt;&gt; Uh uh he&#x27;s he&#x27;s saying that uh this is light going around a ring and it&#x27;s held together by gravitational azimuth which is the gravitational attraction of the light to itself.</p>
<p>Then in this 1990s video recording which I shared he&#x27;s saying that in modern times uh he he now believes that you just need to uh link up gravitational waves and they will then pull together automatically increase the gravitational wave and uh this will lead to either an explosion or gravitational uh black something that like that we would call today a black hole. Okay, that&#x27;s literally what he says. Now, um I only need to explain those videos when I was sent to them by Matthew Velat before I ever spoke on knew of uh um Ashton. I only needed four slides from my ICCF25 presentation to explain them. That&#x27;s it.</p>
<p>I just needed four slides. I didn&#x27;t even need to change them. I just needed to talk to those slides. Right? And one of them was this work by John Archable Wheeler. Now, what have I told you in this presentation? I&#x27;ve said that the yin and the yang which you have always you need a minimum fractal two and so you have a wheel within a wheel within a wheel and other than the big wheel you have two wheels in in the subour and in the subtors you have four wheels but they make two tours subours of two tours right so you you you have one two four okay making a wheel within wheel within wheel structure those will have gravity and anti-gravity waves now the overall structure will have a gravity wave coming through the center Now, when you&#x27;ve got one orb, which is the the non-radiating boundary is the spherical part of it, that will have a gravity wave that goes in front.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;ve talked about this for years, how it creates a spin wave in the rail nutrinos, and it only only similar things. And I&#x27;ve got videos of these things going around each other, right? But they don&#x27;t do anything. They&#x27;re not responding to the magnetic fields, electric fields, but then when they come near the gravitational spin field, they they we will orbit around each other. So, I&#x27;ve already had this on video and I&#x27;ve presented this at conferences. So it was immediately obvious what was going on.</p>
<p>But when I saw John Archie Bullwheeler, he&#x27;s saying that if you get these structures and then you orient them. So the gravity wave goes into the next one. It then the gravity wave pulls itself in together and then the the the next fractal level up is born and that produces a new stronger gravity field and that pulls those in which pull those pulling in makes that stronger and that stronger pulls these in. &gt;&gt; Bob, please don&#x27;t make one of those in your laboratory. We make those all the time and I believe they go on in our &gt;&gt; can they be runaway? I mean Ashton says &gt;&gt; for lack of a better description that somebody could make the world disappear.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I I think okay so it I I have a book which is currently unfortunately sorry Stoyen supporting this monitor that I&#x27;m looking at &gt;&gt; but it&#x27;s signed by Stoyen Sagar who visited me and stayed with me in 2014. A couple of years later, he showed that two nuclear bombs detonated of modern size on uh north and southern hemisphere. This is why you should never give nuclear weapons to Australia. You should never have submarines with nuclear weapons. And and and and I hope that Argentina never sorry uh yeah, Argentina or Brazil or whatever, they never use their nuclear weapons because if you have a nuclear weapon above and below below the equator, one will produce a vortex, the other one will produce an anti vortex and it&#x27;ll produce self-organized structure.</p>
<p>And I didn&#x27;t understand it back in 2015. He said this will strip the atmosphere of the earth and the the oceans will boil off in four hours. &gt;&gt; Jesus. I mean, don&#x27;t they have to be kind of nearby? I mean, if you set one off in the North Sea and another &gt;&gt; reinforces the other and it starts pulling the ether in. It becomes a self uh uh feeding structure.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, what the hell is going to happen to us, Bob, if this stuff gets out in the &gt;&gt; We can already do this. By the way, listen to what I&#x27;ve just said. We can literally end life on Earth within four hours and it will never come back. It&#x27;ll strip the earth of the water. &gt;&gt; But someone has withheld from doing that presumably because they have relatives and children and stuff.</p>
<p>Okay. So they&#x27;re they&#x27;re holding this stuff back because it is dangerous to them and others. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re holding it back because you can make an nuclear missile disappear in flight, &gt;&gt; right? in &gt;&gt; and you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t and I said this to Ashton a long time ago but basically you want to keep people in a state of fear and then you can tax them. We need to protect you. We need this huge military complex to protect you because the bad guys over there they got bombs.</p>
<p>They could fire those bombs. If they told you that firstly if they told you that we could make all those bombs disappear before they ever touch the ground no one&#x27;s going to pay any taxes, are they? Like why am I doing this for? It also helps explain to me well I thought the one of the few explanations for why we would be so cavalier in the Ukraine war and just take us to what you know provoke the hell out of Putin to shoot them at us is we can make them go poof at least that would help launch 19 kins in one salvo a kinsal can be launched from sea ship land or air right kinsal is unstoppable with anything that the Americans have admitted too. &gt;&gt; Is that a hypersonic weapon? What&#x27;s a &gt;&gt; hypersonic weapon? Yes. There&#x27;s nothing that can stop it. Okay.</p>
<p>And what they did by in launching 19 Kenzals is they said, &quot;We can knock out every single carrier you have on Earth immediately and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And America didn&#x27;t bat an eyelid. &gt;&gt; They did not bat an island. The other thing that&#x27;s very weird about this story is after I had we had replicated on the 12th of the 12th, we started an experiment on 12 seconds past 12 minutes past 12 and the 12th of the 12th of the 12th California time. I was presenting this on the 14th uh of December in a military base in Rome.</p>
<p>I then went to the UK and I was invited to go and meet this person who wanted to speak to me. And so I booked a hotel and I went and met him and and he started talking about hypersonic uh scramjets. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How do you get He wanted to know what I knew about them. And I&#x27;m thinking, how do you get from me doing cold fusion and replicating this technology to asking whether you can develop scramjets? What&#x27;s the connection? Now I know the connection.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s just incredible. I&#x27;ve got to wrap up in a minute and I&#x27;ve never said that in a podcast because I usually just open them but I need to have dinner with an old friend. Tell me this. Are there some concepts that you want to share at the end like you know right now that you just kind of fill in some cracks? I know you could go for another two or three hours but what do people kind of need to know maybe big picture what&#x27;s coming? Are you gonna &gt;&gt; Well, f firstly I I want to just clarify and again it&#x27;s the first on this that I&#x27;ve said this. I want to make clear that the accelerated uh mass that the Nazi bell were trying to do and so on that has a limit electronamically you think you can get there by just moving the fields and that might get there that might get there but because what it&#x27;s doing is in those instances it will be cohering the relic nutrinos into a point and you only need to get an amount of thing above the shringer limit.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how small it is. It just needs to be a mass density above the swinging limit and then that will create a permanent gradient in the ether, right? And that gives you anti-gravity. Now, you don&#x27;t want to be in the flux of that. You&#x27;ll end up what that guy Jake Barber did. He feels like he&#x27;s connected to God because he&#x27;s getting a load of chi going through him.</p>
<p>But of course, he made all his skin fall off because it&#x27;s turning the water to water gas under his flesh &gt;&gt; and so his skin falls off. Right? So like these are completely uh and this is what was happening in my view with the people you know jet fuel does not make people jump take their clothes off because they think something&#x27;s going on and jump out of a building to get away with from something. Right. Right. But something that was making their feel feel skin feel like it&#x27;s boiling under there and they they would want to get away from that.</p>
<p>I think those people jumped because they were being exposed to what Jake Barber was being exposed to. They might have felt they could fly because they felt they were connected to God, right? Because they&#x27;re in such a chlux, &gt;&gt; right? So, so um this is anti-gravity. But the way you get around this is you create a triangular craft and you have the orbs on the corners. &gt;&gt; Ultimately, is this technology good news for us or bad news? &gt;&gt; One, we have used this technology before as humans. All species in any part of the galaxy and the universe will ultimately learn about this technology.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is the great power. Uh uh the original Greek translation uh is is pre prius uh uh not meek. Preus when properly translated means that those that know that they have great power but choose not to use it will inherit the earth. You cannot use this for weapons because it we can destroy the planet. But as I&#x27;ve already discussed, we already have the means to destroy the planet many, many, many times over.</p>
<p>Not just the bomb detonation, I mean using two bombs strategically to strip the atmosphere within about four hours. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re hard to make. Is this Would this be hard to I mean, is it a &gt;&gt; nature makes it very triv. A three-year-old can run a cavitation experiment using a $35 piece of equipment and they&#x27;re producing anti-gravity waves and gravity waves and they&#x27;re producing lighter elements in the yang force as it assembles matter and the heavier elements in the ying force as they uh condense matter. This can be done by a three-year-old and they need the incredible skills of being able to pour water from a jug.</p>
<p>Mhm. &gt;&gt; They need to be able to fold aluminium kitchen foil and they need to be able to press a button. There are mo many many people on earth that can replicate this experiment. Okay. And it has been widely replicated.</p>
<p>Okay. Um so so showing the principles is really rather trivial. uh and and it&#x27;s just wanting to know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s as I said since 200 well I suggested it in 2019 but I in 2021 I said you know you can do it and it takes minutes and it&#x27;s inexpensive &gt;&gt; okay but but to have do you need greater resources obviously and I hope uh unattainable resources except maybe by nation states to make the world disappear &gt;&gt; yeah but well um where You infect metal with this, it typically likes to keep working for a minimum of two days. It it typically works up to two days, but the active structures can stay in the metal and be reexited. Um uh and the Russians have been able to what is it? Neil Kiteon Gold reexited them after 9 months by just raising the temperature to around about a thousand degrees.</p>
<p>Okay. Um, and the Russians were able to reexite theirs by putting outside in sunlight for for 10 days. Um, and so if it&#x27;s exposed to see see the sun photons will carry a flux of the relic nutrinos with them. And if you&#x27;ve got one of these structures built up and it&#x27;s in a dormant state, you can re-energize it. Um, I mean, magic is freaking real, but it&#x27;s not magic.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just science. the sword in the stone where you have this myth of of a one type of metal inside another metal. It was actually a metal anvil. This wasn&#x27;t in a stone that was on a on a stone down in Tintagel. And the idea is you had to pull it out.</p>
<p>And then this is where the connection to uh you know this is where it gets a little bit weird. Uh if it hasn&#x27;t been weird already. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You need to you need to be of of the right uh genetic manup if if the if the naent clusters that were put in because if Nenel Calagina could produce these things and they could come out of her fingers and she could uh uh stop and start the heart of a frog. She stopped the start the heart of a man that was there.</p>
<p>She could uh manipulate things behind uh shields, static shields and stuff. And because it&#x27;s coming out of the fingers, they&#x27;re quantum entangled to your consciousness, right? So if if the person putting the sword in with this highly energized sword was able to put it in, it would be someone of that bloodline that was literally able to pull it out because they would be the only one that could intend to have that thing pulled out, right? It gets a little bit a little bit weird and but this is the whole thing behind spoon bending when when Yuri Geller is into the spoon and when in 1983 the CIA and analyze those and you can go and look at my blog at remoteview.acu or remote uh sorry um remoteview.substack.com um uh I I I I rebuilt that CIA 1983 document. They found that when they looked at the crystal grain boundaries in these me bent bent metal that have been done with this telekinesis process that that something had happened on the crystal grain boundaries and it slipped. This is exactly what Matsamoto found in his cold fusion experiments that the the process starts on the crystal grain boundaries and it starts to cause it to uh lose its integrity. This is essentially the process.</p>
<p>So uh it&#x27;s not magic. It&#x27;s just science and and it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s you know when you have a company called science applications international corporation it&#x27;s it&#x27;s creating magic but just through the application of science. It&#x27;s a very good name for a for a military contractor. It&#x27;s an extremely good name. It&#x27;s exactly what it is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Fantastic. &gt;&gt; I got an Uber picking me up in 12 minutes. I can&#x27;t say or I would sit here for another 45. Hey, um folks, y&#x27;all can find Bob&#x27;s experiments, not just him talking because Bob doesn&#x27;t talk about things that he doesn&#x27;t do and see himself. So, he does it and shows it to you um at the Martin Flashman uh Memorial Project &gt;&gt; YouTube channel and then he has a fantastic Substack uh which is remote view and you can see him here.</p>
<p>Please like, share, and follow him. But while you&#x27;re out there liking, sharing, and following, please go to all the major platforms and make sure to uh like, share, follow, comment, maybe give a review on YouTube of this podcast at CosmicSummit. And Bob, we will see you at the next CosmicSummit. You can come and meet him, talk to him, and uh he likes to work the crowd and the crowd sure works him. He had a lot of lot of big fans the last two years.</p>
<p>Meet Bob in person. But Bob, thank you so much, man. and I look forward to being a lifelong friend of yours. And uh &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s great and and thank you for the work bringing all these different eclectic people. I had some incredible conversations with people I never imagined I would have an opportunity to meet and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve done.</p>
<p>Uh and so thank you very much for doing that. Yeah, go to the CosmicSummit website. Why don&#x27;t you get a a pass to look at their previous uh video collection from uh previous Cosmic Summits? They&#x27;ve got them all there for you to stream as you wish. Um, and they they do put some stuff out on the the CosmicSummit YouTube channel, right? So, you have some stuff to watch for free. &gt;&gt; Well, actually, Bob, I was going to close with that.</p>
<p>What we&#x27;ll do is we&#x27;re putting out one full presentation from this year once a week for a year because we actually have that much content. We&#x27;ve easily got 50 hours. And what we&#x27;ll do um and we do it every Friday and we also put this podcast out every Friday. So, what we&#x27;ll do is put out um not your classroom presentation because you have over three hours of content from this year, but um but your stage presentation. &gt;&gt; Awesome.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. Okay. We&#x27;ll put it out this Friday. It&#x27;ll accompany this podcast. So, if you want to hear another hour or so of Bob, it is available elsewhere on this very channel.</p>
<p>Thank you, Bob Grineer. Thank you, George.</p>
