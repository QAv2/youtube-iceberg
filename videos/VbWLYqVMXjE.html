            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In 1955, Panama Flight 914 took off from New York with 57 passengers headed for Miami. It never arrived. Radar [music] lost it over the Atlantic and the Navy declared it lost at sea. But 37 years later [music] in 1992, a DC4 propeller plane appeared on the radar at [music] Caracus Airport in Venezuela. Out of nowhere, [snorts] the pilot radioed the tower, screaming, [music] &quot;Where are we?&quot; When the ground crew approached, they saw the passengers pressing their faces against the glass.</p>
<p>They hadn&#x27;t aged a single day. The pilot [music] dropped a small 1955 pocket calendar and then gunned the engines, taking off again before the military could intercept. [music] The plane vanished back into the clouds, leaving only that calendar behind. Did [music] they fly through a vanish point in the sky? Watch the full documentary on our channel at 7:45 p.m. [music] EST, New York to see the 1992 Caracus radar logs.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t let the trail go cold.</p>
