            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Welcome back to Special Report. Tonight we continue our series looking at unidentified anomalous anonymous say that easy phenomena. What uh many people still call UFOs, UAPs. Last week we spoke with the director of the age of disclosure. It&#x27;s a new documentary out about a suspected government cover up over UAPs for decades, which debuts tonight in select theaters around the country is also available on Prime Video.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s powerful. It features testimony from 34 former and current government officials, including witnesses who have testified before Congress. Earlier, we spoke with another whistleblower who is now a congressional task force member on the UAP subject. If you believe we have crashed craft uh stated earlier, do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? &gt;&gt; Biologics came with some of these recoveries. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um were they I guess human or non-human biologics? &gt;&gt; Non-human. Well, let&#x27;s get some insight into the UAP or UFO it used to be called controversy and what Congress is trying to do about it. Joining us now, retired Air Force Major David Grush, who has been a whistleblower on the subject of UFOs, UAPs, and government transparency. He&#x27;s a special adviser now to the House UAP Task Force. Thanks for being here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me on, Brett. &gt;&gt; So, since then, people say, &quot;Where is the evidence? What&#x27;s happening? Why don&#x27;t we know more right now almost two years later?&quot; &gt;&gt; Well, certainly the last administration didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t help. And my my hearing of course was during the last administration and they were not exactly super transparent on this issue unfortunately. Uh but now that the task force has been created um I&#x27;ve been able to you know guide the members within the boundaries of uh what they&#x27;re actually cleared for. When people look at this they look online they say there&#x27;s a lot out there.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a lot of people talking about encounters. There&#x27;s a lot of people talking about videos and we&#x27;ve seen a lot of that. Can we just cut it down to you believe that we have encountered alien beings and that they&#x27;ve come to Earth and that we know about it as a US government? That seems to be the case. I don&#x27;t like to characterize necessarily where they came from. They&#x27;re definitely some kind of nonhuman sentience, but it is true.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, we&#x27;ve recovered the vehicles um and we actually have physical proof. And I was actually uh partially cleared into some of those activities. It was beyond uh oral testimony provided to me. I actually had partial access uh to the data and actually read the intelligence reports uh resulting from those programs &gt;&gt; with your own eyes. You saw it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so when people say this is kooky, this is out there. There&#x27;s nothing to back it up. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t speak for other parts of the government, but I can tell you NASA, which I speak for, is open and transparent with our data. Do you believe what Mr.</p>
<p>David Crush said or is he lying? &gt;&gt; Whatever he said, where&#x27;s the evidence? &gt;&gt; What do you say? &gt;&gt; Certainly members of this current administration are very very well aware of this reality. Um uh certainly the the current president um is very knowledgeable on this subject and I trust his leadership on it and I think he&#x27;s assembled an an a team cabinet and I really believe uh if Trump wants to be the greatest president and the most consequential leader likely in world history he certainly um has the knowledge, the capabilities and understanding of some of these sensitive government transparency issues. &gt;&gt; I have access but and I I speak to people about it. I&#x27;ve had actually meetings on it. People that are very smart and very solid have said they believe there is something out there and you know it makes sense that there could be.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never been convinced even despite that you know I just for some reason it&#x27;s not my thing. So you think one he knows and two he&#x27;s open to transparency on UAPs. &gt;&gt; Uh he certainly is very well informed on this issue. Uh leave it at that. I don&#x27;t want to get ahead of what the president might want to reveal personally.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s been a role to cover this up. you&#x27;re saying uh through administrations &gt;&gt; um and there have been people who have been threatened and told not to testify. &gt;&gt; I was uh physically threatened even before I sent in my intelligence community inspector general report under the previous administration. I actually had to go and and seek legal protection that way because I was, you know, literally in fear both professionally and in my personal life. And when you mentioned in that testimony of recovering the pilots or or remains nonhuman, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s something that you saw as far as the intelligence with your eyes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. And it is a very uncomfortable even for me now as as somebody who&#x27;s seen it, experienced it, even talking about it because it&#x27;s so um outside a normal person&#x27;s worldview to understand that there is um this biological sentience that have piloted these crafts that don&#x27;t necessarily look 100% like you and I. &gt;&gt; Were there pictures? Were there &gt;&gt; there were yes there were. &gt;&gt; When I said from another planet or from outer space, you said not we don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re from. Is it interdimensional? What What are we talking about? &gt;&gt; Uh I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of I&#x27;ll call greybeards on the program.</p>
<p>That is a subject of hot debate on origin. I&#x27;ve as a guy trained in physics formally as well in my background. I leave an open mind on what the origin is. Uh certainly uh there is the extraterrestrial hypothesis and they could be coming from elsewhere off Earth, but I don&#x27;t usually go there because I did not see that data. I and I&#x27;m not conversant in the high confidence theories that the US government had.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not aware of any remains that the department has um uh of you know any signs of extraterrestrial beings or activity or technology. &gt;&gt; You say we the US government knows but there are many other governments around the world. &gt;&gt; Do they know? They have their own programs and like I said two and a half years ago uh we have been an arms race with our peer competitors you know namely Russia and China and they have their own programs in that in this regard and I was actually able to view a body of intelligence that discussed um adversarial programs and I&#x27;ll leave it at that. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve recovered things you say yeah &gt;&gt; bodies and physical remains. Was there a sense that the motive of whether how they got here, what they were doing, was it peaceful, not peaceful? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve seen a mixed bag of activity.</p>
<p>Um, and uh motive and intent, why they&#x27;re visiting. That&#x27;s once again that gets into our assessments, not necessarily, we can&#x27;t quite understand the intent of some of the sentients and why they&#x27;re visiting. Could it be because uh we have interesting genetic material on Earth? uh we&#x27;re uh Jurassic Park tourist attraction for them. Could be a myriad of reasons &gt;&gt; for the other people who are coming out. &gt;&gt; You say to them what you&#x27;ve obviously faced intimidation.</p>
<p>You talked about harassment. Uh there are reports that others have too. &gt;&gt; I say that uh there&#x27;s hope. Um certainly uh Congress values whistleblower information right now and certainly I believe there&#x27;s an appetite with the administration to do the right thing on this as well. Um and there&#x27;s some other things that are happening behind the scenes that I&#x27;ll let the administration discuss when they&#x27;re ready.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, we appreciate your time and uh we&#x27;ll follow every element. It&#x27;s fascinating. &gt;&gt; Yep. Thanks for having me on.</p>
