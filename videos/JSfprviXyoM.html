            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>ERIK BARD: Andy, Paul, where are you about to take us? So you&#x27;ve all heard of the Roswell crash. Sure. Who hasn&#x27;t? But have you heard</p>
<p>of the Kecksburg crash? Yes, I have. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Kecksburg, Pennsylvania-- Yes. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: --had a relatively well-known, amongst our community, crash in</p>
<p>1965, that has really kind of become an unanswered cold case. Well, I&#x27;ll confess. Look, I&#x27;ve been hoping that we might engage this story. You have? I know a little bit</p>
<p>about it, as does Travis. And so this is really exciting. So the story is that there is some kind of craft, or space debris, or something that came down there, acorn-shaped.</p>
<p>But what it is, or what it was, or what happened remains really kind of shrouded in mystery. There were a lot of witnesses at the time.</p>
<p>It got a lot of coverage, and then just sort of faded from view under, it seems like, sort of a cloak of secrecy and some cover up. We have an opportunity now to go in Kecksburg and see if we can&#x27;t bring some</p>
<p>of the most modern technology that we have available to us to try to answer the unanswered questions about what happened in this location. This sounds pretty ambitious. We don&#x27;t know what this thing</p>
<p>is or how it worked or whatever, right? - Right. Was it really a UFO? Was it a downed experimental craft that was being worked on? Who knows what it could have been? I think we have some</p>
<p>ambitious plans for this. Yeah. Well, I feel like this is a topic where-- and an area where certainly an ambitious effort is warranted.</p>
<p>Yeah. Can&#x27;t wait to see what you find. Absolutely. Right on. PAUL BEBAN: We&#x27;re</p>
<p>excited to get out there. Pete, I&#x27;m happy to have you here, man. We have got a mystery for you, for sure.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: Andy and Paul have called in Skinwalker veteran Pete Kelsey with his expertise and technology to conduct a thorough scan of the environment surrounding the possible UFO landing in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>All I know is some kind of an impact site, right? PAUL BEBAN: Right. From what we understand through third-hand information, the impact site might actually be in this wash area right behind us.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: It sounds like this thing came down in this area, right in here. We&#x27;re not exactly sure where. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re hoping you can help us figure out.</p>
<p>Well, as you guys know, typically, the tools that I bring have to do with physical evidence right on the ground. I brought all the usual suspects, LiDAR and the SLAM scanner.</p>
<p>If one of you guys want to scan, I can be watching the data coming in on the tablet in real time. I&#x27;m happy to stomp around, sure.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: Handheld LiDAR, also known as a SLAM scanner, uses laser light to map out an area. It measures the time it takes for the laser to bounce back after hitting an</p>
<p>object and uses that collected data to create a detailed 3D model of the environment. I just want to make sure we see data and then you&#x27;re off. I&#x27;m good to go.</p>
<p>Here we go. NARRATOR: LiDAR technology also has the ability to strip away layers of vegetation to visualize the topography of a site, which can reveal</p>
<p>areas not easily detected by the naked eye. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: We know we&#x27;re looking for something that happened in the past. We have these dense woods. And we need a piece of tech</p>
<p>that allows us to scrape away the layers of the currents in order to get backwards in time. And the SLAM scanner is exactly the kind of tool to make that happen. Well, I would love to</p>
<p>get eyes on the data that you were able to collect, see if that can&#x27;t point us in the next direction. - I&#x27;m going to get busy on that. - OK. Thanks, Pete.</p>
<p>[music playing] NARRATOR: Andy and Paul return to Kecksburg to learn Pete Kelsey&#x27;s handheld LiDAR results from the possible UFO crash site. Look at this right here.</p>
<p>I cut my teeth in civil engineering and land surveying. That&#x27;s manmade earthwork. Because it&#x27;s level against this otherwise very steep slope.</p>
<p>Straight lines, right angles, those kind of things do not occur in nature, right? And then when you rotate the view, like I&#x27;ve done here, and you see it has a level bottom? PAUL BEBAN: I mean, this is right where we were walking.</p>
<p>is this evidence, 60 years later, of that impact. We looked at it with our own eyes. There&#x27;s no level</p>
<p>ground down there. So that&#x27;s a remnant of something that&#x27;s no longer visible. Andy, Paul, and Pete decide to go back to replicate their</p>
<p>experiments in the exact spot. This is it right here. Up there, yeah. You see how it feels like a pad and sort of leveled out? And then it sort of ends</p>
<p>abruptly right there. NARRATOR: Now they&#x27;ll check the radio spectrum, at the newly discovered area of interest. I&#x27;ll pop the RF scanner. There&#x27;s a peak at 1.638.</p>
<p>Are they significant peaks? Oh, yeah, look at that. Yeah. 1.74. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: That&#x27;s not the same spectrum that we saw when we were here the first time.</p>
<p>Right. So, yeah, we&#x27;ve moved, what, 20 feet. Totally different spectrum. That&#x27;s strange.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: The one difference from here to there is this is what it was indicated on the LiDAR as something unusual that maybe suggests that this is the actual impact site. But that would not explain</p>
<p>how it could have such a different radio signature-- [laughs] with nothing in between here and there. Unless it&#x27;s hyper-localized, unless it exists here and doesn&#x27;t exist over there, we could take the spectrum</p>
<p>analyzer right over there and find out right now. - Yeah, that-- I mean, how could that be-- how could the signal differ across-- It shouldn&#x27;t. --such a short distance? We can test it. We can take it right over there</p>
<p>and see if that same signal is present right now. OK. Let&#x27;s just walk it up. [music playing] Look. It actually did</p>
<p>completely change. Wow! Pete, look at this. It actually did completely change. It&#x27;s totally different.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s dead. It&#x27;s a completely-- Completely flat. --different signal. Look at that. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: We&#x27;ve</p>
<p>gone, what, 20 feet? That&#x27;s unbelievable. PETE KELSEY: That&#x27;s, like, not within the realm of possible, right? No, no. That makes-- I&#x27;m-- [laughs] I&#x27;m stunned. This doesn&#x27;t make any sense.</p>
<p>How is there a radio signal in one place that doesn&#x27;t exist just a few feet away? That&#x27;s not how radio energy works. That&#x27;s not how frequencies work.</p>
<p>The only reason that we were brought here was because of Pete&#x27;s LiDAR data. And now that we&#x27;re here, we&#x27;re getting even more evidence that suggests that there</p>
<p>really was something strange that happened on this spot, in this ravine in Kecksburg. We might have actually found the real crash site. That might explain why we have</p>
<p>so many localized anomalous readings right here that we don&#x27;t see anywhere else in this valley. Thanks, Pete, for pointing that out in the LiDAR. We would have never</p>
<p>found this otherwise. Yeah. Yeah, this is a great find. Amazing. Yeah, we&#x27;ve got to share</p>
<p>this with Travis and Erik. Absolutely. [music playing] ERIK BARD: Well, guys, welcome back to the ranch. I want to hear about your</p>
<p>findings at Chestnut Ridge. I think it exceeded our expectations. Mhm. But it left so many more</p>
<p>questions than answers. If you recall, we went out there first to dig into what happened in Kecksburg in 1965, the reported landing or crashing of some sort of acorn-shaped object from the sky.</p>
<p>So we called in Pete Kelsey. And then when we did get Pete&#x27;s results-- Yeah. --they were really quite telling.</p>
<p>It made us ask ourselves the question in that specific depression What else could we  measure in that site? PAUL BEBAN: Because we&#x27;re walking, what-- you can see-- 20 feet? ERIK BARD: Yeah.</p>
<p>OK. Look at that. It actually did completely change. Wow! Pete, look at this.</p>
<p>It actually did completely change. It&#x27;s totally different. It&#x27;s dead. TRAVIS TAYLOR: See, that</p>
<p>right there is fantastic data. Look at that. We&#x27;ve gone, what, 20 feet? That&#x27;s unbelievable. So I&#x27;d like to stop you here and ask a question.</p>
<p>[laughs] What I just watched was contiguous footage? PAUL BEBAN: Mhm. Yup. There was no cut. There was no editorial</p>
<p>process there. That is correct. Physically walked, in my hand, 20 feet. That&#x27;s it.</p>
<p>TRAVIS TAYLOR: You dropped, uh, 55 dB in 20 feet. I mean, you&#x27;ve got the numbers right here. 55 dB, that&#x27;s ginormous change.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: Orders of magnitude. Many orders of magnitude change. And here&#x27;s another piece that should be the opposite of this.</p>
<p>You guys were down in a hole. PAUL BEBAN: Right. - Right? In a ravine. And you walked uphill. The signal should have got</p>
<p>stronger as you walked uphill because there&#x27;s less terrain blocking from wherever it could be coming from, unless it&#x27;s coming from down there in that hole. What is this signal doing there? That doesn&#x27;t add up. That-- that is just too much.</p>
<p>Here on the ranch when we get it, we usually see some kind of phenomena occur. We see something we expect, OK, somehow or other, the source is with whatever</p>
<p>this is, or this is causing it. It&#x27;s a byproduct or something. This looks like it&#x27;s just coming out of the dadgum ground. Right.</p>
<p>Or it&#x27;s a beam coming from somewhere else hitting the ground. So this is-- that shouldn&#x27;t be there. Anyway, whatever that is,</p>
<p>it shouldn&#x27;t be there. Either we&#x27;ve got something active, something energizing that space in the RF today, and for who knows how long, or we&#x27;ve got some kind of residual from the event.</p>
<p>TRAVIS TAYLOR: So what you have shown is there is something very odd about that particular point in Kecksburg. ERIK BARD: You&#x27;re talking about getting concrete evidence of something--</p>
<p>what did you say, 60 years? PAUL BEBAN: 60 years ago. Did a little beacon fall off of whatever that acorn-shaped thing was and it&#x27;s still-- A 60-year battery. --with a 60-year-- yeah, right? I&#x27;m thinking right now of all sorts of different things that we need to go back and do.</p>
<p>This place, to me, is absolutely fascinating and bizarre. Good work, guys. I didn&#x27;t think you were going to come back with this, that&#x27;s for sure.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: Yeah. Neither did we. What do you guys want to do for us next? If you recall, one of our special projects from our first</p>
<p>years investigation was a gentleman named Chris Bledsoe. NARRATOR: Last year, Andy and Paul traveled to North Carolina to meet with Chris Bledsoe who says he had an extraterrestrial</p>
<p>encounter in 2007. This fire was swirling, and these little flames were shooting off of it. I never thought about UFOs, but I knew it wasn&#x27;t anything that we had.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: Chris claims that afterward, he formed a connection with the phenomenon. It came out of the sky. And when I came home, the</p>
<p>phenomena came to the house. NARRATOR: This experience gave Chris the ability to seemingly communicate and directly interact with orbs. I&#x27;m broadcasting my</p>
<p>intentions in every direction, and I&#x27;m asking them to come and share their experience tonight with us. This is time right now. Here it comes. [music playing] You see it coming? ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Oh, wow.</p>
<p>CHRIS BLEDSOE: Yeah. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: What the hell. I don&#x27;t know what this is. NARRATOR: Andy and Paul called in neuroscientist Dr.</p>
<p>James Thompson to take an EEG of his brain when interacting with the orbs and recorded stunning results. The state change that occurs in the presence of the orb, which is instantaneous, it&#x27;s</p>
<p>really only held by the highest level meditators. You look at a Buddhist monk, they can move into this state. Oh, yeah. This was a very interesting</p>
<p>experiment that these guys did. I think what we found coming out of our first round of investigations with him and the EEG was that there is some kind of effect on his brain.</p>
<p>There is something different biologically that happens when he believes he&#x27;s in contact with the phenomenon. The question is, is it a physical stimulus or is it a</p>
<p>psychological stimulus? If we can add a more clinical way of studying Chris&#x27;s brain. Because if you recall, our first experiment happened in the field. We would like to find a way to</p>
<p>put more controlled elements around that experiment to see if we can recreate or even advance some of what we&#x27;ve learned about Chris brain. I mean, one possibility we think, and I think this would be interesting to you guys as well,</p>
<p>is taking him to the Monroe Institute, you know, studies of deep consciousness where a lot of this research has been going on for decades. They have some facilities there that are pretty unique.</p>
<p>We think, you know, that&#x27;s something that that&#x27;ll intrigue Dr. Thompson as well. So it sounds like we&#x27;re planning on an EEG exercise, electroencephalogram study of</p>
<p>what&#x27;s going on in real time, perhaps as he engages, which is a very interesting avenue to go down because there&#x27;s talk about the effect of orbs on human neurophysiology. Well, this will be an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to the results from that. - Me, too. - All right. - Good luck.</p>
<p>- Cool. Thank you. [music playing] PAUL BEBAN: This is a beautiful place. Look at this.</p>
<p>The team will meet with neuroscientist Dr. James Thompson at the Institute to do a more controlled set of tests with Chris. I am super excited</p>
<p>about this experiment. Dr. James Thompson, thank you so much for coming back. Pleasure.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: In last year&#x27;s investigation near Chris&#x27;s home in North Carolina, Dr. Thompson ran brainwave tests on Chris to see what happened to him when he saw orbs using an</p>
<p>electroencephalogram, or EEG. An EEG uses electrodes on the scalp to detect and record the location, frequency, and strength of electrical signals sent to different areas of the brain and can give an analysis</p>
<p>of a person&#x27;s brainwaves when they are experiencing different events. In 2023, using EEG technology, the team was able to capture data of Chris&#x27;s brain when orbs appear.</p>
<p>Just had a sighting. We just had a sighting. He&#x27;s pointing. Wow. We&#x27;re going to have you in</p>
<p>this copper-enclosed room. Right. You&#x27;re going to be lying in the bed. We&#x27;ve got people outside,</p>
<p>and we&#x27;ve got the cameras outside monitoring the sky. And when you sense a phenomena, react to it as you naturally would. And we&#x27;ll be capturing the data outside, and we&#x27;ll be capturing the</p>
<p>data inside in your brain, inside this copper room. Wonderful. The copper room is a modified Faraday cage, an enclosed room lined with copper, designed to prohibit any kind of energy within or outside the</p>
<p>room from penetrating the walls in either direction. NARRATOR: The question is, will Chris be able to sense the orbs without being able to see them while also being completely shielded from any known measurable energy</p>
<p>that the phenomenon might communicate to him? And how will his brain react? Here we go. We&#x27;ve got the screens rolling. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: All right, man. I&#x27;m going to head out. PAUL BEBAN: OK.</p>
<p>- I&#x27;ll be on standby. You got me via walkie. Yep. Away we go. See you, gents.</p>
<p>OK. PAUL BEBAN: This is such an interesting experiment, right? Because the copper room, really what it does is seal Chris off electromagnetically from the outside world.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no way, as far as we know, that he can still connect with the phenomenon. Hey, Paul, this is Andy. Copy you, Andy.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m in location. All cameras are running. We&#x27;re ready to rock and roll. Very good. Chris is in position.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also the question of whether the copper shielding actually shields him from whatever it is, whatever his connection is. Yeah. PAUL BEBAN: Andy,</p>
<p>he&#x27;s gesturing. OK. Copy that, sir. We&#x27;ve got eyes on the sky. ANDY BUSTAMANTE:</p>
<p>Son of a [bleep]. That&#x27;s unbelievable. NARRATOR: Despite being completely isolated, he just seemed to identify an orb in the sky.</p>
<p>Andy, he&#x27;s pointing to this-- he&#x27;s pointing to the sky. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Copy that. We&#x27;re eyes on, trying to find something now.</p>
<p>Still pointing. Now, he just dropped his arm. Good, copy. We&#x27;re still scanning. Nothing so far.</p>
<p>Copy you. Andy, he&#x27;s signaling. Copy that. We&#x27;ve got eyes on the sky. Hey, Andy, why don&#x27;t</p>
<p>you come on back in, and we&#x27;ll get our heads together here. All right, man. Copy that, coming to you. Hey, Chris.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to wrap it up. Do you want to come on out? - Sure, great. NARRATOR: Although Andy didn&#x27;t film corresponding UAP activity two of the three times</p>
<p>when Chris signaled it, the production team has reviewed all the cameras pointed at the sky during the experiment and have compiled some surprising correlations. There was so much space. There were so many</p>
<p>dimensions of removal here, that even here we actually have footage now that correlates with Chris&#x27; hand raises. I&#x27;m very curious to see what this looks like. Right, inside the copper room.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: Chris&#x27; first signal, during which Andy captured an orb on his infrared camera. Son of a [bleep]. That&#x27;s unbelievable. NARRATOR: Also featured another</p>
<p>hit on the UFODAP camera in another part of the sky. So this is an airplane. You can see the flashing. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>- Whoa. Whoa. What was that? Did you see that? There&#x27;s a streaker. Yep. Wow.</p>
<p>And to think that that correlated with Chris raising his hand inside the copper room? That&#x27;s wild. That&#x27;s totally wild. It&#x27;s barely perceptible.</p>
<p>Chris was in an insulated room. Mm-hmm. Insulated by, like, three walls.</p>
<p>Like, the room was inside of a room which was inside of a house. JAMES THOMPSON: Right. Not to mention the fact that it was enclosed in copper.</p>
<p>To even hear that there was any kind of correlation between when Chris was raising his hand, what we were seeing outside, anything at all, was kind of shocking in the moment. Right.</p>
<p>I mean, that really goes to show the correlation between your sense and what&#x27;s happening in the sky above us. Right there.</p>
<p>So here&#x27;s another event, Chris, where you were able to show a signal with your hand. [suspenseful sound] Boy, that&#x27;s a quick one, too. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: That correlates with some kind of activity in the sky.</p>
<p>Yeah, see it, doing a wag? ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Oh, yeah. JAMES THOMPSON: See, there&#x27;s a curve a little bit. Yeah, swimming like a fish. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Yeah.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what I call a streaker. They don&#x27;t go straight. They all do this number. Wow. And here again, Chris is</p>
<p>inside the copper room-- ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Mm-hmm. JAMES THOMPSON: --isolated from electromagnetic fields. That&#x27;s absolutely flabbergasting, man.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at the next clip. NARRATOR: The next footage from the thermal camera correlates with the third time that Chris sensed an orb.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: Here it comes, coming up. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Oh, yeah. JAMES THOMPSON: Oh, yeah. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Wow.</p>
<p>How did we miss that? And the copper room is there to block any kind of electromagnetic signal from getting in or out. Right. Right.</p>
<p>So whatever your relationship is with the phenomenon, it&#x27;s not electromagnetic. It bypasses all that. Yeah. I don&#x27;t know how you sense that.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know how you did that. CHRIS BLEDSOE: I wish I knew how or what. I had no idea. Teach us.</p>
<p>[laughs] Just, got the same signals that I get when I&#x27;m out looking at the sky. Fascinating. What an interesting start. That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>Whatever you&#x27;re doing, just keep doing it. Paul and Andy, it&#x27;s good to have you back at the ranch. What do you got for us? We want to go back</p>
<p>to Miller Ranch, a place in Southern Colorado. ERIK BARD: Oh, yeah. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: The ranch where we went originally to investigate the incredible amount of cattle mutilations in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>TRAVIS TAYLOR: Over the years, they&#x27;ve had some, like, 10 or 20 cattle mutilations there, right? Exactly. ERIK BARD: Yeah. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: The only</p>
<p>ranch in the area that had any kind of history like this. NARRATOR: Andy and Paul&#x27;s research of cattle mutilations at Thomas Miller Ranch led them to a bridge that could hold clues to how their cattle are being mutilated.</p>
<p>I think something lifts them up, does their thing, and then drops them down. All evidence points to the bridge. Yeah.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: Their last investigation revealed there could be some sort of time-based anomaly or portal at the bridge, just like the triangle at Skinwalker Ranch. There&#x27;s data underground.</p>
<p>Also, there&#x27;s anomalous data that&#x27;s in the air. What we&#x27;re seeing is impossible. It&#x27;s not possible. This is like another</p>
<p>Skinwalker Ranch. The parallels are stunning. This will be our third trip back to Miller Ranch. And this time,</p>
<p>we want to go back with a very specific objective. We want to try to get much more aggressive with whatever the phenomenon is above the bridge so that we can try to define it more, and identify if there is and to what extent there</p>
<p>may be of a relationship between the Millers themselves and the phenomenon over the bridge. The bridge might be the nexus of whatever the phenomena is or the stimulus or the doorway-- Right. --that they&#x27;re</p>
<p>slipping through. And these cows are coming in and out through that somehow. So we&#x27;ve been talking about a physical bridge, but we may be</p>
<p>dealing with a bridge of an entirely different kind. Yes. I think this is an ideal place to continue to follow up on. Maybe it&#x27;ll lead</p>
<p>us to some answers. PAUL BEBAN: All right. - Sounds like a plan. - Ready to go? - Ready to rock.</p>
<p>Good luck, guys. Go forth boldly. Yeah, yeah. Right about there. Right there, right there.</p>
<p>Are you good? NARRATOR: In preparation for their next experiment, the team works with local law enforcement to safely shut down the Miller Ranch bridge. [inaudible] We&#x27;re going to</p>
<p>roll traffic through slowly. - Hey, hey, guys. - Hey. Hey, look who&#x27;s here. Good to see you, sir.</p>
<p>- Yeah, you too. - Hey, man. Thanks for coming out. Great to see you. Let&#x27;s set up Tesla</p>
<p>coils first and bring out our equipment afterwards. Yeah, let&#x27;s set them up. NARRATOR: During their first investigation at Miller Ranch, Andy and Paul conducted a Tesla coil experiment under the bridge that triggered UAPs.</p>
<p>Now they&#x27;re setting up the Tesla coils again, but this time, they&#x27;re placing them on top of the bridge in the area where Pete Kelsey found evidence of a portal with his photogrammetry drone.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t explain it. This anomalous data that&#x27;s in the air that shouldn&#x27;t be there, and Travis and Eric were saying, that&#x27;s where some space-time something is the only thing with our current</p>
<p>understanding of physics that could explain it. Like a portal? Yeah. If you don&#x27;t mind just giving us a quick test to make sure all the equipment is working. - OK.</p>
<p>[music playing] NARRATOR: The team will flood the Miller Ranch bridge with up to 300,000 volts of electrical energy, hoping to once again stimulate UAPs, strange radio spectrum communication, or even find further evidence</p>
<p>of a portal above the bridge. [police siren] All right, we&#x27;re all set. We&#x27;re rocking and rolling, man. We&#x27;ve got full power and everything&#x27;s functioning normally.</p>
<p>- Evening, guys. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, Sally. Good to see you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us. - Good to see you too. - Hey, Tom. - Good to see you, ma&#x27;am. - You too.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: With everything up and running, the team welcomes the Millers and is ready to put their Tesla coils to the test. [radio chatter] All right, I&#x27;m ready to rock. The road is shut down.</p>
<p>The Tesla coils are plugged in. Tom, Sally, you&#x27;ve seen us have this set up on multiple parts of your ranch. This is our FAA tracker. We&#x27;re going to use this to</p>
<p>rule out any aircraft that are actively transmitting a signal. Here we&#x27;ve got a satellite tracker. This is giving us all the satellite activity that&#x27;s happening all around the world.</p>
<p>How exciting. This is our spectrum analyzer registering our RF spectrum right now. And then here, you&#x27;ve got our outputs for our two UFODAPs.</p>
<p>These are our eyes in the sky. AI powered machines that are designed to be watching the sky at all times because we&#x27;re going to be watching everything else. If they find something</p>
<p>that doesn&#x27;t fit their AI index of pre-recorded data, then they&#x27;ll zoom in, record, and alert us. The arcs are going to come off the side and go down into the bridge, and you&#x27;ll see them spider out</p>
<p>into the asphalt. It&#x27;s really cool looking. [siren] So this is what baseline looks like right now. And if we see changes</p>
<p>with radio energy, if we see changes when we have any kind of activity overhead, that will confirm for us that there&#x27;s some sort of correlation between the two. - All right, let&#x27;s do it. - Alrighty.</p>
<p>- Rock and roll. - OK. Coming up. [music playing] [electricity sparks] All right. Look at that.</p>
<p>Keep going up. Let&#x27;s keep going. Do you want to go up? Yeah. [electricity sparks] 300. [electricity sparks] Paul, Paul, Paul-- Weird.</p>
<p>Yeah. What could that be? NARRATOR: As Cameron increases the electrical energy of the Tesla coils on top of the bridge, the team measures a correlating increase in radio energy on the spectrum analyzer,</p>
<p>which makes no scientific sense because adding electrical energy should not relate to receiving a radio frequency response. I mean, look at this, it&#x27;s unlike anything we were seeing in our baseline. Whoa.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s huge. Is that normal? I don&#x27;t know if you noticed, we&#x27;ve got a little arc over on the coil on the right. What do you mean by arc over? It&#x27;s when an arc hits the copper tube.</p>
<p>I think that one&#x27;s toast. All right. Do you normally see that the coils break if you put them through this much energy? Typically the wind or moisture on the coil itself from dew or condensation in the air will</p>
<p>cause it to arc back to itself. We don&#x27;t have that tonight. Tell us if we&#x27;re not understanding it. But does it feel dry</p>
<p>and calm to you here? It does. So, somehow, your dry, calm Colorado night isn&#x27;t so calm at all. We know our ground is good, or the other coil would suffer the same problem.</p>
<p>Something drew that arc to the coil itself. And that&#x27;s all she wrote. That seemed like it was playing with us, man.</p>
<p>CAMERON PRINCE: Yeah. I don&#x27;t know. I can&#x27;t explain it. So, guys. Well, I know Travis</p>
<p>and I both are just anxious to find out what happened on this third visit to Miller Ranch. This was an incredible trip. It really was. All right.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s our first clip. That jumped away quick. OK, now go frame in time. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: So there&#x27;s our first big break away from the actual UFODAP</p>
<p>tracking box, from 9587 to 9590, so three frames. There, right there. Stop right there. ERIK BARD: It&#x27;s way down there. How many frames is it? From 90 to 92, two frames.</p>
<p>Two frames. It covered most of the field of view. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: But then it decelerates right there.</p>
<p>TRAVIS TAYLOR: Yeah, it jumped and it slows down. So that&#x27;s clearly not a satellite. It&#x27;s not an airplane.</p>
<p>No. Something makes it jump that big jump. Is it an optical aberration? Or did it accelerate that fast? So tell me where I&#x27;m looking. Is this thing right</p>
<p>by you looking up through where Pete Kelce&#x27;s drone had the phenomena occur? Yes, sir. So if there is a time anomaly at the bridge, you&#x27;ve found the edges. Because you see it moving</p>
<p>normal, then you see it jump, and then you see it slow down and move normal again. Which suggests where the jumps are is it&#x27;s behind whatever your time shift, something else, whatever this is, right? Yeah, I&#x27;m not saying</p>
<p>it&#x27;s a wormhole, a gateway to another universe. It could be an optical distortion. It could be anything. In fact, we actually</p>
<p>measured something like that here over the triangle with Pete Kelce&#x27;s terrestrial LiDAR scanner back in the summer. That would make this another data point that correlates with the triangle here on Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s exactly right. Every time we visit Miller Ranch, we seem to come back with another solid data point that correlates the bridge and the area over the bridge, the anomaly over the</p>
<p>bridge, with the anomaly over the triangle here at Skinwalker Ranch, it really cross correlates well with Skinwalker Ranch. And then here&#x27;s the other big question.</p>
<p>What is this anomaly doing near a place where all of these cattle mutilations seem to be occurring? Right, which is where we started. Yeah, I can think</p>
<p>of five, probably, followup experiments that need to be done, including tandem experiments that we do here, then we do there simultaneously. Absolutely. Fantastic, guys.</p>
<p>Good, great work. Awesome. Agreed. This is goodness, guys. TRAVIS TAYLOR: Yeah.</p>
<p>Can&#x27;t wait to see what you do next. with UAP experiencer Chris Bledsoe and his daughter Emily in a remote, unpopulated, dark sky area in the Florida Everglades.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: Last week, Andy and Paul brought Chris to the world-renowned Monroe Institute, a research center focused on the study of human consciousness to do controlled brainwave tests.</p>
<p>With the help of Dr. Thompson, they first studied Chris with Paul as a control subject and found their brains seemed to react differently to orbs that appeared.</p>
<p>JAMES THOMPSON: Paul&#x27;s a little more cognitive. Now he&#x27;s thinking about things, whereas Chris, Chris&#x27;s brainwaves are larger and slower.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: Next, they isolated Chris in a completely sealed off copper room that blocked the energy of the outside world to see if he&#x27;d have brainwave interactions with orb phenomena.</p>
<p>And he did. PAUL BEBAN: Andy, he&#x27;s gesturing. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Paul, I see an orb right here, flying overhead.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: Son of a [bleep]. That&#x27;s unbelievable. NARRATOR: Now, they&#x27;re capping off the Bledsoe brain experiment by bringing in a new test subject, Chris&#x27;s daughter, Emily, who claims to have</p>
<p>a similar relationship with the phenomenon despite not having been at her father&#x27;s original reported encounter. EMILY: I was 10 years old when the Cape Fear River incident happened. And I just remember</p>
<p>believing my dad 100% very soon after the phenomenon started showing around me. And it hasn&#x27;t stopped since. They want to further test Emily&#x27;s seemingly unique relationship</p>
<p>with the phenomenon. They&#x27;ve also brought in Beyond Skinwalker veteran Steve Priola, an ex cinematographer who&#x27;s developed a unique way to film orbs in the night sky. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Hey, Steve.</p>
<p>STEVE PRIOLA: Gentlemen. So the thing about this camera is you have to be at the right place at the right time. And with Chris here, the odds</p>
<p>are pretty good that we&#x27;re going to see something. So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re bringing this to the table. And I think it&#x27;s going to work out great.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the idea. We&#x27;ve got all the pieces in place. Just got to wait for nightfall, which won&#x27;t be long.</p>
<p>STEVE PRIOLA: Right. NARRATOR: In addition to monitoring Chris and Emily in perfect conditions to document potential orb sightings, the team wants to test a claim that the phenomenon appears to</p>
<p>be amplified when both of them are together. NARRATOR: For the first time, Andy and Paul have trekked their monitoring tools into the swamp to detect energies present during any interaction</p>
<p>Chris and Emily have with orbs, including their spectrum analyzer, which records Earth-to-space and space-to-Earth communication. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: So I&#x27;m going to be monitoring a number of different tools</p>
<p>from this space station here while we&#x27;re relying on you guys to point us in the direction of any activity that you see. But we have multiple ways of looking at what&#x27;s happening in the radio spectrum.</p>
<p>We have a way of ruling out aircraft with our FAA tracker and ruling out satellites with our satellite tracker here. And then we have UFODAPs watching the sky constantly, our AI-powered eyes in</p>
<p>the sky that you remember from the Monroe Institute. Flash up there. CHRIS BLEDSOE: Overhead? EMILY: Overhead, yeah. I mean, it&#x27;s gone now. It was very quick.</p>
<p>ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Paul. PAUL BEBAN: Yes, sir. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: We had something interesting happen in the radio spectrum, just as Emily pointed out what she just saw.</p>
<p>Yeah. Come take a look at this. This just came to life. PAUL BEBAN: Wow. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: And</p>
<p>this is exactly what Erik talks about when he talks about-- see how the peak keeps moving? PAUL BEBAN: Yeah. Yeah. So this was a quiet spectrum until Emily called out whatever what she saw in the sky.</p>
<p>Look at that. The way that peak is sort of just oscillating back and forth, right? So at 1.692 gigahertz, just under 1.7 gigahertz. Strange.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve ever seen anything just like that. No. Straight up. It&#x27;s very faint.</p>
<p>You see it, Dad? ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Look at that. And then it disappeared. And look what they did. She connected arms with him. CHRIS BLEDSOE: They</p>
<p>definitely know we&#x27;re here. I was just a little greedy. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: There certainly seems to be some interesting activity in the radio spectrum for sure.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: A lot of weird little pulses between 1.69 and 1.7. Hey, Andy. What if we try to find the source of that signal? Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see if we can. You got the log periodic right here. NARRATOR: With the spectrum analyzer detecting a signal in the 1.6 to 1.7 gigahertz</p>
<p>range, which is being sent from Earth to space or space to Earth, the team will now use their log periodic antenna. By rotating this directional antenna 360 degrees, it can isolate and hone</p>
<p>in on the exact direction where the radio signal is transmitting from. - All right, man. - All right. Ready when you are.</p>
<p>Start swinging through. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Backtrack for me. Stop right there.</p>
<p>So there are changes. I want you to watch for changes in intensity, and then look at where the antenna is focused during those changes. All right.</p>
<p>ANDY BUSTAMANTE: So expect the pattern to stay the same. But watch the change in energy. Intense for a spike. All right.</p>
<p>Here we go, counterclockwise. [music playing] [antenna beeping] Tell you what, Andy, right about here, we&#x27;ve got a bit of a drop off. That&#x27;s exactly what I thought I saw, too.</p>
<p>The pattern is still there, but the intensity is less. PAUL BEBAN: Go back a little bit. Yep.</p>
<p>Yep. There it is. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Yeah. So I wanted you to see that without me saying anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. PAUL BEBAN: It&#x27;s definitely higher now. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: So we see this consistent pattern of energy.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: Right. And we see this level of intensity, these high peaks when the directional antenna is focused in their direction. And it really drops off at 180</p>
<p>when we turn it away from them. Yeah. Exactly right. Why would that happen? I don&#x27;t know, man. I mean, it implies</p>
<p>that something is transmitting at them. Right. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: One of the things that Paul and I discovered from the command post while you all were</p>
<p>focused on the woods is that we saw some sort of unique signature, a radio signature that seemed to be focused on where you were localized to you. And not only that, it&#x27;s in a frequency bandwidth where there should be</p>
<p>no activity at all. We were at 1.692 gigahertz, which is a frequency zone that&#x27;s reserved for US federal government use only and for Earth-to-space and space-to-Earth communication.</p>
<p>Wow. So almost like there&#x27;s a frequency from Earth to space somehow connected to us. That&#x27;s where we&#x27;re landing as well, that somehow there&#x27;s energy that&#x27;s tied to your being</p>
<p>together, your being connected, your being connected to the phenomenon at the same time. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but what I do know is it doesn&#x27;t happen that way for other people.</p>
<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be happening at all to anybody. So it&#x27;s almost like the phenomenon uses that frequency to communicate somehow, and we somehow-- Connect to it somehow, yeah.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s as good a hypothesis as we&#x27;ve got right now. Well, we&#x27;ve got a lot of data. Yeah, I mean, this was a fantastically successful night.</p>
<p>Yeah. Let&#x27;s pack up. Let&#x27;s dry our feet and start reviewing the data. Yeah, let&#x27;s do it.</p>
<p>Sounds good. Well, welcome back, guys. You&#x27;ve had some incredible travels. I mean, you&#x27;ve managed to cross</p>
<p>the entire continental United States in service to this expanded investigation. We&#x27;ve been in the heat. We&#x27;ve been in the cold, and now we&#x27;ve been actually in one</p>
<p>of the darkest places in the continental US with Chris Bledsoe. And I&#x27;ll tell you, we&#x27;ve got some really interesting stuff to show you. we didn&#x27;t have our biggest</p>
<p>breakthrough until after we had left for the night and started reviewing some of our footage. So the first thing I want to share with you is this. Whoa.</p>
<p>Look at the way this one moves through space and seems to touch down in a way-- Getting off the ground. PAUL BEBAN: Far in the distance, right? It&#x27;s reflecting</p>
<p>off the ground. Or at least that&#x27;s what appears. PAUL BEBAN: But nobody&#x27;s walking back out there. And you guys didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>see this, right? Nope. So I get the feeling there&#x27;s a story with this. I&#x27;m really interested in the timeline here.</p>
<p>Was there some exercise being conducted with Chris around this period of time? Do you-- So what we discovered from the timeline was that Steve found that-- the timestamp on this image was at 6:50 PM. And if you recall,</p>
<p>the spectrum analyzer results that we were just showing you started up when the first sighting happened between Chris and Emily. That first sighting happened at 6:51 PM.</p>
<p>So within one minute. Right. You have this event caught on camera, coupled with the UAP, with the other unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
<p>I think the correlations, the people, the participants involved, the setting, the remote setting where this occurred, where you really don&#x27;t have light pollution. You&#x27;re in a very remote area.</p>
<p>And then you couple with that the correlation within seconds of UFO activity. I think we&#x27;ve-- congratulations, gentlemen. I think we have a</p>
<p>bona fide unidentified aerial phenomena event. Incredible. Welcome back. We&#x27;re thrilled to come back together with you.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been researching a number of other sites over the course of the last few years. And one in particular that keeps coming up is Mount Shasta in</p>
<p>Northern California. Mount Shasta seems to be a center of gravity for phenomena that is very similar to what we&#x27;ve been seeing here at Skinwalker Ranch. Everything from UFO</p>
<p>or UAP phenomena to electromagnetic anomalies, strange creatures, and other activity that has been reported for decades, if not millennia. And people seem drawn to that area.</p>
<p>It has a very profound impact. So it sounds like there&#x27;s an entire community of experiencers, then, who may be resources for the research. Indeed.</p>
<p>We have some boots on the ground there that I&#x27;ve been collaborating with, in particular,  the local Sheriff Jeremiah LaRue. I mean, this is an area where there&#x27;s gonna be a lot of reports.</p>
<p>Whether they&#x27;re official, whether they&#x27;re on file or not, we&#x27;ll just see what we find. Well, this feels like the moment where we say, &quot;Go forth and conquer.&quot; But I think it&#x27;s more like, &quot;Conquer and go forth.&quot; There you go.</p>
<p>Good luck, guys. Thanks, guys. TRAVIS TAYLOR: Can&#x27;t wait to see what you find. See you soon.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: Yeah. BRANDON FUGAL: Thank you. Thanks, gentlemen. [suspenseful music] PAUL BEBAN: This place has been really a pilgrimage maybe for millennia.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s your take on it? What is the story of this place? JEREMIAH LARUE: This mountain puts out a lot of energy. I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of people that have come here. And it&#x27;s all different.</p>
<p>People describe speaking telepathically. They seek healing. They seek maybe a revelation of some kind.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, it&#x27;s beautiful. It&#x27;s wide open. You have a great shot of Mount Shasta.</p>
<p>It draws a lot of people to this area. Yeah. And then we, of course, have the aerial phenomena that is unique to the area.</p>
<p>We actually get quite a few calls up here for people that are just seeing things that they don&#x27;t normally see, whether it&#x27;s orbs in the sky, whether it&#x27;s actual craft, or people that have been out hiking,</p>
<p>skiing and they report seeing figures seven feet tall and they were glowing. They don&#x27;t have backpacks. They don&#x27;t have skis with them. There&#x27;s no reason that</p>
<p>they would see them in some of these remote areas. And I think this would be a potentially great location for a night investigation. Because we have equipment to observe the night sky.</p>
<p>Is this someplace we could set up tonight? - This is an excellent place. - Fantastic. Let me touch base with Andy. We&#x27;ll get the gear up here</p>
<p>and we&#x27;ll get started. - All right. - OK. Thanks so much. Thanks.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: With a perfect vantage point at the base of Mount Shasta, Andy, Paul, and Sheriff LaRue will conduct an experiment at night to see if they can capture evidence of a UAP.</p>
<p>So I want to walk you through a little bit of the equipment that we have here real quick. So what we&#x27;re looking at here is a thermal imaging camera. This is the most</p>
<p>sophisticated version of FLIR. It&#x27;s high definition. And it wasn&#x27;t available to us last year at any of our experimentations and it&#x27;s never set foot on Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: The FLIR T1030 is a high definition thermal camera that has a long-range capability to capture the environment&#x27;s heat signatures and convert them into digital video images.</p>
<p>This has never been available outside of the military before. And that&#x27;s trained on Mount Shasta. That&#x27;s gonna be our best friend</p>
<p>for seeing anything outside of the visible spectrum. Here and here we got flight tracker data, satellite tracker data. So we&#x27;re always trying to rule out aircraft in any sightings that we see overhead.</p>
<p>JEREMIAH LARUE: Right. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Here, we have two tools called UFODAPs. These are our eyes in the sky, AI-powered machines that are designed to be watching</p>
<p>the sky at all times because we&#x27;re going to be watching everything else. And if they find something that doesn&#x27;t fit their AI index of pre-recorded data, then they&#x27;ll zoom in, record, and alert us.</p>
<p>So if we do see something in the sky, then we&#x27;ll be able to actually record it and enhance the light that it&#x27;s giving us so that we&#x27;ll be able to really see it clearly. - Awesome.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#x27;t miss anything, then. It&#x27;s a lot of comfort blankets. Because we really only get one chance to set it up tonight, right?</p>
<p>- Right. So if you hear something strange, if you smell something strange, start tasting something strange, don&#x27;t be embarrassed to say anything that seems or feels strange.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to search through the radio spectrum, Paul. PAUL BEBAN: It&#x27;s super quiet, huh? ANDY BUSTAMANTE: It&#x27;s a really stable spectrum.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: Not a lot of air traffic either. You know, we do have one kind of creative thing on standby. We have a tone generator.</p>
<p>The Skinwalker team has had investigations where we&#x27;ve seen some kind of response that comes from actual auditory tones at specific frequencies. So it might be worth us running a couple of frequencies up against the environment</p>
<p>and seeing if it causes any kind of response. I think at Skinwalker the frequency is 192, right? 192 hertz, I have it set. NARRATOR: Now, Andy and Paul will play back the same 192 hertz tone</p>
<p>here at Mount Shasta to see if they can trigger a similar result. All right, here we go. [tone sounding] Oh, Paul, this is totally different.</p>
<p>Look at this. Where are we now? 1.4. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: 1.485. NARRATOR: When radio frequencies from 1.4 to 1.8 gigahertz are seen on a spectrum</p>
<p>analyzer, that indicates Earth-to-space or space-to-Earth communication. It might also signal the presence of a UAP. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: We&#x27;ve</p>
<p>got multiple peaks here, 1.52 gigahertz. And now they&#x27;re totally gone. Let me stop the tone generator. It did seem to correspond with the tone.</p>
<p>ANDY BUSTAMANTE: It really did. Oh, there it goes again. Did you see it? It&#x27;s like a-- Look at that. Look at that. Look at that.</p>
<p>Whoa. What is that? Whoa. Look at this. 1.71 gigahertz. There&#x27;s tons of energy.</p>
<p>And you can see how sporadic it is. It&#x27;s not clean. This is just all over the place.</p>
<p>All over the place. Look at that. And it just started up out of nowhere. [tone sounding] PAUL BEBAN: What was that?</p>
<p>ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Oh, UFODAP. PAUL BEBAN: Whoa. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: --just found something. Did you see that? PAUL BEBAN: I didn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Boom. OK. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: It&#x27;s against the coldest part of the sky. You see that? PAUL BEBAN: Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me take it slide by slide, frame by frame. PAUL BEBAN: Oh, yeah. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: What is that? PAUL BEBAN: It kind of wobbles. It does wobble.</p>
<p>Look at that. It&#x27;s like-- it&#x27;s like moving like a fish, right? You see that? Oh, look. We&#x27;ve got another object. It darted straight across from</p>
<p>right to left, 45-degree angle. FLIR is popping. [tone sounding] For all we the visual orbs that are being reported are just a fraction of all the orb activity.</p>
<p>Because they&#x27;re not using thermal imaging technology. This may be something completely new, a thermal orb. Let&#x27;s take a look</p>
<p>at that footage. Here&#x27;s the orb you saw off to the right. PAUL BEBAN: Yeah. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Right</p>
<p>here, look at this guy. PAUL BEBAN: Oh, that&#x27;s the one. JEREMIAH LARUE: This is the one that disappears. ANDY BUSTAMANTE:</p>
<p>Look right here. Oh, whoa, whoa. JEREMIAH LARUE: There&#x27;s a second one. PAUL BEBAN: Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>We were so busy with that, I didn&#x27;t even see that one. Hold on, that was... That was two objects. Did you notice how they</p>
<p>had the same shape? PAUL BEBAN: Yeah. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Similar trajectories. They appeared at the same time. PAUL BEBAN: But completely</p>
<p>different speeds. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: Totally different speeds. One of the things that just I can&#x27;t ignore is the fact that these objects</p>
<p>that we see on the FLIR seem to be going towards Mount Shasta. Whether we see slow moving orbs or fast moving orbs or groups of orbs, they all seem to be centering on Mount Shasta as their destination.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what this is. I have no explanation for this. It&#x27;s kind of freaking me out. What are these hot, high-speed objects? And they&#x27;re outside</p>
<p>of the visible spectrum. Right. I mean, is this normal? I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it before. Those are clearly</p>
<p>objects moving at speed, not just some sort of weird temperature anomaly. I&#x27;m feeling a little bit overwhelmed, man. There&#x27;s this, there&#x27;s this.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s still going. Once we triggered the 192-hertz tone that we borrowed from Skinwalker Ranch-- PAUL BEBAN: Yep. --that&#x27;s when</p>
<p>we really started tracking to multiple changes. But what has me fascinated right now with what&#x27;s going on in the FLIR is the continuity, the continuity in terms of the temperature signature that each of those</p>
<p>anomalies is putting off. They&#x27;re within the same range of each other. PAUL BEBAN: Right. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: The shape,</p>
<p>the size, they&#x27;re consistent. Yeah, it brings up just a lot more questions like we&#x27;re asking. What are these things? We&#x27;ll dig into it as much as we can.</p>
<p>And anything we learn, we&#x27;ll be sure to pass your way. Great. I&#x27;d love to hear. BRANDON FUGAL: All</p>
<p>right, gentlemen. We&#x27;ve been anxious to hear your findings. What do you have for us? PAUL BEBAN: Well, I think Mount Shasta delivered-- - Yeah.</p>
<p>- --is the top line here. This is going to blow you away. We had multiple UAP sightings on both the UFODAP and on our thermal camera.</p>
<p>All of that happened after we played the tone. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: After we triggered the 192-hertz tone. Yeah, wow.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: The skinwalker tone. ANDY BUSTAMANTE: The FLIR hits that I&#x27;m about to show you now were all captured in real time. From the upper right hand side of the screen, you see these two orbs</p>
<p>that are heat signatures. It looks like it either goes behind the mountain or possibly into the mountain. They&#x27;re only UAPs right now because we don&#x27;t know what they are.</p>
<p>- Correct. Right? They could turn out to be something completely explainable. I mean, we&#x27;ve got the flight tracker and the satellite</p>
<p>tracker running. You&#x27;re not seeing satellites or airplanes. But whatever that was flying in the air, it was as warm or at</p>
<p>least as reflective to appear to be the same color temperature. So that&#x27;s really interesting. It makes me think it may have been putting out its own light.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m glad we have this instrument. We didn&#x27;t have this instrument in our inventory during the first phase of our work together.</p>
<p>PAUL BEBAN: Right. So this is really a nice new piece of tech. What we see here is a definite correlation to what we have experienced</p>
<p>here at Skinwalker Ranch. It really begs the question. What is it going on beneath Mount Shasta? There is legitimacy to the lore. Yeah, I feel like you haven&#x27;t</p>
<p>just put a pin in the map, you&#x27;ve really put a golden spike in the map on this one. Let&#x27;s use this as a springboard. And I can&#x27;t wait to see</p>
<p>what we dig up next.</p>
