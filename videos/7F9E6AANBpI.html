            <p>maxwell please welcome tom bearden [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] thank you very much tom and ladies and gentlemen it&#x27;s always a great pleasure to come to the uspa annual symposium it&#x27;s just like coming home and so it&#x27;s really nice to be back here once again i&#x27;m sorry last year i&#x27;ll try to do better next time tonight i&#x27;d like to go into some work that i&#x27;ve been doing in the last year you will not be on weapons i&#x27;ll indicate very briefly at one point the obvious weapons implication of what i&#x27;m talking about but i would like to address the magic unified field theory everyone has been looking for how to unite gravitation and electromagnetics and a single theory that is engineerable they can be used on the laboratory bench and it does indeed work i will try to indicate for you exactly what gravity is and exactly how to manipulate it electromagnetically and will also indicate for those of you that are very sharp rather precisely how to easily make anti gravity everything that i&#x27;m saying has a basis on the laboratory bench but i work with inventors so i will not present a circuit i will not present even a picture of a particular piece of equipment nor will i answer such questions but the principles that i give you i will assure you you will have little problem yourself in applying if you&#x27;re an experimentalist and i will also assure you that they do work in the laboratory and if all goes well and the good lord&#x27;s willing and the creeks don&#x27;t rise like we used to say down in louisiana in about a year or less we hope to present the proof of everything i&#x27;m saying in livid breathing technicolor so without any further ado if we can get the mechanical part going we will start to talk about what happened to this magic unified field theory that was the original theory of james clerk maxwell maxwell&#x27;s original theory is no longer taught in western universities hasn&#x27;t really been taught since 1900 instead the work of a single man who quote translated unquote maxwell&#x27;s work into the modern version of vector analysis jane of oliver heavyside is what is taught as maxwell&#x27;s theory it is a subset of maxwell&#x27;s theory that is taught today and specifically is it it is that subset which only applies when there is no interaction whatsoever between the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field we&#x27;re going to show you the other part that got left out first of all the original theory the first paper that maxwell wrote was written in 1864 during the time of the american civil war it was a unified field theory it did contain a an engineerable and workable and experimental theory of gravity but very few people recognized it for what it was maxwell recognized it as the stress of space but didn&#x27;t understand that he had also grabbed the whole top gravity itself and so because it was written in quaternions vector analysis not having been invented yet or finished it was written in the mathematics that was quite difficult to calculate in and one which had very bizarre appearances of minus signs when intuition said there shouldn&#x27;t be one there and one which was devilishly difficult to calculate in one which most scientists found quite distasteful a quaternion differs from the present modern vector in that in addition to the three vector components you have a scalar component for example let us take a vector a obviously the vector a today and a little normal sophomore physics we&#x27;ll start out with a sub i or a i plus b j plus c k where i j and k are unit vectors orthogonal to each other if we take such a vector for example and we cross it with itself we will produce a zero vector resultant now i want to stop right there let me say that again rigorously we will produce a zero vector resultant now the two vectors didn&#x27;t go anywhere they&#x27;re still acting upon each other they&#x27;re still there so very rigorously what we produce is a zero vector system that is a system of acting vectors which sums to a zero resultant vector for translation on the bottom we show the same situation in quaternions the quaternion is expressed very similar to the vector except it has this little scalar term w sitting in there with one big difference when i cross for example q the quaternion with itself i do not get just a zero vector the vector part still goes to the zero vector resulting but now i have suddenly the emergence of a scalar part which did not go away and the scalar part it turns out is in fact a function of the vectors that entered into the interaction notice on the bottom line that the cross product now is the square of the amplitude of one of the vectors that&#x27;s the urgency or the energy of the urgency of one vector on the other stress wise and i&#x27;ve retained the zero vector because now we have to learn to read that exactly which is what heavy side did not do what this equation says and says very rigorously is this if these are two electromagnetic vectors or quaternions we started with suppose they are the e fields and the two e fields for example the two e vectors are identical and we have an operation that&#x27;s making the cross product suppose that&#x27;s what&#x27;s actually going on what the bottom equation rigorously says is electromagnetically you have a zero vector resultant with the system of two vectors still inside the zero vector system and still acting producing the action a squared now a squared is proportional to the energy of one of the vectors the amplitude energy the urgency so to speak energetic urgency of one vector on the other so we&#x27;ve captured a form of stress now suppose for example we&#x27;re instead of dealing with static vectors we&#x27;re dealing with actual sine waves again our q cross q is going to be a squared plus the zero vector result in the electromagnetically i&#x27;ve got to say all that because i must not throw the zero vector away it&#x27;s a real thing it&#x27;s a vacuum engine as a matter of fact it is not a zero except electromagnetically but it&#x27;s doing something else in the vacuum suppose q is of the form q is equal to a sine omega t standard kind of wave simple sine wave type entity then q cross q will give you a squared sine squared omega t plus this zero vector how do you read that the way you read that equation rigorously you don&#x27;t throw the zero vector away it&#x27;s telling you something it says i have a zero vector electromagnetic system whose active internal structure is giving me a scalar wave a squared sine squared omega t that&#x27;s precisely what that equation says now when you threw away the quaternion heart you threw away the scalar wave and notice that in the scalar wave the energy which is proportional to the a squared is rhythmically barrier if the energy density of the local vacuum where this action is occurring is rhythmically varied then rigorously that is the definition of a local gravitational wave and there is your precise definition or derivation of skater electromagnetics i will say one thing in passing and go on without further explanation because it takes a long time to explain it that particular wave the sine squared wave scale away is most useful indeed in electromagnetic healing it has the unique characteristic if you will break that wave out and look at it on your little graph plots it has a most unique characteristic that almost no other wave has a very weak wave of that exact configuration will instantly spread throughout the whole body through the bone cells through the marrow cells everywhere it won&#x27;t miss a single thing [Music] okay let&#x27;s take a look now for we&#x27;re not going to get too technical here i just want to give you the concepts and the ideas and the mathematics we can all manipulate later actually i&#x27;m not the only person in this room who&#x27;s working in this area by far i&#x27;d particularly like to mention the work the very important work of dr henry monty who as far as i know independently discovered the same thing because on the telephone conversation he was telling me about it and i was telling him about it at exactly the same time and dr monteith has already gone much further than we&#x27;ll go into tonight on the mathematics of the whole area i expect probably that the full theory of stable electromagnetics will probably eventually be written by dr henry monty now what can you do with an electron well you can push the thing straight away you produce a field that will do that that&#x27;s what we call an e field you translate the electron straight away or the charge that&#x27;s the definition of a knee field another thing you can do is you can produce a field which will cause the electron to interact with it and swirl around in a little swirl that is technically what we call the magnetic field the b field there&#x27;s one other thing you can do suppose you do not move the electron at all but you have a zero vector electromagnetic system remember now i&#x27;ve got to say some extra words i can&#x27;t just throw away the zero vector i&#x27;ve got to go after the gravity that&#x27;s left when it&#x27;s there if i have a zero vector electromagnetic system it&#x27;s a stress system as i show on the bottom diagram is suppose all of those vectors are rhythmically varying like a sine squared or a sine wave i have then a scalar wave and all that it does it squeezes the electron can we not easily imagine taking a rubber ball between the outstretched fingers of both hands and rhythmically squeezing it and relaxing squeezing and relaxing that is a scalar wave specifically it does not translate the particle neither does it swirl the particle it merely squeezes it so it does not give you an electron wiggle and electron wiggle detectors will not detect it because they detect translation fields e fields or swirl fields b fields they do not detect squeeze waves as a matter of fact that squeeze squeeze wave doesn&#x27;t do much to the electrons in the shells and orbits around an atom it goes through and is absorbed and interacts with the nucleus as we&#x27;ll see later to show you that indeed maxwell knew that he had captured the stress the medium now remember he wrote a theory based on a mechanical ether the ether was a thin material [Music] thin ethereal material in his model so when he says a stress in the medium he means a stress in the ether and he knew about that and here&#x27;s a direct quote which you can read from the chart directly from maxwell himself here is the finish of the quote again directly from james clerk maxwell so maxwell himself realized that he had also captured the local stress of the medium in his full theory what is really pathetic is they didn&#x27;t realize that&#x27;s what gravity was so maxwell had written what really was a unified field theory of electromagnetism and gravitation in quaternions because he had captured the stress or the squeeze wave in the local vacuum the fluctuation or the variation controlled variation in the local energy density of the vacuum heavy side later on in fact after maxwell&#x27;s death was one of the two men that finished what today we call vector analysis it is adding gibbs now heavyside&#x27;s solution to the formidable and teeth gnashing problem of calculation with quaternions said the real problem is you mix in apples and oranges and so what we got to do is get rid of the steeler component and he just sawed it off and threw it away one single human being oliver heavyside did that nobody else not a team of scientists not a board of peer review one guy remember there are very few scientists this time probably there were some 30 or 40 scientists in the world in the western world struggling with electromagnetics at the time that&#x27;s about all you had not many there was a short debate then remember maxwell is long dead though quaternionness we&#x27;re pointing out that you have not captured the complete theory and the vectors were saying yeah but boy can we calculate we can out calculate you all day long now this is simple it&#x27;s easy to understand we got it in a short debate most of the action occurred in the journal nature they simply buried the quaternioness that&#x27;s all there was to it and by 1900 you couldn&#x27;t even find cartonian theory being taught anymore everything was now heavy sized version of electromagnetic theory now what happens when you throw out the squeeze way when you throw out the scalar compound of the quaternion you throw out the component that caught the interaction and interplay between electromagnetics and gravity now this caused albert einstein to make a most serious and grave restriction and today we would call it an error on general relativity because einstein studied oliver heavyside&#x27;s version of electromagnetic theory and in that theory you do not and cannot have electromagnetic curvature of space time let&#x27;s reason together ladies and gentlemen let&#x27;s make this as simple as possible what does a normal garden-variety heavy-side electromagnetic wave new it gets the hell out of there at the speed of light it does not stay around and oscillate the energy density of vacuum blip and it&#x27;s gone it&#x27;s the fastest thing in the universe it&#x27;s a material type thing but what does a squeeze wave doing which is sitting in position and squeezing it sits there and it oscillates the energy density of the local vacuum the gravitational wave is what it is it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere it doesn&#x27;t take off with the speed of light it&#x27;s sitting in place it&#x27;s all locked together as a single system with a zero vector translation or get the hell out of their result so einstein then not knowing any way that you can curve electromagnetic curves local space time electromagnetically and by the way all curvature space time means that&#x27;s a simple thing imagine that space is filled with little fantastically dense and intense spray all the time called a virtual particle flux the only problem is each little particle doesn&#x27;t stay around it&#x27;s instantly borne almost instantly dies so it&#x27;s like a gas that&#x27;s continually each particle being continually created and annihilated so it&#x27;s a crazy kind of gas flux that we&#x27;re looking at that&#x27;s really the modern view of the vacuum and all we&#x27;re talking about is the intensity of that flux is oscillating that&#x27;s all we&#x27;re talking about only we polarize the entire pattern of it we can put patterns in it that&#x27;s what the stress wave but the scalarium wave is einstein then said the only other thing left to curve local space-time is this very weak gravitational force which is some 10 to the minus 42 times weaker down in the grass from where the force the electromagnetic force field the electric field is between two electrons now that&#x27;s very weak 10 to the minus 42 is a very small fraction you can&#x27;t find that you can&#x27;t even measure with normal instruments with except great with great difficulty so he reasoned then that that&#x27;s so far down in the grass you&#x27;re never going to be able to measure any kind of local space-time curvature from that from the electrical stuff going on he also reasoned that such a thing that you could measure could only result from a huge collection of mass like the sun of a great star or something like that well the laboratory and the instruments and the observer and the is not going to be sitting on the surface of the sun it&#x27;s a little bit hot so he said therefore where you the local observer is where the lab is where the instruments are there will be no local curvature or space time so he assumed because of that at the local space time is never curved now all you energy buffs clean out your ears and open them up wake up and listen when you make that assumption the local space time is never curved it gives you a lawrence frame all that nonsense you now save and cause to be applied rigorously every conservation law in that system you cannot escape the conservation of energy you&#x27;re not going to get any energy from space time it&#x27;s all going to run right back in there that you get out of there you&#x27;re going to lose it so forget any kind of a free energy device where you&#x27;re trying to build a paddle wheel in a special river as long as that assumption of einstein holds now if you were to curve local space time the russians have long since removed that restriction from general relativity that they teach in the western world you can&#x27;t get such a paper published in western literature many good physicists have tried if you curve local space time and this is absolutely rigorous russian work check the leading generals and the leading academicians oh i hope you heard that word all conservation laws go out the window there are no irrevocable conservation laws when you have local curvature space time and that&#x27;s the thing the condition that oliver heavyside threw out of james clerk maxwell&#x27;s original theory he threw out the baby with the bath water but he made it a hell of a lot easier to calculate and understand so people began to understand it began to be able to calculate v8 began to build instruments and make great advances but meanwhile we had a severely crippling assumption made for good reason by albert einstein on general relativity and the irony of all ironies for the rest of his life einstein was in a vain and desperate search trying to find out how in the world to get electromagnetics back in there and he never succeeded not realizing that that little bitty assumption meant you could never do it if he had changed that one single assumption he had it all and if he had studied maxwell&#x27;s original quaternion theory he would probably have not made the assumption and you would be flying any gravity spaceships all over the solar system since about 1904 [Music] okay we have a new breed of cat now the scalar em wave it&#x27;s rigorous you can mathematically derive it you can try it out on that bench and it works but it works quite different from normal electromagnetic waves so all you electrical boys you got to remember now you got to learn some new phenomenology they didn&#x27;t teach you this one in electrical engineering and if you look at circuits that work this way and you insist you&#x27;re going to look at them with electrical engineering eyes you&#x27;re going to go home thinking that that can&#x27;t possibly work and it&#x27;s all nonsense and you will never never be able to build such circuitry in such devices you&#x27;ve got to learn to think in a different manner the first place this wave goes right straight through the electron shell goes down the nucleus well we&#x27;re going to tamper with something very fundamental here let&#x27;s ask a very fundamental question what is this physical reality around us how is it made everything is made from potentials according to quantum mechanics the most modern theory my operators forget your force fields your e-field and your b field that secondary jump that comes after the operator works on the potential the potentials of gravitational fields gravitational potential all potentials are but this normal thing you studied as the normal electromagnetic wave equilibrium in the b field component normally reacts with the electron shells of atoms with negative charges why because all the atoms got the electrical charges negative around them in their electron shells the whole world is built that way now the electron shells can go bananas a lot of interaction the average nucleus is several hundred thousand times more massive than one electron which interacts with one photon so the big old nucleus just sort of shakes a little bit in most cases and that&#x27;s it so large assemblies of nuclei of atoms normally very stable in this first order reality stuff physical reality as you normally see it you&#x27;re looking with electron wiggle detectors from your physical system and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeing proton interaction with electron shells of atoms and so the world is very stable and all of the people first start off thinking that become materialists they think everything material is real and that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s ultimate reality and a lot of them are willing to kill you under certain dogmatic systems to enforce that belief and nothing could be further from the truth that is a first order truth but it is not ultimate truth this thing is real but it&#x27;s not ultimately the only reality if you go down into the nucleus now and you really hit the nucleus if the nucleus moves everything goes bananas and the stable order that you observe around you goes right out the window and when you go in with the scalar waves that&#x27;s the kind of reality you&#x27;re looking at okay let&#x27;s talk about the flow of time because we&#x27;re going to tamper with that too told you this part gets a little complicated but i&#x27;m gonna try to show you before you get out of here how to think about a time reverse wave and how to use it and how to make it work for you and do magic now a photon comes in and interacts with a negative charge and that and then the charge goes into excited state going around the atom and then drops back and decays and emits a proton that process a proton absorption and emission re-emission from the excited state of a negative charge in an atom is what we call the policy flow of time now let&#x27;s be rigorous here we&#x27;re saying that the flow of time in this universe occurs bit by bit at a fantastically high rate one near piece at a time delta t is not always the same size it is discrete but it is not the same size so watch your words you got to think very carefully pronouns do not exist not as being one simple value it&#x27;s discrete but is quite variable as we&#x27;ll find later if that same proton interacts with a positive charge we already know in physics that if you invert the charge you invert time that may surprise you but it&#x27;s well known in physics that is not tom bearden and so it gives you a little piece of negative time hey wait a minute we got a problem here they used a theorem in particle physics they found out that charge is not conserved broken symmetry parity is not conserved time itself is not conserved but it seems that the three the product of the three all three cannot be violated at one time that&#x27;s the best shot we got at it today in vertical physics that&#x27;s where they&#x27;re at but you can violate any two or one let me say that again you don&#x27;t have to conserve charge the contrary argument is but it&#x27;s a little effect you say yeah baby it&#x27;s a little white crow but maybe he&#x27;ll grow if i can have little white crows and i can collect them and grow them i&#x27;ll have big white clothes in the maker world so charge parity time if you inverse the thing you might get something different was a matter of fact the anti-photon which has been assumed to be the same as a photon that is a fast assumption in physics and i&#x27;ll show you that in just a moment well we&#x27;ve already said we go into the nucleus with scalar waves and we&#x27;ll have a higher order reality when we do that why first place we&#x27;re interacting with a negative a positive charge the nucleus of an atom is already time inverted did they forget to tell you that in your electrical class yeah because they didn&#x27;t know that but it&#x27;s true and modern physics substantiates it and we&#x27;re going to find out that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to get time reverse waves a little later on that we can use to do all sorts of magic things at this point then if you go into the nucleus although i showed here on this diagram little balls all clustered together modern physics tells us that&#x27;s not the way the nucleus is built at all it&#x27;s a vast boiling smear there&#x27;s not a proton there&#x27;s not a neutron all that mess in it at all if you go in there and you catch one and you gradually catch all the wiggling fish and bring them out that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll find on the average after you stop the fish but before you stop them they&#x27;re waves they are not particles they&#x27;re all mixed up as a big mess so you can&#x27;t separate them it&#x27;s a boiling mess in fact it&#x27;s a trapped local potential which means it&#x27;s gravitational that&#x27;s what mass is that&#x27;s modern physics not tom bearden but now if i can go in and have a wave absorbed directly in that the scale wave i just either increase or i can decrease depending on how i bias that potential wave that i send in there and i can raise that potential lord at will as a matter of fact if i keep radiating it and absorb in there it&#x27;ll keep building up it charges up just like a capacitor only now it&#x27;ll charge either positive or negative and i&#x27;m giving you laboratory results it acts as a capacitance for scalar waves now when something else comes in there and hits it another way it&#x27;ll trigger the thing it&#x27;ll collapse and i&#x27;ll come another wave out of the nucleus it&#x27;ll be a time reverse wave and all the nuclei in the universe are continually exchanging scalar waves i don&#x27;t have time to go into this aspect but i will say with the fourth law of logic which i built many years ago proved i published a proof for it so i don&#x27;t have to worry about can it be proved i can demonstrate it in less than 10 seconds the fourth law of logic tells us ultimately you can only model a thing in terms of its direct opposite is not geometry the modeling of the presence of mass in terms of the absence of mass you see my point in this case we&#x27;re going to have to learn a little bit of that in our modeling theory and we&#x27;ll go into that in just a moment but when we go into the nucleus now in this boiling mess and we can actually adjust the potential we can even put patterns remember we put fingers structure inside this scalar way it&#x27;s got a structure we can build any kind of zero system different systems and patterns and polarizations inside there in the virtual state of vacuum that we wish to we can go into that nucleus and it&#x27;s boiling away it&#x27;s just like a cathode you put a little signal in there you put a matrix that thing will organize you know about cricket gene you know about self-organizations of highly non-linear systems far from thermal nuclear uh thermal equilibrium that thing is as far as you can get from thermal equilibrium so a violent exchange with the vacuum itself virtual particle exchange it&#x27;s a fricative system first class and that thing will self-organize according to the pattern you put in it i&#x27;ve just told you how to do transmutation of elements between isomers is very simple a man was nominated for the nobel prize curve in 1977 for proving conclusively the living systems with microvolts in transmute elements to a limited extent chickens do it we do it barley rye wheat everything does it a little bit the average biologist still hasn&#x27;t heard of that and doesn&#x27;t believe it when you tell it but it is a fact and it was replicated and that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done the living system can generate and has these electro gravitational waves these squeeze waves the scalar em wave the part that heavy side left out living systems have generated since the beginning of time it&#x27;s very weak as far as power goes but if you keep right on point in the nucleus you can change the nucleus the nucleus will order and change and charge up with that pattern that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done and it&#x27;s fairly simple to be done between our isomers of the elements of the isotopes general relativity inclusive klein geometry now apply because when you go into the nucleus you&#x27;ve moved into higher dimensions how many as many as you wish but you&#x27;ve got to have at least five dimensions to capture a unified field theory of gravity and electromagnetics now when heavyside threw out the scalar component before 1900 it meant that somebody could come along now for special relativity and put it in four dimensions but did he have electromagnetics in there nah no you can&#x27;t really fit electromagnetics correctly and have gravity in there too in four dimensions if you have a four dimensional theory of electromagnetics you ain&#x27;t got gravity if you&#x27;ve got gravity in there you ain&#x27;t got electromagnetics it won&#x27;t fit but if you&#x27;ll add one fifth dimension which colusa did in 1920s you can unify again electromagnetics and gravity this paper was published on the recommendation of albert einstein so now we must have collusicline at least five-dimensional geometry by the way collusion showed that where the extra dimension went you could model it wrapped around each point in our three-space now in that model electromagnetic waves do not travel through three spaces rigorously they slither around the little surfaces around every point in three space along their direction of travel that&#x27;s a quite important distinction if they penetrate the point that&#x27;s gravity if they slip and slither around it in the fifth dimension that&#x27;s electromagnetics and that&#x27;s collusive crime theory not tom beard they just don&#x27;t make it quite that simple and clear what do we got here yes we got a space now in the past i&#x27;ve given you a piece of information because i didn&#x27;t want you to hurt yourself i gave you spatial opposition of positive energy positive time waves and those are very weak you get very weak gravitational effects and very weak inertial effects you won&#x27;t kill anybody with that you won&#x27;t kill yourself but this one is powerful specifically it can be nine times ten to the sixteen times it&#x27;s powerful you make a time reversed wave which we&#x27;re going to go into with a full explanation here you&#x27;re going to get the full treatment tonight i&#x27;m not going to cut it short if you get tired just go if you want to get it stay because i&#x27;m going to make it real simple but if you take a normal wave which i&#x27;ve shown this little sine wave here one oscillation and you make its time reversed or time reversed replica it&#x27;s exactly like it in space it fits exactly with it spatially but the time dimension is reversed now the stress of those two ways that they&#x27;re locked together is totally on time dimension that&#x27;s a highly compacted space dimension and you get one going up one coming back so you get a c squared type factor out of this thing that gravitational wave and that&#x27;s what it is that scalar wave can be up to nine times ten to the sixteenth times as strong as the one i&#x27;ve told you about in the past and this is the one you do if you want to do any gravity you got your ears open you&#x27;re listening all you have to do to do any gravity all you want in any university laboratory in this country is make a pumped phase conjugate mirror at 100 to 400 hertz let me say that again and i&#x27;m not going to answer any questions on it all you have to do if you want to make all the anti-gravity you wish to make and any university laboratory in this country can do it it&#x27;s simple it doesn&#x27;t take much power is make a pumped phase conjugate mirror between 100 and 400 hertz enough said okay a photon is a piece of energy and a piece of time welded together no seam in the middle it&#x27;s a piece of what we call action which has the dimensions of angular momentum we usually show that as planck&#x27;s constant h ah h is always positive you&#x27;ve got to have something called a brick call action but the brick can be made two ways and still be positive you can make it with a piece of positive energy and a piece of positive time you&#x27;re well together and the product is still positive you can make it with negative energy and negative time and is still positive now the first one is a photon and that&#x27;s something that comes off of interaction with a negative charge and it&#x27;ll give you positive time interaction as it continues it&#x27;ll also give you entropy because that will tend to more and more disorder and the law of entropy the second law of thermodynamics ruthlessly applies now what&#x27;s the assumption in that law your professor never told you it had assumption because you didn&#x27;t know it the assumption is it&#x27;s only for positive time critters it does not apply to negative time recruiters the negative of the law applies for negative time critters it backs up instead of tending to more and more disorder it tends back to order so don&#x27;t you worry about the universe running down it&#x27;s running back up to order just as fast as it runs down to disorder but in negative time but the internal part of every atom is already filled with time reversed critters now the energy of an atom of a photon rather is equal h nu we&#x27;re new is the frequency let&#x27;s reason together here why did i say we got plenty of people making pump phase conjugate mirrors and these guys don&#x27;t ever see any gravity why i just told you you can do it that way am i full or did they miss something if you understand that equation is it not true if h retains a fixed size it can&#x27;t vary in size if i have a big delta e i&#x27;m gonna have a little delta t magnitude of if negative delta e is big in magnitude then negative delta t is small in magnitude they are canonical variables well if you&#x27;ve got high frequency by the bottom formula you&#x27;ve got lots of energy in a photon you&#x27;ve got very little time change in it so high energy photons high frequency photons are not going to have very much negative times even when they&#x27;re anti-photons they&#x27;ll have very little and anti-gravity depends on negative time let&#x27;s reason together if in positive time the assumption in newton&#x27;s crazily low gravitational law attraction of mass what&#x27;s the assumption positive time anybody ever tell you that no because they never thought of it but if you reverse the time do you not back up the situation does now mass not repel and we have just told you you can go into the nucleus and start charging the nucleus with the pattern including negative time we&#x27;ve just told you that you had to lose use low frequency why because you want a big delta t you don&#x27;t want a big delta e delta e it gets in your way ties you up so the optics board never see this that is so far in the grass can you measure it where they&#x27;re at they never thought about doing it at 400 hertz you go home and try it in your laboratory and then sit on the side laughing for the next two three hours and how silly we all been for years and how easy it is to do it i will tell you if you pursue that you can take a flashlight battery and levitate a battleship and i will not discuss that further because then you&#x27;re going to ask me about the philadelphia experiment i&#x27;m going to tell you i don&#x27;t know anything about that that&#x27;s my god lie a little bit unfortunately okay as delta e goes up delta t goes down the magnitude the absolute value we&#x27;re going to be interested when we talk about gravitational inertial effects things like that we&#x27;re going to be interested in big pieces of negative time low frequency photon away from the optics boys they&#x27;re in the wrong regime they&#x27;re doing good work but in the wrong regime let&#x27;s see then what happened further with some of this well comes along the greatest electrical genius of all time nikola tesla what does tesla do he discovers the scalar em wave he called it his standing karma weight let&#x27;s run that bar again standing columnar wave does it make sense now a squeeze wave which stands in place he discovered that out in colorado springs before 1900 he has such a rapid progression of his understanding of this and his developmental material he also discussed time reversal we&#x27;ll get into that later he found that out he started building on long island a situation to power the whole world and tonight i&#x27;m going to explain to you precisely and exactly how that works and i&#x27;m going to tell you there&#x27;s a thousand papers in the literature that prove the fundamental mechanism works and if you believe you can get that mechanism in the earth then you have just shown that it will work well barack put in time reversal he didn&#x27;t predict the positron he predicted he predicted a time reversed electron and lo and behold they looked around and they discovered the critter so all of a sudden we had time reversal in physics only we reversed the whole particle nobody&#x27;s doing the photon now because they say well timer reverse protagonist wiggle this way or wiggle back that way still looks like a sandwich same thing and they missed it right there colusa klein theory came along in the 20s after general relativity had come along we talked about gravity and anti-gravity were worked out based on only the attraction of mass electromagnetics is left out that&#x27;s the missing ingredient everybody&#x27;s hunting for how to get it back in einstein failed and his vigorous search for it the rest of his life and the reason was they didn&#x27;t worry about negative energy and they didn&#x27;t worry about negative time how many physicists have wondered about the second law of thermodynamics and not a damn one of them has realized that it assumes positive time only does not assume negative time time reversed critters well a magic thing happened in world war ii now we&#x27;re going to tell you some of the rest of the story that we haven&#x27;t told you before in world war ii a funny thing happened radar came into being and everybody&#x27;s using radar like mad the german wolf packs were murdering the ships we put a radar in an airplane we found out you could track the periscope when the u-boat came stuck his eyes up to luke when he put his snorkel up to breathe you could track his snorkel and all of a sudden we had a hunter killer team and we were bombing the living hell out of those u-boats and the pride of the german navy went to the bottom and when the mark went by they didn&#x27;t sink a single ship and they lost a hell of a lot of u-boats because every time he looked boom come greetings on his head in an absolute panic the germans placed the finest brains and they had the finest brains in those days in europe the finest mathematicians and the finest physicists in the finest brains on that problem they originated what today is really called rigorous radar cross-section theory radar absorbing material the advanced radar cross section which is the heart of modern radar theory and countermeasure theory further according to some real radar expert friends of mine than we are today just a little further than we are today in the u.s and at the end of the war that entire team went to the soviet union again let us reason together what do you do they coded by the way their snorkels with the ram material and they coded their periscopes and their opponent they didn&#x27;t get any reflection back and so we couldn&#x27;t track them again they went right back to shooting down our torpedoes and ships okay let&#x27;s reason together again what do you do with the radar absorbing material it&#x27;s in the open literature you do something like carbon doped with various materials and what you do is you slow the wave down you can get at least a whole wavelength of the correct portion of the wavelength in there and what you do reflect back and get it out of phase cancel make make that zero vector right electromagnetic zero vector you don&#x27;t have no electromagnetic reflection they don&#x27;t wonder about it or try to detect it or have any detector if it&#x27;s a gravitational reflection so it disappears off your radar still sitting there still absorbing the energy now you will find out later that when we absorb two waves in a non-linear material 180 degrees out of phase that&#x27;s called a pump wave and that&#x27;s the first thing you do to get to start to make amplified phase conjugate waves you start to get anomalies when you radiate with another wave bang you get this big amplified response boom comes out of the material why where the devil did that come from not supposed to be there at all by electromagnetic theory when you radiate such a material with multiple beams you have what today is called pump phase conjugate four wave mixing and you get amplification of the tickling wave and you get high amplification of it and you get it with a time reverse wave as we&#x27;ll find out later i&#x27;ll show you how it works so the anomalies were there now in in huntsville alabama we have the head of the rocket team retired dr longgate dr elongate new those members of the german radar team and he has confirmed they had anomalies but after all these years he doesn&#x27;t remember what it was he had his hands full of big rockets we got the rocket team you see but it says that the russians had those kind of anomalies that led the pumped four wave amplification of crime reversed waves in radar at the end of world war ii and by 1950 they built in operational radars they&#x27;ve got the finest mathematicians who always had the finest non-linear mathematicians on it and they started that whole weapon system in radar by 1950 and they got it from the german radar team they did not start it in nonlinear optics now we were not clever enough or smart enough to discover the time reversed electromagnetic wave after developing all the formidable weapons i&#x27;ve talked to you in the past about around 1969 to 70 or so the russians cautiously released this stuff a paper showing the time reversed wave in the optical frequency why why any optical frequency they didn&#x27;t want you to get any gravity hell if they released it at 400 hertz you had any gravity already so you want you to have that stay away from that we&#x27;re up there where he doesn&#x27;t harm anything gravitationally and see if we know about it we showed we didn&#x27;t nobody reacted so they sent a couple scientists down the lawrence livermore laboratory and briefed them on it in 1972 this is time reverse wage and our guys with great alacrity said ah me thinks there&#x27;s something here i&#x27;ve been hit over the head with a brick bat so they started vigorously working it in my linear optics it&#x27;s a general solution to the wave equation now we haven&#x27;t got the foggiest notion today what generates the time reverse wave but boy do we know how to write the equation we take the wave equation write an asterisk in one term that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s all of it it writes a time reverse wave so we think we understand it we write the equation we solve the equation ain&#x27;t got the foggiest notion what causes it to be born but if it is it&#x27;ll follow that equation that&#x27;s where we are today we&#x27;re going to go further than that because you need stator electromagnetics to go further a couple of more technical things then we&#x27;ll get into fun cartoons world change is composed of action two canonical variables energy times time we just want to refresh your mind here and we can have either negative or positive now i want to show you how it works in pollution theory collusion theory everything comes in five dimensions the potential is really in five dimensions but this little surface around every point in our space time as you shrink to a point does not the surface area vastly increase in that the law the surface area around the volume increases the smaller the thing gets by the time you get down to a point you&#x27;ve got a real humongous surface area for electromagnetics to slip around and not have to penetrate the point so everything escapes electromagnetically real easy slips around a fifth dimension never penetration never makes gravity so electron gets it and boogies out of there so most of the five dimensions is normally bled off on the left as fast as you form the potential which is a five dimensional pressure so to speak zip boom is found in the fifth dimension electromagnetics that&#x27;s all there is to that so if you can force it to go into the 4dg field you got to first block this terrible escape for example between two electrons only 10 to the minus 42 of it gets out it&#x27;s gravitational actually penetrates the point but if you could knock that out on the left and force a lot more of it to go over there into the actual three space that&#x27;s in our 4d menkowski space then you get lots more gravity lots more inertial feel that&#x27;s all you got to do to build this inertial field generator but you got to block the end field how are you going to do that well do it real simple normally it goes boom out there&#x27;s electromagnetics not much left to grab your little bitty tiny hiss over on the side to make it kitty cartoon but impress the point but if you block the escape as electromagnetics block the big door you&#x27;ll get a big boom out over there and you&#x27;ll get lots of inertia and lots of gravity and you can engineer that on the bench at real the great cosmic engines of the universe operate inside vector electromagnetic vector zeros that&#x27;s where the gravitation is gravitation is unfolded electromagnetic forces locked together with a zero e field and b field resultants electromagnetics is the out folding of the locked in electromagnetic stress of the right that&#x27;s all it is by the way that&#x27;s rigorously in agreement with modern physics except we can have a structure to it whereas they normally have it as a random structure they don&#x27;t use the fact that you can deliberately do it because why side call them the throwaway the zero electromagnetic vector resultant because you&#x27;ve thrown away the gravity with that system okay to get distance effects we all know how to put photons through there and hit something out there the distance so here it will matter but the best way to do it is to do it with potentials not with force fields and photons and matter mass potentials potentials were thought to be mathematical figments until quantum mechanics prove they are the real things and it&#x27;s the electromagnetics that&#x27;s a derivative and interference is what gives you everything in the potentials that&#x27;s the magic first you have to make potentials if you make these the zero vector electromagnetic systems are artificial potentials they have an internal structure of stress that they have no gradient they are not flowing out with a translation vector or soil vector if you interfere two of those at the distance you recreate electromagnetic energy depending on how you bias the beams you create the thing higher than the normal energy so energy flows out of that interference zone if you bias it lower it&#x27;ll create energy lower sort of suck energy out of there by the way come right back down the beams back in your transmitter you better dump it somewhere but let&#x27;s look at some characteristics now of time reversed ways because here&#x27;s where the real magic is this is the magic we&#x27;ve been looking for regarded first like the non-linear optics boys if you have a piece of plastic that&#x27;s non-linear hunk of junk 10 cent piece and coming in from the left over here is the dotted line away front that i show is e1 it comes in and it strikes this non-linear medium and it travels on through it and it starts break getting distorted as it goes through the wavefront starts getting distorted because it&#x27;s a non-linear distorting medium it comes out the other side and you see it&#x27;s now all wiggly and distorted but another magic thing happens which we didn&#x27;t know we had to discover it from soviet literature and then they had to kick us in the ankles to get our attention to make us realize what they said then we went to work on it the medium also generates a second wave that&#x27;s a time reversed wave e2 that now appears spatially in phase everywhere that other wave appears forward backwards everywhere else it&#x27;s normally a very weak thing we&#x27;ll find out you can amplify it real easy but it is totally in exactly and precisely in phase it has an invisible trace of where this other wave came from and where it&#x27;s going in it boogies out of there to appear right in that exact same place in space but in time it&#x27;s reversed it&#x27;s a stress in time the two together will form a real good gravitational wave if they&#x27;re equal spatially they don&#x27;t know that in optics because at the wrong frequency they never see the gravity aspects they don&#x27;t have it in optics this is a quote right out of a standard textbook that says the same thing the diagram said and i won&#x27;t bother to let you read the thing it&#x27;s it says exactly the same only very technical okay let&#x27;s amplify the thing we take our same piece of plastic material hunk of junk we&#x27;ll put in a wave a2 and a wave a1 normal nice garden variety electromagnetic waves nice little sine wave let&#x27;s play that but we put them in so we&#x27;re in the medium at 180 degrees that sounded like that ram material didn&#x27;t it only now i&#x27;m working at optics just wanted to point it out and passing and so now in the medium what do we have it is it not a non-linear medium all the electrical engineers is that not a modulator let&#x27;s hear it yes it locks the two waves together they don&#x27;t just mix and run through one another they become one system you got to have a zero vector locked in modulated system not mixed waves mixing don&#x27;t do it it&#x27;s got to be modulated it&#x27;s got to be a non-linear medium okay waves a1 and a2 spatially 180 out of phase now do they not lock together and form a zero vector resultant e field and b field yes they do is that now they stay away now you can argue a little bit if you want to about what happens to magnetic field if that bothers you so it&#x27;s going to shift 90 degrees forget it just stay with the e field the point is you can make a scalar wave and it will go now into the nucleus and they call the combination of those two waves the pump wave and what are you pumping the nuclei of the atoms in the material what are you doing to the nuclei of the atoms in the tube you&#x27;re charging them up to a higher or lower potential than the excited state as the case may be it doesn&#x27;t matter and here you go and then suppose you come in here with a little weak a4 wave these are the numbers that they use a1 and a2 is a pump a4 is the input this thing operates like a trial a1 and a2 to pump wave makes the nucleus a cathode a3 a4 goes in on the grid a3 comes out as if it were a signal coming off the plate and you can have all the energy in a3 that you up to what you&#x27;ve got in a1 and a2 and a3 is time reversed which means what it means wherever a4 came from in the universe out there from some distant point this thing has a memory and it takes off booking through space precisely fitting the path that a4 took all the way back to that point be at six feet in the laboratory be it six thousand miles away or six hundred thousand miles in the perfect case if that&#x27;s an over the horizon radar signal a3 boogies back up to where it bounced off the ionosphere boogies on back over to where we tracked a rising rocket like the delta rocket in 86. if i am popping the pulse because i put 100 megawatts get whatever you want to in a1 and a2 in the pump wave i can get out up to a 100 megawatts in wave a3 do you see that everybody understand that boom out comes 100 megawatts in a3 in the oscillation condition a3 100 megawatts now backs up it does spatially the exact thing different from a normal wave it converges along its trail not diverges all [Music] of the power goes right back the trail right into the missile if it&#x27;s slowly rising and if you&#x27;re 150 feet over to the side of the missile you won&#x27;t see anything you&#x27;ll think it originated inside the missile and so the delta rocket died with two mysterious surges of power in it they cut the damn booster off and they had to destroy it that&#x27;s exactly what destroyed it right there we&#x27;ll talk about some other things later now do you see that this thing is useful for weapons if you understand time reverse waves and phase conjugation you can design yourself every weapon i have in fairy lance and the words phase conjugation do not appear in the book by design not by accident and i can&#x27;t tell you how many times i&#x27;ve been beaten up verbally and abused by physicists and engineers who didn&#x27;t know what the hell they were talking about and they didn&#x27;t have the foggiest uh understanding of time reversed wave now let&#x27;s lay one issue to rest the average physicist who knows about this in the face of a thousand papers already approving this experimentally and everything else theoretically does not believe it&#x27;s a time reversed way even though we&#x27;ve described the characteristics all well it&#x27;s a wave reversal we prefer to say you can&#x27;t go backwards in time you can&#x27;t go into the past immediately he revealed his ignorance let&#x27;s reason together i said this wave was time reversed did i say that every single particle of mass in the whole cotton picking universe was time reversed and backed up to a previous state of the universe which is what the past would be nobody said any such thing the theory doesn&#x27;t predict any such thing and if he thinks that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m saying he doesn&#x27;t understand time reversal and he doesn&#x27;t understand quantum mechanics and he doesn&#x27;t understand physics and he&#x27;s put a label around his own neck and on his own for it not me he has done it so much for los alamos and lawrence livermore yes indeed i have the papers i have friends who send me the copies of letters of the names they call them so much for los alamos and launch a little more laboratories now so we have a magic wave in the real world you have some change like in the ionosphere some distortion of the exact path itself the medium because there&#x27;s is a finite time involved and so you&#x27;ll miss a little bit maybe you get 90 or 80 percent of it in there that&#x27;s good enough for government work that&#x27;ll destroy the missile that&#x27;ll destroy a bomber running down takes it off down the runway before it ever takes off but this thing is magic because now i can make a time reverse wave i want to give you a way to visualize a time reverse wave and settle this issue of going back to the past i want you to imagine a movie of scenes going on here and in this scene somewhere amongst all the surroundings and all in buildings and all this there is a wave generated okay you&#x27;re watching this wave go your magic so you watch it real slow and you&#x27;re watching it go and suddenly we say now that wave and that wave only is reversed in time we can&#x27;t see time quantum mechanics tells us it&#x27;s not an observable you can&#x27;t detect it even in principle what we will see is the spatial aspect we will see it crawfish backwards especially we&#x27;ll see everything else continue so what would i physically see and observe i&#x27;d see the whole rest of the world going along in positive time i would see this crazy wave suddenly stopped where it&#x27;s time reversed and start to crawl fish backwards and crawl back right along its path meanwhile everything else is going on just like it was that&#x27;s all time reversal is think of it as space reversal but it carries negative energy and that&#x27;s magic as we found out because you can get inertia and gravity from that if you get down at the right frequency optically you&#x27;ll never get it radar you&#x27;ll never get it okay let&#x27;s continue to show you how strange a breed of cat this time reversed wave is i want to compare a normal mirror to a time reversed mirror the phase conjugate mirror they call it in the top when i show you a standard mirror on the right on a point source the light from it scatters across the surface of the mirror and has the standard diverging pattern reflection as i show that that&#x27;s it&#x27;s optical geometry everybody knows that normal reflection so if you&#x27;re doing that light scattering from the toe of your shoe across the mirror there&#x27;s one point where you get the right angle it comes to your eyes so you see your toe you can see your knee you can see your clothes and everything you stand there and look in the mirror and you&#x27;re quite happy with that let&#x27;s look at a face conjugate mirror the light from the source which may be the toe of your shoe scatters across the surface of the mirror from every point on the surface of the mirror it reflects right back to the original point it crawfishes backwards we&#x27;re going to believe that we&#x27;ll be right back to the point what could you see if you looked in such a mirror could you see your toe all that light goes back to your toe because you see your knee the only thing you could see would be the two black retinas of your eyes nothing else it&#x27;s a quite different breed of cat this is out of the standard literature by pepper that&#x27;s not tom beardy it&#x27;s a quite different breed of cat from an ordinary em wave and you must understand that it does not behave the same and i want to quote pepper on something else because i want to point out to you there&#x27;s a whole new physics here the whole new world peppa said the real and the major discoveries and face conjugation and time reverse waves are yet to be made so have at it young fellow there&#x27;s a hundred nobel prizes waiting on you any gravity free energy violation of all the conservation laws control of it overcoming space time moving in hyper dimensions materialization dematerialization transmutation of elements reversal of disease reversal of aging you name it it&#x27;s there the absolute control of physical reality you can go into the straightening your equation you can change the probabilities before they even occur and determine whether they shall emerge as physical reality or not the world is your apple for god&#x27;s sakes get in there and work okay what it is [Applause] what it is it&#x27;s a time reverse wave it carries negative time it carries negative energy they say it has a healing property it restores the order and that poor distortion crept in and then scientific american pepper publishes a beautiful picture absolute marvelous work showing phased conjugation of the distorted image of a cat and the thing backs up into a nice beautiful picture of the cat again no problem it does distortion correction it moves from disorder back to order it has negative entropy so much for the hopelessness of the second law of thermal they always assume positive time here&#x27;s a critter moves in negative time it&#x27;s time reversed and it takes care of the hopelessness of the second law and recreates hope for everybody now why the hell do you age you age because most of the stuff going on is positive energy waves you&#x27;ve got all those electron shells around your atoms if you could capture the delta in the spectrographic pattern there are spectrographic ways spectroscopic ways of doing this very detailed waveform analysis usually by digital synthesis not fourier synthesis built in impulse waves and use one more law here&#x27;s one from bearden it ain&#x27;t in your textbook please remember this because the previous speaker had an example of it looking at you if you take randomness like the virtual flux of vacuum and you impose upon that the structured potential the artificial potential the scalar em wave very technically it produces what today we call chaos technically i&#x27;m not using take chaos in the general sense i&#x27;m using chaos in the technical sense but that&#x27;s a science today but it blows ordinary signs and the chaotic the chaos patterns that she showed using one thousandth or one ten thousands second and then adding them what you were doing is getting back at the digital synthesis of what&#x27;s really there in the civil your body has been using that living systems has all the time that&#x27;s the way to go she&#x27;s right exactly on the track that&#x27;s exactly the way to go anyway you age because of your electron shells and your atoms but if you map the delta between the aging cells and the younger cells and if you time reverse that delta and if you radiate the body with that time reverse delta you will have a signal which will move the body gradually from age back to [Music] youth and say that again in case that went by you you capture the aging pattern that&#x27;s like the cosmos you have worked you time reverse that pattern you have the rejuvenation pattern and if you bathe the body and continually charge it up with that pattern it will gradually spread out through dr pop&#x27;s communication system and he discovered in the body the virtual state is scalar and you will rejuvenate the body if you capture the delta in a diseased cancer cell simply subtract the scalar pattern of the normal cell from the disease pattern and you&#x27;ll have the delta then if you reverse time reverse the delta you will now have the specific healing pattern for that specific illness in that specific body it was done it&#x27;s been proven it was called the priori machine in france mid to mid 60s to mid 70s and was ruthlessly suppressed because priority cured thousands of cases of terminal cancers and leukemias in lab animals done under rigorous auspices with some fine french scientists including robert courier head of the biology section and the perpetual secretary of the french academy the story of all of that is in my new book called aids biological warfare as is all of physics there&#x27;s a chapter called extraordinary physics covers all this mess and there&#x27;s a chapter called extraordinary biology covers all the biology please read that part of it because it lays a foundation for the electromagnetic healing of disease that&#x27;s the purpose of the book the subtitle used to be an electoral gravitation because almost half the book is on electro gravity okay you can do some other marvelous things now here&#x27;s the magic one if you make time reversed waves their characteristic was they do not diverge they converge they retain a laser-like beam well if you can make with standard practices a hologram and three feet in the laboratory by the way this does it in real time you don&#x27;t even have to make a hologram first with a couple of beams this is in the literature this is not tom beard they say very gently it&#x27;s distant independent distant independent distance independent sometimes we can talk we learned that last week uh i think pastor and i talk sometimes and that confuses the tongue but if it&#x27;s distance independent and if i can do it at three feet in the laboratory i can do it at 15 000 miles in the field with the radar and it&#x27;s so hard to build a state of radar that it just takes a plumbing section and the waveguide and the switch to throw and you get a scalar beam not a normal beam and if you interfere that two scalar beams and you&#x27;re responding you create a time reverse wave in each beam from two radars in response to some signal either passively received or reflected like from the over the horizon radar from a distant target you can put a six inch or three inch ball of light inside that target at fifteen thousand miles in the latter part of november shuttle launch at night was the third shuttle they tested these weapons against there is the strike of such an electromagnetic missile which i published the picture bob bladman took it in 30 lamps there is a ball of light hanging up which they used to switch from and shoot from a standard artillery technique shift from a registered point hanging up seen by hundreds of people photographed by george supreme i printed that photograph and it&#x27;s all in the book they offset it so they wouldn&#x27;t kill the shuttle now i&#x27;m going to tell you something else two weeks later we didn&#x27;t react didn&#x27;t know what was going on by the way 12 minutes after that shuttle got the humongous explosion over the site heard 600 miles up and down the coast made the local papers didn&#x27;t make the national news they don&#x27;t know what the hell is going on hundreds of engineers with a whole sky blowing up over their damn heads hurt for 600 miles said what is that and the standard thing was we don&#x27;t even recognize this stuff when it&#x27;s used over our own head now two weeks later i&#x27;m going to tell you another little story because i got a new piece of data for you the same over the rising radar called the woodpecker using time reversed wave real-time distance independent holography all those terms come out of the literature not tom bearden only they did it with radars first and they&#x27;re doing it today an arrow dc8 started down the runway again air force base movement jet engines on big high reflectivity nice signal to an over the rising radar you&#x27;ve got your micro micro watt tesla said i have an invisible wire started the interferometer interfered with the combustion of the engines as she&#x27;s taken off they then struck that airplane with an electromagnetic missile just like i told you about now let us reason together if they did do that the missile penetrated the airplane on one side went right straight through out the other side and it set fire to all of the inside at that point all plastics were violently and explosively set a flame that would have had to happen there is a hole in the right fuselage ahead of the engines it was not chemical explosion because they checked it for that no chemical residues and there&#x27;s another hole in it would come out yeah but you had to ignite the plastics if you had ignited the plastics you would have had a violent outflux of orange flame the windows would have been blowing orange out and that was seen with three eyewitnesses the interference would have been interfering with the combustion and one eyewitness that had passed directly over his head said the engines were laboring they did not develop full hour everybody knows it was ice it&#x27;s been validated that they checked the ice on top of the wing got back in the airplane before they left that&#x27;s false and here&#x27;s a clincher if the plastics were on fire the plastics out gas one of the products from those kinds of plastics is hydrogen cyanide and the people in that part of the plane would have had to breathe hydrogen cyanide and buy before the airplane sunk to the ground and crashed now here&#x27;s what the u.s government and the canadian government have withheld from you and they withheld from the board during the investigation which is a legal offense and criminal and they ought to be hauled into court and who&#x27;s responsible for it ought to be put in the penitentiary for conspiracy in a murder case now they did autopsies and all of the remains but about two there wasn&#x27;t enough left to do there and about one half of those people were dead of hydrogen cyanide before they hit the ground so we&#x27;ve got the picture of the strike of an electromagnetic missile two weeks earlier we&#x27;ve got the picture of the distant holography two weeks earlier we got the whole way to hit the airplane we got the orange glow from the fire we got the fire we got the hydrogen cyanide we got half the dead people the soviet union killed the damn airplane it&#x27;s a 99.9 certain conclusion let&#x27;s continue that&#x27;s the characteristics and let&#x27;s talk about tesla&#x27;s magnifying transmitter i want to show you quickly how it works but i want you to know this you know about nikola tesla everybody here knows about tesla we don&#x27;t have to talk about tesla through this audience ieee yes here no you know what he did you know what he was building on long island the famous magnifying transmitter take the earth treat it momentarily as an isotropic nonlinear medium hey non-linear baby remember that word it&#x27;s going to come back to homeless he was going to be putting in a signal in the earth he had a tremendous ground plane down there if you pop up and down like this you pump this way into the earth as well as popping up into the elevated capacities i mean every fool knows that right so yeah you got a signal going into the earth what happens to that well you believe newton&#x27;s third law right by the way we can derive that from this and i found out feynman thought of it first i was delighted i had one piece missing or what happened in the nucleus to my utter complete delight and wanted sorry to work that out beautifully and showed me last night much to my great appreciation so he filled in the missing piece that i couldn&#x27;t find out how to fill in henry already had it okay so we have a wave occurring in the earth you heard a vacuum up and all those good things that all gets generated and it gets generated out of phase it&#x27;s a time reversed wave that&#x27;s what causes newton&#x27;s third law i&#x27;ll tell you we can derive that i don&#x27;t have time to do it and what happens is we have then the scalar waves non-linear medium the back emf the probability of ml locked together is a zero vector system and that&#x27;s electrical gravitational you&#x27;ve got a stereo wave now spherical wave goes in the earth you now got the pump wave that&#x27;s the wave you put in the back emf lock together the single system you&#x27;ve got a pump phase conjugate spherical mirror earth do you see that at whatever frequency he was going to be using and he was using frequencies in which the earth is rusted so you&#x27;ll get a standing scalar spherical wave through the nuclei of the earth this goes through the nuclei don&#x27;t bother with the electron shells like that well the earth is already highly stressed what&#x27;s stress what&#x27;s mechanical and heat stress every kind of wave you&#x27;re going even the mechanical stress quantum mechanically little electromagnetic virtual particles going it&#x27;s electromagnetic at bases the electromagnetic stress feeds this wave remember i talked about stressing the nonlinear nucleus this is a different kind of nonlinearity the heat stress and mechanical stress the electromagnetics we got exactly the same situation boiling like mad it&#x27;s a cathode and it&#x27;s a child and we&#x27;re putting in the grid signal and that whole sucker now all the power that gets in here lots more power is in there from the amplification furnished by the earth it&#x27;s a pump phase conjugate mirror as a matter of fact self-taught it starts to resonate itself build up builds up to a nice value lots of power in it so what&#x27;s going to happen now that it&#x27;s a pumped phase conjugate mirror with scalar resonance which is what we finally get to what&#x27;s going to happen when i set pumping the heat and stuff is what furnishes the sub pump way we don&#x27;t have to furnish anything but the little way to get it initiated when i put in a little input signal to another input somewhere else around the world here bingo i get back the amplified phase conjugate replica big amplified power there&#x27;s a thousand papers in the literature approve pumping and self-pumping systems they prove the amplification they prove the non-linearity so if you believe those mechanisms then it ought to be possible to do that and you can do that anywhere and you can power the whole earth from the internal heat and pressure that you&#x27;re tapping and what is so beautiful about what monty had he explained that all the disorder went to the electron shells and all the order comes out on the time reverse wave and it&#x27;s beautiful it&#x27;s perfect what he&#x27;s worked out now what comes out is a nice coherent wave almost like a laser at all these points you could power the horror with this system except there&#x27;s a little flower with it the earth is not quite an isotropic medium the soviets have already proved and the westinghouse has proved that if you use the beat frequency between two waves the earth will think you transmitted a sine wave at that beat frequency and they&#x27;ll go through as a sine wave and do what i&#x27;ve said and the soviets proved if you use circular polarization you will have standing wave solutions it&#x27;s all there in the bits and pieces in the literature so if i take the non-linear optics work the pump based conjugate mirror work the way tesla actually built the thing i take the deep frequency knowledge and i take the circular polarization knowledge you can do what i had on the diagrams and the thing will work and you can power the horn from one transmitter and that&#x27;s the secret of tesla&#x27;s magnifying transmitter that cat had discovered what today we call phase conjugation and pumped four wave mixing it was workable my conclusion is tesla knew about it only he didn&#x27;t use those terms he had discovered face conjugation and timer versus wave and frank golden showed in 1985 27 such channels exactly like that put into the earth by the soviet union and i looked at it on the oscilloscope they were 12 kilohertz apart they were taking power out of the earth enormous power 12 kilohertz and power in that whole big system for barber shop in around may day 1985. garbershop had been in power just a short time that was the stated time they were going to be ready to have all this ready they stated 1972 they made the schedule they were using tesla&#x27;s magnifying transmitter the earth sun and moon are formed in a triad linked by such scalar wave residents and you better watch what you do on the earth with this massive massive stuff or you will tickle the sun and if the sun burps and spits out a mighty hiccup of fiery molten material you may really have the book of revelations and the holocaust coming at you don&#x27;t laugh what we looked at in and around may the 1st 1985 if miss triggered could have done precisely that every time the soviet union energizes these big continent busters they risk the total survival of the human race now we&#x27;re going to add one law one rule we&#x27;re going to take cpt and we&#x27;re going to add all the other stuff in now we&#x27;ll give you a new rule it&#x27;s called cpt egs charge parity time energy gravity entropy but now we&#x27;ve got a rule how to use all of it put together the rule is here&#x27;s the normal factor normally we interact with electron shell that&#x27;s negative charge period is normal space priority time is plus time time flow energy normal positive energy gravity is the normal kind which means attraction the mass and entropy is the tendency to more and more disorder that&#x27;s normal physics normal reality but when you use time reversal if you reverse the rule is this if you reverse one of those things you reverse all of them all the rest now you can do anti-gravity you can do entropy and you can do negative energy if you sort out a massive amount of negative energy in the laboratory you get a breed flash that will burn you for a couple of days and the thing will freeze ice around it doesn&#x27;t heat cools okay priority lab i want to tell you about healing cancer what priori did this is his little setup he killed healed all the rats and lab animals with up above this big coil here there is a rotating plasma fed by 17 frequencies up in the gigahertz band rotating plasmas are one thing that do face conjugation we know today they didn&#x27;t know it in the west in 1965 and so he has a rippling magnetic field strong magnetic field which by magnetic resonance will get him in the nucleus of all the atoms by nuclear magnetic resonance why the nucleus because he&#x27;s got to get down where the negative energy stuff and the negative time stuff is in electro gravity is that&#x27;s where the control system of the immune system and the living systems are living systems have had to use to be to keep producing the same kind of species pattern otherwise the law of entropy would eat them alive after about three generations you couldn&#x27;t transmit the pattern anymore they wouldn&#x27;t even be species you have to use negative entropy and that&#x27;s why living systems use negative energy negative time and scalar waves he produces then a phase conjugate pattern he&#x27;s learned what the right mixture is to give him the anti pattern to that cancer it comes right back down through gets down into the bone cells everything else bathes every cell in a little animal and reverses the cancer if you differentiate the cancer cell turns back to a normal cell now robert becker should have the nobel prize for proving how little weak pico amperes occur heal bone it takes the red blood cell shuts off the hemoglobin the thing regrows the genetic nucleus with all the genetics turns into that kind of cell that&#x27;s called b differentiation going back to a more primitive cell any what&#x27;s needed so it then crawls around and turns into the kind of cell makes cartilage very what&#x27;s needed so then it crawls around and changes into the kind of cell that makes bone and heals these horrible bone factors and he proved that in victory over frogs that could heal bone terrible bone fractures should have a nobel prize nobody had the foggiest notion it was the blood red blood cells responding to pico amperes or tiny occurrence so small you can hardly imagine can you not do pico amperes with this thing in the body of course you can can you not drive cells through that whole structure of course you can you can do electromagnetic healing of any kind of cellular disease known to man you don&#x27;t have to understand the cause you just got to capture the delta and time reverse it and do that to the body and you&#x27;ll cure it and that&#x27;s why they wiped out priori and that&#x27;s why they suppress that machine because a cancer patient is a hundred and sixty seven thousand bucks multiply that by five hundred thousand a year in the united states and you&#x27;ll see why they don&#x27;t wanna cure cancer so how they&#x27;re gonna cure aids they&#x27;re gonna give it to the same bunch that&#x27;s refused to cure cancer for all these years how many aids patients are going to die before they do this this is proven it worked it&#x27;s real it&#x27;s still in the french hardcore medical literature there&#x27;s no reason for these 500 000 people dying every year and for the age people dying 100 million dollars and three years will cure all of those diseases they&#x27;re not going to spend it that way they&#x27;re going to give it to that crew you can&#x27;t make a vaccine and they&#x27;re going to spend billions and bankrupt the whole medical system and they&#x27;re not going to cure it that&#x27;s the way to cure it that&#x27;s my new book thank you for your attention [Applause] [Music] [Music] still drink water andrea pujorich once accused me of sounding like a baptist preacher and i&#x27;m afraid i did tonight but that&#x27;s the message thank you very much for your attention [Music] you</p>
