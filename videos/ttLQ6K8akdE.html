            <p>coming to you live from my living room floor i wanted to talk about your neck and getting it stronger very easy way to do that getting on the floor coming up into a chin tucked position and fighting against gravity the more against gravity you can be the more your muscles are gonna work you can use your arm to really uh provide some support if you take the arms off it&#x27;s a little bit harder challenge yourself see what you can do assuming you have no pain with this nothing going down the arms 30 seconds on one minute off try that for three rounds while you&#x27;re down on the ground in general most humans do not get on the ground often enough but this is a really good way to get down on the ground and challenge your postural neck muscles build that up it&#x27;s just as important if not more important than doing regular old planks and getting your six pack so try this out this is the six pack for your neck have an awesome day</p>
