            <p>hello welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel where we learn about different important items that you may not know anything about and today is video 185 on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson Mr Larson uh Drive the reciprocal system back in the 20th century and uh eventually came out with his fundamental postulates in the 1950s and after that wrote books until his death in 1990 we&#x27;re looking at his 1979 book here called Nothing But motion and uh the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we do live in a universe of motion not a universe of matter not a universe of energy but a universe of motion where motion is the prime constituent of the universe and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are not the container of the universe but they are the contents of the universe motion is basically a fraction where space and time is the numerator or and time or space is the denominator and uh that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time and uh but it is a bit more complicated than that because space and time are both multi-dimensional meaning coordinate they have their three-dimensional uh aspects they also have their scalar aspects uh their clock aspects time time is always getting later and later and later that is the flow of time and space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart as the flow of space and space and time also both come in discrete units there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light that sets the speed of light up as being not the maximum speed of the universe which is what Einstein says but as the midpoint of uh the universe with really two separate uh universes or sectors of the universe Larson kalsos the material sector that is the sector that is moving slower than the speed of light which is the one that we&#x27;re familiar with but there&#x27;s also what Larson calls the cosmic sector wherein everything is moving faster than the speed of light and the speed of light is actually the minimum speed of that universe now the cosmic sector is something that Legacy science knows little or nothing about but because of the reciprocal postulate meaning there&#x27;s a reciprocal relationship between space and time what we know about the uh material sector can be extrapolated to the cosmic sector all we have to do is invert the rolls of space and time so if something is in the material Universe it&#x27;s exact mirror image is also in the cosmic Universe uh with the caveat that you just have to invert the relationships of space and time okay now um we are going through chapter 12 of this book nothing but motion which is primarily on Atomic physics and this uh this chapter is called basic mathematical relations and um we&#x27;re gonna go back a little bit and uh kind of try to go over uh some of the mathematical relations he&#x27;s here in this chapter he&#x27;s really defining uh a lot of the the various uh chemical uh a lot of the various physical and mechanical properties of things and how that they everything can be described exclusively uh in terms of space and time now I just want to mention that you know where you have atoms and sub atoms and so on these are combinations of motions and everything is a mo is a certain kind of motion uh you have really four kinds of motion you have your translational motion you have your vibrational motion you have your rotational motion and you have your rotational vibration and those are all uh can be in one two or three dimensions or at least two and [Music] those those different motions can combine in various ways to create the different atoms on the periodic table as long as well as the different sub atoms um okay uh we&#x27;re gonna go back here and start right here in the middle of this paragraph however the atom rotates in the inward scalar Direction now just remember a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no Direction okay so it&#x27;s either inward or outward and you can Envision this by using a balloon and you put some dots on the balloon with a magic marker you blow up the balloon and all the dots are moving away from each other that is an outward scalar motion if you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other that is an inward scalar motion that outward scalar motion at the speed of light is what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system that is the flow of space time that is always there the progression of the natural reference system you get to gravitation or the inward force that creates the atoms if you don&#x27;t want to use the term gravitation which Larson uses by Reverse by first nullifying that outward progression first of all and then adding another negative uh or inward motion to that and so that&#x27;s kind of what he&#x27;s uh getting at here the atom rotates in the inward scalar Direction and inward motion necessarily takes place in opposition to the omnipresent outward motion of the natural reference system two inward displacement units are therefore required in order to reach the limit of one net unit these two units extend from unity in the positive scalar Direction what he calls the positive zero in terms of the natural system or the natural reference system to Unity in the negative scalar Direction which he calls the negative zero so you know that goes against uh basic math that you might have learned that there is both a positive zero and a negative zero and they constitute the maximum for any one-dimensional unidirectional motion in three-dimensional space or time there can be two displacement units in each of the three dimensions and the maximum three-dimensional unidirectional displacement is therefore 2 to the third or eight units there have been some suggestions that the number of possible directions and consequently displacements in three-dimensional space ought to be three times two equals six rather than two to the third power equals eight it should therefore be emphasized that we are not dealing with three individual dimensions of motion we are dealing with three dimensional motions the possible directions in a three-dimensional Continuum can be visualized by regarding a two unit cube as being an assemblage of eight one unit cubes the diagonals from the center of the assemblage to the opposite corner of each of the cubes then Define the eight possible directions and uh so if you know your geometry uh or even if you don&#x27;t you can just try to Envision that try to uh to visualize uh a cube that you divide into eight cubes by you know basically uh the cube is two units on each side and so basically dividing each one of the sides in half so you have eight one unit cubes and then he says the the diagonals from the center of the assemblage to the opposite corner of each of the cubes then define the eight possible directions these would all be um well when you have a cube like that you also then have a star tetrahedron and uh these would these diagonals would be like the altitudes of the star uh star tetrahedron or of really the several star tetrahedrons that you would have there an important consequence of the fact that these are eight displacement units between the zero point of the positive motion and the end of the second unit which is the zero from the negative standpoint is that in any physical situation involving rotation or other three-dimensional motion there are eight displacement units between positive and negative magnitudes a positive displacement X from the positive datum is physically equivalent to a negative displacement eight minus X from the negative datum this is a principle that will have a while a wide field of application in the pages that follow the key factor in the relation between Motion in space and motion in time is the previously mentioned fact that in the context of a spatial reference system all Motion in time is scalar and in the context of a temporal reference system all Motion in space is scalar the regions of motion in time and motion in space therefore meet in what is essentially no more than a point contact it follows that of all of the possible directions that emotion in time can take only one of these time directions brings the motion in time into contact with the region of motion in space only in this One Direction can an effect be transmitted across the regional boundary in as much as as all possible directions are equally probable the absence of any factors that would establish a preference the ratio of the transmitted effect to the total magnitude of the motion is numerically equal to the total number of possible directions as can be seen from the foregoing explanation the transmission ratio depends on the nature of the motion particularly on the number of Dimensions involved however the value with which we will be most concerned is that applicable to the basic properties of matter this is the relation that was called the inter-regional ratio in the first edition and it appears advisable to retain this name although the more extensive information now available shows the relation is not as general as the name might indicate on the basis of the theoretical considerations discussed in the preceding paragraphs there are four possible orientations of each of the two two-dimensional rotations of the atoms and eight possible orientations of the one dimensional rotations making a total of four times four times eight equals 128 different positions that a unit displacement of the scalar translational motion of the atom can take in three-dimensional time in addition each of the rotating systems of the atom has an in an initial unit of vibrational displacement with three possible orientations one in each dimension for the two dimensional basic rotation this means nine possible positions of which two are occupied so that&#x27;s for the photo the two photons that are at the core of each one of these atoms each of the rotating systems of the atom has an initial unit of vibrational displacement this vibrational displacement is the photon okay for the two-dimensional basic rotation this means nine possible positions of which two are occupied thus for each of the 128 possible rotational positions there is an additional two over nine vibrational position which any given displacement unit May occupy the original the inter-regional ratio is then 128 Plus 128 times 2 over 9. which equals 156 in 4 9 or 156.44 um now you have to go over this derivation probably repeatedly to understand where he&#x27;s uh you know all of the numbers and how he&#x27;s employing this but to just know at this point that uh he uses this inter-regional ratio of very commonly and um so you know if you&#x27;re wondering where he&#x27;s getting it from this is where he&#x27;s getting it from chapter 12. of nothing but motion and so um when he starts to use this you know don&#x27;t just say he&#x27;s where is he getting this from this is where he&#x27;s getting it from and uh this unit is also modified if you&#x27;re using a sub atom because within sub atoms there&#x27;s only one Photon or one vibrational displacement and so instead of using 128 plus 128 times 2 9 which is you know 120 128 times 11 over 9 is what we&#x27;re really talking about um okay in the in the situation with sub subatomic particles you have really 128 plus 10 over 9 instead of 11 over nine and that is that turns out to be 142.22 or 142 and 2 9. so he uses that number as well in other situations it is this again this is a process of Larson um deriving a theoretical universe strictly from the from the postulates that he postulated back in the 1950s and then he developed them through a process of deduction if this then that if this then that and then he so and I I did about 15 videos on that earlier going over his talk that is called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system it has about 165 different steps that he takes to to derive all of this stuff and so he derives a theoretical universe and then he Compares that Universe with the universe that the mainstream scientists have measured and have observed um okay now it is this inter-regional ratio that accounts for the small size sizes in quotes the small size of atoms when the dimensions of these objects are measured on the assumption that they are in contact in the solid state according to the theory developed in the foregoing Pages there can be no physical distance less than one natural unit of space which as we will see in the next chapter is 4.56 times 10 to the minus 6 centimeters or 4.56 times 10 to the minus 8 meters but because the inter-atomic equilibrium is established in the region inside this unit the measured inter-atomic distance is reduced by the inter-regional ratio and this measured value is therefore in the neighborhood of 10 to the minus 8 centimeters or 10 to the minus 10 meters so what he&#x27;s showing here is that this inter-regional ratio is basically the amount that you&#x27;re losing in the translation if you&#x27;re trying to measure across a unit boundary okay when you&#x27;re trying to measure across the unit space boundary one unit of space if you&#x27;re trying to measure into uh from the sector that we&#x27;re in which is um multi-units of space if you&#x27;re trying to measure into the area that is less than one unit of space you have to reduce all your measurements by the inter-regional ratio he says but because the inter-atomic equilibrium is established in the region inside this unit the measured inter-atomic distance is reduced by the inter-regional ratio okay so the met so that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re losing in the translation what you&#x27;re measuring is one thing but what you&#x27;re actually observing is another the measured inter Atomic distance is reduced by the inter-regional ratio the inversion of space and time at the unit level also has an important effect on the dimensions of inter-regional relations inside unit space no changes in space magnitudes can take place since less than unit space does not exist however as pointed out earlier the motion in time which can take place inside the space unit is equivalent to a motion in space because of the inverse relation between space and time an increase in the time aspect of emotion in this inside region the time region where space remains constant at Unity from 1 to T is equivalent to 2 to a decrease in the space aspect from one to one over t where the time is T the speed in this region is equivalent space 1 over T divided by time t so 1 over t to the second power so an increase as pointed out earlier the motion in time which can take place inside the space unit is equivalent to a motion in space okay so inside a unit of space space does not exist only time exists and inversely inside a unit of time only space exists but we only see space we do not see time and so when we measure something that is in time we convert it to what is the equivalent in space and in this case you have to use this fraction 1 over t squared to basically convert uh what we see in the time region um we will go over this again tomorrow um but I know that this is super abstract and difficult to manage especially when you&#x27;re not really being given any um specific examples to illustrate but uh this is important stuff to understand the reciprocal system and really understand uh where Larson&#x27;s coming from what he&#x27;s thinking about what you know what uh what the theory is uh kind of founded on so we&#x27;ll review this again tomorrow but thanks for tuning in for now and have a great day</p>
