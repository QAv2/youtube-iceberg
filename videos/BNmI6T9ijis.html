            <p>UFOs uaps flying saucers extraterrestrials non-humans what the [ __ ] is going on here these strange unidentified objects have been seen throughout history it seems like but has naturally become a serious topic of interest for the United States government Anne is now being taken seriously with Congress having held a special hearing on the topic on July 26 2023. this is Lieutenant Ryan Graves he&#x27;s the executive director of Americans for safe Aerospace Lieutenant Graves is also a former U.S Navy F-18 pilot with the Zone UAP experience the next witness David gresh is a former senior intelligence officer with the National geospatial Intelligence Agency and was a senior technical advisor for UAP issues and final finally retired Navy commanded date Commander David fraver Squadron leader who worked as a Naval aviator for 18 years Mr fraber has his own UAP experience known as The Tick Tock event now before panties get themselves in a bunch let me be very clear I do believe the testimonials given by Lieutenant Graves and Commander fraver because of the evidence to back up their eyewitness accounts these two gentlemen in my opinion are 100 being honest present themselves in the professional of demeanors and the fact they even came forward with these stories takes [ __ ] big cojones with that being said my tinfoil hat slowly began tipping off my fat ass head with David gruch&#x27;s account gracious grass how the [ __ ] do you say that this guy legit came out of nowhere claiming to have worked on a UAP task force where he ran investigations regarding credible sources on the anomalous aerial phenomenon several things threw me off with his story the main being that most of his answers were vague and any of the more serious topics would be presented in a skiff but what the hell is a skiff all I know is it rhymes with Jiff and I love peanut butter is David Grudge lying or is he an American hero coming out with serious allegations ladies and gentlemen welcome to the scotch grab your non-human entities and let&#x27;s find out whether or not we should believe David Grudge [Music] thank you before we eat touch on Grudge let&#x27;s briefly talk about when UFOs or UAP started being taken seriously by the U.S government and also by the world it seems like it would be a New York Times article released on December 16 2017 along with infrared footage of one of these tic-tac-shaped objects released by The Pentagon [Music] the video along with Commander David fraver and Lieutenant Commander Jim Slate&#x27;s account of these unidentified crafts were eventually studied by a pentagon program that investigated UFOs the incident took place in 2004 off the coast of San Diego and when the fighter jets returned to the Nimitz everyone on the ship had learned of Commander fraver&#x27;s encounter and was making fun of him Commander fraver&#x27;s superiors did not investigate further and he went on with his career deploying to the Persian Gulf to provide air support to ground troops during the Iraq War the New York Times would also publish an article in 2019 along with Fleer evidence involving a person by the name of Lieutenant Ryan Graves foreign Graves had been a Navy pilot for 10 years and flew the fa-18 Super Hornet with his accounts of these aerial phenomena happening over a span of several weeks in 2015. Graves claims would be supported by the go fast and gimbal videos taken off the coast of Jacksonville Florida the gimbal video would have one of the pilots claim the object to be a drone bro and would even claim to see an entire fleet of these aerial phenomena whatever these videos were left quite an impression on very credible sources who had evidence others corroborating their stories and even had eyewitnessed these objects in a nutshell this is the story of the modern UFO craze that people are taking seriously so much so these gentlemen presented their stories and evidence in a congressional hearing but the man who stole the show and had most of these Representatives direct their questions towards him is someone fairly new to the UAP public community this man had a lot to say with very little answers to give and this man who was getting more positive attention than negative goes by the name of David Grudge foreign [Music] appeared on everyone&#x27;s radar with the release of his news Nation interview on June 11 2023. he had come from a blue-collar family in Pittsburgh and his admiration for people in uniform prompted Grudge to join the Air Force where he received an Air Force scholarship in physics he was originally commissioned on active duty and served 14 years in the Air Force he became a career intelligence officer grush spent time on the ground in Afghanistan and other places he can&#x27;t mention before rotating back to Washington D.C it was around this time in 2019 that David claims to have been invited to join the UAP task force it was here that Grudge heard firsthand testimonials from high government officials about the existence of non-human spacecraft and entities it&#x27;s interesting to note that David Grudge has personally never seen anything to do with uaps at least a first-hand account was an intelligence officer for 14 years in the both in the U.S Air Force both active duty Air National Guard and Reserve at the rank a major and most recently from 2021 to 2025.2023 at the National geospatial Intelligence Agency NGA at the gs-15 civilian level which is the military equivalent of a full bird colonel I was my agency&#x27;s co-lead and unidentified anomalous phenomena and transmedium object analysis as well as reporting to the UAP task force uaptf and eventually once it was established the all-domain anomaly resolution office arrow in the news Nation interview Grouch states that he&#x27;s never personally seen non-human intelligence but says he&#x27;s spoken to enough people directly involved in what he calls the program that he&#x27;s convinced it&#x27;s real I started out as a non-believer I came to the problem as a hardcore physics guy Intel officer he said so I have you know excuse my language High [ __ ] factor I was very methodical interviewing people who didn&#x27;t know each other and making sure this wasn&#x27;t some kind of cover-up of some other program in May of 2023 his lawyers would file a disclosure of urgent concerns along with a complaint of reprisal to the office of the Director of National Intelligence stating he was a general schedule 15 employee at the National geospatial Intelligence Agency also known as the NGA also stating that he is currently cleared at the TS SCI level by the NGA and serves as the agency&#x27;s senior technical advisor for unidentified aerial phenomena analysis he is also an intelligence officer in the United States Air Force Reserves the document would also state that in July 2021 Mr Grudge confidentially provided UAP related classified information to the Department of Defense Inspector General at that time Mr Grudge communicated classified information about the improper withholding and or concealment of classified material from the U.S Congress by certain intelligence Community elements Mr Grudge believes that his identity and the fact of his UAP related Communications with the dod Inspector General have been disclosed to individuals and or entities outside of the dod Inspector General and that he has suffered retaliation and reprisals related there too since his protected disclosures to the dod Inspector General Mr Grudge has been subjected to numerous adverse security clearance actions that unjustifiably and punt his Integrity character judgment professionalism and mental health less than a month later in June of 2023 would put Mr Grudge into the public Spectrum where he appeared in an interview for a news Nation whistleblowing these allegations what conclusion did you come to at the end of your time on the uip task force the UAP task forces refused access to a broad crash retrieval program and in Late July of 2023 reported his claims to Congress under oath along with commander fraver and Lieutenant Graves that was met with both criticism and praise all throughout Reddit [Music] feels like another recently xdod government guy setting himself up as the next UFO podcast hero lining up his next job did he watch the hearing his actual job was to interview and debrief military people who experienced these things and he had over 40 different interviews you think 40 people lined up just to interview for this guy and [ __ ] with him his statements were crazy the fact that his life has been threatened is crazy and when you answer the question about if Anya have been murdered to keep this a secret with I can only answer this in a classified setting I think that says it all yes if you are under oath and say no it&#x27;s probably a no but if you are under oath and say I can&#x27;t say that then it&#x27;s most likely a yes just can&#x27;t speak it publicly LOL while many people believe his non-responses were responses during his hearing David Grudge has begun the interview circuit starting with BBC&#x27;s the world tonight though the interview only lasted about five minutes it&#x27;s hard finding any evidence that corroborates David grudge&#x27;s Stories being that he&#x27;s still fairly new to the UFO slash UAP Community that&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t have any opinions of my own it is quite possible that David Grouch will start doing podcasts more interviews books who knows and all of these stories could be a way to popularize himself before doing these extracurricular activities but the only person who knows the truth is David Grudge it is also very possible that David Grudge is being 100 honest under oath but we all know that raising your right hand doesn&#x27;t mean much to some and the fact that David Grouch is working on second-hand accounts kind of throws me off here&#x27;s the thing if he&#x27;s lying or reveals classified information he faces perjury the fact he answers questions with I can provide that in a skiff throws my human brain off and makes me question his story even further here&#x27;s the thing the fact that he was even at this hearing proves to me that he&#x27;s got more truthful credentials than that of Bob Lazar which I wonder why he wasn&#x27;t at this hearing being that his buddies George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell were there until any of us can see slight proof of David grouch&#x27;s claims then that&#x27;s what they will remain to be just claims foreign [Music]</p>
