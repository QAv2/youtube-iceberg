            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Let us know if you would what the hell you think is going on, you know, and and and what this has done what this has done to you too. This I mean, this has got to kind of come out of left field, so to speak in a severe way. And so I imagine it&#x27;s put a bit of a bump into your life. I mean, maybe one that&#x27;s mostly interesting, but still, you know, it&#x27;s to call it strange is to barely scrape the surface. So what what are what are you what do you make of this that there&#x27;s something non-human here and it&#x27;s been here for a long time is my provisional conclusion.</p>
<p>Um and you know the question is not that people should ask is not is there something here. You have to ask the question first can there something be here? And the short answer is of course there can because the universe is 14 billion years old. You could have gotten from one side of the galaxy to the other in our galaxy in Elon Musk&#x27;s Tesla if it were traveling at 10,000 m an hour. Right? But what got on in the first place doesn&#x27;t mean the same thing as what gets off on the other side. So um yes, the short answer is something can be here.</p>
<p>what it is, I&#x27;m not 100% sure. And I feel very uncomfortable with the sightings of biological beings, if only because they they just look a little too much like us. And I just can&#x27;t see from a genetics point of view how why the human form is so or even, you know, two legs and two arms is necessarily biologically the most uh, you know, successful shape. So I I think there&#x27;s something here. I think the data, the evidence of the hypothesis, there&#x27;s more than enough evidence to say that it&#x27;s worth investigating.</p>
<p>So I would ask my colleagues to just hold their, you know, hold their sarcasm for a while. Uh because how do you deny thousands of reports like this? Uh, and uh, you know, I don&#x27;t want to sound conspiratorial, but I mean, I did get a phone call from somebody representing the White House cuz I was talking about something that they felt was a little too on the edge. Uh, they said, &quot;You need to just shut up, Gary. I mean, I&#x27;m just telling you. I mean, I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve briefed Canadian Parliament.</p>
<p>I went to the your parliament in Toronto and I briefed all three parties on it. Um I only didn&#x27;t the only ones who didn&#x27;t want to hear anything were the separatists. Um so interestingly but no I I spent two days there on that. Um and we&#x27;ve briefed the European Parliament as well on it and and they&#x27;re aware of what their own some of their own military are talking about. So that I I conclude that there&#x27;s definitely something here.</p>
<p>But I think the more interesting conclusion is if they are if something is here, it&#x27;s likely been here longer than humans have even been civilized. So it really opens the question uh and actually it&#x27;s something that I think Charles Fort actually said is, you know, Earth is probably somebody else&#x27;s property. Well, that&#x27;s a hell of a place to end.</p>
