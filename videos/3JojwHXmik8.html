            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh it&#x27;s like 5:00 a.m. and um I&#x27;ve been trying to record this video and uh I just recorded 30 minutes plus and I don&#x27;t know my phone is not really taking it so I&#x27;m just going to record a video to basically tell you that I&#x27;m not going to record a video today because I still have a bunch of stuff to do and it&#x27;s already 5:00 a.m. and um I&#x27;m not really that much in the mood for doing a whole lot anyway this is an educational Channel and we&#x27;re trying to look at uh the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson on 452nd video of his all I&#x27;m going to tell you today is that he proposed his two uh fundamental postulates in 1959 they were about how the universe operated and and he um then tried to construct a theoretical Universe which was a a series of deductions from his postulates and um then he wrote books kind of comparing his theoretical Universe with the actual measured universe of the scientists and he was able to arrive at some incredible um findings that really agreed he&#x27;s basically able to reproduce many of the scientific tables just from Theory just from his head uh the principles in his head and um with no money uh and these Army of scientists with uh huge budgets uh he was able to reproduce what they did strictly from Theory so I believe that there&#x27;s really something to what he was talking about and um we&#x27;re going over his book that&#x27;s called basic properties of matter all I&#x27;m going to do really today is go over his two fundamental postulates which are basically seven assumptions about how uh he in uh induced through inductive reasoning uh How the Universe operated taking just massive quantities of data and um a few epiphanies and um crunching all that up and figuring out uh how the general principles of the universe operated so the first aspect of his study was inductive and then the second after he proposed the postulates was deductive taking his general principles and then applying it to specific situations um and then arriving at his theoretical Universe larsson&#x27;s reciprocal system is also known as the universe of motion and that is because he tried to construct his Universe upon motion uh other people have tried that before um such as Thomas Hobs and Renee deart uh Larson is the first one to really make it work and turn it into a generalized theory of the universe now that&#x27;s why Larson calls it the reciprocal system of theory it&#x27;s a system of theory it&#x27;s a system meaning that if you understand how the system works you can apply it to any subject it is a an interrelated network of different subjects you can have reciprocal chemistry reciprocal astronomy reciprocal economics you know reciprocal religion and so on and it&#x27;s all based on the universe of motion the first postulate is that um I kind of like to break it down into the uh seven assumptions and the uh first assumption is that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion then motion um comes in three dimensions motion comes in discrete units and motion um is made of uh two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so the universe is made out of motion motion is a relationship between space and time and space and time and motion have three dimensions and they come in only discrete units that&#x27;s his first postulate and his second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian the second postulate is more axiomatic it&#x27;s just kind of like if you do science you need to uh you know agree that Ma works you know and geometry Works uh I actually disagree with a good portion of that second postulate because I think there are uh geometrical systems that are more inclusive than ukian the ukian geometry is a geometry of the universe but uh there are other geometries that also include ukian geometry that are more descriptive of the whole universe and and uh I also think that in certain circumstances the communative mathematics part may not apply so uh and um I&#x27;m getting a lot of my critiques on that from other uh of larsson&#x27;s uh Associates or researchers the first postula is where most of the work gets done basically uh space uh motion uh is uh what he call a scalar motion and this is a motion with a magnitude but no specific Direction so the universe is made out of scalar motion you can model this with a balloon that you put dots on uh you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other the motion uh is either inward or outward depending on whether you&#x27;re blowing up or sucking in the balloon if you&#x27;re moving away if uh if you&#x27;re blowing out the dots are all moving away from each other if you suck in all the dots are moving toward each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific direction or rather they&#x27;re moving in every direction every dot is moving uh away from every other dot on the expanding balloon Larson calls that the progression uh the uh sucking in the balloon is the gravitation all the dots are moving toward each other and if you assign a reference point it appears as if all the dots are moving uh it it appears that one dot is motionless then you assign a reference point this dot is motionless well then you can now measure the directions to the other dots and it appears as if there is a force field between your Dot and all the other dots like all the other dots are attracted by your dot none of that is true and Larson calls that as if Force it appears as if there&#x27;s a force field but actually every dot is pursuing its own course they&#x27;re all moving toward all others and uh the the direction is actually equality of the reference point and not of the motion scalar motion itself and then motion for Larson is the relationship between space and time all motion uh is and basically all sign ific phenomena are motions matter energy force acceleration pressure these are all kinds of motion and every kind of motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space in as as the denominator except that time or space can come in multiple Dimensions so you can have time to the third power over space to the third power that&#x27;s matter time over space that&#x27;s energy time over space to the fourth power that is pressure space over time to the second power that is uh acceleration and so on so that is a great system of units that you can use uh to check your work and uh it&#x27;s much easier than dealing with the MKS system which has also got matter in there you can turn all matter into time to the third power or space to the third power everything works out to just time and space space um which makes it a lot easier than dealing with three variables um space and time come in three dimensions uh that&#x27;s coordinate space three dimensions of space but that&#x27;s really when you assign a reference point you stop the universe and then the three dimensions become still um like space like we&#x27;re accustomed to and then but time is still moving in a scalar manner time time is getting later and later and later but if you um you can do that also with time uh and so you end up with a three-dimensional uh vectorial spatial reference system and you also have can get a three-dimensional temporal reference system three dimensions of time in a still frame and space is progressing space is always getting farther and farther and farther par but in no specific Direction like on the surface of an expanding balloon uh and space time and motion come only in discrete units um meaning that you have to have a full unit of space before you have space and you have to have a full unit of time before you have time if you have one unit of space and one unit of time you have what Larson calls unit speed space over time is speed the car is moving 10 miles an hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time one unit of space in one unit of time is unit speed which is also known as the speed of light that is the background speed of the universe of motion the universe is always moving at the speed of light outward in all directions a scalar motion of space in all directions that is always happening it&#x27;s Eternal and omnipresent and then by turning back that motion that is the source you turn back that motion to get particles and atoms and molecules and Aggregates by rotating that outward motion and turning it into an inward motion which is gravitation gravitation is inherent in all matter all atoms and particles uh and U molecules and Aggregates H are uh gravit are are have gravity in them inherent so gravity again is not a force it is an as if force it is inherent to the atom itself all of the atoms or dots are moving on their own there is no force field there&#x27;s no force of attraction it just appears that way because all atoms are moving toward all other atoms and um uh you know in order to accept the reciprocal system the universe of motion you have to be able to accept the concept that motion exists before anything moving so you got that progression of the natural reference system that is always there and that&#x27;s always going to be part of the calculations is the what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system so you have your spatial reference system you have your temporal reference system both of those reference systems are three-dimensional in space three-dimensional in time but in terms of motion they are just onedimensional so it takes one scalar Dimension to describe three dimensions of space or three dimensions of time so your reference systems are not capable of describing larsson&#x27;s Universe because larsson&#x27;s Universe has three dimensions of motion uh so he has this natural reference system basically moving outward in three dimensions in um at the speed of light in all directions and those three dimensions then need to be rolled back to turn it into matter first it&#x27;s vibrated you you put in a vibratory motion into that outward motion and that is a photon and then that vibratory motion then gets rotated and the first time it&#x27;s rotated is really like a particle and then that particle combines with other particles that also have photons in them so you end up with two photons and then you end up with various um various rotations combinations of rotations a full atom is three different uh well it can be two different rotations that are both two-dimensional for a total of three and uh then there&#x27;s an optional third uh one-dimensional rotation so larsson&#x27;s periodic table looks like that now um I&#x27;m not going to be reading today uh going to just stop there for today uh but we are looking at this book that&#x27;s called basic properties of matter he looks at the basic properties of uh like the melting point and boiling point and so on of uh chemistry and he Compares his values that he deres from the equations he deres for the various properties of matter with the scientific tables we&#x27;re looking at this chapter that&#x27;s called specific heat patterns and this this particular chapter is very much in the weeds he&#x27;s like in into details that you don&#x27;t really need to know about but I still like to read it into the record and case somebody is really up on their organic chemistry and they uh you know and they understand all of this um and they can kind of weigh it into um you know their uh Legacy science viewpoint but um you know I&#x27;ve read this already kind of labored through it earlier and my recording didn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s like I said 5:00 a.m. so um I&#x27;m going to leave it there and we&#x27;ll get back to looking at the specific heat patterns tomorrow have a great day and hopefully I&#x27;ll be a little bit more chipper tomorrow um thanks for tuning in</p>
