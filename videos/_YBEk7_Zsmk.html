            <p>hi everyone I&#x27;m Matt and I&#x27;m a physicist I spent most of my professional physics life doing research into hot fusion which is what goes on in the center of stars today though I do confusion research which is completely different there&#x27;s a story behind the shift from hot to cold as you might imagine just like there&#x27;s a story behind cold fusion itself where it came from why it&#x27;s important why you should care about it but there are longer stories which we will say for another day this video is about something very practical you see I&#x27;ve been building up to my first cold fusion experiment for quite some time and it&#x27;s happening tomorrow which I&#x27;m stupidly excited about I put a link in the description below where you can find out more information and follow me if you are interested the practical thing we&#x27;re going to be talking about is how I prepare my materials to go into my cold fusion reactor I&#x27;ve been inspired by a Japanese researcher called Mizuno so I&#x27;m following along as close as I can to his procedure so without further ado I will let you watch the procedure and hopefully it is instructive insightful and that you enjoy it please bear in mind that is one safety concern about the production of fine nickel powder don&#x27;t do this unless you&#x27;ve read all the information in the description below please do wear breathing protection and do this in a well-ventilated space [Applause] [Applause]</p>
