            <p>Freedom the final font. These are the voyages of source souls in the third dimensions. Its eternal mission is to explore all possibilities. To seek out and create and form new ways to express source. To boldly go where no soul has gone before.</p>
<p>you big dummy. &gt;&gt; So, hello my friends. All you souls here having a physical experience on this planet that we call Earth or Terra, how you guys doing today? Now, I&#x27;ve known you for a while and we have talked about um crimes against humanity a lot on this channel and I just want to um let you guys know that crimes against humanity um could be technological too because um we have been focusing on atrocities that&#x27;s been committed against other human beings which is very important for us to know and for us to um see what these evil I don&#x27;t even want to call them people these evil beings have been doing to us for millennia and that&#x27;s very important for us to know that but we crimes against humanity also could be in a technological sense where they keep things hidden from us or keep things from us that is technologically good for humanity. And in some cases, the technological um advancements that we&#x27;ve made that they&#x27;ve kept and hidden from us could save millions of lives and change the the aspect of our reality in a way that we can only imagine. So, I&#x27;m going to start this out with at least three or maybe four of the main um technological advancements that has been hidden from us, that&#x27;s been kept from us.</p>
<p>And from what I&#x27;m hearing is that this is what the Alliance is going to be releasing very soon. um to show us that we have the ability to move forward without having being controlled by these elites. They are not elites. They are deletes and we need to delete them from our freaking world or make sure that they&#x27;re not in power to keep us in a abject slavery that&#x27;s both physical, mental, and spiritual. So, the the video I&#x27;m getting ready to show you is going to have some cartoon overlays and it&#x27;s going to present facts in a way that is very easy for everybody to understand and understand.</p>
<p>So I would hope that you guys would pass this on to put it in our collective consciousness so that we can create a world with knowledge that we have done and overcome a lot of the technological um things that we need that um they say that we can&#x27;t do. And we if we had these things, it would change the world in a better way and we could be living in a world that&#x27;s basically like almost like heaven here on earth. So, um, without further ado, I&#x27;m going to basically show you this and I&#x27;m going to have a little comments in between to basically drive home the point that these people are basically idiots and they&#x27;re criminal idiots, which is a combination that&#x27;s very deadly. So, without further ado, let&#x27;s start with the first one, which everyone should know. Remember Nicola Tesla, okay, when he invented and came up with a way to extract energy from the ether.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let&#x27;s start there. In 1899, Nicola Tesla developed a wireless power transmission system that could provide unlimited free electricity to the entire world. His Warden Cliff Tower project successfully demonstrated the technology powering electrical devices across Long Island without any wires or fuel sources. Within 2 years, the project was shut down. The tower was demolished and all evidence of Tesla&#x27;s breakthrough was systematically destroyed.</p>
<p>Tesla&#x27;s free energy system worked by tapping into what he called radiant energy, electromagnetic radiation that permeates all space and can be converted into usable electricity. His tower created a resonance effect with the Earth&#x27;s natural electrical field, essentially turning the entire planet into a wireless power source that could supply unlimited energy to any receiver tuned to the correct frequency. Documented demonstrations showed Tesla&#x27;s system powering entire neighborhoods on Long Island using nothing more than specialized receivers that collected energy from the air itself. Witnesses described light bulbs glowing without any connection to power lines, electric motors running continuously without fuel and heating systems operating indefinitely without any energy source. JP Morgan, who had financed the project, immediately withdrew funding when he realized that free energy would destroy the profit model of the electrical power industry.</p>
<p>Morgan reportedly told Tesla, &quot;If anyone can draw on the power, where do we put the meter?&quot; The financial implications were staggering. Tesla&#x27;s invention threatened to eliminate the need for power companies, coal mining, and oil consumption for electrical generation. Federal agents seized all of Tesla&#x27;s research materials immediately after his death in 1943, classifying his free energy patents under national security orders that remain in effect today. The FBI confiscated over 80 trunks of Tesla&#x27;s documents, including detailed blueprints for scaling up the wireless power system to global proportions. Independent researchers who attempted to replicate Tesla&#x27;s free energy system have faced systematic persecution.</p>
<p>In 1957, engineer Lester Hendershot built a working reproduction of Tesla&#x27;s radiant energy collector and demonstrated it to military officials. Within weeks, Hendershot&#x27;s laboratory was raided by federal agents. His device was confiscated and he was warned never to discuss his work again. The suppression continues today. Patent applications for free energy devices are immediately classified under the invention secrecy act, preventing inventors from developing or discussing their technologies publicly.</p>
<p>Over 5,000 patents remain classified under secrecy orders, many involving energy generation systems that would eliminate dependence on fossil fuels. Tesla&#x27;s free energy system represented more than a technological breakthrough. It was a threat to the fundamental economic structure of modern civilization. Unlimited free power would have eliminated energy scarcity, reduced industrial costs to nearly zero, and fundamentally altered the balance of global economic power. The technology that could have freed humanity from energy dependence was deliberately erased to protect the interests of industries built on artificial scarcity.</p>
<p>Tesla&#x27;s vision of abundant free energy for all humanity was sacrificed to preserve the profit margins of companies that control the world&#x27;s power supply. Now, this technological advancement is is really a crime against some humanity. Can you imagine the world with free energy? It will have the eradication of energy poverty. I mean billions of people around the world in developing regions could access reliable electricity for lighting, cooking and basic appliances without cost. Lifting communities out of poverty and enabling economic growth in all these regions.</p>
<p>Free energy would eliminate power costs in factories enabling hypo efficient automation. You could do all these manufacturers at a scale that&#x27;s we have never seen before rapid reproduction and it will slash prices for goods and foster innovation in materials and robotics for a more prosperous global economy. It&#x27;ll do wonders for the agricultural productivity of the planet. also this thing farmers could make um food and produce food for absolutely nothing that will make our food prices go down. And there&#x27;s so many things that would be affected by the use of free energy that this is a crime against humanity.</p>
<p>And those that have said that this will have a threat to our freaking national security are nothing but liars. And I hope President Trump and the alliance and whoever&#x27;s um doing this reset I matter of fact I don&#x27;t hope I know that they will take care of that. I heard that that&#x27;s in the first phase of um the innovations and technological um advances that will be released probably next year um at the state fair at the at the fair at the at the great fair maybe during the time um where we are celebrating the 250th anniversary of our country. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hearing from the darknet that a lot of these that exactly will be one of them. And the next one is basically is a crime against humanity no matter how well you look at it.</p>
<p>Why do I say that? Let&#x27;s take a look at an invention by a guy named Royal Raymond Refe. In the 1930s, Dr. Royal Raymond Reich invented a microscope so powerful it could observe living viruses and bacteria in real time and discovered that specific electromagnetic frequencies could destroy cancer cells without harming healthy tissue. His frequency therapy successfully cured cancer in clinical trials with 100% success rates before being systematically suppressed by the medical establishment that profited from expensive, ineffective treatments. Refe&#x27;s universal microscope achieved magnifications of over 60,000 times using a revolutionary optical system that made living microorganisms visible without killing them.</p>
<p>Using this technology, he identified the specific electromagnetic signature of cancercausing viruses and developed frequency generators that could destroy these pathogens selectively. The right frequency therapy work by bombarding cancer cells with precise electromagnetic pulses that match their natural resonant frequency. Like an opera singer shattering a wine glass with the right note, Refe&#x27;s machine could destroy malignant cells by hitting them with their exact vibrational frequency while leaving healthy cells completely unaffected. Clinical trials conducted in 1934 at the University of Southern California showed remarkable results. 16 terminal cancer patients were treated with Reich&#x27;s frequency therapy and within 70 days 14 were completely cured.</p>
<p>The remaining two patients recovered fully after their treatment protocols were adjusted, achieving a 100% cure rate for terminal cancer cases. Dr. Milbank Johnson, who directed the clinical trials, prepared to announce the revolutionary cancer cure to the medical world. But before the results could be published, Johnson died suddenly of mysterious circumstances and all documentation of the cancer cure trials vanished from university records. The American Medical Association, led by Morris Fishbine, immediately launched a campaign to discredit Reich&#x27;s work.</p>
<p>Medical journals refused to publish papers on frequency therapy. Researchers who supported Reife&#x27;s work lost their funding and doctors who used the Refe machines were threatened with loss of their medical licenses. In 1939, agents working for pharmaceutical interests broke into Reife&#x27;s laboratory and destroyed his research materials, including irreplaceable components of his universal microscope. The remaining Refe machines were systematically tracked down and destroyed, and technicians who had built the devices were intimidated into silence. The suppression was economic as well as scientific.</p>
<p>Cancer treatment had become a billion-dollar industry by the 1940s, generating enormous profits for pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and medical equipment manufacturers. Refe&#x27;s simple, inexpensive cure threatened to eliminate the entire cancer treatment industry overnight. Several researchers who attempted to replicate Reife&#x27;s work died under suspicious circumstances. Dr. Nemesis, who had reproduced the frequency therapy results, was found dead in his laboratory under conditions that investigators deemed mysterious but not suspicious.</p>
<p>Dr. Kosh, another Reife supporter, died suddenly just before testifying about the cancer cures effectiveness. Refe spent his final years fighting legal battles and patent disputes, impoverished and broken by the systematic destruction of his life&#x27;s work. The technology that could have saved millions of lives was a race to protect the profits of an industry that benefits from treating disease rather than curing it. &gt;&gt; So, I&#x27;m just going to interrupt this for uh a few minutes because I just want to talk about the invention secrecy act a little bit now.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve been talking about the act of 1871 on this channel for a very long time. And we all know that the um act of 1871 which created a separate government for the District of Columbia, a corporational type entity that replaced the republic of our country with a commercial entity called a United States of DC, a separate government that we don&#x27;t control, that we the people have no um authority they say over and they did this in secret as a con to fool the American people. The invention secrecy act is under that corporation. So what does that make it illegitimate? And why would they actually suppress inventions that could help the humans, the human, the the people of America and pro and and basically the world. And they claim that it was the u uh we impose secrecy orders on patent applications if their disclosure could harm national security.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s another two words that we must look into. What do they consider harming national security? And what is national security? Is it a threat to the people of America? So, how is free energy a threat to the people of America? No, it&#x27;s a threat to the ones that stole our country. That&#x27;s who&#x27;s a threat to &gt;&gt; and the military has got to take take action with this. This has got to go. We all know it is going.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s one of the things that&#x27;s and since this act has been in and it was signed into law by Truman. I don&#x27;t know what the hell was going on with Truman. Was he made to do this? Was it under threat? Because I thought Truman was pretty good. But he wasn&#x27;t. if he signed this into order.</p>
<p>Okay. All of these people are basically under the the thumb of the cabal that has run our country for since 1871 basically. And it all leads back to Cabal of the threeheaded state, the Vatican, London, and the United States of DC. It makes absolutely no sense that if someone invents invents something like free energy devices that they would call this a national security threat. Do you guys agree? Are we idiots to allow this to happen? This is our country, not theirs.</p>
<p>We the people is the one who owns this country and we the people will have to demand that this crap that they&#x27;ve been doing in the in the um protection of national security that means that anything that they don&#x27;t like could be deemed a national security threat. really curing cancer is a national security threat. Really? And this is why we heard when Q said that there was over almost 6,000 patents and inventions that has been kept secret from the people. This is what we&#x27;re talking about. The Invention Security Act.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re hiding under. So, um, I just wanted to to do these first two. I&#x27;m going to do more in the in the in the future in the future now. But I just want you to pay attention to those two because those are the the two most egregious ones that I am basically going to be reviewing. But, um, there&#x27;s more.</p>
<p>Matter of fact, there&#x27;s a lot more. And some of the things you&#x27;re not even going to believe. But let&#x27;s get back to what&#x27;s going on in the world today, right? You know, this is going on in the world today, but what&#x27;s going on with this government shutdown is is is comical people. Don&#x27;t you know that the military is doing this? Every day you wake up, say that I&#x27;m in a military operation. This is a military operation.</p>
<p>When you look in the mirror, when you&#x27;re brushing your teeth, when you&#x27;re washing your face in the morning, I always tell you to think military. This government shutdown is being done by the military. How do I know? Common freaking sense. The Democrats are being blamed for shutting down the government and not getting the billions and billions of dollars that they wanted to steal from us. Well, I think it was like $1.3 trillion that they wanted to freaking steal from us for all kind of programs for health for the illegals and all this other crap, which is basically just the money laundering scheme that they&#x27;ve been doing for years to steal our money and put it in their coffers, in their crooks coffers.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s look at this logically. If the Democrats only had to vote to open up the government and not have their money not given to them, wouldn&#x27;t they do that? Wouldn&#x27;t they want their money? Let&#x27;s say you a crook, okay? And you being threatened to take away all your crooked money, billions, maybe trillions of dollars. All you have to do is vote to open up the government. You get your money. But they&#x27;re not opening it.</p>
<p>Are you freaking kidding me? And then Trump says this. &gt;&gt; And we&#x27;ll be making cuts that will be permanent. And we&#x27;re only going to cut Democrat programs. I hate to tell you. I guess that&#x27;s makes sense.</p>
<p>But we&#x27;re only cutting Democrat programs. Uh but we&#x27;re going to start that. And we have Russell who can talk to you about it if he wants to, but we&#x27;re we&#x27;ll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren&#x27;t popular with Republicans, frankly, because that&#x27;s the way it works. They wanted to do this. So, we&#x27;ll give them a little taste of their own medicine.</p>
<p>But &gt;&gt; So, what world do you live in if you think the Democrats would actually shut down the government despite their own coffers? Yes, a lot of things that Trump and them were saying that they wasn&#x27;t going to approve of, but there was a lot of things that they were going to approve of. They were going to get something. So, this is all a ploy by the military to make it look like and blame it on the Democrats while they&#x27;re trimming the fat of our government. Waste, fraud, and abuse. Remember when Doge was trying to enact those cuts and they were suing Doge and suing the government, suing Trump to not be able to cut.</p>
<p>It was going through the courts. Now they have no options. And yeah, they&#x27;re going to be court cases and all this. There&#x27;s people out there saying we&#x27;re going to fight this and you can fight it all you want, but when the government is shut down, it gives the president broad powers to cut waste, fraud, and abuse because the government is shut down. And it&#x27;s lasted how long now? Today is the 11th.</p>
<p>So, here we are six days into this government shutdown. Four more days to go. Like I think they&#x27;re going to do with the 10 days. I think this has something to do with the 10 days of darkness for the Democrats. Not for us, for the Democrats.</p>
<p>You heard Trump say, &quot;We&#x27;re just cutting Democrats program.&quot; So wouldn&#x27;t that Whoa. Whoa. He&#x27;s He&#x27;s cutting off our money. Let&#x27;s We got to open up the government. No, they&#x27;re not doing that yet because the military is not allowing it.</p>
<p>This is what&#x27;s going on. These people are pawns. They&#x27;re actors. The military is doing this. And most Americans have no clue and they&#x27;re still falling for that old, oh, the government shut down.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s cutting off these people&#x27;s jobs. Listen, our government has over 20 million people employed. That is crazy. So they&#x27;re making cuts now to make this  permanent that these people listen, you got to find someplace else to work. You&#x27;re not going to be living off the people&#x27;s dime anymore.</p>
<p>Getting free health care and free all of this other stuff that you get, free trips, free retirement, all this crap that they&#x27;ve been doing and line us getting paid all this money from us and ain&#x27;t doing nothing. They don&#x27;t do nothing. Most of them just basically posturing to get our money. So, stop falling for the con and look at what&#x27;s really going on, people. I&#x27;m in such a good mood.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to give you one more. Let&#x27;s talk about anti-gravity. You think that&#x27;s a myth? Listen to this. In 1928, physicist Thomas Townsen Brown discovered that electrically charged objects experience a force that appears to defy gravity, leading to the development of anti-gravity technology that could revolutionize transportation and space travel. His electrogravidics research successfully demonstrated controlled flight using electrical fields alone before being classified and hidden under national security restrictions that persist today.</p>
<p>Brown&#x27;s breakthrough came from observing that capacitors, devices that store electrical charge, experience a net force when charged with high voltage. The capacitors would move toward their positive electrode, creating thrust without any propellant or moving parts. This befeld brown effect suggested that electricity and gravity were connected in ways that contradicted Einstein&#x27;s general relativity. In 1952, Brown demonstrated his anti-gravity technology to military officials using discshaped capacitors that could fly around a circular course under their own power. The devices achieved speeds of several hundred mph using only electrical energy with no jets, propellers, or reaction mass of any kind.</p>
<p>The implications were staggering. Brown&#x27;s electrogravitics could enable spacecraft that didn&#x27;t require fuel, aircraft that could hover indefinitely using only battery power and transportation systems that operated silently and without environmental impact. The technology promised to revolutionize every aspect of human mobility and space exploration. Classified military research into electrogravitics began immediately with projects cenamed Winterhaven and Project Y receiving substantial funding from the Air Force and Navy. Brown was recruited to develop military applications of anti-gravity technology, including discshaped aircraft that could outperform any conventional fighter plane.</p>
<p>By 1955, Brown had developed electrogravitics devices that could lift their own power supplies and achieve sustained flight. Classified demonstrations showed discshaped craft powered by high voltage generators achieving remarkable performance characteristics that conventional aircraft couldn&#x27;t match. The research was suddenly classified in 1956 under national security orders that made public discussion of electrogravidics illegal. Brown&#x27;s patents were seized. His research facilities were closed and all documentation of anti-gravity technology was removed from public access.</p>
<p>The official explanation was that the research had failed to produce practical results. Independent investigators discovered that major aerospace companies had secretly incorporated electrogravitics research into advanced aircraft programs. Aviation Week magazine reported in 1956 that several aircraft manufacturers were developing flamejet engines and electrogravidic propulsion systems for next generation military aircraft. The suppression of Brown&#x27;s anti-gravity technology appears to have been motivated by strategic military considerations rather than scientific validity. If electrogravitics could enable revolutionary aircraft capabilities, controlling the technology would provide decisive military advantages to nations that possessed it.</p>
<p>Brown died in 1985, still prohibited from discussing his breakthrough discovery that electricity could overcome gravity. His anti-gravity technology remains classified, hidden within government laboratories, where it may have contributed to advanced aircraft programs that officially don&#x27;t exist. Now, I&#x27;m not naive to think that these crooks just confiscated all these inventions and put them in the dust bin of history. They have been developing and perfecting and using these inventions for themselves. Take for instance Tesla&#x27;s free energy.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m learning that they have been using it to con us out of our money to keep us in slavery in debt slavery mostly. They tell us that they make electricity from dams, coal, nuclear, blah blah blah, etc., etc. But in reality, these plants are extracting free energy and then charging what they see as we the stupid slaves for the delivery of the free energy. Yeah, that&#x27;s that that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about. See, this is what you got to think beyond what you&#x27;ve been taught.</p>
<p>You see all these power lines and all this other stuff that they use to deliver the electricity. It&#x27;s just a f facade to make it look like they are producing electricity but in reality they are just collecting electricity for free. They had the opportunity to do it. You don&#x27;t think they did it? Don&#x27;t be stupid. &gt;&gt; And they sell it to us and send it to us and charge us for it.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re getting it from free from the plant from the from the earth. This is what they do. JP Morgan was not was not stupid. He was a diabolical puppet of the rough child reptile family. I call them reptiles because their DNA is mostly repi reptilian.</p>
<p>They are worth so much freaking money. Trillions. Some say sex trillions. That&#x27;s a one followed by 21 zeros. I think it&#x27;s more than that because they hide all their wealth.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s almost impossible to know how much they&#x27;re really worth. It&#x27;s estimate that they collect over five quadrillions per year. They own 90% of the banks. They own so much real estate that it can&#x27;t be quantified. It could be worth a Google for all we know.</p>
<p>You know what a Google is? A Google is a one followed by a 100 zeros. That&#x27;s a lot of money. Okay? That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying. So, you think they going to just let these inventions just go into the dust bin, or would they use it to enslave us even more? I&#x27;ll let you answer that for yourself. Use common sense.</p>
<p>So, thank you for listening to this video and um hopefully you like the direction that um because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s I&#x27;m not going to be reporting the same old same old that we have been talking about here and we have been waiting for this um type of situation to happen for years. So, we&#x27;re just moving forward for the next phase. And I just want you guys to be aware that a lot of these things that what we have been waiting for are coming to fruition because they have been using this this system to keep us in the dark. And the system that&#x27;s being used in America is the Invention Security Act. Go look it up.</p>
<p>Go look it up. It was enacted in 1951. A lot of things happens in the 50s that they&#x27;ve been hiding from us. Ever since they got the uh Operation Paper Click to come over here at the end of World War II, a lot of secrecy happened after that. I wonder why.</p>
<p>Mhm. So, peace, love, truth, prosperity, and self- sovereignty to all of you guys. I&#x27;m just opening up the door. You guys go research. Tell me if I&#x27;m over the target.</p>
<p>Leave me a message, guys.</p>
