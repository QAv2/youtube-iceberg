            <p>So, how does all this connect to the what they call the observer effect where you I want to measure the particle right there. I I got to look at it. So, I shine light on it and the light sends it somewhere else. Yeah. So, I can&#x27;t actually ever know what the particle is doing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. And and so there&#x27;s two things in there. One is, as you&#x27;re saying, to look is to interact. And when you interact, say by bouncing a photon off a particle, you affect the particle &gt;&gt; because I need the photon to take the picture. &gt;&gt; That That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s one key point that emerges from these ideas &gt;&gt; that we can never know anything. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. This is on that on that. That&#x27;s the crazy thing. Y&#x27;all went on this crazy I&#x27;m sorry.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry. I got that. That is just not right. Okay. &gt;&gt; Quantum mechanics tells us that the things that you thought you could know are not the things that you can know.</p>
<p>But with quantum mechanics, we&#x27;ve made predictions of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron to 14 decimal places using a theoretical calculation. And we&#x27;ve measured it and it agrees decimal by decimal by decimal on all of those numbers. And that&#x27;s why we love these numbers. They show us that we understand what we&#x27;re doing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Okay, Brian just blew a gasket.</p>
<p>So you can know without knowing is what you&#x27;re saying. &gt;&gt; We can know. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this, Brian. The type of energy you&#x27;re bringing. All right.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. I&#x27;m in.</p>
