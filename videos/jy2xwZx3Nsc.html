            <p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s to me. Yeah, sure. I mean, I I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not, but you know what I mean? But from my limited understanding of how things work and secretive government projects that they could have a gravity propulsion system in place for decades. Yeah, it seems crazy to me, but he had something Brown had something called his wounded prairie chicken routine, which is basically showing people something called it was basically the electro-hydrodnamic effect, which is not the electrogravidic effect. So these are two very different things.</p>
<p>One is coupling again electromagnetism and gravity somehow or creating some gravity shielding or whatever. You can do this in a vacuum. And then the other thing is what you could see on YouTube videos which is associated with towns and brown where you have um basically these balsa wood structures. You have tin foil at the bottom and you have a copper wire at the top. The copper wire is the positive electrode.</p>
<p>The tin foil is the negative electrode. The copper wire is producing ions which is creating thrust because those neutral ions are bombarding the wind which is creating thrust in in a certain direction. So that is an experiment that is 95% similar to the electrogravitic</p>
