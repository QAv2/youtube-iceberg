            <p>Welcome to the forbidden frontier. [Music] &gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t know about this until the Y files brought it up in their video about this and I found it just absolutely absurd. This is insane. &gt;&gt; Disturbing. &gt;&gt; It is absolutely disturbing.</p>
<p>Yeah. That this exists. This is such a major thing. Like I feel like people need to talk about this more because you know that this still exists. Let me let me I&#x27;m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>It allows the US government to essentially take any invention and go that&#x27;s a threat to national security, right? And just lock it down in indefinitely. And the inventor is not allowed to talk about it. It&#x27;s not allowed to sell it. It&#x27;s not allowed to do anything with it unless they&#x27;re going to sell it to the US government. That &gt;&gt; it would be just given free at that point, right? Yeah, &gt;&gt; they&#x27;re basically saying anything is it&#x27;s a threat and &gt;&gt; national security the same thing that they say with a lot of out there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, what Garrett was saying earlier about, you know, World War II and all this stuff and like what I think really happened was the same people that owned stocks in oil were the same people that probably owned stocks in military and they were like, &quot;Well, we&#x27;re going to make double money if we use the tanks that run on gasoline,&quot; &gt;&gt; right? and we&#x27;ll make double money if we use the jeeps and the planes and all the stuff that use don&#x27;t use that car but use our fuel and our vehicles. I think that it&#x27;s the same people here in the same situation. The military, the same people. It continued on. This is the 50s.</p>
<p>Like Eisenhower tried warning us the military-industrial complex. You don&#x27;t think that those same people that he was warning us about, you know, have their fingers dipping in oil all around the world as well. Absolutely. So in the same time where the petrol dollar came into existence, you know, the world traded all oil on the American dollar. I mean, the amount of power in petrol the past 100 years, it&#x27;s started wars.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s brought regime changes around the world multiple multiple times. Probably easily over 10, 20. I mean, I don&#x27;t even know like how many times, whatever the powers that be. I guess the military-industrial complex is the best way to put it. But I mean that that&#x27;s why when we see these different inventors reinvent the same thing, this &gt;&gt; really really efficient engine or this zero point energy machine or whatever it is that threatens so many industries that they kind of just go, okay, well, what does it take to just threaten this guy to into silence or we could just go kill them? And in some scenarios, I think that&#x27;s what they did.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s what they did until this. Now all they have to do is call their buddy, their their governor, their senator, their homie that they&#x27;ve got on speed dial. &gt;&gt; Hey, this invention, make it disappear. &gt;&gt; Like, oh, it&#x27;s a threat to national security. Now, that line is such a  vague, abused line.</p>
<p>Like, they could do it with anything could be national security. Regime change is national security. If Saddam Hussein was able to create a whole new petro dollar on based on gold, America would lose all this power. Well, we got to take him out. You know, Gaddafi, another one.</p>
<p>You know, it&#x27;s like many examples. If they get threatened, let&#x27;s read this cuz this this is basically something that was a freaking damn &gt;&gt; to stunt humans, I think, in in the name of maintaining their power over us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. The the United States Patent and Trademark Office has the privilege of reviewing hundreds of thousands of inventions each year before the public learns about them.</p>
<p>Consequently, the US PTO is uniquely positioned as a funnel through which the government can collect information about new technologies and determine which ones have implications for the safety and welfare of the nation. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s same line. I&#x27;m from the government and I&#x27;m here to help.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like &gt;&gt; absolutely, &gt;&gt; you know, same same exact energy. We&#x27;ll do this because we don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;re capable. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re all We&#x27;re your parents. We know what&#x27;s best for you. Like, I hate that energy.</p>
<p>Under the Invention Security Act, the Commissioner for Patents may order that that invention for which patent protection is sought be kept secret if the disclosure of the invention might be detrimental to national security. Commissioner patents. &gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s one person versus maybe a &gt;&gt; Who is that? Who is that right now? How could that like that mean? &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. &gt;&gt; Say, say we didn&#x27;t have airplanes yet, right? Say we didn&#x27;t have airplanes. They This act is already out there.</p>
<p>I invent a way of flight. I then go to the patent office and say, &quot;Hey, I invented flight.&quot; They could then determine and say, &quot;Oh, well, you could put bombs on that or you could put guns on that. People can come to our country. spy on us. &gt;&gt; You could fly that above American airspace.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to have to make that secret. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s true. &gt;&gt; Now we don&#x27;t have flight. &gt;&gt; They would. &gt;&gt; You know, that&#x27;s where we are.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m I&#x27;m absolutely sure that they&#x27;ve had inventors out there inventing and they just put a kaibos on it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And this control. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, before you bring it up, before you even look. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Man or woman? &gt;&gt; I mean, &gt;&gt; woman. I was going to guess that, too. &gt;&gt; Yep. It&#x27;s a woman. is &gt;&gt; Valencia Martin Wallace.</p>
<p>Now, I&#x27;ll be honest, guys. I judge book by their covers. All right. I do. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know about you.</p>
<p>Look, I&#x27;m a changed man. &gt;&gt; I was taught don&#x27;t judge books. &gt;&gt; Commissioner of a patent. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been ruined. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s her donor history? &gt;&gt; This should be a committee if anything.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I agree 100%. one sole person acting can end up, you know, with power comes great responsibility and &gt;&gt; or um people going and giving them money. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we&#x27;ve seen people get corrupted. So, &gt;&gt; exactly. You know, &gt;&gt; three, five, seven people I think would be a much more fair &gt;&gt; way to Did you see Garrett&#x27;s face &gt;&gt; would be &gt;&gt; I just saw a more upto-date photo of this woman.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh gosh. &gt;&gt; What it&#x27;s Whoa. She ate her former self. Now that we&#x27;ve talked about this, bring that list back up. This is what publicly we know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is redacted. This is unredacted, right? So that it was redacted for a long time. &gt;&gt; 40 years. &gt;&gt; This is public. &gt;&gt; No, 50 years.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is what we know publicly that they&#x27;ve withheld from us for however long now. the stuff that&#x27;s on here probably is maybe revealed now and and is into general public and we can use some of this stuff, but like what do they have that we don&#x27;t know? &gt;&gt; Well, and how many patents have they stopped? Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Throughout the years, apparently through World War II alone, at least 11,000 inventions were submitted. Other research found that about 8,400 inventions were actually placed under secrecy.</p>
<p>This is during World War II. 75% of them hidden. &gt;&gt; Wow. Holy &gt;&gt; We could be in a whole new space right now.</p>
