            <p>I can know that you&#x27;re sitting here and I&#x27;m the measurement of that is completely sufficient for anything I might do to you or with you. But when particles are involved, which is the whole world of the quantum, if you try to measure it, the act of measuring it changes what it is you&#x27;re trying to measure. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, so the interaction with the particle confounds your ability to measure what that particle is doing with precision.</p>
<p>And I think that&#x27;s foundational. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s foundational.</p>
