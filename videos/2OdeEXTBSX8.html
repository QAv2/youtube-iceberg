            <p>but the other thing that we try to cover in these broadcasts is what&#x27;s happening with technology and that&#x27;s why we have U uh Mr Robert George from brillen energy talking to us because it&#x27;s technology that is also disrupting Our Lives we see a familiar pattern with history but that pattern can be broken in a very disruptive way when we have certain types of Technology coming in and just to give you an idea of what&#x27;s going on he sent us a defense intelligence agency analysis an unclassified analys analysis A couple of years ago of where LR is low energy nuclear reactions and what they said was this is the DIA they said it can produce uh nuclear origin energy at room temperatures and this disrupted technology could revolutionize energy production and storage since nuclear reactions release millions of times more energy per unit mass than any other known chemical fuel for example and they give this in their closing argument they say nuclear fusion releases 10 million times more energy per unit mass than does liquid Transportation fuel in other words gasoline or jet fuel or something like that and they say because this is the US government the military looking at this since the US military is the largest user of liquid fuel for transportation ler power sources could produce the greatest transformation of the battlefield for US forces since the transition from horsepower to gasoline power so this is an incredibly transforming technology if it comes true I want to talk to uh Mr George about the history of this because this something we&#x27;ve seen uh talked about for quite some time thank you for joining us uh Robert George thank you for having me let&#x27;s talk a little bit about the history here because a lot of people have heard about coal fusion and I guess we could say it&#x27;s kind of become the Rodney Dangerfield of uh of physics it gets no respect okay uh because when it first came out in 1989 you had this chemical reaction they didn&#x27;t know what was happening with it there was some unexplained effects so the big issue was was it chemical or was it nuclear they had no Theory to explain it so they basically have been having this argument for quite some time give us a little bit of the uh history of this so people understand how this has developed over the last 30 so 30 some odd years and where we are today absolutely the when ponds inflation first introduced uh in &#x27;89 the department of energy was about to release $800 million for Fusion Energy Research and they decided to hold it up um because cold fusion which was a misnomer at the time was introduced and they said well you need to investigate this before we release the money to find out if it if it&#x27;s legitimate and the ones they asked to evaluate it were MIT and Caltech and Texas A&amp;M uh to verify or invalidate the technology and uh these people were hot Fusion Advocates so they had different Technologies competing technologies that they wanted to go out and get the money for they they did they they were all hot Fusion physicist that were waiting for their budgets to be approved MIT um was one of the the the universities that discredited it um they got caught later for downshifting the data because they did see excess heat and uh it was uh there was a lawsuit resulting in their falsification of the information and they lost but they don&#x27;t bring that to the four um so when we&#x27;re talking about hot Fusion versus cold fusion and going back again you know 30 some odd years ago uh we&#x27;re talking about fusion with coal fusion fusion occurring at room temperature versus massive amounts of energy having to be put in with hot Fusion which is has not worked yet because they haven&#x27;t been able to get something that has a net uh increase in production of energy they they basically can&#x27;t recoup what they have to put in it to get it hot so you&#x27;re talking about a situation that where Fusion is occurring at room temperature is what people are looking at or now they&#x27;re calling it a low energy nuclear reaction what has happened in the intervening years that show that it&#x27;s not just excess heat but there&#x27;s other things that have come out that let them give a hint that uh there&#x27;s really Fusion going on here well since 1989 there have been scientists all over the world that have been testing and working on on this phenomenon um the most recent ones U the NASA the spy wars group U Down in San Diego they got 30 times excess heat out of their unit U energetics technology that came out of Israel and is now at the University of Missouri they also were verified at getting 30 times excess heat U most of the people that were discrediting the field were saying well it&#x27;s an hybrid chemical reaction and um you know the proof was was lacking to verify that this was actually a nuclear reaction and we&#x27;ve taken samples out of our boiler and sent it down to Los Alamos and had a scientist down there verify that uh it actually is a nuclear reaction and unlike the uranium nuclear reactions there are no hazardous byproducts the byproducts of exciting hydrogen which is the fuel uh is basically heat and helium and we&#x27;ve had uh Silicon Valley scientists from some of the major companies here in the valley as well as the people from the naval research lab in Washington come out with their radiation detectors to to verify if there&#x27;s any harmful radiation coming from our system so what you&#x27;re looking at is essentially you&#x27;re looking at the transmutation of hydrogen with a end product of helium and so because you have that uh that process where it goes from duum to trium you can that only happens if it&#x27;s a nuclear reaction that&#x27;s going on there and then that trium quickly decays into a helium byproduct which is not a dangerous thing going on there but they can see two things they can see nuclear activities going on they can see that there&#x27;s a transmutation of elements which shows that there is something going on there that is nuclear is that right that&#x27;s absolutely correct and the interesting thing is that the the tridium is basically part of the fuel cycle and if you&#x27;re generating excess heat then you don&#x27;t build up the amount of trium in the system and in fact that&#x27;s how we met the scientist down in Los Alamos they had looked at our website and looked at our PowerPoint and in our patents and and basically were trying to replicate it and they were getting trium but they weren&#x27;t getting excess heat and they asked what they were doing wrong and and our chief scientist and the the inventor and founder Robert goddess basically went through the process they were using and showed him how to get excess heat out of the process now we talking about the excess heat and of course that that&#x27;s a key thing for power generation I mean most of um you know we look at a nuclear power plant and as uh Einstein said or or one of the nuclear physicists said that&#x27;s a a heck of a way to boil water but I mean that&#x27;s the way you generate power right you create uh you you burn uh some kind of a fossil fuel or you burn wood or you create a nuclear reaction and then that creates heat that then creates Steam and drives turbines and so forth and so on that&#x27;s the way you generate uh Power so when we&#x27;re looking at uh creation of heat that&#x27;s a very important thing you&#x27;re talking about uh a a piece of equipment that has is a 30 times increase in heat it seems to me whether or not that is Fusion or not that would be something somebody would want to uh continue with as a technology and develop that to me it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether it&#x27;s chemical or whether it is a fusion or nuclear reaction uh I would still want to try to uh en enhance that and and uh make that work well since the University&#x27;s discredited it uh since &#x27; 89 it&#x27;s been political suicide or AC mic suicide to even work on it in in universities um most in the last three years we&#x27;ve tried to get the National Labs to do uh material analysis for us and isotopic Analysis on our cores uh just to verify uh what the systems are actually occurring in in there we&#x27;re willing to pay them for it and their response has been this is too controversial we can&#x27;t work on it that&#x27;s amazing but you know this is not something that we haven&#x27;t seen in other fields as well you have vested interests whether whether it&#x27;s in drugs or whether it&#x27;s in particular types of food or whether it&#x27;s in energy you have the vested interests that are there and they don&#x27;t want to run the studies to show that some alternative would be cheaper more uh economical more environmentally friendly they essentially shut that down and not only do they not fund it but they demonize it they ridicule it they do everything they can to uh censor it and and that&#x27;s essentially what we&#x27;re seeing here with low energy nuclear reactions isn&#x27;t it yes this could actually shift us off a lot of the petroleum usage uh from Cars to airplanes uh to diesel trucks and buses uh this could be very dramatic we have two products currently one that would be suitable for home heating which operates at about uh 80 degrees to 8 150° C or domestic hot water and then we have another one that&#x27;s a gas phase system that operates at 600° C that&#x27;s suitable for generating electricity and could repower Coal Power powered power plants and so those are the systems that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where you are right now in terms of of your state-ofthe-art so you&#x27;ve got essentially something that could replace a water heater as well as something else that could uh generate electricity and and what are the inputs to your systems basically the thing that&#x27;s been missing from the field all these years is a control system there have been scientists all over the world that are getting this excess heat as I mentioned earlier the spy wars people the NASA people uh the problem has been uh being able to start the reaction uh when you want it to and be able to start it stop it when you need to and uh uh Robert goddess devel is an electrical engineer a multi-discipline engineer and developed a control system we call a c pulse that actually uh if for the home heating system for example when you turn up your thermostat you want the heat to come on immediately and so our reaction starts immediately and when you turn off the C pulse it immediately stops so there&#x27;s no chance of the system running away and and if it runs away it just it&#x27;s just hot water so it doesn&#x27;t really matter so is this something we&#x27;re likely to see sometime in the uh in the near future I&#x27;m thinking of a Mr Fusion machine like we saw in the DeLorean and Back to the Future are we going to be are we going to see this in a nice uh uh containerized thing or are you still trying to get financial backing to do this and trying to fight the censorship and the Prejudice and the scientific Community against this to to get this develop all of the above we&#x27;ve raised about $13 million over the last 10 years uh to develop the systems we have a system operating under scientists down at SRI International because of the controversy in the field we wanted independent scientists verifying our results in our system uh hands off from us and uh that&#x27;s been going very well uh and as a result of our work although we&#x27;ve had very little interest in the United States uh the defense authorization act has just recently added LR to their bill but we&#x27;ve licensed a South Korean firm a manufacturer multi-million dollar license to start manufacturing and distributing it in South Korea we have a license in Canada as well um but there&#x27;s been very little interest or support in the United States and this is where we need it the most and you know quite frankly I I think a lot of that is is due to politics I mean we look at how deeply embedded uh the oil business is in terms of the banking business you know we&#x27;ve got the Petro dollar that was created as they took us off the go standard they created a fiat currency with cooperation of Saudi Arabia and it&#x27;s having the ability to print that money without anything behind it and then use that as the uh uh the medium of exchange for all the oil that has really been the Bedrock of our financial system here in America is a Petro dollar so there has to be a tremendous amount of political pressure not to do that and yet on the other hand this is such a disruptive technology and there&#x27;s every other country essentially is working with this we&#x27;ve got this uh document that you gave me that is six years old from the defense intelligence agency they point out how it&#x27;s Japan and Italy are are pretty far along in research but of course China Russia India all these uh countries France as well they&#x27;re all have their own uh research project so in that sense you have to move forward with doing the research or you get left behind yes we&#x27;ve been very fortunate to have Angel Investors that have have come in and are supporting the the company U the technology is disruptive as you said uh and uh the carbon based industry is so well entrenched that it&#x27;s difficult for them to look at this kind of Technology as something that&#x27;s going to be useful and necessary um most people confuse what we&#x27;re doing with hydrogen and water is using it as a a fuel as a combustible fuel but hydrogen is a nuclear fuel has so much higher energy density as an example uh if if you take the volume of water contained in the in the area of a number three pencil eraser and just take the hydrogen out of that volume of water it&#x27;s equivalent to 2 38 gallon barrels of gasoline that&#x27;s the energy density that we&#x27;re talking about wow so so the boiler that we have de developed for the home heating system which is a 2 liter vessel has one liter of water in it with electrolyte and that amount of water is capable of heating your home for for 10 or 15 years wow that is amazing and and of course that that&#x27;s an idea of just how disruptive this is that that Gores a lot of people&#x27;s uh cash cows when you do something that it would be a very freeing technology and we we seem to have a history in this country of technologies that uh that free us technologies that are clean uh being shut down and and that&#x27;s the the amazing thing about this it it really is and uh this will be the first time you could have a home heating system that you could actually calculate your return on investment because all you&#x27;ll need is electricity to stimulate the reaction let me let me get some idea about how far away you are with this now this is is this something that um you know you have a working model uh that that you&#x27;ve got here you&#x27;re looking for investors to try to uh Market this is is that what the uh the issue is here you&#x27;ve already got uh uh some Set uh products you&#x27;ve got the um uh what was it called the wet um the wet boiler as well as a hydrogen hot tube those are the two products that you had just described earlier I mean are those ready to go to market and we&#x27;ll take your answer when you come back we got to go to a break and we&#x27;re going to be right back we&#x27;re talking to Robert George he&#x27;s with brillan energy corporation and it is a company that is looking at low energy nuclear reactions and they have a couple of systems here as he pointed out just a a little bit of water power your house for years okay this is amazingly disruptive technology if we don&#x27;t do it in America somebody else will but there&#x27;s a lot of political resistance welcome back to the Alex Jones Show I&#x27;m David night we&#x27;re talking to a gentleman with brillan energy corporation about uh his company efforts to create cold fusion as it&#x27;s been known in the past but as they&#x27;re referring to today low energy nuclear reactions before we get back to them I just want to remind you that our specials that we&#x27;ve had since the 28h hour uh Marathon sale that we had last week we&#x27;ve had three specials that we&#x27;ve extended uh through this week those are going to be ending this weekend because we&#x27;re going to be running out of stock it&#x27;s been very successful we really appreciate your support on this it&#x27;s vital for us as well as a a way that we can fund our operation without being uh dependent on big companies who uh would shut us down with the types of things we talk about I mean we&#x27;re talking about a very disruptive technology here we talk about very disruptive politics here and uh that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important for us to self-fund our operation it&#x27;s why we appreciate your support and it&#x27;s why we offer these kinds of sales and appre appreciation and so we&#x27;ve extended this 40% off on brain Force 30% off on vitamin mineral fusion and 30% off DNA force that is our very expensive difficult to produce uh formulation has biopqq you can look that up there&#x27;s 175 clinical studies that talk about how effective biopqq is you can look at the reviews for all these products as well as everything that we sell at infowarsstore.com see what other people say that uh their experiences have been with that and of course because DNA course is so difficult to produce so expensive to produce that 30% savings is a huge discount so take advantage of that now as well as a 30% off vitamin mineral Fusion drink mix and the 40% off brainforce and we have storewide free shipping that we have extended as well as a thank you to you to help you take advantage of this to provide for your health your family&#x27;s health and to fund our operation thank you so much for your support you&#x27;ll find that all at infowarsstore.com I want to go back to uh Mr Robert George with brillin energy you know Mr George when I&#x27;m looking at things like U the the issues that we&#x27;ve been seeing with Tesla they just had their corporate sales come out they have been in operation for 13 years uh they have lost money every quarter except one that&#x27;s not really a good record and yet their stock has multiplied by factor of 12 they keep passing this on they&#x27;re under investigation by the SEC at the current time but nevertheless I see these large corpor operations like Tesla like uber because Uber is going to be part of the disruptive technologies that are going to U hand over control of our transportation to the government where they can uh tax and track US it&#x27;ll also uh make it difficult for us to uh afford Transportation so when we look at things that line up with the political agenda of the establishment we see these people kind of get everything the the the the way is is cleared for them uh Wall Street helps them the government helps them to to uh take down obstacles and yet when we look at something like this that is very disruptive as you were saying in the last segment what was it some water that&#x27;s about the size of a pencil combined with your device would power your home&#x27;s energy needs for about 10 or 15 years that&#x27;s an amazingly uh transformative and freeing technology uh it it&#x27;s but it&#x27;s difficult for you to U uh get this out into the marketplace because Wall Street has some vested interests in the existing energy infrastructures don&#x27;t they absolutely when we took it to Wall Street they looked at the upside potential of this kind of technology and said it&#x27;s worth trillions you&#x27;re only trying to raise 15 to 20 million dollars it makes no sense we can&#x27;t do that gotta go big yeah well that&#x27;s certainly what we&#x27;ve seen with ubber and Tesla you you got to be uh you got to be out there and and kind of brash I guess to get their attention but you also have to be politically connected uh maybe you should do some crowd sourcing or take this on Shark Tank or something like that uh certainly wish you luck with this and U thank you so much for talking to us about it uh we hope that this is going to be something that is going to free us with technology because too often we see technology being used to suppress our freedoms this is something would have a very freeing effect I believe that&#x27;s it for today&#x27;s broadcast uh join us tonight at 7 central 800m eastern for the Infowars Nightly News</p>
