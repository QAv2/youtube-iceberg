            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>There&#x27;s like a 8 foot person beside it [music] and another one&#x27;s inside and it has big eyes and is looking at us and it&#x27;s still there. &gt;&gt; Okay. Where is this on your property? &gt;&gt; Uh uh in my backyard. [music] &gt;&gt; I swear to God this is not a joke. This is actually we terrified.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So there&#x27;s two people or two subjects that are in your backyard. [music] &gt;&gt; Correct. And they&#x27;re very large. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re like 8 foot 9 ft 10 foot. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re they look like they look like aliens to us. big eyes. They have big eyes like like I can&#x27;t explain it. And big mouth tiny eyes and &gt;&gt; and they&#x27;re not human. 100% they&#x27;re not human.</p>
<p>[music] [music] Welcome to Extraterrestrial Reality. Legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg has a big movie set to come out this summer called Disclosure Day. uh he&#x27;s going to be revisiting his roots uh in this new uh science fiction endeavor and apparently it&#x27;s going to be about uh the world finding out about the truth that we&#x27;re not alone. Uh but however, I just want to say this disclosure has already happened folks. It&#x27;s we&#x27;ve already been there.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve already seen it. Um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m starting to wonder right actually you know that you know the evidence is out there now that shows there&#x27;s no question about it that we are not alone. It&#x27;s there for the whole world to see with their own eyes, right? and and they could absorb that information and they could uh you know take it from there. However, uh we&#x27;re gonna still play makeelieve, right? And that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m sure that this movie is going to be fantastic.</p>
<p>I in fact, I can&#x27;t wait to see it. I I love Stephen Spielberg movies ever since I was a little kid back in the 1970s. In fact, you know what? The first movie I saw that Steven Spielberg directed was Close Encounters of the Third Kind. My dad had taken my uh my brother Davey and me to see that movie. Uh it was sometime in the first quarter of 19 that movie was released late 1977 but by the time it got to the local movie theater where uh we used to go uh the Capitol theater in Shannondo Pennsylvania it was so it was a few months after it was initially released but that&#x27;s when I went to see that movie and uh I thought it was fantastic and and then I guess it was a year or so maybe the same year I don&#x27;t know I saw Jaws for the first time when it premiered on HBO and I couldn&#x27;t believe how good that movie was.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#x27;s my one of my favorite movies. Top three actually. You know, King Kong, you know, Jaws and I don&#x27;t know, maybe Treasure Sarah Madre, you know, might might throw those in the top three. I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not even sure here. But but the bottom line is Close Encounters of the Third Kind was a fantastic movie.</p>
<p>And he just always was he&#x27;s always been making great movies. I mean, growing up seeing Steven Spielberg movies, I can&#x27;t tell you what that meant. You know, going to the movies when I was 12 years old in 1981 to see Raiders of the Lost Arc. Oh my god, what a fantastic movie that was. And of course that was a collaboration with George Lucas who he he worked on the story on that one.</p>
<p>And then of course in &#x27; 82 he had ET the extraterrestrial which was you know one of the biggest money-making movies of all time. Actually all of these movies we&#x27;re talking about. All these movies that he&#x27;s been making over the decades. A lot of them have been or box office champions. I mean it&#x27;s not just the Indiana Jones movies that he&#x27;s made.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s not just ET the extraterrestrial or Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I mean, you have Jurassic Park. I mean, that was gigantic in 1993 when it came out. Schindler&#x27;s List came out the same year. I always wondered, how could this guy come out with two giant big movies in the same year like that? But he did it.</p>
<p>I mean, the guy&#x27;s a a fantastic filmmaker. The Color Purple. I mean, there was just so many good movies that this guy is responsible for. Uh, and even some of his lesser appraised movies like uh this, what was it? The one with Tom Cruz, Minority Report. There was other movies that he&#x27;s made.</p>
<p>But now, here we go. We&#x27;re going to have a movie about uh Disclosure Day. And according, you know, there&#x27;s not much on the story yet, but you could see from the trailer. In fact, the other night I I saw the trailer. Again, I saw the trailer a couple of weeks ago, I guess, on the internet, but then I went to the movies the other day.</p>
<p>My son wanted me to go see some movie uh called Iron Lung. So, we went to this movie called Iron Lung, and they showed about 25 trailers before the movie started. And uh one of the one of the uh uh previews was for Disclosure Day and it looks very interesting, right? It looks like that in one scene there looks like there&#x27;s a a woman about to tell the truth to the world while she&#x27;s given a weather report and there&#x27;s all these eyeballs watching the news. I I really can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s going on. According to the internet here, it says uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a mo science fiction movie that follows a small group led by a character played by Josh O&#x27; Conor who discover definitive proof of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>The plot centers on their struggle to reveal this truth to the world to the world amid government suppression and widespread panic. [gasps] I I I&#x27;m sure that this movie is going to be fantastic. Again, Spielberg is one of my favorite directors, one of my favorite movie makers. It&#x27;s not just directing. He&#x27;s he&#x27;s been involved in so many different movies.</p>
<p>He he&#x27;s produced a lot of great movies, I think, too, as well. A lot of movies that he had his fingers in, like for instance, the Back to the Future movies or or Poltergeist. I mean, he was he helped make that original poltergeist back in 1982. So many great great things he&#x27;s been involved in over the years. And I I expect that this one will be uh just as thrilling as as his other ones.</p>
<p>I mean, I I you know, he&#x27;s he he has made some flops throughout the years like uh 1941, there was a comedy movie back from what what year was that? 79. That was a big flop. So, every now and then he does come out with movies that nobody likes. Uh, but for the most part, his movies are classics and I would expect that this one&#x27;s going to be a blockbuster. It&#x27;s about aliens.</p>
<p>I mean, how could he go wrong? Spielberg and Aliens, how could you go wrong? And uh, but the bottom line is this is we we&#x27;ve already have disclosure. Everybody here on this planet at at this juncture in time should know, right? There&#x27;s no question at this point. Everyone should just know. I mean, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the problem here is the mainstream news. It&#x27;s the governments of the world, the the top governments of the world keeping this from the people.</p>
<p>We all know it. A lot of us who study this know this, right? It&#x27;s the disclosure. It&#x27;s already here. Look at what we what&#x27;s look what&#x27;s going on in Congress. You know, whistleblowers testifying under oath about strange encounters with UFOs, about uh government programs to recover crashed UFOs and and reverse engineer them.</p>
<p>I mean, we have what else do we need at this point? And then on top of it all, as I&#x27;ve been talking about now for almost two years, even though the incident happened almost 3 years ago, but it wasn&#x27;t until about two years ago, close to two years, where we have evidence that shows without any doubt whatsoever there&#x27;s a non-human intelligent presence on this planet. And you know what we&#x27;re talking I&#x27;m talking about there. That&#x27;s the Las Vegas case. But you you go back to the beginning. Go back to Kenneth Arnold back in 1947 when he reported seeing those nine crescent-shaped objects uh flying at incredible speeds over Mount Reneer in Washington State.</p>
<p>You start there, right? That&#x27;s the beginning of disclosure. That guy wasn&#x27;t lying. And then there was so many other witnesses that saw these UFOs at, you know, during that period as well. Look at 1950, the McMinnville incident. the Trent.</p>
<p>Uh Paul and Evelyn Trent saw a UFO hovering near their house uh in in in Oregon in Mcmminville, Oregon, and they took a took a couple snapshots. Paul Trent took a couple snapshots of it. That&#x27;s disclosure. That was featured in Life magazine. That story was featured in Life magazine at that at that time.</p>
<p>There was the big UFO flap in 1952 where UFOs were were flying over Washington DC and there was nothing anybody could do about it. Our Air Force could do nothing about it. And then they come out and just say there&#x27;s nothing to it. It could be the a weather inver weather issue, a weather phenomenon. That&#x27;s all it was.</p>
<p>When we everybody here, everybody knows that it wasn&#x27;t. And it just goes on like this. And you you have the alien abductees uh stories all these years starting with the Betty and Barney Hill and even before that if you want to talk about uh Antonio Villis Boas. I mean you all these stories and all the people that have stepped forward in in the decades after that after the decades after uh uh Betty and Barney Hill went public with their with their story and it was the subject of that book the interrupted journey uh back in the mid1 1960s and all the different people that have talked about being abducted by aliens over the decades all the different books that have been uh written about this all the all the research that&#x27;s been conducted by numerous people all over all over the world right for for decades Now we there&#x27;s something here the cattle mutilations to this point which have not been explained. Right? We already have disclosure.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just a matter of the mainstream news just sitting down and putting it in put putting a presentation together and saying, &quot;Yeah, guess what folks? We&#x27;re not alone. This shows it. There&#x27;s just too much evidence at this point.&quot; The Turkey UFO videos from 2007208 2009. You have that Turkish guy uh Yaen Yaan who over the numerous different uh nights uh filming with a with a with a video recorder over the Sea of Marra capturing craft hovering out there with alien beings in them. And it was looked at by experts from multiple different countries and they all came to the same conclusion that this is truly anomalous.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t have we have no explanation to what&#x27;s happening here. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s some phenomena we cannot explain. That&#x27;s because it it there there was no they found no evidence of of fraud or hoax or anything like that. It was real and they so what else could they say? Well, we can&#x27;t explain it. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a true phenomenon.</p>
<p>What what you what you see there is what was there and it just you just keep going down the list. I mean look at someone like Whitley Strieber for instance, you know, when he when he wrote that book Communion, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s disclosure. He&#x27;s telling you what happened to him because it really did happen to him. I mean he he was getting abducted by aliens. That&#x27;s what happened to him and he wrote about it in communion and he continued to write books after and he&#x27;s still talking about it decades later.</p>
<p>All of these things uh that they all constitute disclosure to me. All the people that have stepped stepped up and talked about what they know about the Roswell UFO crash starting with from Jesse Marcel Senior, Jesse Marcel Jr. all the way to to the Walter Hout all those different people that were involved. All the military witnesses that stepped forward and had the guts to go against the what the United States Pentagon was telling them uh don&#x27;t say anything about this. This is top secret.</p>
<p>After a long after much time had passed, they finally started coming out of the woodwork and telling the truth about what happened there. Something crashed and there were alien bodies and we&#x27;ve been getting lied to about all of this stuff by the government by people in the Pentagon, a secret control group. That&#x27;s all we majestic 12 whatever you want to call it right somebody has been responsible for keeping this a secret not only in the United States but in all these all different countries all of our allies right and and I&#x27;m sure in within our en enemy countries that the United States considers enemies like China and Russia they know about this they&#x27;re all keeping it a secret too they&#x27;re all trying to figure out how these things tick secretly just so they could use it against each other that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to do right but here&#x27;s the bottom line is that we already we&#x27;ve already had disclosure and you know what how it was treated it was treated like it was nothing. It was laughed at. Look, look at what just happened over the last year.</p>
<p>The History Channel, three strikes, you&#x27;re out. The History Channel, three different programs. The Proof is out there. Uh, and then Ancient Aliens. And then finally, the Dan Akroids, the the Unbelievable with Dan Akroyd program, right? All three of those programs talked about the Las Vegas alien incident of 2023, but they spend a total between all three of those episodes, maybe five or six minutes at at best.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t even It wasn&#x27;t a lot. They didn&#x27;t focus on that incident a lot. They poo pooed it. They they didn&#x27;t talk about all of the evidence associated with that case when when when Scott Roer, the crime scene reconstruction expert, sat down with me uh two years ago. It was uh a it was April 2nd of of 2024 when he was able to determine uh that what we see in this vid this 1 minute and 41 second long cell phone footage that was uh filmed that was captured by the Kenmore family in in uh during the early morning hours of May 1st 2023.</p>
<p>He they he confirmed he authenticated that video and what we see in the video were aliens. What happened was some sort of an object came out of the sky, made a hard landing in the backyard of this family in uh family&#x27;s backyard in Vegas. Alien creatures exited that craft and they were captured on on video by these people who then called 911 up because they didn&#x27;t know what to do. The cops showed up an hour later. The cops saw that these people were totally rattled.</p>
<p>Right. It was it was a sub it was a big story for a few months there and then it died down a little bit and then it picked up a little bit when Scott Rotor made his uh announcement in on April 2nd 2024 that this that this really happened. He was a him and his team were able to confirm that there was something that actually happened there that involved non-human intelligent beings that those people were not lying. [gasps] But you know what, and there were some some news channels out there and and mainstream news news outlets like News Nation, they covered a little bit, but they never got into it deeply. It was just a, you know, little 5 minute, 10-minute segment here, another 10-minute, 5 minute segment there, and then they just let it go.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t make a big deal out of it. Nobody else, even though they were alerted to it, the New York Times was told about this recently, they never they&#x27;re not doing anything with it. The I I&#x27;ve actually contacted the Pentagon and the Department of Energy. They never responded to any any of the messages that I sent to them two years ago now. Almost.</p>
<p>Well, let&#x27;s see. What was it? 2024. Yeah, almost two years ago. Year year and a half ago. Uh, who else was I I told the uh the UAP caucus knows about this.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve done nothing with it. Nobody wants to talk about it because they know what it means. Fox News Digital was the only outlet that really took it seriously for a little while during the summer of 2024, but once the Pentagon got contacted, then they backed away somewhat. They don&#x27;t want to talk about it. But here&#x27;s the bottom line, folks.</p>
<p>We have already, if you want to know whether or not we&#x27;re alone or not, just look at what happened with the Las Vegas case. I&#x27;ve done I don&#x27;t know how many shows about this over the past couple of years, but a lot. I can&#x27;t I lost count, right? Last I think I counted was maybe maybe 50, 60, 70. I don&#x27;t even know. I talk about it a lot on here because I know what it means.</p>
<p>I know that there&#x27;s no wiggling out of this one. Debunkers won&#x27;t even try to debunk it because they know they can&#x27;t. The best we got was from Mick West, right, who said it was he thought it was could be raccoons or coyotes. When you clearly see when you watch that video, it&#x27;s not coyotes or raccoons. That&#x27;s insanity.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a blatant lie. That&#x27;s blatant gaslighting. See, here&#x27;s the thing, folks. We already have the proof. It&#x27;s already out there, right? We already disclosure already happened.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re interested, right? It&#x27;s there for for the taking. It&#x27;s always been there. Does you you don&#x27;t even need to look at that case. Just look at the history of this. Get some books by Richard Dolan who who a historian who&#x27;s been writing about this in books like UFOs and a national security state, right? Volume one and volume two.</p>
<p>Read those books, right? See what how the government&#x27;s been keeping us a secret for all these years. You know, check out Preston Dennis uh YouTube channel or read some of Preston Dennis books about all the different kinds of crazy encounters people have reported over the years with UFOs, aliens, abductions, all kinds of stuff, right? All of these people aren&#x27;t lying, right? Look at all the cases that Muon has been investigating over the decades. It&#x27;s unbelievable, folks. The amount of evidence that we have at this point makes it clear that we&#x27;re not alone. So, we&#x27;re going to have a movie here, which I&#x27;m excited to see.</p>
<p>I I I really think it&#x27;s going to be fantastic. How could it not be? Steven Spielberg&#x27;s involved in it, right? I mean, I I think he&#x27;s one of the best, if you know, if not the best of all time. One of the best directors we&#x27;ll ever get to see in this in this existence, right? And that movie, I&#x27;m sure, will be very exciting, just like a lot of his other movies have been. But the bottom line is there&#x27;s this we&#x27;ve already had disclosure. We&#x27;ve been getting disclosure every day since 1947.</p>
<p>If you can&#x27;t see it by this point, especially at this by this point, right? Uh then there&#x27;s something wrong with you. Then you&#x27;re walking around with blinders on. You just don&#x27;t want to accept it. You want like I don&#x27;t know. I I don&#x27;t know how it would, you know, apparently disclosure day is a the movie is going to be about a way to, you know, let all seven billion people on this planet figure out find out all at the same time that we&#x27;re not alone.</p>
<p>Everybody should know this already. We&#x27;ve have the the evidence is there for anyone who wants to take a look at it. There&#x27;s no question there&#x27;s a non-human intelligent presence here. Whether they&#x27;re extraterrestrial or not, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s up for debate. Who knows? I think that that that&#x27;s what they probably are.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s still up for debate. Maybe it&#x27;s something from here. Maybe they&#x27;re from another dimension. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not a scientist.</p>
<p>Where&#x27;s the scientific community at? That&#x27;s the other thing. Where are they at? There&#x27;s some guys that have been stepping over stepping up over the decades, right? But for the most part, most of the scientific community just stays away from this. they don&#x27;t want to go near it because they don&#x27;t even know what to say about it. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s they it&#x27;s such a uh you know, you have a responsibility if you&#x27;re a scientist, you should have a you have a responsibility to look into these things and take them seriously, especially at this point when you have evidence that shows unequivocally that we are not alone at this point. There&#x27;s no question about it.</p>
<p>You look at that Las Vegas evidence, there&#x27;s no getting around it anymore, right? There&#x27;s just no getting around it. I mean, the object came down from the sky. People were saying it was a meteor. No, it couldn&#x27;t have been a meteor. It didn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t have a heat signature.</p>
<p>It was filmed under longwave infrared and it showed no heat signature. That&#x27;s if it was a meteor, there would have been a heat signature. It also made some sort of an oscillating sound as it came down from the sky, right? And and from one viewpoint of that thing when it was falling from the sky, it looked like there were two objects, not just one. There was a big one and a little one. A little one right beside of it, depending on the angle that you were looking at it from.</p>
<p>Something weird happened during that uh April right just before midnight April 30th 2023 May 1st and then just after midnight May 1st 2023 something landed in a in a family&#x27;s backyard in Las Vegas uh at and it was like a hard landing whatever it was we don&#x27;t know what kind of object it was but it became invisible upon impact. That&#x27;s what we do know. And then the next thing they the witnesses said they heard what sounded like thousands of footsteps. They told the cops that there were uh they saw two 8 to 10 foot tall alien beings in their backyard, right? They were serious about this. They were serious about it, right? And then when we examined that video, that 1 minute and 41 second long video filmed in portrait style, no less, I found at least over there&#x27;s over 20 at least 20 different times more than 20 times you see aliens in that in that video.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no denying it anymore. The evidence is there for anyone to see it. So, disclosure day. Yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to be a fantasy. It&#x27;s a madeup story.</p>
<p>Steven Spielberg came up with it himself and he had some other guy write the screenplay for it. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to be great. But guess what, folks? We&#x27;ve already had Disclosure Day. It&#x27;s over. Like we Scott Roer and I were talking about, it&#x27;s just up to the rest of the world to to get on to this latch on to this evidence.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s been over for almost two years now. But I just wanted to point that out. Uh I do look forward to seeing this movie. However, at the same time, we&#x27;ve already had disclosure, folks.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve been getting it getting getting it for decades now. And if you can&#x27;t see the truth by this point, then there&#x27;s something wrong with you. [snorts] Anyway, moving on. I want to get caught up on the recent Spotify polls. And uh we&#x27;re going to start with the for the episode, the weird creatures US Marines vet Marvin Jacobs saw on a UFO when he was 9 years old.</p>
<p>I asked this question. Are these beings trying to tell us to get a grip? Uh now of course if you remember that episode uh that was a sequel to the first part where I had an interview with Marvin Jacobs. He was a he&#x27;s a retired Marine Corps vet and [snorts] he had uh exper multiple experiences throughout his life and in one instance he was brought on board a craft in 1986 and he was shown images of the end of the world. Uh basically the United States was getting attacked by NATO alli allies including Germany apparently and uh the next thing you know it was the end of the world and he was shown this and without any comment from the aliens whatsoever and then that was it. He he he thought it was silly all these years but now with the way things are in the world he&#x27;s starting to wonder if maybe what he was shown back then was a glimpse of the future and uh and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re ask that that&#x27;s what this question was about.</p>
<p>Are these beings trying to tell us to get a grip? Okay, 33 votes so far with 3 days left only. Okay, eight people or 24.2% say no while 25 people or 75.8% say yes. Uh I agree with the majority with the yeses. I think that they are trying to tell us to get a grip. I think they&#x27;ve been trying to tell us to get a grip for a long time now.</p>
<p>Uh I don&#x27;t know what their ultimate agenda entails, whether it is taking over the world or whatever, but at the same time it seems like they have been concerned about uh particularly our nuclear weapons. That&#x27;s what they seem to have a concern concern about. They&#x27;ve been seeing it a lot. A lot of our uh nuclear missile silos. They shut missiles down.</p>
<p>They activate them and then you know it&#x27;s almost like they&#x27;re trying to give us a message. So message. So I do think that they are trying to tell us to get a grip. All right. For the episode maybe they&#x27;re looking for a fight.</p>
<p>Uh, and that with that episode that was about I wondered whether the uh I put out the hypothesis that maybe the extraterrestrial non-human intelligent presence here is just looking for to get into a fight with us, but right now we&#x27;re so stupid that we that that we we we were just incapable of putting up a good fight. Maybe that&#x27;s what it is. And I came up with a new theory called the deferred adversarial contact theory. And uh basically till we till they&#x27;re trying to they&#x27;re trying to get us to a they want us to get to a point where we&#x27;re able to fight back, you know, and put up a fight. That was the that was the uh idea behind that episode.</p>
<p>And I asked this question. Do you consider the deferred adversarial contact theory as a legitimate possibility? All right, 28 votes so far with 5 days left. Uh 10 people or 35.7% say yes while the majority 18 people or 64.3% say no. Um yeah [snorts] where do I stand now? It was my idea. So where do I stand on it stand on it? Uh I I&#x27;d say yes.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what the I don&#x27;t I think anything&#x27;s a possibility. I don&#x27;t know how to We don&#x27;t know much about these things at all really when it comes down to it. Right. So yeah, I&#x27;ll say yeah. It&#x27;s a legitimate possibility.</p>
<p>You know why not? I don&#x27;t. So, I&#x27;ll go I&#x27;m going to go with the minority on this one. All right. For the episode, Scott Rotor debunks M Miami Mall alien incident, discusses other major UFO cases. I asked this question.</p>
<p>Do you agree with Rotor&#x27;s assessment on the Miami Mall alien incident? Of course, in that episode, uh, Rotor said he just looked at all of the evidence that was out there on this case, and there just not enough there to say that it was that it really happened. So, uh, let&#x27;s see. 25 votes so far with 10 days left. Okay. Eight people or 32% say no while the majority 17 people or 68% say yes.</p>
<p>I agree with the majority. Uh I I I haven&#x27;t seen enough evidence in that with that case. I mean I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a done deal. But as at this point I just there&#x27;s just not enough there. There just not enough there.</p>
<p>So I&#x27;m I&#x27;m saying I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s at this point I say no. There&#x27;s nothing to it. All right. All right, for the episode interview, woman videoed possible NHI on cell phone after bizarre teleportation event. Now, of course, this was involving a woman uh from California named Street Capture who back in 2018, her and her former partner uh Kell, these are all pseudonyms were uh they had some missing time.</p>
<p>They had a teleportation incident and also they um they also encountered some aliens at at her grandmother&#x27;s house. Uh but anyway, for that episode I asked this question. Were Street Capture and Kell teleported by aliens that night in 2018. 23 votes so far with 12 days left. Okay.</p>
<p>Nine people or 39.1% say no while 14 people or 60.9% say yes. Uh I I go with the majority. I think that yes, they were teleported for reasons unknown. Uh if you haven&#x27;t seen that interview, I would I suggest you check it out. uh cuz I thought that uh Street Capture was uh very compelling and she provided a very detailed story and we went over it.</p>
<p>Uh we tried to cover every aspect of what happened to her and I think what she said happened happened and then she also had some evidence uh what might be aliens that she captured on her cell phone in her grandmother&#x27;s backyard on top of it. So, yes, I I do believe that something very strange and happened to them and that it looks like they were teleported somehow uh that night. All right, for the episode, we best heed alien warnings of destruction or we might face Armageddon. I asked this question. Should we take the alien message of world destruction seriously? Okay.</p>
<p>Now, this is of course uh follow in followup to some of the stuff we&#x27;ve been talking about on the show recently, including uh the remarks by Marvin Jacobs about what he was shown. He was shown that there&#x27;s going the end of the world&#x27;s going to be coming of apparently unless we do something to stop it. Uh so, uh what what are people saying? Should should we should the should we take that message seriously? 34 votes so far with 13 days left. Okay. Six people or 17.6% say no.</p>
<p>While the majority, 28 people or 82.4% say yes. We cannot afford to not take it seriously. That&#x27;s how that&#x27;s where I stand at it. Uh I know here&#x27;s the thing. I know something&#x27;s here.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve encountered one of these beings myself and I saw one of their craft up close and personal on another occasion. So I know that there&#x27;s something here. So yes, if they&#x27;re giving us some message about destruction, I think we need to be need to take it seriously cuz yeah, they might be lying, but we still but maybe they&#x27;re not. We need to take it seriously. We we can&#x27;t afford not to.</p>
<p>It&#x27;d be stupid. We&#x27;d be stupid not to take it seriously. How about that? So, yeah, of course I agree with with the majority. All right, for the episode, alien hybrids might be controlling the narrative. Uh, I asked this question for this episode.</p>
<p>If there are alien hybrids living among us, is it a good good thing or a bad thing? Okay, 32 votes so far with 14 days left. Wow, this one was pretty close. Okay, 14 people or 43.8% 8% say it was a good thing while the majority 18 people or 56.3% say it was a bad thing. Uh I think it&#x27;s a bad thing. Uh yes, I think that&#x27;s why would you do that unless you&#x27;re up to no good.</p>
<p>Okay, if you&#x27;re going to if you have to put uh secret spies in and sprinkle them out throughout throughout the the human race, that has to be a bad thing. That means you&#x27;re you&#x27;re keeping something from us. So yes, I agree with majority again. It&#x27;s a bad thing. All right, moving right along for the episode interview Colorado man plagued by UFONHI encounters throughout his entire life.</p>
<p>Okay, this was uh another guest I had on the show recently. Uh Bill Wrath and uh he talked about all the strange encounters that he&#x27;s had throughout his life and uh it was very very interesting. If you haven&#x27;t seen that episode, I I highly recommend it. And anyway, I asked this question. Have you dealt with encounters with UFOs and NHI throughout your entire life? Okay, there&#x27;s 33 votes so far with 18 days left.</p>
<p>Okay, 12 people or 36.4% say yes, while the majority 21 people or 63.6% say no. Um, yeah, I mean, this is that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a pretty good number. I mean, uh, 12, you know, 36% saying yes. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a lot of people out there who have encountered these beings throughout their entire life lives. And I would have to say that I&#x27;m one of them because I had inst uh things that happened to me throughout my entire life.</p>
<p>Now I haven&#x27;t had really a lot of stuff happening re recently. There was one little thing but I&#x27;m not even sure about it. But for the most part I&#x27;ve had some major things happening and they were spread apart by many years. You know there was the incident when I was a kid back in 1977. Then there was another incident in the mid 1990s where they saw the UFO.</p>
<p>And then there was another incident when I was in Hawaii back in 2017 where I had a a a very strange experience where a dog one of my dogs went missing under very strange uh circumstances. Uh I will get into these stories in a different episode. I&#x27;ve talked about them many times before. Uh but I do want I do plan on bringing them up again in a different episode. But I want to I because I think it&#x27;s important to there&#x27;s other there&#x27;s other ways of looking at these things some sometimes and I I want to I want to talk about them again at a at a future episode.</p>
<p>But yeah, I I&#x27;d have to go with I&#x27;d be one of the yeses because I did have uh a lot of things going on throughout my life, multiple different events. All right, for the episode giant lobster-like alien tries to abduct teenage girl. Also, 2018 Oregon backyard ETS update. For that episode, I asked this question. If the 1977 lobster creature story is true, what sort of entity was it? Of course, uh in that episode, you know, we were talking about this incident, this alleged incident that happened in 1977 where this creature came through a portal somehow into into this teenage girl&#x27;s bedroom and she woke up and she was getting dragged through this portal by some kind of a lobster kind of creature or something, right? and had had a pinser on one of her arms and was trying to drag her in and then she fell backward.</p>
<p>She broke loose and fell backward on the floor. When she woke up the next day, she was covered with bruises. So, uh if it if the story is true, what sort of entity was it? That was the question. 20 votes so far with 21 days left. All right.</p>
<p>Uh zero people say it was a spiritual being. One person or 5% say other. Another one person or 5% say it was ultraterrestrial. Uh three people or 15% say it was earth an earthly crypted. Another three people or 15% say it was extraterrestrial.</p>
<p>Uh four people or 20% say it was interdimensional. And the majority eight people or 40% say it was an imaginary being. So it was all in her imagination. Where do I go with this one? Uh because I know strange things do happen to people. I&#x27;m not going to go with the majority.</p>
<p>Most people thought, okay, most people thinks thinks it was something cuz if you take the interdimensional, the ultraterrestrial, the extraterrestrial, and the earth earthly crypted all together, that that&#x27;s more than eight, right? That&#x27;s that&#x27;s 11. So, I&#x27;m going to go with uh uh what am I going to go with? I&#x27;m going to say how about go I&#x27;m just going to go with extraterrestrial for the for the fun of it, right? You know, I think that&#x27;s a funny thought. you know, lob lobster aliens operating spacecraft. Imagine anything&#x27;s possible, folks. Anything.</p>
<p>Uh, especially when you know you have, especially when you have evidence of something weird going on here, right? Anything&#x27;s possible is my mind at this point. Anything. Nothing&#x27;s off the table. I wouldn&#x27;t be I would it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if if a race of intelligent dogs and cats showed up in spaceships at this point. Seriously, why not? Anything&#x27;s possible.</p>
<p>All right, for the episode, Alien Robots with Heads Resembling Flowers startled Child in Florida Schoolyard. Okay, for that episode, I asked this question. Are the robots people sometimes encounter related to the gray insecttoid and reptilian aliens witnessed in most alien abduction accounts? Okay. Uh, so of course that was an episode where I not not only was was I talking about these robots that look like uh [snorts] had flower heads with flower petals on their head, but there was other robot cases. And you know, are they connected to the grays, the reptilians and the insecttoids, the the the whole gang that&#x27;s responsible for the abductions, are they connected? Okay, 20 votes so far.</p>
<p>Okay, five people or 25% say no. 15 people or 75% say yes. Uh, I&#x27;m gonna go out on a limb and say yes. Yeah, I think these robots are connected to the to the whole thing here. I don&#x27;t know what their purpose is, but yeah, I&#x27;m gonna go with yes.</p>
<p>So, here&#x27;s the thing is we know that there&#x27;s something here because we have the evidence, right? Uh, it&#x27;s up, you know, if you don&#x27;t want to believe the the truth, right? That&#x27;s fine. There&#x27;s a lot of people out there who live in fantasy worlds. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s great, right? But the bottom line is the world should know by this point, folks. We&#x27;ve already had disclosure. We have enough evidence at this point uh to show the world that that we&#x27;re not alone, right? And it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s up to the mainstream news.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s up to the the politicians we have in office. It&#x27;s up to those people because they&#x27;re the ones in power, right? They have they they they have the ability to reach to a lot more people than uh some small little podcast like this and a bunch of little there&#x27;s another bunch of other guys out there too telling you the same kinds of stuff. Yeah, we we&#x27;ve already had disclosure. It&#x27;s up to the people out there to who are who have the power to show this to share this information to do their jobs already because there is something here with us whether you like it or not. Sorry.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just want to say this. I want to say thank you all for joining me today. Until next time.</p>
