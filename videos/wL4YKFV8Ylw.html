            <p>What if I told you the solution to the world&#x27;s energy crisis has already been invented multiple times, but the inventors mysteriously vanished or died? Take Stanley Meyer. He created a car that he claimed could run on water. But in 1998, during a dinner meeting, he suddenly collapsed, shouting, &quot;They poisoned me,&quot; and died. Or think about Nicola Tesla and his dream of free wireless energy for everyone. His massive Warden Cliff Tower project was shut down by his powerful financial backers.</p>
<p>Coincidence or a deliberate pattern of suppression? What do you think would happen if someone made a similar breakthrough today? Let me know in the comments.</p>
