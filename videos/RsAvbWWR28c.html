            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Do you how much do you know about like what was going on with physics research in the 50s? I think it was with like this gravity research that like went dark and supposedly like went underground. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this. I have You&#x27;re I have a very controversial take on it. You&#x27;re not like &gt;&gt; I love controversial takes. &gt;&gt; I think it went dark cuz it doesn&#x27;t work.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, really? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; I mean there I &gt;&gt; have Have you looked into Thomas Towns and Brown? &gt;&gt; Yes, I have. Yes, I have. &gt;&gt; What do you think of him? I if it if he had if there were actual revolutionary ideas that worked, they would have been reproduced already.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t keep science dark forever because someone else would accidentally stumble upon the same idea. So like let&#x27;s say for example, take example, let&#x27;s say you suppressed Einstein and tried to stop relativity. Let&#x27;s say you were a time traveler and for whatever reason you wanted to stop human advancement kind of like in the threebody problem, right? you&#x27;re with the let&#x27;s say you wanted to stop Einstein &gt;&gt; wouldn&#x27;t have worked because Minkowski would have come up with relativity or if not Minkowski then Po and Kare was very close to relativity and so you can&#x27;t stop an entire field of research and ideas because someone else would accidentally stumble upon it might take decades don&#x27;t get me wrong might take decades &gt;&gt; well the it could very plausibly what could have happened was if they they could have been monitoring everybody who&#x27;s been even getting remotely close to it and and then pulling them in through through time. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s possible, but I&#x27;m skeptical. And the reason is is because conspiracies would fall apart eventually.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll give you an example. &gt;&gt; So for a long time, so astronomers developed something for our new telescopes for the groundbased ones. You know, we were talking about James Webb. There&#x27;s also groundbased telescopes like uh giant Mellan telescope. So we devel one the Subaru.</p>
<p>Is there one called Subaru? &gt;&gt; Not that I know of. &gt;&gt; Like he&#x27;s in like the South Pole or &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;m not an astronomer so unfortunately I don&#x27;t know the names of all the telescopes. But so for the giant Mellan telescope and for other telescopes like it, we&#x27;re using something called adaptive optics. So what adaptive optics is is where you cancel out the twinkling of stars and astronomical objects. The way you do that is you fire a laser into the sky and you use that laser as your calibration of, you know, like the thermal convection and like the atmospheric aberration.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a way to get as good or almost as good or even better images from the ground as from outer space. Saves money, right? &gt;&gt; You still need space-based telescopes like James Webb, Vera Rubin, right? But here&#x27;s the but when astronomers invented adaptive optics. Guess what happened? &gt;&gt; The US Navy said, &quot;Oh yeah, we developed that 30 years ago, right? It &gt;&gt; was secret.&quot; So yeah, things like this can happen, but my point is they can&#x27;t last forever. So there&#x27;s hope. There&#x27;s hope.</p>
<p>So, even if there was anti-gravity, but also I don&#x27;t even understand what anti-gravity means. And I have good friends who who research this. I have good friends in Falcon um space and um flux space. Uh Markal, Jared Yates, uh Tim Venture, a lot of these guys in APEC, the alternative uh propulsion engineering conference. I&#x27;m good friends with these guys.</p>
<p>But the thing is, but I think they appreciate my um my skepticism with them. And we go back and forth. I told them, &quot;Look, anti-gravity already exists. It&#x27;s called, you know, a superconductor or a magnet, a repelling magnet. Like I, as a physicist, I don&#x27;t even know what that word is supposed to mean because to me, we already have anti-gravity.</p>
<p>I can do it right now. An airplane is anti-gravity. It uses Bernoli&#x27;s principle, Newton&#x27;s third law. So, like, I don&#x27;t even know what that word&#x27;s supposed to mean anymore. You know what I mean? Like, I hope that like there are forces.</p>
<p>This is physics one. This is physics 101, textbook physics. &gt;&gt; I can take forces and I can cancel them out. That&#x27;s physics 101. If I have gravity pulling me down, I create an equal opposite force the other way.</p>
<p>Like this is centuries old physics. So I&#x27;m not sure like when usually when people use the term anti-gravity, they mean some magical thing we haven&#x27;t thought of yet. When when I think of it, I&#x27;m like but we already we already have anti-gravity. We have airplanes. We have magnets.</p>
<p>So I don&#x27;t &gt;&gt; Well, I mean I&#x27;m not the kind of person to describe this to you, but a lot of people have been on the show and described how and been on other podcasts as well and explained theoretically, you know, how this would work. And there&#x27;s been lots of experiments to try to do it. I know. &gt;&gt; And the experiments all fail. Well, I&#x27;m friends with Mark Soal and Jared Yates.</p>
<p>You should have one of them on the show. Actually, you&#x27;re both their entire They&#x27;ve been laughed at as crackpots. They&#x27;ve been insulted by people. I love these guys. They&#x27;re not crackpots.</p>
<p>You know what they do? They take every crazy idea and they&#x27;re like, &quot;Hey, what if that anti-gravity idea is true? They test it.&quot; Doesn&#x27;t work. &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard of Jack Sarati? &gt;&gt; Yes. I can&#x27;t stand him. &gt;&gt; I I will do anything for him. I c for him to get off his email list.</p>
<p>If it means I have to tell him now on on this show that he&#x27;s the best physicist who ever lived, I will do anything to get off his email list. &gt;&gt; What do you think about his theories of like warp drive? I cannot say. &gt;&gt; Have you looked into it? &gt;&gt; I have thoroughly. I cannot say cuz he&#x27;ll threaten to sue me for liel. &gt;&gt; He already has and I just don&#x27;t want to deal with that cuz look, I got I have a wife and who doesn&#x27;t work.</p>
<p>I have four kids. I already take huge risks working on UFOs. There&#x27;s a stigma. &gt;&gt; Thought he&#x27;s not going to. No, I don&#x27;t think he has the money to do so.</p>
<p>But still, I But I I&#x27;m also going to get an angry email. If I tell him what I actually think about him right now on the show, I&#x27;ll get an angry email from him. &gt;&gt; Who cares? &gt;&gt; Okay. If he was right about this stuff that he&#x27;s doing, he could go to Home Depot and do it. He claims he can warp spaceime with a 9volt battery.</p>
<p>Go do it. Do it right now. Prove it to everybody. So, like, I cannot stand Jack. He just spouts theories with no experimental evidence.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Do you know what the Biffield Brown effect is and how it works? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, I do. &gt;&gt; So, do you know that that was &gt;&gt; a great effect and it&#x27;s real? &gt;&gt; We can do it. &gt;&gt; Yes, we can. There&#x27;s But there&#x27;s no new physics.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, so for people who don&#x27;t know it, can you explain what it is? Like, can you distill it down to something that&#x27;s easy to understand? &gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. Um, it&#x27;s when you can So, there is an there is a way and they tested this on Mythbusters as well and it works. What you can do is using high voltage you can ionize the air and that allow that produces a force that counteracts the force of gravity and allows you to have an air aircraft or airship that floats in the air. There&#x27;s no new physics involved. It&#x27;s just engineering.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just new engineering. So people, &gt;&gt; this is like ion wind, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. People worship this effect as if it&#x27;s magic. It&#x27;s not magic.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s well-known physics that&#x27;s been around for decades. It&#x27;s cool. It&#x27;s a cool trick. And I we could have ships that capitalize it. Absolutely.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s nothing weird about that at all. We might have some Black Ops project that uses it. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Well, the B2 bombers are coated in like something uh the they&#x27;re they&#x27;re covered not the B2 the uh stealth bombers, the B2 stealth planes. They have this sort of a uh like a skin on them.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s supposed to have some sort of like an extra ion wind up. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s entirely possible. But here&#x27;s the thing. &gt;&gt; Steve, can you by the way, sorry to interrupt real quick.</p>
<p>Steve, can you find that video that we that we uh had Jeremy show us of the Yeah, there we go. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; do you know what this is? How is this working? This is This isn&#x27;t a vacuum. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m there. I&#x27;m off camera during this. Are you really? &gt;&gt; I was visiting Falcon Space during this test.</p>
<p>Yes. No way. &gt;&gt; Mark is my friend at Falcon Space. This is what I&#x27;m trying to tell you is Mark is one of those guys who tests every crazy idea. Occasionally, the idea works.</p>
<p>This is an idea that actually works. The vast majority of anti-gravity ideas are garbage. &gt;&gt; So what is Can you explain this? &gt;&gt; So can you zoom out so I can refresh my memory? &gt;&gt; This is this is the frame of the video. &gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, no. Just the description of the video.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So be brown effect. So basically &gt;&gt; in a vacuum chamber.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. So basically, but what&#x27;s weird here is you should need air for the effect to work. And so that what&#x27;s really interesting here is it seems to be it seems to be working without air where you&#x27;re getting propulsion from electricity but in a high vacuum. And that&#x27;s interesting. That&#x27;s very interesting.</p>
<p>It could suggest something. Now, and I said this to Mark. I told you I&#x27;m good friends with Mark, but we get in fights and arguments. I tell him, &quot;Look, it rotates. Prove it better to me.</p>
<p>Show it taking off.&quot; &gt;&gt; He can&#x27;t because well, he&#x27;s cramped in his lab. He can&#x27;t just make it take off in one direction. So, I&#x27;m not convinced it will be useful for outer space. &gt;&gt; It feels like it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s ramping up there. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s Well, he&#x27;s he can be he&#x27;s tuning the voltage, but yeah, I was literally there during the test, one of these tests at least.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know for the YouTube video one, but but yeah, Mark is a great guy. And what he&#x27;s doing is he tests all these crazy anti-gravity ideas. &gt;&gt; So, how could you theoretically test this on like make this bigger and make this something that&#x27;s &gt;&gt; What I would what I would do is try to send it in a straight line instead of rotating. He&#x27;s got it rotating because he&#x27;s got a tight space, you know, in his lap. I would send it in a straight line because the reason is &gt;&gt; in physics there&#x27;s a difference between angular momentum and linear momentum.</p>
<p>So just because something can spin on its own without a propellant doesn&#x27;t mean it can go straight on its own. Those two things are not necessarily equivalent. &gt;&gt; But you have to So another thing I would do is pull even higher vacuum because I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s residual air. There&#x27;s always you can never get there&#x27;s no such thing as a perfect vacuum. I wonder if it&#x27;s ionizing the residual air in there.</p>
<p>Mark says no. Like I said, I&#x27;ve had back and forth with him. But see, this is the difference between theory and experiment. &gt;&gt; Anyone can come on a podcast with their grand anti-gravity theory, but these are the guys who are trying to make it a reality. People like Mark at Faulk in Space.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re actually trying to make something happen. &gt;&gt; Mark will be the first person to tell you this. The vast majority of the ideas he tests &gt;&gt; garbage. They&#x27;re nonsense. Occasionally though, he gets something promising.</p>
<p>But the vast majority of anti-gravity theories are wrong. Well, they&#x27;re self-contradictory, right? You&#x27;ve got dozens of people say, &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s this effect. It&#x27;s that effect. It can&#x27;t be. Is it going to be all of those effects?&quot; And so, occasionally though, you hit upon something that looks promising like this, like in this case with the Belel Brown effect.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I have no I have very little doubt. I&#x27;m sure we have Black Ops, you know, planes that use something like this. Absolutely. But to me, this is not new science. This is new engineering.</p>
<p>M &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s a big difference. So this is a beautiful example of the difference between science and engineering. I&#x27;ll give you another one like this. Take a guess what year it was when humans finally understood how to make airplanes. Take a guess like understood how theoretically &gt;&gt; theoretically &gt;&gt; theoretically &gt;&gt; 1800s 1700s &gt;&gt; earlier &gt;&gt; really uh &gt;&gt; 1687 Newton &gt;&gt; 1687 &gt;&gt; Newton&#x27;s once we had Newton&#x27;s physics we knew how to make airplanes so my question to you is what the hell took humanity so long to do it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you know what the answer is engineering &gt;&gt; so there&#x27;s a difference between physics and a difference between engineering.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We have Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. &gt;&gt; Then how come we can&#x27;t make better planes? How come we use the same planes? We&#x27;ve been using the &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been using the same planes for decades. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Did you know that when we cancelled the Concord, that was the first time in human history that technology has gone backwards instead of forwards. Well, also you could you could you could argue the Apollo the Apollo program as well.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a Yeah, but it&#x27;s around the same time. Apollo wasn&#x27;t canceled yet. So, no, my statement still stands. Apollo was still doing multiple missions in the 70s. &gt;&gt; Well, they Yeah, they &gt;&gt; It was not canceled yet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; After 72, they they completely they&#x27;re &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, it&#x27;s around the same time. &gt;&gt; If you ask Chat GPT what happened to the Apollo technology, it will tell you that NASA&#x27;s official statement was they accidentally uh overwrote the hard drives with all the data. &gt;&gt; So, they Oh, we accidentally erased it all. Sorry.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Apollo&#x27;s another example. But let me let me go back to my Concord example because it affects our daily lives. &gt;&gt; Yes. Sorry to derail you &gt;&gt; for No, it&#x27;s okay. For the first time in human history, &gt;&gt; it took more time to cross the Atlantic or Pacific instead of less.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Do you realize I get so I get so angry with everybody who tells me technology, oh, it improves exponentially, &gt;&gt; right?  If it actually improved exponentially, I could get on a plane right now and in five minutes I&#x27;d be home in New York. &gt;&gt; If technology improved exponentially, why aren&#x27;t airplanes improving exponentially? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll tell you why. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s because of economics. It&#x27;s because of practicality.</p>
<p>You know what people will pay for. And so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not going to completely dismiss. I&#x27;m skeptical, but I&#x27;m open to the possibility that there&#x27;s some secret anti-gravity program. You know why? because it would upset the apple cart of all the airlines who are suddenly out of business. Right.</p>
<p>Right. &gt;&gt; Totally. &gt;&gt; People on your podcast have said the same thing, I&#x27;m sure. Exactly. You know how &gt;&gt; well also these companies uh they they control they control every they have they they have a monopoly on on what they do like Boeing and these and not only that but it&#x27;s &gt;&gt; worse than that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They literally own Congress, right? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s worse than that. &gt;&gt; They pretend not to have a monopoly. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Do you know what the trick is? &gt;&gt; Kill people. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Well, I sometimes in extreme cases, I&#x27;m sure. &gt;&gt; How many Boeing whistleblowers accidentally committed? &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Like, you&#x27;re right. That happens, too. But that&#x27;s not where I was going.</p>
<p>But you&#x27;re right. And in Russia, you have an you have an unfortunate window accidents. That&#x27;s how they do do you in Russia or you find palonium in your bors. That&#x27;s the other way. &gt;&gt; But you&#x27;re you&#x27;re partially right about that.</p>
<p>I was going a different direction, but the direction I was going is they have a secret game they play where all companies do this, by the way. I forget what the exact term is of this. It&#x27;s not a monopoly. It&#x27;s like an oligopoly, I think, &gt;&gt; where basically you don&#x27;t in my turf and I stay out of your turf. So, for example, with airlines, there are some airports where only one airline flies there and there&#x27;s another airport, a different airline flies to that one because they&#x27;ve all made a deal.</p>
<p>Yes, you stay away. United, Delta, America, stay out of our our our hubs. It&#x27;s the same thing with internet. At home, my wife and I and kids have the absolute shittiest internet service you can imagine. What can we do about it? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What can we do? Nothing.</p>
<p>Can we switch to another provider? No. You know why? It&#x27;s only one provider. And if you go to Philadelphia, there&#x27;s one provider. go to Boston and they oh we&#x27;re not a monopoly because they&#x27;re in different parts of the country. So that&#x27;s the sneaky stuff they do.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So yeah, I&#x27;m I I am I believe there&#x27;s probably secret stuff and military industrial complex and all that, but the story I told earlier of adaptive optics makes me hopeful people like Mark and his work at Falcon Space make me hopeful that other people are going to rediscover the secret stuff. And and now in the age of internet, it&#x27;s impossible to stop everyone and bring everyone in. It&#x27;s not going to happen. It&#x27;s going to fall apart. So, I&#x27;m optimistic.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m optimistic.</p>
