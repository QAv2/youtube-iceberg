            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>This is the world&#x27;s first behavioral and emotional training using VR. And I have to tell you that just blew me away. I had a bit of a moment after that. It was quite confronting looking at the limiting beliefs. So you did one of the ones in the bold program and so bold is very personal.</p>
<p>This program that&#x27;s out this year is very much personal development as well. And I think at the end of the day, understanding your fears, your limiting beliefs, what keeps you in denial, you kind of have to work through that stuff before you can actually then elevate to take on new concepts. That&#x27;s the challenge that I found in leadership is trying to teach people to have difficult conversations when they have these deep limiting beliefs about themselves that they don&#x27;t know. So that&#x27;s why our early modules can be um for a lot of people a bit confronting. It&#x27;s perhaps a conversation that you may not have had before or be aware of and then obviously you&#x27;re doing it in a virtual environment.</p>
<p>It was remarkable.</p>
