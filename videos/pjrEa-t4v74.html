            <p>Have you ever heard of 0 point energy? It&#x27;s a mindblowing concept from quantum physics. Imagine an endless clean energy source that exists everywhere in the vacuum of space. Theoretically, we could tap into this and power our entire planet for free forever. No more pollution, no more energy bills. Sounds amazing, right? So why aren&#x27;t we using it? Many brilliant inventors like Nicola Tesla claimed to have been close to harnessing this power, but there work often mysteriously disappeared, was underfunded, or they were discredited.</p>
<p>Some people believe powerful interests who profit from traditional energy sources have actively suppressed this technology for over a century. Could a secret this big really be kept under wraps? What do you think? Let me know in the comments. And don&#x27;t forget to subscribe for more mysteries.</p>
