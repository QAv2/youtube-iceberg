            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I just checked my student loans because I needed to get the information to someone and I started with 80,000 I have been paying for 10 years last year I paid 6,000 lumpsum because that&#x27;s really the only way to get it low uh that took it down to 76,000 after I&#x27;ve been paying for 9 years the grand total is I have paid $ 120,000 and I still owe 76 I think I might be late to the game learning about this um student loans are really messed up this is the reality of student loans so many people are dealing with this and it&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t just make minimum payments it&#x27;s why you shouldn&#x27;t get on these income based repayment plans where it keeps your payments nice and low as a gift to you to give you breathing room while your student loan balance balloons and balloons and balloons</p>
