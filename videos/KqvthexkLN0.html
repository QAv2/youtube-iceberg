            <p>yes well over 200 of these centigrade we can now show the Leidenfrost effect so where I drop them off on this time they weren&#x27;t just bubble and disappear something quite remarkable happens it&#x27;s stays in place I have temperature I think isn&#x27;t afraid oh yes spin isn&#x27;t it put another drop in so he&#x27;s got a companion what&#x27;s happening here something quite extraordinary there&#x27;s a big one now the hinder run no it&#x27;s going around naturally beautiful if I really practice I can make an entire ring of this equally so something quite extraordinary here they&#x27;re much higher temperature he&#x27;s creating this little barrier between the very hot surface underneath and the water block roads so it&#x27;s insulated and it doesn&#x27;t evaporate but does evaporate were very much more slowly letting go over some time before it finally disappears wow what a discovery you</p>
