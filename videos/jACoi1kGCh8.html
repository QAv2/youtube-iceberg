            <p>I love the hard problem of Consciousness it always tells you that there is something about matter about energy about that we don&#x27;t understand the question is usually phrased as like this I&#x27;ve studied physics I&#x27;ve studied chemistry I&#x27;ve studied biology and then neurophysiology and I went from the simple to the to the more and more complex and then when I came to the complex I saw that there is something which I don&#x27;t understand why there are qualia why there is this Consciousness and so on perhaps even the foundations where you studied them there was something missing do you think that we know everything about matter about energy about space or about time perhaps the mystery is already there uh there is the kind of philosophy called pan psychism Which says that Consciousness is a mystery that exists perhaps everywhere but it is only here that it becomes most manifest I like it</p>
