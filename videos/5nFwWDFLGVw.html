            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>August 10th, 1991. Room 517, Sheran Inn, Martinsburg, West Virginia. A housekeeper knocks on the door at 10:30 in the morning. No answer. She uses her key.</p>
<p>The bathroom floor is wet, dark red. Joseph Daniel Castillo is in the tub. Both wrists slashed, not once, multiple times, deep. He&#x27;s been dead for hours. Here&#x27;s the first thing that doesn&#x27;t add up.</p>
<p>Danny Castillo was 44 years old, healthy, and by every account from every person who knew him, completely electrified by the story he was chasing. He&#x27;d told his brother just days before, &quot;I&#x27;m close. I&#x27;m finally close.&quot; The official verdict: suicide. But here&#x27;s what they don&#x27;t want you to know. His briefcase was gone.</p>
<p>His research notes, a year and a half of work, hundreds of pages, names, dates, source contacts, all of it vanished. Not misplaced, gone. and his body was imbalmed before his family could even request an independent autopsy. Let that sink in for a second. So, by the time his brother Tony demanded answers, the physical evidence was already destroyed.</p>
<p>No second opinion possible. The clock had been running before the family even knew he was dead. By the end of this video, you&#x27;ll know what Danny Castillo found. You&#x27;ll know who he was about to expose, and you&#x27;ll understand exactly why a freelance journalist with no enemies, a guy who wrote pieces about cats and antique cars, ended up face down in a bathtub in a West Virginia hotel room. But right now, I need to ask you three questions, and I&#x27;m not going to answer them yet.</p>
<p>What was inside that briefcase? Who was Danny traveling to Martinsburg to meet? And what exactly is the octopus? Stay with me. Danny Castillaro wasn&#x27;t a crusader. That&#x27;s the first thing you need to understand. He wasn&#x27;t Woodward. He wasn&#x27;t Bernstein.</p>
<p>He was a freelance writer living in a house in Fairfax, Virginia with a cat named Scruffy and a reputation for writing light features, home improvement, tech gadgets, a little fiction on the side. But in the spring of 1990, something landed on his desk that changed everything. It started with a software company. And software sounds boring, I know. Stick with me.</p>
<p>Because this particular piece of software, this one program, might be the most dangerous thing ever written. It might have funded arms deals, gotten people killed, tracked dissident across a dozen countries without their knowledge, and the United States government stole it. That&#x27;s not a theory. That&#x27;s been confirmed by multiple federal court rulings. The company was called Inslaw and its founder, a former Justice Department analyst named Bill Hamilton, had spent years building a database management program called Promise.</p>
<p>That stands for Prosecutor&#x27;s Management Information System. It was designed to help prosecutors track criminal cases, cross reference defendants, link related cases, follow paper trails automatically. It was for its time extraordinary. Here&#x27;s what you need to picture. 1975.</p>
<p>The personal computer doesn&#x27;t exist yet. Government case files are literally paper. Folders stacked in rooms. Prosecutors lose track of defendants. Cases fall apart because nobody connected the dots.</p>
<p>Promise could do it automatically. Feed it a name. It finds the aliases, the associated cases, the linked addresses, the financial records instantly. The Justice Department licensed Promise in 1982, gave Inslaw a contract worth $2.5 million. And then, Bill Hamilton says they stopped paying.</p>
<p>Not just stopped paying, they modified the software without permission. They distributed it to other agencies without Insaw&#x27;s knowledge. And when Hamilton sued, the Justice Department went after his company with everything it had. Audits, contract disputes, agency pressure. Insaw nearly went bankrupt fighting back.</p>
<p>A bankruptcy court judge, not a conspiracy theorist, a federal judge, ruled in 1987 that the Justice Department had stolen promise by trickery, fraud, and deceit. Let me say that again. A federal judge said the United States Department of Justice stole this software by fraud on purpose. Now, here&#x27;s where it gets strange. Because that ruling, that damning on there ruling got quietly reversed on appeal procedural grounds, not on the merits, not because the theft didn&#x27;t happen, because the bankruptcy court was deemed to not have the right jurisdiction.</p>
<p>So the question of whether the government stole promise was never actually answered in court. And that question, that open, unanswered, officially ignored question, is what pulled Danny Castellaro in. He&#x27;d been following the Inslaw case in the papers. Most people hadn&#x27;t. It was buried in financial reporting, legal briefs, dense technical language.</p>
<p>But Dany saw something under the surface, something the official story couldn&#x27;t account for. Why would the Justice Department, the entire Justice Department at the highest levels under Attorney General Edwin Me risk a federal fraud ruling over a $2.5 million software contract? You follow the money when the money doesn&#x27;t make sense. And $2.5 million didn&#x27;t make sense. Not for an operation this coordinated. So Danny started pulling threads and the first thread led him somewhere he absolutely did not expect.</p>
<p>A man named Michael Rakanuto. Rakanosuto was a technical prodigy, genuinely brilliant, the kind of guy who could build a working radio at age 10, who understood cryptography the way most people understand the alphabet. He also had a wrap sheet, drug convictions, weapons charges, a history that made him look on paper like a career criminal, which is exactly how the people who used him wanted him to look because Rakanos claimed and provided specific technical detail to support this claim that he had personally modified the promise software that someone in the intelligence community had hired him to do it and that the modification wasn&#x27;t just a technical upgrade. It was a back door. Think about what that means.</p>
<p>Promise, remember, was being sold to law enforcement and intelligence agencies worldwide. Canada, Israel, Jordan, South Korea, dozens of countries. Their prosecutors used it, their intelligence services used it. It was embedded inside foreign governments. And if Rakanosuto&#x27;s version is true, if the modified version contained a backdoor, then whoever planted it could access the databases of every agency running the software, every case file, every informant, every ongoing operation anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>You following this? Rakanosuto went on the record. In February of 1991, he signed a sworn affidavit in the Inslaw case. He named names. He described the modifications in specific technical detail. He explained where the work was done on the Cabazan Indian Reservation in Indo, California, a location with unusual jurisdictional status that made federal oversight difficult.</p>
<p>And he said something else, something that Danny Castillaro read very carefully. Rakanosuto said in the affidavit under oath that he expected to be arrested immediately after filing it. He said that in writing before it happened. 10 days later, he was arrested. Drug charges.</p>
<p>He was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Now, the official version says Rakanos was a career criminal who got caught, that his affidavit was a fantasy, that the timing was coincidence. But here&#x27;s the problem with that version. Rakanosuto predicted his arrest in a signed legal document filed with the court before it happened. That&#x27;s the kind of thing that should generate questions, loud ones, and it generated almost none except from Danny Castillo.</p>
<p>By the summer of 1990, Dany is working the phones constantly. He&#x27;s talking to Bill Hamilton at Insaw. He&#x27;s reading court transcripts. He&#x27;s tracking down former intelligence contractors and retired government lawyers. And slowly, very slowly, a pattern starts emerging.</p>
<p>He calls it the octopus. That&#x27;s his name for it. Not a single conspiracy, not a single crime. Something more like an organism. a network of people who keep appearing in different contexts, in different countries, in different decades, connected by money, by classified programs, by a shared willingness to operate outside the law.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s the thing about the octopus. Dany didn&#x27;t invent it. The connections were real, documented, crossverifiable, congressional records, court filings, FIA documents. The same names kept showing up. Iran Contra, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the BCCI scandal, the biggest bank fraud in history up to that point.</p>
<p>The October surprise, the allegation that Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaign team secretly negotiated with Iran in 1980 to delay the release of American hostages until after the election. The savings and loan collapse. Wacken Hut Corporation, a private security firm with unusually deep intelligence community ties. Different scandals, different years, different agencies, same names, same networks, same methods. Now, here&#x27;s what separates Danny Castillaro from a thousand other people who&#x27;ve spotted patterns in geopolitical events.</p>
<p>He was building a sourced documented manuscript. Not a blog post, not a radio rant, a book with named sources, filed documents, and a paper trail. And one of those sources agreed to talk on the record. That source was a man named Ari Ben Manash, former Israeli military intelligence officer. He claimed direct personal knowledge of the October surprise operation.</p>
<p>He&#x27;d written about it. He&#x27;d testified about it before Congress. He was a polarizing figure. The intelligence community publicly dismissed him as a fabricator, but some members of Congress took him seriously. Dany took him seriously.</p>
<p>They&#x27;d spoken multiple times. And then there was Robert Booth Nichols. Nicholls is harder to describe. On paper, he was a businessman, entertainment industry contacts, international trade connections, but his background was murky in the specific way that backgrounds get murky when someone has been involved in classified operations they&#x27;d prefer you not know about. He had connections to organized crime figures.</p>
<p>He had connections to intelligence figures. He moved between those worlds with a comfort level that didn&#x27;t make sense for a civilian. Dany and Nicholls had exchanged letters, phone calls. Dany believed Nicholls was one of the connective nodes in the octopus, a fixer, someone who made things happen and made other things disappear. He was also almost certainly feeding Dany selective information.</p>
<p>Whether Dany understood that fully, whether he knew his source might also be his target, we don&#x27;t know. because his notes are gone. Let me tell you about those notes. People who knew Dany in the last year of his life described the same image. He carried a large black vinyl briefcase worn at the corners.</p>
<p>He&#x27;d had it for years. Inside a manuscript in progress, legal pads filled in his tight, cramped handwriting, manila folders labeled by subject, photocopies of court documents, and a growing collection of source contacts written on index cards clipped together with a rubber band. By the summer of 1991, that briefcase was heavy. He&#x27;d been at this for a year and a half. The manuscript was reportedly over 500 pages.</p>
<p>Now, here&#x27;s a thing that stays with me. Dany had shown portions of that manuscript to at least three journalists. He&#x27;d shopped it to publishers. The general shape of the octopus was known to people around him. Which means if something happened to Dany, the manuscript would have survived through those contacts, right? Except what Dany hadn&#x27;t shared were his source notes, the names, the contact information, the specific documents proving the connections he was making.</p>
<p>Those were in the briefcase and the briefcase was gone. Not stolen, according to the Martinsburg Police Department. We don&#x27;t know what happened to it. That was their position. A briefcase containing 500 pages of notes on a potential government conspiracy disappears from a locked hotel room where a man has just been found dead and the investigation essentially shrugged.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s a concrete fact about what they did find in room 517. On the nightstand, there was a single empty wine bottle, cheap red wine, local brand. There were cuts on both of Dy&#x27;s wrists. Not one slash each, multiple cuts. Had shown signs of stress in recent months, which for a man investigating government conspiracies while his sources kept getting arrested or going silent is not exactly a surprise.</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s what a forensic pathologist later noted reviewing the case. The cuts were on both wrists, deep. for someone to cut their right wrist deeply enough to cause fatal blood loss, then switch the razor to their right hand and cut their left wrist with equal depth while already losing significant blood. That&#x27;s not impossible, but it is medically speaking unusual. The strength and depth of the wounds on the non-dominant hand present a question, not proof, a question.</p>
<p>A question that could have been answered by an independent autopsy, which Dy&#x27;s family never got to request because he was imbalmed within hours. Tony Castillo, Danny&#x27;s brother, found out his brother was dead from a phone call. Then he found out the body had already been prepared for burial. Tony pushed back hard. He contacted a congressional representative.</p>
<p>He demanded answers. He hired a lawyer. None of it moved fast enough to recover the physical evidence. And I want to be fair here. I want to give you both versions like I said I would.</p>
<p>The version that says Dany killed himself is not insane. He&#x27;d been under extraordinary stress. His book had been rejected by publishers. His sourcing was complicated by the fact that some of his most important sources were, by their own description, career liars, intelligence operatives, criminals, people with reasons to mislead him. His personal finances were strained.</p>
<p>People who knew him said he could go dark could get overwhelmed. The case for suicide is not nothing. But here&#x27;s the problem. Dany had told multiple people, his brother, a former neighbor, two journalist contacts, not to accept a suicide verdict if he turned up dead. He&#x27;d said it explicitly, not as a dramatic flourish, as a specific repeated warning.</p>
<p>If something happens to me, don&#x27;t let them call it a suicide. He said that more than once before he died. The week before his death, Dany drove to Martinsburg, West Virginia, a small city about 70 miles from Washington DC. Not a place you go for the scenery. He told his brother he was meeting a source, someone who had offered him, quote, &quot;The final piece.&quot; That&#x27;s what he said, &quot;The final piece.&quot; He didn&#x27;t tell Tony who the source was.</p>
<p>He said he&#x27;d explain everything when he got back. He never came back. And here&#x27;s what I want you to hold on to right now because this is the question that&#x27;s going to open the next part of what we know and what we don&#x27;t. Dany believed he had found the operational center of the octopus, not just a piece of it. the center, the person or persons who actually ran it, who coordinated it across decades and across scandals, who had the power to make Michael Reconos get arrested 10 days after filing a sworn affidavit.</p>
<p>Who had the power to make a briefcase disappear from a crime scene? Who had the motive to make sure a journalist&#x27;s manuscript never saw daylight? He&#x27;d told Tony he finally had a name. Not a network, not a conspiracy, a name, one person. And then he drove to Martinsburg to meet his source. And then he was dead. What was in the briefcase? Who was he meeting? And what name did he have? We&#x27;re going to answer all three, but first you need to understand what promise actually became.</p>
<p>Because the software story doesn&#x27;t end with Bill Hamilton&#x27;s lawsuit. It doesn&#x27;t end with the bankruptcy court. It goes somewhere that even today with everything we know should genuinely disturb you. There&#x27;s a document, a single eightpage document signed, dated, filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Columbia. Case number 85-0000312, February 21st, 1991.</p>
<p>It is Michael Reconos&#x27;s sworn affidavit. I&#x27;ve read it. You can read it. It&#x27;s public record. It&#x27;s been reproduced in congressional testimony.</p>
<p>It is written in plain technical English. No hysteria, no drama. It lays out step by step the modification of promise. It names the location. It names the people who contracted the work.</p>
<p>It describes the nature of the back door in functional terms. And in the final paragraph before his signature, before the notary stamp, Rakanos writes that he has been warned that filing this document will trigger retaliation, that he expects to be arrested. Eight pages, standard letter size, plain white paper, government case file stamp in the upper right corner, a notary seal at the bottom, and somewhere in the federal court system, a copy of this document still exists. Because documents like this don&#x27;t fully disappear. They get buried.</p>
<p>They get lost in procedure. They get misfiled for 30 years, but they don&#x27;t disappear. Danny Castillaro had a copy in his briefcase. And now you have to wonder who else knew he had it. Because Dany, in the final week of his life, had done something that made some of the people around him nervous.</p>
<p>He hadn&#x27;t just kept his research private anymore. He&#x27;d started making calls, checking facts, pushing sources for confirmation on specific names. He was close enough to the end that he was ready to verify. And verification in this particular story means calling the people who are implicated, giving them a chance to respond. Journalistic practice, standard protocol, which means the people he was about to name knew he was coming.</p>
<p>Let that sit there for a second. He drove to Martinsburg the night of August 8th, 1991. He checked into the sheran under his own name. He called his brother from the room. He sounded, Tony said later, slightly nervous, but not depressed.</p>
<p>Focused. He said he was meeting his source the next morning. He said he&#x27;d be home by the weekend. Tony never spoke to him again. And the source, whoever that source was, has never been publicly identified.</p>
<p>The Martinsburg police say they don&#x27;t know who Dany was there to meet. His personal phone records from that final day show outgoing calls. The incoming calls are harder to trace. By the time anyone started looking carefully, the trail had gone cold. Gone.</p>
<p>So, we know what Dany believed. We know what he was carrying. We know what he told his brother. What we don&#x27;t know, not fully, not yet, is the full shape of the octopus itself. What it actually was, how it worked, how many people it connected.</p>
<p>Because here&#x27;s the thing about the octopus that Dany understood and that most people covering the story get wrong. It wasn&#x27;t a single conspiracy. It was a method, a way of operating, a set of relationships between people who existed in the spaces between legitimate institutions, between government agencies and private contractors, between intelligence operations and organized crime, between official policy and completely deniable action. And that method didn&#x27;t start with promise. It started much earlier.</p>
<p>and it left a paper trail that if you know where to look is still sitting in federal archives right now. Dany knew where to look. He&#x27;d spent 18 months finding the documents, cross referencing the names, building a map of the connections, and then he said he had a name. The name, the person at the center. He drove to Martinsburg and somebody or nobody met him there.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what comes next. Because the promise story, the software, the back door, the foreign governments, that&#x27;s only one arm of the octopus. There were others. And one of them runs directly through a weapons program on an Indian reservation in the California desert. a program that involved chemical agents, high-tech weapons systems, and allegedly a direct connection to the people who ran Iran Contra.</p>
<p>Rakanoshut wasn&#x27;t just modifying software at Cabazon. And what he says was happening out there in the desert, if even half of it is true, changes the entire picture of what Danny Casillaro was actually close to exposing. That&#x27;s next. So, the Cababazon Indian Reservation, Indo, California, about 130 mi east of Los Angeles, out past Palm Springs, where the desert starts to mean it. Picture it.</p>
<p>1981. The land is flat and dry. The air smells like dust and creassote and heat. On the surface, the Cababazon band of mission Indians is trying to generate revenue for their tribe. They&#x27;re building a bingo hall.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re negotiating a card club. And then they get a partner, the Wacken Hut Corporation. If you haven&#x27;t heard of Wacken Hut, here&#x27;s what you need to know. On paper, they were a private security company, one of the biggest in the world. But their executive roster reads like a CIA reunion.</p>
<p>Founder George Wackenhut, former FBI. senior executives with deep intelligence community backgrounds. Government contract after government contract, black budget work, the kind of company that exists in the space between public accountability and classified operations. Wacken Hut and the Kabazon tribe formed a joint venture. The official purpose, economic development, job creation.</p>
<p>But Michael Riconuto, who we know was already on the reservation modifying promise, wasn&#x27;t working on economic development. He was working on weapons. In sworn testimony, Riconuto described research into fuel air explosive systems, modifications to automatic weapons. work on a material he called red mercury, a substance connected in intelligence circles to certain categories of weapons development I&#x27;m going to let you look up yourself. He described a program on that reservation that had nothing to do with the bingo hall and everything to do with generating covert revenue for intelligence operations that couldn&#x27;t be funded through official channels.</p>
<p>Because here&#x27;s the core problem with running a shadow foreign policy. It costs money, real money, and you can&#x27;t exactly put it in the federal budget under a line item that says off the books covert arms program. So, you need other revenue streams. Promise was one. The weapons programs at Kabazon were another.</p>
<p>And there was a third, the biggest one that connected both. The Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the BCCI. Stay with me here because BCCI sounds like another boring financial story. It isn&#x27;t. It is the largest documented case of criminal banking in history.</p>
<p>At its peak, BCCI operated in over 70 countries, managed assets of $20 billion, and served as the financial backbone for arms dealers, drug cartels, intelligence agencies, and heads of state simultaneously. The United States Senate investigation into BCCI, led by Senators John Kerry and Hank Brown, which produced a 700page report in 1992, called it quote, &quot;a global criminal enterprise, not alleged enterprise, criminal enterprise on the record in print.&quot; And the same names that kept appearing in the Inslaw case, the same networks Dany was mapping kept appearing in the BCCI investigation. Now, here&#x27;s the concrete fact that links all three arms of the octopus together. And this is something Danny Castillo had pieced together by the fall of 1990. His name was Earl Brian.</p>
<p>Earl Bryan had been California Secretary of Health under Governor Ronald Reagan in the 1970s. He was close to Reagan. He was close to Ed Me, the same Ed Me who became Reagan&#x27;s attorney general and oversaw the Justice Department that stole Promise. Brian went on to run a technology company called Hadron Inc., a company that according to multiple sources in the inslaw litigation acquired a modified version of promise and distributed it to foreign intelligence services for money large amounts of money flowing through accounts that were difficult to trace. Reconos named Brian directly in his affidavit.</p>
<p>He said Brian had been present on the Kabazon reservation, that Brian had facilitated the distribution deal, that Hadron had been the vehicle for selling a backdoored version of promise to foreign governments, including Jordan, Israel, and Canada, at the direction of someone in the Reagan Justice Department. The official version says Brian was a legitimate businessman who was falsely accused by a career criminal with an axe to grind. Brian sued Rakcomut for defamation. He sued journalists who wrote about the allegations. He consistently denied any connection to Promise.</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s the problem with that denial. A Canadian government inquiry, not an American one, not partisan, not politically motivated, separately concluded that a modified version of Promise had been acquired by Canadian law enforcement and that the acquisition contained anomalies consistent with a backdoor access function. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were using software that someone could read over their shoulder. And there&#x27;s more. A journalist named Seymour Hirs, Puliter Prize winner, broke the Mi massacre story.</p>
<p>Not exactly a fringe figure, was separately investigating promise distribution in the early 1990s. His sources inside the intelligence community told him the software had reached Israeli intelligence. From there, elements of it had been passed to other services. The back door, if it existed, had potentially been read by people who were reading the people who installed it. It had metastasized.</p>
<p>Now, remember loop one from part one, the briefcase. Here&#x27;s what I can tell you. Not all of it, not yet, but this much. People who had seen portions of Danyy&#x27;s manuscript before his death described a section specifically on Earl Bryan named him explicitly included what Dany called documentary corroboration specific references to court filings to Canadian inquiry documents to financial records connected to Hadron&#x27;s government contracts. That section of the manuscript was what Dany believed would make the book legally bulletproof.</p>
<p>Because Brian was latigious, Brian sued people. Danny knew that. And he&#x27;d spent months building a case that he believed could survive a defamation lawsuit. So, when the briefcase disappeared, that section went with it. And here&#x27;s the thing about that disappearance that should bother you more than it seems to bother official sources.</p>
<p>The Martinsburg Police Department&#x27;s inventory of room 517 lists the items found at the scene. The wine bottle, the razor blade, personal toiletries, clothing in the closet, a notepad on the desk, blank. No briefcase, no manuscript, no source notes, no index cards. The police determined not stolen. They found no evidence of forced entry.</p>
<p>They found no evidence of a second person in the room. Which means either Dany drove to Martinsburg with 18 months of irreplaceable research and left it in his car and the car was never properly searched or someone left that room before the housekeeper arrived. With no evidence of how they got in or how they got out, the Martinsburg police closed their investigation within weeks. Suicide, case closed. Danny&#x27;s brother, Tony, never accepted that.</p>
<p>And in the years that followed, he wasn&#x27;t alone. Because here&#x27;s where we need to slow down for one moment before the next part of this story. Because I want to be precise with you. I want to give you the version that skeptics give fully, fairly, without strawmanning it. The skeptic&#x27;s case for suicide goes like this.</p>
<p>Danny Castellaro was a freelance writer of modest means who had spent nearly 2 years and significant personal money chasing a story that kept expanding. He was struggling financially. His manuscript had been rejected by publishers who found the connections speculative. Several of his most important sources, reconcicted criminals whose testimony had been discredited. He was drinking more than usual in his final months.</p>
<p>And people who experience depression don&#x27;t always show it clearly to everyone around them. That&#x27;s a real argument. Those are real facts. But here&#x27;s what the skeptics&#x27;s case cannot account for. Danny told four separate people.</p>
<p>his brother, a journalist colleague named Anita Bartholomew, a neighbor, and his literary agent, that if he ever turned up dead, they should not accept a verdict of suicide. He said it more than once. He said it calmly. He said it specifically. That&#x27;s not something a suicidal person says.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s something a person says when they know they&#x27;re being watched. And the evidence suggests he was right about that. Everything we&#x27;ve covered so far, Insaw, Promise, Cabazon, Earl Brian, BCCI, that&#x27;s the surface layer. What comes next is the part they really don&#x27;t want you to find. Because here&#x27;s what nobody told you.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what changes the entire picture of what Danny Casillaro was actually doing in his final weeks. Dany wasn&#x27;t just being tracked by the people he was investigating. He was being tracked by the people who were supposed to be investigating them. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had opened a file on Danny Castillaro, not after his death. Was in contact with.</p>
<p>This came out later was in contact with. This came out later slowly through FOIA requests filed by journalists and researchers after Dy&#x27;s death. The documents that were released were heavily redacted. The documents that weren&#x27;t released, the FBI cited national security exemptions. Think about what that means.</p>
<p>A freelance journalist in Fairfax, Virginia, is writing a book about government corruption. The government is monitoring his contacts under national security exemptions. And when he dies under suspicious circumstances, those monitoring records are classified. Why would the government invoke national security to hide records about a dead journalist&#x27;s phone calls? What&#x27;s in those pages? But here&#x27;s the part that keeps people up at night. The part that took years to piece together from congressional testimony and court documents and the accounts of people who worked the inslaw case from the inside.</p>
<p>One of Danyy&#x27;s sources was not what he appeared to be. Robert Booth Nicholls, the man Dany believed was a connective node in the octopus. The businessman with the intelligence community contacts and the organized crimeadjacent resume. Dany had been speaking with Nicholls for months. Nicholls had given Dany information, documents, names.</p>
<p>He&#x27;d helped Dany map connections. What Dany may not have fully understood, and what investigators piecing this together afterward came to believe, was that Nicholls was not just a source. He was a filter. Here&#x27;s how it works when an intelligence adjacent operator wants to contain a journalist&#x27;s investigation without killing it outright. And note, I am describing a documented technique, not a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s called a limited hangout. You give the journalist real information, verifiable, damning, interesting information, but you give it selectively. You steer him toward the parts of the story that can be disclosed without exposing the core. You give him enough to write a book about a software theft and miss the bigger picture entirely. And then if he gets too close to the thing you actually need to protect, you reassess.</p>
<p>Dany got close. In the final two weeks of his life, Dany stopped being selective about who he called. He&#x27;d been patient for 18 months, building the case quietly, protecting his sources, verifying before publishing. But by late July 1991, he believed he was done building. He believed he had enough.</p>
<p>So he started making verification calls to the people he was about to name. You call them. You say, &quot;I&#x27;m going to publish a claim that you did X. Do you want to respond? standard practice, ethical journalism. It&#x27;s what you do before you go to print.</p>
<p>But in this case, those calls had an unintended effect. They told the people he was naming that he was ready, that he had documentation, that the book was real and it was coming. Some of those people had resources that Danny Castillaro did not. And within days of those calls, Dany drove to Martinsburg to meet a source who had promised him, quote, &quot;The final piece.&quot; The final piece. Think about that phrase.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve spent 18 months building a case. You believe you have it. You&#x27;re making verification calls. And then at that exact moment, a source surfaces and offers you the one thing you&#x27;ve been missing. The timing.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the thing that the congressional investigators who later looked at this case kept coming back to the timing. Who knew Dany was ready to publish? The people he&#x27;d called and who called Dany in that final week to set up the Martinsburg meeting. We don&#x27;t know for certain. His phone records show calls. The incoming call logs are incomplete.</p>
<p>The Martinsburg police did not subpoena his phone records before the trail went cold. Danny&#x27;s brother Tony hired a private investigator. Tony pushed Congress. Tony did not stop and Congress eventually reluctantly started asking questions. The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law Chairman Jack Brooks, Texas Democrat, veteran legislator, former Marine, not a man who scared easily.</p>
<p>Brooks opened hearings on the Inslaw case in the fall of 1991, weeks after Dany died. The Justice Department stonewalled. Documents requested delayed. Witnesses called, some refused to appear, some appeared and remembered nothing. The familiar choreography of institutional obstruction performed for a congressional committee.</p>
<p>But Brooks kept pushing. And here&#x27;s where a name enters the story that carries real weight. Because in 1991, the Hamiltons, Bill and Nancy Hamilton of Insaw, hired a lawyer to continue pressing their case. Not just any lawyer. Elliot Richardson.</p>
<p>You know that name, or you should. Elliot Richardson was the attorney general of the United States who refused to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archbald Cox when Nixon ordered him to. He resigned instead in the middle of the Saturday Night Massacre. He chose his integrity over his job publicly at great personal cost. Richardson was not a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>He was not a political crank. He was one of the most respected lawyers in American public life. And after reviewing the inslaw evidence, Richardson said he believed the theft of promise had occurred. He believed it went to the highest levels of the Justice Department, and he called for the appointment of a special counsel. Let that sit there.</p>
<p>Elliot Richardson believing it. The Justice Department reviewed its own conduct through its Office of Professional Responsibility and produced a report. The report&#x27;s conclusion, no wrongdoing found. The House Judiciary Subcommittee reviewed the Justice Department&#x27;s review and concluded that the internal investigation had been inadequate, compromised, that the investigators had essentially been asked to investigate themselves. Brooks called it an institutional coverup on the record in committee.</p>
<p>In 1993, the matter was referred to a special counsel. A federal judge named Nicholas Buoua was appointed to conduct an independent investigation. Buoua reviewed the evidence, interviewed witnesses, and concluded no wrongdoing. Here&#x27;s the problem with that conclusion. The Senate Judiciary Committee separately conducted its own investigation in 1992.</p>
<p>Senior investigators on that committee reviewed documents that Bua&#x27;s team apparently did not obtain or did not request. The Senate investigators came to a different view. One of those investigators speaking years later on background to a journalist described a specific document, a single page classified. It had come through unofficial channels. a source inside the intelligence community who believed the coverup had gone far enough.</p>
<p>That document, the investigator said, named the person who had authorized the original theft of promise, named them directly with specificity. It went into a classified annex of the Senate committee&#x27;s report. The annex was never published. The classification has never been lifted. The document has never been publicly released.</p>
<p>And then something happened that took the entire story, everything we&#x27;ve established, every connection, every name, and placed it on a different level entirely. Two other people died. Not Dany, two others before Dany and connected tenuously but documentably to the same network of people and programs he was investigating. Alan Standorf was a signals intelligence analyst with the National Security Agency. He&#x27;d been in contact with Dany.</p>
<p>He&#x27;d promised to provide documents, technical documents about electronic surveillance programs that connected to the promise story. Standorf was found dead in his car at Dallasos airport in January 1991, 6 months before Dany. Blunt force trauma to the head. His death was listed as a homicide. It was never solved.</p>
<p>And before Standorf, Jonathan Moy, a British defense journalist investigating connections between weapons programs, specifically helicopter-based weapons systems, and a covert arms network that tracked directly back to some of the same people connected to Kabazon. Moy was found dead in his hotel room in Santiago, Chile in March 1990, hanging. Chilean police initially called it suicide. The subsequent investigation determined it was not a defense journalist dead in a hotel room. Initial verdict, suicide, reversed.</p>
<p>A signals intelligence analyst dead at an airport ruled homicide never solved. And then Danny Castillaro, dead in a hotel room. Verdict: suicide never reopened. Three people traveling in overlapping circles asking overlapping questions dead within 18 months of each other. The official position connects none of these deaths.</p>
<p>Separate incidents, separate investigations, separate conclusions. But here is what ties them together in a way that isn&#x27;t theory. It&#x27;s documentation. All three were at the time of their deaths in active contact with sources connected to the same network of privatized intelligence programs that ran through Kabazon through BCCI through promise. All three died before finishing what they were working on.</p>
<p>All three died in circumstances that generated early questions and produced final answers that satisfied almost no one who looked closely. And all three, this is the detail that the official investigations don&#x27;t know what to do with. All three were at the time of their deaths believed by their sources to be close. Close to what? Close to the name. Because here&#x27;s what Dany told his literary agent, Peggy Donahue, in a phone call approximately 10 days before he drove to Martinsburg.</p>
<p>She remembered it clearly enough to recount it in detail afterward. Dany said he had found the operational center of the octopus. Not a network, not a program, a person. Someone who existed at the intersection of the intelligence world, the criminal financial world, and the political world. Someone who had been present, not metaphorically, physically present, at multiple critical junctions in multiple scandals.</p>
<p>Someone whose name, Dany said, would be recognized by everyone. He said he was going to Martinsburg to confirm it. One meeting, one source, the final piece. And here&#x27;s the question that has no clean answer. The source who called Dany, who set up that meeting, called from a number that the Martinsburg police traced to a pay phone in Virginia, not in Martinsburg.</p>
<p>Whoever set up that meeting didn&#x27;t call from where they said they were. They called from a pay phone, anonymous, untraceable. And Danny, who had warned four people not to accept a suicide verdict if he turned up dead, drove to meet that source anyway. Why? Because whatever they offered him, whatever the final piece was, it was something he couldn&#x27;t walk away from. something specific enough, credible enough that a man who knew he was being watched and knew the risks chose to get in his car and drive 70 m to a hotel in West Virginia to meet someone he couldn&#x27;t fully verify.</p>
<p>What was it? What do you show a journalist who&#x27;s been building a case for 18 months, who has the documents, who has the names, who has everything except the one connecting thread that makes him drive toward the danger instead of away from it. There&#x27;s only one thing. You show him the evidence that makes the whole story undeniable. The document that names the person at the center. The piece that completes the picture.</p>
<p>You show him what he&#x27;s been looking for and then whatever happens next happens. Danny drove to Martinsburg on the evening of August 8th, 1991. He checked in. He called Tony. He went to sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning, the morning of the 9th, nothing. No record of a meeting, no record of a phone call from the room, no record of a visitor. The housekeeper found him on the morning of the 10th, 36 hours. The window is 36 hours wide. And inside that window, nothing.</p>
<p>No confirmed meetings, no confirmed contacts, no witnesses except except there&#x27;s a detail. One detail that surfaced not in the immediate investigation, not in the congressional hearings, but years later in a document obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by a researcher named Ken Thomas who spent years on the Castillo case. The document was a Martinsburg Police Department internal note, one page, handwritten, not dated precisely, but clearly from the initial investigation period. It references briefly without followup a report from a hotel staff member, not the housekeeper who found the body, a different employee, who said they had seen a man leaving the hotel in the early morning hours of August 9th carrying something. The note doesn&#x27;t describe the man.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t describe what he was carrying. There is no follow-up notation, no follow-up interview on record. The note just sits there in the file, single page, handwritten, one paragraph. And after that paragraph, nothing. Who was the man? What was he carrying? And why, in a hotel room where a man has just died under unclear circumstances, did the investigating officers not pursue a witness report of someone leaving the building? Those questions were never answered.</p>
<p>But there&#x27;s one more layer, one more piece that the congressional investigators who looked at this case later described as the thing that convinced them personally, not officially, that something was deeply wrong. It involves a specific phone call made from inside the Justice Department on a specific date to a specific person. And when the committee requested the records of that call, the log, the content, the participants, they were told the records didn&#x27;t exist. Except they did exist because the person who received the call kept their own notes. And those notes ended up in the hands of a Senate investigator in the spring of 1993.</p>
<p>And what those notes described, what that phone call was about, is the thread that connects every part of this story. Promise, Kabazon, BCCI, Earl Brian, the three deaths, the missing briefcase, the classified annex, the pay phone in Virginia. One call, one conversation connecting everything. That Senate investigator is still alive. They&#x27;ve not spoken publicly about what those notes contained and the notes themselves.</p>
<p>Where are they now? Let&#x27;s talk about what the Senate investigators actually found. &gt;&gt; Because this is where the story stops being about one journalist and one death and starts being about something much larger. Something that was operating before Danny Castillo was born and kept operating after he died. The Senate investigation into BCCI, the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, produced a final report in 1992. 704 pages.</p>
<p>Senators Kerry and Brown, fully sourced, fully documented, cross-referenced with classified annexes. Read it. It&#x27;s public. It&#x27;s in the Senate Archives. It names names, traces money flows, maps the network.</p>
<p>And buried inside it, not in the classified section, in the published text, is a passage that most people who discuss BCCI skip over because it connects to something that sounds too large to be credible. The report describes how BCCI was used by multiple intelligence services simultaneously. CIA, Pakistani intelligence, Saudi intelligence, Israeli intelligence, all running operations through the same bank, all aware at varying levels that the others were doing the same. It wasn&#x27;t a conspiracy of one government against the world. It was something stranger and more troubling.</p>
<p>It was multiple governments using the same criminal infrastructure separately. simultaneously. Each one knowing the bank was dirty, none of them willing to shut it down because shutting it down would expose their own operations. The bank finally collapsed in 1991, July 5th. Regulators in 62 countries seized its assets simultaneously.</p>
<p>The coordinated shutdown was by some accounts the largest bank closure in history. Danny Castillaro was found dead 36 days later. Was that timing meaningful? I don&#x27;t know. Neither does anyone else officially. What I know is that when BCCI collapsed, a lot of people who had been relying on its infrastructure, relying on its ability to move money invisibly, suddenly had exposure.</p>
<p>accounts that could be traced, flows that could be reconstructed, and at least one person connected to those accounts had known for months that a journalist was building a documented case that touched the same network. Now, here&#x27;s what happened to the Senate investigator. And this is where I&#x27;m going to be careful because I want to be precise with you. In the spring of 1993, while the Buoua special counsel was conducting his official investigation into the Inslaw affair, a senior investigator on the Senate Judiciary Committee staff received through a source inside the Justice Department a set of handwritten notes. The investigator has described these notes in general terms, but has not released them publicly, citing ongoing concerns about source protection.</p>
<p>what the investigator has confirmed on the record in interviews with journalists working the Castillaro story in the 1990s. The notes referenced a conversation that took place inside the Justice Department in the summer of 1991 before Dy&#x27;s death. The conversation concerned his investigation specifically by name. Read that again. Before Dany died, inside the Department of Justice, someone was having a conversation specifically about a freelance journalist named Danny Castillo and what he was working on.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not a theory. That&#x27;s what a Senate staff investigator confirmed happened based on notes he held in his hands. The investigator brought this to the Buoua special counsel&#x27;s attention. The special counsel&#x27;s team reviewed the matter. It did not appear in the Buoua report.</p>
<p>Why? The official non-answer is that the Buoua investigation focused narrowly on the promise theft itself, not on peripheral matters. That the conversation, whatever it contained, didn&#x27;t constitute evidence of criminal conduct. But here&#x27;s what that explanation can&#x27;t address. If someone at justice was discussing a specific journalist&#x27;s investigation by name before his death and those notes were not included in the special counsel&#x27;s report and not referred for further investigation, then either the notes didn&#x27;t show what the investigator believed they showed or someone made a decision about what the Buoua investigation would and wouldn&#x27;t look at. And here&#x27;s the thing about the Bua report that the Senate investigators, the ones who&#x27;d seen more, said diplomatically was incomplete.</p>
<p>Buoua had not obtained or had not requested several categories of documents that the Hamiltons believed were directly relevant. documents from the National Security Council, documents from the office of the Deputy Attorney General, documents connected to specific classified programs that intersected with the promised distribution. When the Hamilton&#x27;s lawyer, Elliot Richardson, remember, asked why those documents hadn&#x27;t been sought, the Bua team said they&#x27;d conducted the investigation as they saw fit. Richardson, a man not given to dramatic language, described the Buoua investigation publicly as fundamentally flawed. A man who once resigned as attorney general rather than compromise an investigation called the official investigation into this case fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the record. That&#x27;s what he said. Now, let&#x27;s close the loop on the source. Who set up the Martinsburg meeting? We can&#x27;t name them with certainty, but we can tell you what investigators and journalists who spent years on this case came to believe based on phone records, on interviews with Danyy&#x27;s contacts, on the pattern of who knew what and when. The source was connected to Robert Booth Nichols.</p>
<p>Not necessarily Nicholls himself, but someone in Nichols&#x27;s orbit. Someone who would have known the right language to use, the right detail to dangle, the right framing to make a journalist who&#x27;d spent 18 months on a story believe that the final piece had just become available. Dany had trusted Nicholls more than he should have. Not because he was naive. He was a careful, experienced reporter.</p>
<p>But because Nicholls had given him real information, verifiable, useful, documented information about real events and real people. That&#x27;s the geometry of the limited hangout. You earn trust with truth and then you use that trust at the moment of maximum vulnerability. Nicholls died in 2009. He never confirmed or denied any involvement in Danyy&#x27;s death.</p>
<p>In the final years of his life, he gave occasional interviews in which he acknowledged his intelligence community connections in vague terms. He described himself as a consultant. He maintained that his relationship with Dany had been friendly and professional. The people who believe that version note that no evidence directly places Nicholls or anyone in his network at the Sheran Inn on August 9th, 1991. The people who don&#x27;t believe it note that absence of evidence in a case where evidence systematically disappeared is not the same as evidence of absence.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what we know. Here&#x27;s the inventory of what&#x27;s actually documented. The Martinsburg source called from a pay phone. Untraceable. The briefcase containing Dy&#x27;s notes was never found.</p>
<p>Not in the room, not in his car, not anywhere. The body was imbalmed before an independent autopsy could be requested. A hotel staff member reported seeing a man leave the building in the early morning hours of August 9th. That report was noted in a single handwritten paragraph and never followed up. The FBI had a monitoring file on Dany before his death.</p>
<p>The relevant records remain partially classified on national security grounds. A Senate staff investigator received notes describing a Justice Department conversation about Dy&#x27;s investigation that were not incorporated into the official special counsel&#x27;s report. And a federal judge in the original Inslaw bankruptcy ruling determined that the Justice Department had stolen promise by trickery, fraud, and deceit. That finding was never overturned on its merits. Take those facts alone.</p>
<p>Set aside everything else. Set aside Kabazon and BCCI and Earl Brian and Robert Booth Nichols. Just those documented facts. A journalist investigating government fraud was being monitored by the government. He died under circumstances that raised immediate questions.</p>
<p>Physical evidence disappeared. The official investigation was described as fundamentally flawed by one of the most respected lawyers in American history. Congressional investigators found the internal review inadequate and records directly relevant to understanding what happened remain classified. That&#x27;s not a conspiracy theory. That&#x27;s a documented institutional failure at minimum.</p>
<p>And what it means at minimum is that we still don&#x27;t know what happened in room 517 of the Martinsburg Sheridan on the night of August 8th and the morning of August 9th, 1991. We don&#x27;t know. And the people who would know, the people who were in that room, the people who made decisions about that investigation, the people who saw those notes and chose not to include them, haven&#x27;t said. Now, let&#x27;s talk about what the name was. Dany told his literary agent he had a name.</p>
<p>He told his brother he had a name. He told a journalist colleague the same thing. He never said the name aloud. Not on record. Not in a way that survived.</p>
<p>But his manuscript, or rather the portions of it that he&#x27;d shared before his death, point in a consistent direction. The person Dany believed was at the center of the octopus was not a career criminal, not a rogue intelligence operative, not a mid-level contractor with compartmentalized access. He believed it was someone operating at the intersection of the official world and the shadow world. Someone whose official position provided cover, someone whose name carried institutional credibility that made the accusations sound on the surface impossible. He believed it was someone in the Department of Justice, someone whose position gave them authority over the promised contracts, over the relationship with Insaw, over the classified programs that the software was being routed through.</p>
<p>Someone who could authorize the theft and authorize the cover up and authorize the containment and who had, if Danyy&#x27;s sourcing was right, been doing exactly that for years. Multiple journalists and investigators who reviewed what survived of Danyy&#x27;s manuscript and spoke with his sources in the years after his death came to believe he was pointing at a specific figure. The name that surfaces most consistently in the most credible accounts is someone who was a senior official at the Department of Justice during the Me years. Connected to the promise distribution, connected to the programs that Rakanoshut described, connected to the financial flows that ran through BCCI. I&#x27;m not going to state that name as a proven fact because we don&#x27;t have the briefcase.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t have Dy&#x27;s full manuscript. We have fragments, accounts, secondhand sourcing filtered through years of subsequent reporting. What I am going to say is this. The person or persons Dany believed were at the center of the octopus have never been criminally charged in connection with the promise affair. Have never been charged in connection with his death.</p>
<p>have never been required to answer under oath in a public proceeding the specific questions that Danyy&#x27;s investigation raised. That&#x27;s not because those questions were asked and answered. It&#x27;s because they were never formally asked. The House Judiciary investigation stalled. The Buoua special counsel closed without indictments.</p>
<p>The Senate BCCI investigation produced a report that named the bank and its facilitators, but didn&#x27;t pursue the American domestic connections to the point of criminal referral. The Martinsburg investigation closed. Dy&#x27;s family&#x27;s push for an independent autopsy came too late. At every junction, every point where the investigation could have pushed forward, it stopped. That&#x27;s not a coincidence of incompetence.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a pattern. And Danny Castillo understood patterns. Here&#x27;s what I want you to take from this. And I mean this not as a slogan, not as a punchline, but as something that has real consequences for how you understand the country you live in. Dany wasn&#x27;t wrong about the octopus.</p>
<p>The arms of it that he&#x27;d documented. promise caban bcci were real. The connections he&#x27;d traced were real. The Senate and House investigators who looked at the same evidence took it seriously enough to hold hearings issue subpoenas and described the official responses as inadequate and obstructive. He wasn&#x27;t chasing a ghost.</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s the part that matters beyond Danyy&#x27;s individual story. What the octopus described, what Dany was mapping was a specific and durable phenomenon, the privatization of covert operations, the creation of self-funding intelligence programs that operated outside the congressional oversight structure, programs that didn&#x27;t need appropriations because they generated their own revenue through arms sales, software licensing, and financial fraud. programs that didn&#x27;t need congressional authorization because they existed in the legally ambiguous space between government agencies and private contractors. Iran Contra was the most visible example of this. Reagan&#x27;s National Security Council ran a covert arms program funded by drug money and arm sales to Iran, completely bypassing the congressional prohibition on funding the Contras.</p>
<p>When it was exposed, the official position was rogue operators, a few bad actors, not a system, not a method. But Dany was arguing, and the evidence he&#x27;d assembled supported, that Iran Contra wasn&#x27;t an aberration. It was an instance of something that had been operating for decades. A method for conducting foreign policy that the elected government of the United States could not formally authorize using tools, money, leverage, information that couldn&#x27;t be traced back to any official decision. Think about what that means for accountability.</p>
<p>If foreign policy is being made by people who operate outside the official structure using money from criminal banks and arms deals and stolen software, then there is no democratic accountability. There is no vote, no oversight, no recourse. The elected government says one thing, the shadow structure does another. and the classified system that might reveal the gap is sealed off from the people who are supposedly in charge of it. That&#x27;s not a new observation.</p>
<p>Senator Frank Church said something close to it in 1975 when his committee exposed the CIA&#x27;s domestic surveillance programs and assassination plots. He used the phrase rogue elephant, worried that the intelligence services had grown beyond any president&#x27;s ability to control them. The debate about whether church was right has never been resolved because the classified record that would settle it has never been opened. Danny Castillaro was trying to open it. He got close enough that someone decided he needed to be stopped.</p>
<p>or in the kinder version of events, he got close enough to the despair of seeing every official channel fail that he stopped himself. Either way, he&#x27;s gone. The briefcase is gone. The manuscript exists only in fragments. And the questions he was asking, the specific sourced documented questions are still open.</p>
<p>Not because they can&#x27;t be answered, because the people who could answer them have chosen not to. Here&#x27;s the last thing I want to say about Danny Castillo as a person before we pull back to the bigger picture. He wasn&#x27;t perfect. He made sourcing decisions that a more experienced investigative journalist might not have made. He trusted people he shouldn&#x27;t have fully trusted.</p>
<p>He was excited, genuinely, visibly excited about what he&#x27;d found in a way that maybe made him less careful than he needed to be at the end. He was also, by every account, a kind man, a good father figure to his nieces and nephews, funny, disarming, the kind of person you wanted to tell things to, which is probably why his sources did. He believed that what he&#x27;d found mattered, that publishing it would change something. That the documented evidence of a self-funding shadow government running covert operations outside Democratic control was information that citizens of a democracy needed to have. He wasn&#x27;t wrong about that either.</p>
<p>His brother Tony carried this for decades, pushed Congress, spoke to journalists, kept the questions alive. Tony believed until the end of his life that Dany was murdered, not that he was suicidal, not that he was careless, that someone made a decision. Tony died in 2015. He never got an answer. And here&#x27;s the thing that I find not comforting exactly, but important.</p>
<p>The Inslaw case is still technically unresolved. The Hamiltons pursued it for 30 years in various courts and venues. They never got the full acknowledgement they believed the evidence supported, but they also never stopped. And the documents they filed, the testimony they gathered, the congressional record they helped create, it&#x27;s all still there. sitting in archives, accessible by anyone with a library card and patience.</p>
<p>Danyy&#x27;s story survived him. Not the way he wanted, not in the book he was writing with his name on the cover and his sourcing in the end notes, but in the congressional records, in the court filings, in the journalism of the people who picked up where he left off. Writers like Ken Thomas, like journalist James Rididgeway, like the reporters at the Village Voice and Wired who spent years in the early 1990s documenting what the major networks wouldn&#x27;t touch. The story survived and the questions survived with it. Let me give you the big picture, what this case actually reveals about the world we live in.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the framework. After World War II, the United States built an intelligence apparatus that was by design shielded from ordinary democratic accountability. Classified programs, black budgets, executive override, need to know compartmentalization. The justification was the Cold War. The Soviet threat was real.</p>
<p>Secrecy was necessary. But the architecture built for secrecy doesn&#x27;t dismantle itself when the justification changes. It finds new justifications. It expands. It develops relationships with private contractors that blur the line between government action and private action.</p>
<p>It develops funding mechanisms that don&#x27;t require congressional appropriation. It develops methods of operation that don&#x27;t require official authorization. What Danny Castillo found, what the Senate BCCI report documented, what the INSLAW litigation established, what the Iran Contra hearings put on television was a specific, mature expression of that architecture. Not a conspiracy of evil men in a room deciding to do wrong. Something more bureaucratic and more durable than that.</p>
<p>a system, a method, a way of doing things that had been refined over decades by people who believed, some of them genuinely, some of them self-servingly, that the national interest required it. And that method requires, above all, one thing, silence. Not the dramatic silence of classified documents, the ordinary silence of institutions that close ranks. Investigations that stop. Journalists who can&#x27;t get traction.</p>
<p>Witnesses who remember nothing. Records that aren&#x27;t found. Reports that are filed and forgotten. Danny Castillaro tried to break that silence with a portable typewriter and a vinyl briefcase and the belief that if he could just get the documentation right, the story would speak for itself. and someone or the system itself, which sometimes doesn&#x27;t need anyone in particular, made sure he didn&#x27;t finish.</p>
<p>The promise software, the program that started all of this, didn&#x27;t disappear when Insaw lost in court. Versions of it kept spreading. The intelligence community kept using modified database management tools with the kind of capabilities that reconcil them and what databases they&#x27;re reading right now. That question has never been fully answered. And the method that promise represented using software as a surveillance backdoor embedded in foreign and domestic agencies, giving the installer invisible read access to everything the software touches.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not a 1982 idea anymore. We live now in a world where every device we carry runs software we didn&#x27;t write, updated by companies we don&#x27;t fully understand, connected to servers we can&#x27;t inspect. Danny Castillaro was trying to document a specific historical instance of this problem. The deliberate installation of a backdoor in software sold to governments around the world. He died before he could publish.</p>
<p>the problem he was trying to document did not die with him. Now, one final thing before we close. The name, the classified Senate Annex, the one that reportedly identifies the person who authorized the original Promise theft, the person Danny believed was the operational center of the octopus. It&#x27;s still classified. As of today, it has not been released.</p>
<p>The FOIA requests that have been filed for it have been denied primarily under the national security exemptions of the FOIA statute. Specifically, exemption one, which covers information that could damage national security, and exemption three, which covers information that another statute requires to be kept secret. Which statute? The government doesn&#x27;t say. Exemption three doesn&#x27;t require them to. They can cite the existence of a statute without identifying it.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the architecture of permanent secrecy. You can file your request. You can get your denial. You can appeal your denial. And at the end of the process, you can be told that there&#x27;s a law you can&#x27;t see that prevents the release of information about a classification you can&#x27;t access, about an event you can&#x27;t verify.</p>
<p>It is in every technical sense legal. It is not in any meaningful sense accountability. Tony Castillaro went to his grave not knowing what happened to his brother. The Hamiltons went to their graves. Bill Hamilton died in 2023 without the full legal vindication that two federal courts had come within arms reach of granting them.</p>
<p>Michael Rakanuto, as of the last confirmed reporting, had served his federal sentence and lived in obscurity. His testimony long dismissed by official sources. His predictions, the arrest, the consequences, the cover up having come true in every particular. The Martinsburg Police Department case file is closed. The Buoua report is in the archives.</p>
<p>The classified Senate annex is sealed. The briefcase has never been found. And the questions Danny Castillo drove to Martinsburg to answer, the questions he believed a single meeting would resolve, those questions are still open. 30 years later, still open. If you&#x27;ve made it this far, you&#x27;ve earned the right to sit with that for a minute.</p>
<p>The discomfort of it, the specific grinding discomfort of a story that doesn&#x27;t resolve, that has documented evidence pointing in a direction that official investigations chose not to follow, that has a dead journalist, a missing briefcase, a classified document, and a Senate investigator who received notes he&#x27;s never made fully public. The truth is right in front of us. Parts of it, anyway. More than enough to ask better questions than the official investigations asked. Danny Castillaro asked those questions.</p>
<p>He just didn&#x27;t get to publish the answers. Maybe someone else will. But here&#x27;s what I need to tell you before we&#x27;re done. Because there&#x27;s one thread I haven&#x27;t pulled all the way, and it&#x27;s the one that takes this from history to right now. The promise software, or rather the concept it demonstrated, didn&#x27;t stay in the past.</p>
<p>Investigators following the BCCI trail in the years after the bank&#x27;s collapse, kept finding the same thing. The same type of modified database access tool. The same pattern of embedding it in foreign agencies. The same pattern of intelligence services reading over the shoulders of the governments they were supposedly helping. And some of those investigators started finding a name they didn&#x27;t expect.</p>
<p>Not a government agency, not a contractor, a private company, one that still exists, one that still sells software to governments around the world. One whose products are embedded in the legal and intelligence systems of dozens of countries. And one that has connections, documented, traceable connections to the same network of people that Danny Casillaro was mapping when he drove to Martinsburg. The company&#x27;s name, what it sells, who owns it, and who can read its data. That&#x27;s the next video.</p>
