            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I am Thomas and we do educational material on this channel and today we are I believe on the 117th day of uh studying the reciprocal system of theory which is a Theory of Everything derived by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 we&#x27;re looking at his final book that came out after he died in 1995 called beyond space and time and this was his attempt to get into metaphysics philosophy religion psychology uh as opposed to his earlier books were to her hard science based uh science uh chemistry and physics and astronomy it&#x27;s got a couple books on economics as well and uh this is a theory of everything so basically you kind of understand the the basic gist of it and then you can um kind of learn the language and then you can actually use the reciprocal system yourself to apply it to whatever problems you have in your life uh whatever problem solved uh problems that you want to solve and so on so uh we are at the very end here looking at his uh final book beyond space and time we are in chapter 28 uh which is the Final Chapter called human Destiny and he&#x27;s going into uh kind of what happens when you die or speculating or scientifically speculating on what happens when you die now the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we have in Larson&#x27;s world uh Universe it is a universe of motion um and he would also use the word change or even space time uh instead of motion but uh the basic idea is that the for Larson the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time and a matter and energy are really just simply different kinds of motion as is really all type of scientific phenomena are kinds of motion relationships between space and time space and time don&#x27;t really exist they&#x27;d only exist together in motion um they don&#x27;t exist separately from one another they are reciprocals of each other in the same way that um three halves and four and two-thirds are reciprocals of each other and hence the name the reciprocal system of theory now um the since they are reciprocals they basically have the same qualities uh space we know to be multi-dimensional three or more Dimensions time therefore is also three or more Dimensions um time we know to be flowing and progressing uh therefore space is also flowing and progressing which was observed by the Hubble telescope in the recession of the distant galaxies Larson refers to that as clock time and clock space the scalar progression of space or time and then coordinate time and coordinate space are the uh 3D or more dimensions of space or time also space and time only come in discrete units uh there&#x27;s no con continuity there they come in in chunks one at a time and one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is really just one and so it&#x27;s really pointing at being the origin or being the midpoint the null point the neutral point of the universe and there is an entire half of the universe that&#x27;s actually moving faster than the speed of light which Larson calls the cosmic sector or sector two and then the half of the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light that we recognize uh is called sector one or the material sector now so this is a big difference from Einstein who believed that the speed of light was the maximum speed of the universe for Larson is the midpoint or the null Point Oregon the origin of this universe um now uh the material sector that we&#x27;re familiar with you know Grows by bonding aggregation to its most complex level which is the DNA molecule at that point the DNA molecule becomes eligible to be controlled by an entity from sector two of the cosmic sector this linkage between the material and Cosmic sector at the right proportions in the right configuration is what Larson calls the life unit life is a combination of those two things sector one and sector two and Life starts out as a single-celled organism and it grows and develops over time through uh up until it gets to its most complex level which Larson says is the intelligent human being or humanoid and at that point that intelligent being becomes eligible to be controlled overall by an entity from sector three and this is what Larson calls the metaphysical sector beyond space and time I would submit that this really has to do with this speed of light region but Larson other people would have would call it the numinous or the religious or god or goddess and um you know Larson calls it sector three but Larson says that you know sector three is only good and sector 3 communicates with intelligent human beings and what it communicates is always correct and uh but our ability to decode those messages is limited uh given that we are more or less like a uh single-celled organism of uh spirituality and so we&#x27;re not quite developed enough yet to really be able to decode these messages okay so that&#x27;s kind of the basic gist of the of the theory now uh we&#x27;re going to take over here toward the end of the last chapter uh where he&#x27;s talking about human Destiny he was just talking about how uh he&#x27;s he he leans toward this Reincarnation of uh beings um kind of coming back and coming back and coming back and working on themselves um and he doesn&#x27;t necessarily restrict it to coming back to Earth uh per se but um he rejects many aspects of reincarnation from the East such as coming back as an animal or being punished coming back and and being punished he he rejects all of that but um uh let&#x27;s let him uh go ahead right here it does not necessarily follow however that the future existences of the sector 3 components of the human personalities are restricted to the universe that contains the Earth there is no actual evidence of such a restriction and we must therefore give consideration to the possibility that the sector 3 entities released from their ties to Earthly bodies may have their future existences in some altogether different universes the range of possibilities that can now be visualized even without taking into consideration the likelihood that we are seeing only a small part of the total picture is the most striking fact about the survival situation as it appears in the light of the new information developed in the pre-present investigation it is clear that human thinking on subjects such as the reality of metaphysical existence and the nature thereof has thus far been based on very inadequate foundations there are people says Carl Jung who feel no craving for image immortality and who shudder at the thought of sitting on a cloud and playing the harp for ten thousand years end quote behind the facetious wording of this comment there is a reflection on the prevailing concept of existence after physical after physical death as an extension of physical life the objects symbolized by clouds and hearts are physical objects years are periods of physical time none of these entities survives and the entity that does survive death therefore cannot be either physical or permanent the concept of Eternity that looms so large in the teachings of many religions has no meaning in an existence that transcends space and time unfortunately this knowledge of what the metaphysical existence is not does not give us many Clues as to what it is as has been demonstrated in the preceding Pages the door to an understanding of this existence is certainly not closed but the opening that we have accomplished is still only a very narrow crack and we are a long way from being able to speak with certainty about what we see however the balance of probabilities as it appears at the moment is definitely in favor of a succession of existences in which the individual metaphysical entities play many different roles and human life on Earth occupies only one place probably relatively low in the scale this brings us back to the question as to why the development and Improvement of these metaphysical entities ethical Personalities in human life and elsewhere should be a desirable end or a desirable intermediate step if it is not an end in itself this is a question that we cannot answer as matters now stand we will have to wait for more light from some Source additional scientific investigation similar to the one reported herein a study and Analysis of Revelation along the lines suggested earlier in clear Insight on the part of some competent investigation making investigator making his inductive leap from a higher platform of accumulated knowledge that now exists or something else on that order it is even possible that existence as a whole does not proceed toward any end in the sense of a final goal indeed finality may be meaningless where time does not exist we have found that the physical universe is cyclical the only one-way process that we observe in operation is the development of ethical personalities a non-physical process if we uh now just to clarify where he&#x27;s talking about ethical personalities that is strictly a sector three thing having to do with the metaphysical ethical he also uses the term moral in that regard and the development of the personality is basically having enough contact with sector three that uh you know you form kind of a tapestry you know some kind of uh some kind of amalgamation of many different uh encounters with sector three okay um if we extrapolate the general cyclic characteristics of the physical Universe to existence as a whole as we have previously done with the various observed properties of that universe a procedure that would seem to be justified by the same basic considerations it would follow that the entire development process whether it is accomplished in one step or a series of steps is merely one phase of a great cycle just what would be involved in the inverse phase of the cycle is an open question of course none of the foregoing answers the question what is the meaning and object of it all it merely pushes the question a little farther into the background but even though the ultimate why still eludes us recognition of our immediate goal the purpose of our Earthly existence is sufficient to put the various activities of human life into their proper perspective science for instance which has sought to abrogate itself into uh abrogate to itself the prominence formerly accorded to religion is now seen to be of permanent value only to the extent that it contributes indirectly to the purposes which with which religion is directly concerned human happiness which so many philosophers have regarded as the primary objective of life now appears as only an incidental and largely irrelevant aspect of the pattern of events the Affairs of the here and now that Loom so large in our world picture are actually of little significance in themselves they are important only by reason of the opportunities that they afford for making progress toward our ultimate objective if life has been a pleasant experience we are fortunate but nothing more the extent to which we have accomplished the purpose of our existence depends on the nature of the structure that we have built not on the amount of sunshine during the progress of the work for the present the matters that we have discussed in this Final Chapter must remain to a large degree speculative but one inspiring fact now stands out in bold relief we and our first cousins the intelligent beings elsewhere in the physical Universe are the actors in the portion of the cosmic drama that is played in that Universe all else is but a stage upon which we go through our routines one of the effects of the scientific of scientific progress particularly that of the last few centuries has been to deflate man&#x27;s previously exalted opinion of his place in the universe he who once thought that he stood at the center of all things with a mandate calling for dominion over all the Earth has been stripped of his glories one by one that Earth which he had assumed was co-extensive with the universe as a whole was found to be merely one of the Lesser members of a group of planets encircling the Sun that sun it developed uh is not the unique object which it appears to be when viewed from man&#x27;s location on the contrary it is just an undistinguished star on the outskirts of a galaxy containing billions of stars a large proportion of which far outshine the Sun finally more recent discoveries have shown that the Galaxy itself has no special claim to distinction and is merely one of billions that populate space in every direction as far as our most powerful instruments can reach on this basis man is no more than an insignificant spec in the vast expanse of the cosmos a tiny bit of matter Whose actions have an utterly negligible effect on the processes of the universe all this is now profoundly altered the facts as discovered by scientific observation and measurements still stand as they must but their significance is now altogether different as an aggregate of matter man is still dwarfed by his physical surroundings but this investigation has revealed that the physical aspect is a relatively unimportant facet of human existence and that the scientists conclusions as to man&#x27;s insignificance base as they are on physical size and perform in the performance of physical functions are wholly invalid according to our findings the physical Universe accomplishes nothing on its own account it exists only for the purpose of facilitating the development of the more advanced aspects of intelligent life to Aid Man and his relatives on other planets to make progress toward their final goal our universe of motion is only one portion perhaps no more than a very small portion of a larger system but we human beings are not limited to this small portion of the whole we are citizens in the greater Cosmos and we will find our ultimate Destiny in that wider field okay that&#x27;s the end of Dewey Larson&#x27;s um beyond space and time and uh I think it took us about uh 95 videos to get there but um but that&#x27;s it and uh you know I just kind of did this so that uh people could kind of um put it on their playlists and just you know listen to one after another after another and you know to make it a little bit more accessible but you know just to to uh shed some light on this um reciprocal system of theory and how you can apply it and how broad its scope is um I&#x27;m going to come back here very shortly and start doing um some more videos on Larson uh we&#x27;re gonna look first at an interview that he did in 1984. uh when he was 85 or six years old and um it kind of talks about you know how he developed the theory what it means to him where it&#x27;s going from here how the theory has been accepted by other scientists that are out there kind of like where he stood at that time and that hopefully will give us a little bit of background than to go into his uh magnum opus which is called the structure of the physical Universe which is a three-volume work uh containing uh works on physics chemistry and astronomy I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to go through that the way that we went through this by like reading the whole thing but we will look at various parts of it we will try to um you know try to come up with something now I think that that structure of the physical universe is really a great thing because uh for me I took all those subjects in high school and college but they never really sunk in never really cared about that but then I started studying Larson because I was inspired by his contrariness and um I came back and eventually got my hands on a mainstream uh textbooks of those subjects and I already knew this stuff with before even reading it just from Reading Larson so it&#x27;s good to get his point of view now I&#x27;m going to be doing one video this weekend that is actually on uh the resurrection it&#x27;s a decode of the Resurrection coming strictly from the Bible uh so look forward to that probably tomorrow um all all sources are going to be straight from the Bible so not bringing in anything separate but it&#x27;s kind of just a litmus test going over it and seeing if this decode makes sense or not okay we&#x27;ll check you later have a great day</p>
