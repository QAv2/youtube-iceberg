            <p>I&#x27;m thinking I want to investigate lener lenr and that&#x27;s low energy nuclear reactions okay I&#x27;m an electrical engineer I&#x27;m not a physicist but I&#x27;ve got some idea of something I could do a really cool experiment given my water carbonation background creating cavitation is something I&#x27;m an expert in not by choice okay the idea here is we could take cavitation which leads to sonoluminescence which leads to a lot of temperature and pressure at The Crush site of a little bubble we create that sonol luminescence with a horn on a trans ucer so pazo again and then within that sonol luminescent bubble which could be you know tens of thousands of Kelvin if not 100,000 or a million Kelvin potentially like a 1 to 5 Micron Sparger we might pump argon into there to increase the temperature of that bubble further now this is the cool part if we put Nickel in there I&#x27;m thinking a very thin nickel wire maybe 10,000 of an inch pure nickel if there is a fusion reaction the nickel will turn into copper it will release energy so we&#x27;ll see an increase in temperature of the water relative to not having the nickel in there we can measure this we can log it into Excel using Raspberry Pi and python we can do the lener experiment in my lab right here and what I&#x27;m toying with is do I build this Water Reactor from scratch or do I repurpose this crazy monstrosity to be a liquid Water Reactor where I can do these experiments let me know what you guys think in the comments all right thank you adios</p>
