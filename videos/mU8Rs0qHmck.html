            <p>because I I know from from your trajectory and from your experiences you&#x27;ve experienced some sort of extraterrestrial encounter perh perhaps two of them in your lifetime and connecting it to the archetypes and the collective Consciousness in that sense your idea could connect with mine and also maybe you know influence the way I do I I experience or or imagine the possibility of interacting with with aliens or with other species correct yeah well I mean I I just want to you know set the boundary conditions that I think the field at large needs to um and let&#x27;s stop calling it alien because alien has implications alien you know is so wound up with the um the ideas of Hollywood and what an alien means as opposed to non-human right or at least I mean you still have to be careful about future humans coming back do you still call them human um you know or alternative reality humans are they still human um and so just just say uh something that clearly is not present day human um and uh you know but uh encompassing other intelligences and so as long as we can keep that as the framework and start to institutionalize that into the language that helps um um it gets rid of a lot of biases and so you know my thought around what it was that I saw was certainly an instance of an archetype whether it was the you know what I can in retrospect see was uh a classic UFO event thing that something that went over my head like 40 50 feet over my head um you know to a 12-year-old boy it was lights on something that vaguely looked like a saucer in the dark um at the level of the trees going right over me soundlessly in my bedroom it was little men what were they doing in my bedroom you know at the age of seven or eight or however old I was um I&#x27;m constantly changing my idea of what how old I must have been based on how old my brother was at the time um and so uh you know I I while neither of those inter actions were negative or positive they were mind expanding for a young boy um to realize that there was something else uh because I was clearly not sleeping in either case uh and so what what was that and so it caused me to question everything for my whole life so let&#x27;s expand that to Society at large if those kinds of archetypes show up on a regular basis to many people two things one what does it tell us about the human brain structure that it seems to see this stuff so quickly or easily and infer that it is other versus let&#x27;s say that these alleged observations are real what is the message that it sends because I don&#x27;t believe that the things that people see they see necessarily by happen stance I wonder if it is a message you know people often talk about you know and and jod Foster in the movie contact and we&#x27;ve all heard of something called the wow signal right that signal that you see that somehow only radio astronomers are able to pick up you know and we always I mean obious is a good friend but why do people always run to astronomers to get their idea of something why don&#x27;t you run to a biologist because or a psychiatrist maybe they should be the first people you talk to not to an astronomer um so but that wow signal you know SEI sets the bar very low in fact almost insanely uh trivial we&#x27;re fine with something as long as it&#x27;s 100,000 Lighty years away you know because I can never prove it I mean it&#x27;s such a lazy approach if I can never prove it I can I can imagine any signal as being an instance of a techno signature right so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s actually a coward&#x27;s approach in my opinion sorry radio astronomers it&#x27;s a coward&#x27;s approach how about you ask the question not is there something here why don&#x27;t you ask the question can there be something here because then if you start running the numbers you find that even a technology CI technological civilization as simple as ours or perhaps a hundred years from ours where we could imagine launching uh just a simple rocket with a sufficiently powered AI that it could be in essence a Von Newman probe even at 10 to 20,000 M an hour we could populate the entire galaxy with humanlike things Seated on other planets in a mere 5 billion years right I mean five billion years sounds like a lot of time but the likes of Neil degrass Tyson and all the rest ridicule the idea of ET by saying well it they couldn&#x27;t get here in any reasonable able time we Define reasonable</p>
