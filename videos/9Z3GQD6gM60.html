            <p>all right hello welcome to my channel this channel is for educational purposes we generally look at uh theories of everything in depth and uh try to get into them and uh demonstrate how they can benefit your life at least helping out your Paradigm so that you uh have a holistic view of things and and U kind of a net to be able to incorporate all the new things that you learn into one um one model and um today is the 346th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from one Dewey Bernard Larson Mr Larson lived in the 20th century he died in 1990 and and um for the 60 years before that he was working out his reciprocal system uh the basic idea is that we live in a universe made out of motion not matter or energy or force or anything else but motion and for Larson motion was the relationship between space and time space and time are basically reciprocals uh they do not exist separately they only exist together in motion like a fraction uh space and time space or time as the numerator time or space as the denominator in motion speed for example the most basic kind of motion uh is space divided by time it took me uh the car is moving 15 miles per hour 15 miles of space and one hour of time space over time energy uh which is kind of the inverse quantity is time over space it took me one hour to push that thing half a mile that is 1 hour of time half a mile of space energy and uh all other scientific uh quantities units that you know of also can be broken down specifically and exclusively in terms of space and time only that you have to recognize that time and space both come in three dimensions that is uh or they can come in three dimensions uh or even four if you&#x27;re thinking of tetrahedral coordinates this is what Larson calls coordinate space coordinate time we don&#x27;t have a problem with coordinate space we normally think of space as being three-dimensional XYZ coordinates but uh as we as it&#x27;s reciprocal time also has the identical qualities as space so it also has three dimensions now time we normally recognize as a scaler quantity scaler is something that has a magnitude but no particular direction and uh you know in uh clock the clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but in no particular direction and um by the reciprocal postulate then there&#x27;s also what you would call clock space and this is that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and uh you can use a balloon with dots on it as a model for this if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other the further away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other and this was also observed D in the Hubble telescope uh the Hubble telescope observed that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other so um that means they have no specific Direction each one is moving away from each other one and it is not until you actually pick one arbitrarily and decide that this is the one that&#x27;s motionless then they have a Direction so the direction comes in when you choose the reference point or the reference system um but not until then so scalar Mo the scalar motion itself has no Direction only when you choose the reference point uh do you have the direction so the direction is a product of the reference point and not of the motion itself these are matters that uh should be known by science but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re kind of not uh they know about the the recession of the distant galaxies they know about the dots on the balloon but they don&#x27;t really see it as a a fundamentally different kind of motion than your normal velocity or any other kind kind of motion that has a magnitude and a direction Larson on the other hand sees this uh kind of motion scalar motion as being his fundamental motion um and uh we were going to we&#x27;re going to get into that in more detail today when we look at some of the writings of Dr Bruce peret who is one of Larson&#x27;s um chief revisers and re- evaluators and uh um we&#x27;ll be looking at one of his articles today now there&#x27;s also what you would call the discrete unit postulate that basically means that space and time only come in discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time uh below which you do not have space or time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you don&#x27;t have space and if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time you don&#x27;t have time you got to have that full unit if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time then you have the speed of light uh that&#x27;s what Larson refers to as unit speed the speed of light is 1 over 1 equals 1 unit speed and this unit speed is really the background or The Ether the origin the reference point the natural reference system of the reciprocal system so that basically means that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light Which flies in the face of Einstein&#x27;s dictum that the speed of light was the speed limit of the universe for Larsson it is the midpoint this also points out a lot of the important differences between Legacy Legacy science Reckoning and reciprocal system Reckoning when you&#x27;re talking about Legacy science they&#x27;re they are measuring from a0 point A uh something that is motionless which in LaRon system is doesn&#x27;t even exist but uh Legacy scientist measures from motionless from zero and it goes plus one plus 2+ three on the positive side and min-1 -2 -3 on the negative side but in the reciprocal system you start from one not from zero now just think of a uh an additive system as opposed to a multiplicative system if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re talking about an additive system you start from zero and you have plus one plus 2 + three and then you have Min - one - 2 - 3 the the balance when you balance them the balance adds to zero like so plus two is balanced by minus 2 if you add them up you get zero but with a reciprocal system you have one in the center and on one side you have 2 3 4 and on the other side you have 1/2 13 and 1 14th so your balance in by what the balance is occurring where you&#x27;re multiplying them to get one 3 * 1/3 = 1 4 * 1/4 = 1 so that&#x27;s kind of a whole different way of Reckoning um based on whether it&#x27;s being uh a an additive system or a multiplicative system okay so and also then this creates a u boundary between two different halves of the universe the which is unit speed the speed of light uh when you cross over from one sector to the other Larsson calls these the material sector and the cosmic sector the cosmic sector is faster than light the material sector is slower than light and when you cross the speed of light moving from one sector to the other you have to invert the relations of space and time so in the material sector you have coordinate space and you have clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later but in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and clock space three dimensions of time and space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no particular direction so um and so that is uh something of great power because even though we don&#x27;t really understand what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector we can understand it through extrapolation what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector is exactly the same in general as what&#x27;s going on in the material sector just that we have to invert the roles of space and time so it gives us great power to penetrate into the cosmic sector and understand what&#x27;s going on there okay now uh we&#x27;re going to read uh this article from Dr Bruce perat he is uh one of the researchers that came up with rs2 the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system along with Dr kvk neru they came up with rs2 um which was to keep the spirit of lson and the idea of this universe of motion but to um make some some adjustments to some of the things that Larson derived from the system uh Larson believed that his uh system was correct but that possibly not all of his applications were going to be correct um and so he was waiting for people people to come around after his day was over in order to uh make these Corrections because he believed that his his his mistakes would become obvious over time and then they would need to be cleaned up and so uh doctors pet and nou have done some work on this now you know perhaps their work will need to be cleaned up eventually um or at least part of their work or or whatever but um so uh pet has written a series of kind of tutorials on the reciprocal system uh called rs211 rs212 and so on this is RS 2104 and it&#x27;s called scalar motion uh it&#x27;s from an article that he wrote in 2014 and Dr pet died back in 2020 um okay so we&#x27;re going to start right here anyone who has explored the realm of science that lies beyond what is taught in the classroom will undoubtedly run across the term scaler without any consistency of application scalar waves scalar energy scalar motion scaler this scaler that it appears the term is popular to describe something that the author does not quite understand themselves so let us start with a clear definition of what the term scaler means scaler uh I think these are dictionary definitions here scaler a quantity possessing only magnitude quantity an exact or specific amount of measure magnitude greatness of size or extent from the definitions a scaler is simply the specific amount of greatness sounds nebulous but it is fairly precise and a good definition of the word scaler first consider the word amount that is used in the definition of quantity it comes from the old trading days where people would barter one exact or specific amount of measure for another I&#x27;ll trade you this sack of sugar for two B two bags of flour amounts were the counting numbers there are three attributes of the counting numbers that make them unique there is no zero suppose I came up to you and said I&#x27;ll trade you nothing for your new rollsroyce does this sound like a good deal if you are the owner uh if so please contact the author ASAP if not then you understand why zero is not included in the counting numbers since they are based on in measures and measures are used in trade you can only trade what you have and if you do not have any of it then it cannot be used in trade two there are no fractional parts I&#x27;ll trade you two and a half necklaces for 3/4 of your mule possible but pointless and three there are no negative amounts with counting numbers there must be something to count and there is no such thing as having minus four dishes on the Shelf now that the idea of quantity is understood to be the whole or counting numbers consider the association the associated term measure quantity is not just a count but a count of something I have 10 marbles but what about magnitude the magnitude refers to the greatness in size or extent which means that it is the amount specified in the quantity of measure the six in six somethings the somethings are not included in the magnitude because it doesn&#x27;t matter what it is only how many there are and now you have the definition of scaler a quantity possessing only magnitude which is one of the nonzero non- negative non-fractional whole counting numbers without any identification of what it is a quantity of the ma the minimum scalar magnitude is therefore one and the maximum is unlimited but not infinite in nature all magnitudes are finite values some people may say that zero and negative amounts are valid but they are not part of the counting number system they are essentially promises if the computer at Cars R Us says that they have minus two break pads in stock for you are you going to walk home with anything a promise won&#x27;t stop your car until you have them them for all practical practical purposes promises don&#x27;t exist and cannot be counted as an item up for trade since we will be dealing totally with the natural systems of reference in the reciprocal system we have to stick to what is real not promises created by the inventive mind of man they don&#x27;t exist in nature can you have minus one ocean okay now this section is called scalar ratio orientation and cross R cross ratio when two scalers are brought into relationship with each other a ratio is the result ratio definition the relation between two similar magnitudes with respect to the number of times the first contains the second as can be seen in the definition of the ratio the ratio adds the concept of proportion to the concept of magnitude this gives rise to three possibilities for the proportions of the ratio one magnitude is either equal greater or less than the other this introduces the concept of a scalar orientation orientation definition to adjust with relation to or bring into Rel relation to surroundings circumstances facts Etc the three possible scalar orientations for the ratio of scalar magnitudes A and B uh which as a colon B uh which is usually the the ter uh the no the notation for uh the ratio of a to b a colon B are a equals B A is greater than b and a is less than b so those are the three possible orientations scalar orientation equal greater than or less than these relations shall be referred to as scalar orientation so he calls them low orientation unit orientation and high orientation depending on whether they&#x27;re greater than or less than one or equal to one uh let&#x27;s see where we&#x27;re at here um yeah there&#x27;s a ways to go here uh we will I think we&#x27;re going to stop it right here and um resume tomorrow uh after uh you know introducing this concept of scalar orientation we&#x27;ll move on to the rest of this article on scalar motion tomorrow so thanks for tuning in today and have a great day</p>
