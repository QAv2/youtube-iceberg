            <p>THE REGION. YOU OF INSIGHT.  &gt;&gt; SO IS POSSIBLE THAT LANDS  HAVE BEEN LIVING IN OUR OCEANS  THIS WHOLE TIME? I NEVER  THOUGHT WILL BE POSSIBLE BE  READING THAT LINE ON NATIONAL  TELEVISION. BUT HERE I AM.  JOINING US NOW IS RETIRED U.S.</p>
<p> NAVY REAR ADMIRAL TIM  GALLAUDET. HIS NEW BOOK  HOLDING FAST IN THE HEAVY SEAS  IS OUT NEXT. SPRING. ADMIRAL,  GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON. SO YOU  SAY, YOU KNOW, THE EXACT OCEAN  CANYON, WE SHOULD BE  SEARCHING.</p>
<p> &gt;&gt; FOR UNDERWATER UFO&#x27;S, WHERE  IS IT? WHY ARE YOU SO SURE  ABOUT ABOUT IT?  &gt;&gt; GOOD TO BE WITH YOU,  ELIZABETH. I WOULDN&#x27;T QUITE  SAY I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY  ARE. WHAT I DID IS SUPPORT THE  ROSCOE SO THAT WEEKEND WHERE  HE WE WENT OUT ON EXPLORATION  TO POSSIBLY IDENTIFY WHERE  THESE ARE CURRENT. BUT WE DO  KNOW IS THAT THEY THE U.S.  NAVY IS OBSERVED THESE  PHENOMENA GOING, YOU KNOW, THE  OCEAN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.</p>
<p> REPEATED TIMES. AND SO THERE  ARE AREAS WHERE THAT MIGHT BE  POSSIBLE. AND WE WENT AND  INVESTIGATED ONE SUCH AREA  OFFERED BE UNDERSEA CANYON. WE  HAVE NO EVIDENCE YET. BUT WE  DO KNOW FROM NAVY VIDEO AND  AND SAILOR REPORTS TO ME  PERSONALLY, WHISTLEBLOWERS  THESE THESE PHENOMENA ARE  BEING OBSERVED COMING IN OUT  OF OCEAN.</p>
<p>ALSO, THEY&#x27;RE  CALIFORNIA AND OTHER AREAS OF  THE WORLD OCEAN. AND TO BE  CLEAR, THEY&#x27;RE NOT JUST  OBSERVE GOING IN AND OUT OF  THE WATER THERE OBSERVED  MOVING THROUGH THE WATER AT  SPEEDS THAT HEARD OF AND  IMPOSSIBLE, ACCORDING TO  EVERYTHING WE CAN DO. AND WE  KNOW SCIENTIFICALLY.  &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WELL, I WOULD SAY  THERE&#x27;S CALL MASS OF DATA, BUT  I HAD SOME MARINE OFFICERS AND  FORMER ACOUSTIC INTELLIGENCE  SPECIALIST COME TO ME.  &gt;&gt; DESCRIBE TO ME INSTANCES OF  OBJECTS THEY&#x27;VE BEEN ABLE TO  DETECT ON SONAR WITH MOST  BEHAVIORS TRAVELING FASTER  THAN ART.</p>
<p>WHAT WHAT ARE SOME  MARINES CAN DO AND EVEN OUR  OUR WEAPONS CAN DO SO JUST TO  REPEAT THOSE. AND THEN I&#x27;VE  ALSO HAD SAILORS COME TO ME  DESCRIBE TO ME FORMER SAY ARMY  AND THE NAVY THAT HAVE SEEN  OBJECTS GO IN AND OUT OF  OCEAN. SO AND BY THE WAY,  OTHERS HAVE REPORTED FOR  ELIZONDO&#x27;S HAS PUBLISHED A  BOOK ABOUT CALL AND DESCRIBES  SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE  OVERHEAD VIDEO BEING USING  NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ASSETS  HAVE SEEN UNDERWATERR OBJECTS MOVING AT HIGH RATES BELOW THE  OCEAN&#x27;S SURFACE. SO WHAT WHAT  IS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COAST  OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN NEAR  CALIFORNIA?  &gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK WHY ARE WE  SEEING MORE  &gt;&gt; INCIDENTS THERE THAN WE ARE  AND OTHER PLACES.  &gt;&gt; I DON&#x27;T KNOW.</p>
<p>THAT&#x27;S WHY WE  WANT TO RESEARCH THIS NOT  CALLED FOR THIS TO BE A  NATIONAL RESEARCH PRIORITY  BECAUSE CAN EXPLAIN WHAT  THEY&#x27;RE DOING WHILE THEY&#x27;RE  DOING IT, THEIR INTENT, THEIR  NATURE WHERE THEY IT&#x27;S RIGHT  NOW. I DON&#x27;T KNOW. AND THE  RENT AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT  RELEASING WHAT IT KNOWS. AND  SO THAT&#x27;S THAT&#x27;S WHAT CALLED  FOR. AND THE FOLKS FORMER  NATIONAL SECURITY PERSONNEL  AND FILM, THE AGE DISCLOSURE  OF ALL CALLED FOR.</p>
<p> &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, PEOPLE MIGHT  LAUGH WHEN THEY HEAR THAT AT  ALIENS ARE AND SPACESHIPS  COULD BE HIDING IN OUR OCEANS.  BUT  &gt;&gt; THE REALITY IS WE DON&#x27;T  KNOW A LOT ABOUT OUR OWN  OCEANS. WE&#x27;VE ONLY EXPLORED  27% OF EARTH&#x27;S OCEANS. WE KNOW  MORE ABOUT THE MOON AND MARS.  THE SERVICE OF THE MOON AND  MARS.</p>
<p>THEN WE DO ABOUT OUR OWN  NOTIONS. IF SOMEONE OR  SOMETHING WANTED TO HIDE,  THERE&#x27;S NO MORE PERFECT PLACE.  &gt;&gt; BUT YOU&#x27;VE DONE YOUR  HOMEWORK, ELIZABETH, BECAUSE  THAT&#x27;S EXACTLY RIGHT. LEGALLY  MAP TO SEE THAT INTO THE OCEAN  FLOOR TO ABOUT 25% OF ITS  TOTAL. WE&#x27;VE NOT EVEN EXPLORED  10% OF THE OCEAN VOLUME.</p>
<p>AND  YES, WE KNOW THE SURFACE OF  MARS AND THE MOON TO HAVE  BETTER RESOLUTION THAN WE DO  THE OCEAN FLOOR. SO IF THERE  WERE EXTRA TRUST, YOU VISIT  HERS. AND DID NOT WANT TO  WHERE THE HOT NOW I WILL NOT  BE CLAIMING A DUST WITH THESE  SOURCE OF THESE PHENOMENA  AGAIN, WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE YET  TURN WE HAVE REPORTS OF IT,  BUT I LIKE DAVID RUSSIA,  EXAMPLE, THE UMP WHISTLEBLOWER  TESTIFIED FOR CONGRESS ABOUT  THIS. RIGHT NOW NOT SEEING THE  EVIDENCE. SO THAT&#x27;S WHAT WE&#x27;RE  SEARCHING FOR.</p>
