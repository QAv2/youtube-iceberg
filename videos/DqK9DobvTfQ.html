            <p>like David grush for example you know his very his testimony came off it&#x27;s very carefully rehearsed which yeah there he is have visual aids um which you know neither here nor there his resume is impeccable I think he&#x27;s probably who he says he is but if he is truly under an NDA and has information that they don&#x27;t want out he wouldn&#x27;t be talking it would be a game over for him so I feel like it&#x27;s almost sanctioned in a this is purely my intuition I&#x27;m just speculating here</p>
