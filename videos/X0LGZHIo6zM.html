            <p>IT STARTED WITH A SEARCH ON-LINE TO HELP MICK MARKE THE PERFECTPY PICTURE. A TOUCHUP HERE, A TOUCHUP. s THAT IS WHAT THIS WOMAN WANTED TO DO WITH A PICTURE OF HER KID. SHE WENT ON-LINE AND LEARNED THE HARD WAY. JUST BECAUSE IT IS BEING SOLD DOES NOT MEAN IT IS LEGIT.</p>
<p>I WANTED TO EERASE THE PEANUT BUTTER FROM THEIR FACE AND NICER LOOKING PICTURES. SO THIS MOTHER OF WHO LOVES TO TAKE PICTURE DECIDED TO LOOK ON-LINE FOR THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM PHOTO SHOP.

THERE ARE A LOT OF THIEVES OUT THERE, INVESTIGATORS SAY HE IS LINKED TO CAUSING MORE THAN $300,000 IN DAMAGES FOR PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT SOFTWARE FROM HIM.</p>
