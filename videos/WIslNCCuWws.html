            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hey guys it&#x27;s Justin with jdc products and um today I want to talk to you guys about a couple things that&#x27;s saddened me hurt me upset me disappointed me I guess pissed me off what else is new when you&#x27;re little old garage engineer doing uh Research into this work um those of you who know me I back in January of 2014 Neil Ward and myself U open sourced the concept known as the hcat uh you can go to H cat.me uh from Sterling Allen he did a compilation of this I&#x27;ve went over this several times in my video essentially you&#x27;re just shooting H gas inside of a automobile catalytic converter and gaining a lot of heat out of it uh lots of things you can do with this I mean the possibilities are uh endless and untapped but you know Neil Warden and myself and some of the other guys on YouTube you know we&#x27;re not much for calorimetry test and things like that we we we just we open source this to give it to the people have them do something with it um thus far nobody&#x27;s really did anything with it um I&#x27;m picking back up on that now and and trying to get some things done but some things have happened uh over the course of the past you know month or so that that&#x27;s really caught my attention and uh floored me upset me and and I I want to expose this and show these people or show you guys who these people really are um they&#x27;re not our friends I don&#x27;t think any of the really the reporting websites on alternative energy on the website the two main ones that I go to are are uh really for the people on this I mean this technology could we could have had this stuff decades ago I can prove it and um some of these people within these uh run these websites want to tell me that um nobody&#x27;s lying to anybody that everybody&#x27;s being truthful but I&#x27;m just gonna point out a few things and just show you guys that you know a bunch of filthy liars and I&#x27;m calling them out I&#x27;m sick and tired of it this is ridiculous you know all right we&#x27;re going to start off with uh basically this hcat once I released it nobody want to listen to me and uh maybe a month or so later I don&#x27;t know how long it goes it might be in the dates up here but uh e-catworld decom Frank aklan runs this website uh he interviewed me basically you can go back and look at the um articles he keeps up interviewed me and so on and so forth and this was a little after the time that uh industrial heat and Andrea Rossy set up in Raleigh North Carolina here supposedly is what they said Raleigh North Carolina here and uh we&#x27;re working on this ecap um Andrea Rossi e uh e catalyzer uh technology it&#x27;s supposed to be a form of what we would call lenr L energy nuclear reactions but um Frank aan interviewed me and and caused a little bit of a stir within the the online you know public community so he decided that they would set up a ecap world HHO experiment crowdfunding goal um proposal and the goal was achieved now as far as how the do actual dollar amount they received I I couldn&#x27;t tell you they said that they were trying to raise $500 by April but probably they got much more than that if you want me to be honest and uh essentially they were just this guy Allan Smith from El frog Labs over in the UK or leap Ford laboratory it don&#x27;t matter what it is and ain&#x27;t nothing to write home about I can tell you that but uh this guy was supposed to do this uh calorimetry task force he was going to say he was going to build himself a h system actually he did Neil Ward actually sent him uh call substrate for free uh I sent this stuff to him to to run tests with we got a couple updates from this guy it was supposed to be all about the people here doing calar test shooting out numbers to us I wanted lat last reports and that came out from this guy is back in May June something like that supposed to be out months and months ago apparently he builds this electrolyzer system quite honestly the guy had no business doing this calorimetry test you know he he might work in a laboratory or what have you but at the end of the day apparently he had no flashback protection no safety protection in his system at all and apparently what had happened was he had flashback and it blew his system up I guess scared the be Jesus out of him and he had to rebuild his simple very simple this thing could be rebuilt in a matter of an hour honestly and truly and apparently because he had that uh big bag flash big bad flashback issue and some from what Frank told me a little while ago a week or so ago I don&#x27;t know how long long ago it was had some family issues couldn&#x27;t get back nobody all these months pass and people kept asking these guys Frank I like where are the calorimetry numbers what&#x27;s going on where where&#x27;s the numbers at we paid for it you know this crowdfunding thing was paid for by followers of ecat world you know they paid for this to be done was never done Allen would never even respond to my emails he won&#x27;t respond to them now wouldn&#x27;t respond to them then you know what&#x27;s going on multiple comments on uh ecat worlds o over the months about from other people other uh in the public s asking where are these calim numbers you know Neil Ward and myself were talking in our uh forum and he he was upset that you know he sent this guy substrate on his own dime didn&#x27;t even ask Allan to pay for it and the least he could do is just provide numbers back well they they never did now I&#x27;ve got really working with the hcat heater technology a little bit I I kind of understand why because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s actually a very valuable um piece of technology even without the lenr to it it can very easily be uh adapted over to um heating technology you know clean very efficient even uh cop numbers greater than one uh even without alen R being applied what any rate I didn&#x27;t really think nothing about it it kind of made me mad anyway that the people of the ecat world were willing to give their money to you know some dude that said he had a laboratory and he was some scientist or what have you when Neil Ward and myself were the ones that put this out you know neither one of us got a dime of donations from anybody you know what else is new but you know it&#x27;s neither here nor there we I put it out it was my decision to put the thing out anyway just to give people something to to go on uh now it looks like it seems like everybody&#x27;s taking this technology behind the curtain you know stab Neil Ward and myself in the back and also the public figures that were looking at it did stabbed Us in the back um but again what else is new and you&#x27;re working with this technology but you know I was under the impression that uh Frank atlan over here ecat world and all the followers and everybody were just good good people I know that ain&#x27;t the case at all you&#x27;re gonna find out that most of these people that are reporting on this stuff are uh slick and slimy and sleev balls say the least but at any rate um let&#x27;s see what we got here I got a lot of stuff to go over it&#x27;s probably a Chop video here but uh as you all you know that the uh Anga Rossi ecat third party report release debacle that&#x27;s going on that has been going on where essentially apparently uh some third party was doing testing on these uh on Andrea rossy&#x27;s ecat technology uh e cat um Ang Rossi the ecat technology and Industrial heat supposed to be over in Raleigh North Carolina just a little while little ways away now they don&#x27;t say too much out in the public sector U I&#x27;m getting the impression that I I had thought at the beginning of all this that they were setting up over in Raleigh North Carolina I mean this this is you know W Brothers country this is over 100 years ago this is where you know man first took flight you know or or at least this is where a couple of uh redneck I wouldn&#x27;t say redneck but I say rough neck you know garage Engineers over here they were very intelligent Orville Wilbur Wright over in Kitty H halt North Carolina you know I built this plane out you know this uh plane out of out of backyard junkyard fars wood scraps and just you know they they flew this thing for just I don&#x27;t know 30 seconds a minute wasn&#x27;t very long and you know other people around the world working with the same technology at the same time but being that it happened here it was just it it gave people uh uh a belief U affirmation you know it&#x27;s like seeing is believing and it somehow had to happen here uh because this is you know at that particular time this would have been where the you know the poor the low grade you know people were at and you know when those people start to catch on that&#x27;s when the rest of the world catches on and some of the the richest parts of the world were working with this technology too and maybe even further than the right Brothers but nobody believed and nobody cared till the right Brothers started flying it and everybody started talking about it and it just took off from there um this this area of North Carolina has been very um fortunate to to have that that type of History base and I just thought you know uh Andrea Rossy and duster heat were going to you know lead the way in in that type of Revolution again and I just I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on right now it just don&#x27;t seem that that that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s playing out uh God I was excited about this stuff really I&#x27;ve been really excited about all this over the past few years and you know I&#x27;ve been written and raving about all kinds of different things but now that I&#x27;m finding out that even the online institutions and public sector of this are all lying to us too it&#x27;s like you know who the hell do you believe anymore you know who who who who is who is for mankind who is for the better of mankind who who is for the People by the people I I don&#x27;t understand who who do I believe anymore but any rate they put out this uh third party report and again the public sector drools all over this and look at this reactor man I mean look like a bone it&#x27;s like throw these people here a bone would you look at how this is and then on our hcat form we had a guy named marrow building little tube reactors out of the the Catalyst of these uh hcat technology basically better than this getting great numbers and I mean nobody gave a damn nobody cared I have a third party report from Andrea Russ come out with a a damn little bone tube reactor sitting here Ju Just sitting on the damn table here just getting hot not doing nothing now this damn research has been going on for decades and I can prove it you know by million and billion and even trillion dollar Research Laboratories and Military sector and defense contractors and the corporations they&#x27;ve been doing this research for decades and you mean to tell me this as good as it gets right here you can&#x27;t do nothing with it can&#x27;t heat no room can&#x27;t heat no house this is what we get this is what we&#x27;re giving the scraps the damn bones this is what they give the public and what&#x27;s so damn sad is nobody believed any of this stuff until this damn report came out with some numbers written on a piece of paper they didn&#x27;t want to start drooling all over it everybody went just berserk over this this stuff is getting reported in and some of the mainstream news like you know cold fusion finally here is real you know blah blah blah blah and I&#x27;m looking I&#x27;m laughing at this because I&#x27;m like what in the hell did they give us this has been the whole the whole thing all time I&#x27;ve been in this research all the research reports I pulled none of them none of these these experiments are doing anything but sitting on a table getting hot doing nothing and I&#x27;m like ain&#x27;t no damn way you&#x27;ve been working on this stuff all these years and some of these places have invested billions and trillions of dollars into this research possibly most likely they&#x27;ve stolen it from us and you mean tell me that uh this as good as it gets no that&#x27;s not happening for me I don&#x27;t believe that one bit and I got a bunch of data and research reports even proved that and I&#x27;m going to show you here a couple things you should know just look at and pay attention to and ask yourself you know is this as good as it gets and is as good as Andrea Rossy has got it well I think not now to report everybody&#x27;s been it&#x27;s the same thing NE me and Neil were talking about even if me and Neil put out CI numbers on the hcat ain&#x27;t nobody going to believe it even if they were legit numbers everybody&#x27;s going to just argue over the numbers they don&#x27;t care well me and Neil said until we put our actual heater got a onoff switch thermostat on it and average Jan go turn it on say I want it at 85 90° and it&#x27;ll turn off when it gets above that nobody&#x27;s going to use it nobody cares about the calorimetry numbers that are sitting in their damn bed at night freezing cold and that&#x27;s what I told Sterling Island just a couple days ago we don&#x27;t care about the damn numbers just put technology out that works that heats somebody&#x27;s home quit doing this type of crap it it is sickening to me that this is all you&#x27;re giving the public sector this damn bone throw these people a bone give me a break and this is uh the freear version so we&#x27;re about at 15 minutes so I&#x27;m going to stop it and then we&#x27;re going to do another one and uh see where things go with that maybe I can get through this whole video for 30 minutes I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m pretty sick of uh how this is all playing out and you going to see a couple other things is going to make me even sicker and I&#x27;m just tired of it and the public sector needs to look at this and even the people that are um doing this to the other people needs to look at this figure out what your damn priorities are are now as I was saying basically when this report came out just a little while ago uh was the eth of this month I guess anyway the public went crazy over this you know they finally got some numbers that said that it was a little bit of EXs heat it was like cop of three three times over Unity or something wasn&#x27;t much I mean these things are known to go you know way above that and I can assure you the technology is way more advanced than this and they&#x27;ve put it in useful product line but at any rate as usual the public slobbers all over it and you know at first I did and then I started to realize that it was all a gimmick it was just laughable it was crazy and the new thing in this was they were adding some sort of catalyst inside of the the the nickel powder like a lithium type of catalyst uh if you use like lithium carbonate in your electrolyzer you might produce some strange results of tritium and uh production in theerum in there and and I got all kinds of research reports to show that I&#x27;ve been studying this stuff for you know quite a few years and it goes back a long time now after this report was done there was a bunch of arguments over the damn numbers as usual oh this number ain&#x27;t right this number ain&#x27;t right this is good for validation and and everybody was putting their stamp of approv approval on it and all the all the propaganda and crap going on and it just hilarious to me you know one of them being well we&#x27;re going to come back to that that right there has got me on fire right now too but we&#x27;re gonna get back to that but one of them being Michael M Mike mccovery of Sri Laboratories he reviews the ecat report and well well well let&#x27;s see here where where is this here he you know Frank reports but Frank uh Mike also seems to give the report an overall passing grade right like hey you know Mike mccy is just he&#x27;s top-notch and you know this guy&#x27;s well known in the industry to be a he&#x27;s a line SLE ball too if you want me to be honest I tried to tell Sterling Allen the other day I was writing to him in in Skype you know messing him back and forth I was like you mean to tell me all these people you follow and report on all these high ups and everything corporate Laboratories are not lying to you telling you that you know they&#x27;re just a year or five years away from something when they&#x27;ve been working on this crap for decades he want me to give him data well Mike mccrew got crap on online right now PDS a damn uh uh cold fusion lenr reactors you know basically a little tiny electrolyzers giving he&#x27;s using heavy water and crap like that in him and getting overunity numbers and this was a long time ago when he was doing this stuff and if you go to the D on Wikipedia page it tells you right here from 1989 to 2002 he researched cold fusion at SRI International you know and this I I believe uh they made a comment on the hcap back in uh January or so and um Sterling Allen asked something about it and basically this SLE ball you know somebody over there I can&#x27;t remember I have to find the quote says something like uh they thought that the uh technology was interesting it was a cool concept and they may even dabble in it behind the curtain but if we ain&#x27;t paying these guys they a they ain&#x27;t giving us no no numbers they ain&#x27;t giving us no access to their equipment basically saying you know pay up or you public figures you peasants ain&#x27;t getting nothing that&#x27;s usually how it is isn&#x27;t it These Guys these guys have been researching this stuff SRI Laboratories over there in California with the rest of the dag on what I call Nazis they&#x27;ve had this hydr and technology these fusion and cold fusion Technologies hot Fusion too they&#x27;ve had this stuff for decades You Know Jack Nicholson uh me and Neils been talking about this for a long time too Jack Nicholson was driving a hydrogen car back in the 70s he&#x27;s up there slimy sleev ball Jack Nicholson doing a a TV report on that and great engineering on it just a pure hydrogen car shooting damn water vapor out the tailpipe where you wouldn&#x27;t even need a CET converter this was back in the 70s you know back it just gets on my nerves people try to tell me that this stuff hadn&#x27;t been out for this long long give me a break they&#x27;ve been developing and researching and perfecting this technology probably going back to somewhere in like 1900s all the way in 1920s but anyway uh let&#x27;s see what else we got here oh they had all the uh the major uh players come out too he had brillian which is working over here in Sri Laboratories over in California too and these guys are American company American lenr Research uh company that has this Grand slam technology that apparently they&#x27;re going to release in China first yeah right ain&#x27;t 40 people at all in this country let&#x27;s see here uh after this stuff came out uh as far as inury Rossy stuff came out I basically uh tore uh Allen Smith uh Frank aklan and and Sterling Allen a new one on this I was pissed off about you know the H cat calar image stuff not not not getting back to us about any of it you know not following up with us not not answering anybody&#x27;s questions nothing not because I was so mad looking at this stupid report one of the guys in our research form called that AI uh Rossy noodle call it the wet Andrea Rossy spaghetti noodles is what I called it it was a damn joke and these people couldn&#x27;t even do it they couldn&#x27;t even give us no uh research supports anyway Frank atlin done set up this energy 2.0 Society where he&#x27;s he&#x27;s a board member of it it&#x27;s a joke if you go watch the video bunch of old men up there talking about how great this is going to be and it seems like the uh the actual meeting that they had was nothing more than water down introductory level you know data on this stuff where it wasn&#x27;t even data just telling you about what alen R reactor could or may be you know nothing real grand slam it was I think Frank an is trying to cash in on this stuff too to be honest but uh matter of fact let&#x27;s go to another one right here this these guys right here where is their website Quantum heat.or Martin flesh Memorial project less light the new Fire underneath your pocketbooks is what these guys are all about these guys are supposed to be publicly sponsored right by the people I&#x27;m not sure how much money they&#x27;ve raised quite a bit on I&#x27;m sure right and uh these guys would not take the hcat calorimetry experiment test they were begged to do it by myself and by a few other people there&#x27;s a guy named Bob Greener from the UK as well he uh goes up there and Report or he comments on ecat world a lot and I was shooting back and forth to him and he would not take the dag on test the public was asking them to do it they&#x27;re publicly funded he wouldn&#x27;t do it right I realize why now but I was I even offered to send the guy the catalytic converter and the electrolyzer all they had to do was just put some data out would not do it right well after all this uh debacle with the the dag on um ecat report came out just a little while ago now all of a sudden uh Martin flet Memorial projects they&#x27;re on a mission to replicate this little tiny little bone reactor right let&#x27;s go to that where&#x27;s that at Mike mccovery all these guys are tools if you want my opinion oh yeah just look at this they they right now they&#x27;re uh they Martin fleser Moore pro project seeks help with bill of materials for the ecat replication they&#x27;re trying to dip in the Public&#x27;s pockets again and get some more money out of them they ain&#x27;t got enough already all their fancy tools crap over over there yeah lying to the people again put this out on October 23rd I guess today want some damn money from the people again hey we need some money we need to we need to replicate this uh fine piece of uh engineering that sitting on the damn table here looking like a wet noodle doing nothing you know how much money they want let me show you let me show you me go over here uh is this it look at this look at these look at these dollar mounts right here to uh replicate a reactor that probably cost all of might cost 50 bucks to build they want thousands of dollars from the public they want you to dip out of your pocket thousands of dollars right to go and build this damn little tiny reactor that ain&#x27;t GNA do a damn thing for a damn soul but give them some numbers I told uh sterling sterling asked me I sent him a picture I&#x27;m going to show it to you in a little bit a little while ago some stuff I&#x27;m working on he asked me what&#x27;s the numbers on this is overunity blah blah blah blah blah I said I&#x27;m done giving the Thirsty thieves numbers out of my notebook numbers don&#x27;t mean a damn thing to the soul it&#x27;s laying in the bed freezing at night I&#x27;m one of them damn Souls right I&#x27;ve been working on this stuff for years can&#x27;t get no help from nobody no love from nobody pisses me off I could run CES around you guys giv the opportunity and the damn funding that you keep stealing from the gullible people but I&#x27;m exposing you guys one by one filthy blind thieves all right oh and get this now all of a sudden uh Loy Martin right they coming out now talking about compact Fusion closer than you think hot Fusion right I think they changed the damn number amount up here it said more than 50 years ago they had a uh I have to find it it&#x27;s got to be uh somewhere but they had a paragraph up here that was saying now it should be no surprise that we&#x27;ve been working on this for over 60 years yeah more like a hundred years they&#x27;ve been working on this damn stuff I I mean this stuff goes back a long time they working on this stuff and ain&#x27;t got nowhere with it at least that&#x27;s what they tell us to public but they&#x27;ve been using this crap they got this stuff perfected already so we ridiculous Frank atlin reported on this said it would be 10 years said it was what they said you a little while ago they um after we started putting stuff on our form these guys come out and say hey it&#x27;s going to be five years now well next week going to be two years huh it&#x27;s going to be two years like e Martin is that what it&#x27;s going to be where you at Nasa I know you in on this too right all you slimy sleev balls well what else am I showing up here all of this and you know we got people on our Forum that were replicating this damn little bone of a reactor tube here nobody cared about us didn&#x27;t throw us a damn party and say that we were changing the world or Frank Allen was a a God didn&#x27;t say nothing to us and this damn thing ain&#x27;t even close to being engineer to anything that you can use here it is winter again gonna be cold as hell I&#x27;m not going to be these these I&#x27;m not going to cuss that bad but these a-holes ain&#x27;t GNA be cold either you the people watching this video going to be cold right because these corporate pigs keep lying to you telling you that this is years away five years 10 years when they&#x27;ve had it perfected working on it for decades I can spend hours going over research reports with you I&#x27;m not going to you want the learn you do put the time in like I have learn what it&#x27;s about I got pissed about all this right so I sent Andrea Rossy email I seent industrial heat Frank Sterling and that dag on stupid scientist over there getting didn&#x27;t have flashback safety material at least that&#x27;s probably the LIE he said all of a sudden I&#x27;m finding like Nexus magazine from July finding reports in there talking about H catalytic heating is going to be revolutionary you know where&#x27;d you get that idea from then had the Germans coming out talking about we were doing it way before Justin church was well damn you should have came out and told me about it too I&#x27;ve been searching for this stuff for years all right ly Martin you make me sick now all of a sudden Frank&#x27;s reporting on uh locky Martin now cuz he&#x27;s in bed with these corporate I&#x27;m gonna call them what they are [ __ ] now all of a sudden there&#x27;s this stupid debacle Andrea rossy&#x27;s ecap versus the locky Martin compact Fusion reactor like it&#x27;s a damn race we messing with people&#x27;s lives don&#x27;t you realize that huh I guess you don&#x27;t restarting the atomic age how about restarting my damn bedroom when it&#x27;s 30 below how about that for the People by the people I started my hcat form and I got some fuel right now we got a team going we GNA bust your ass changing the world takes only one individual with a dream and you look at that people that&#x27;s what&#x27;s coming right now here in a little bit it&#x27;s going to get even more advanced than that if you sons of [ __ ] don&#x27;t start putting products on the damn market for the people I&#x27;m gonna do it and I&#x27;m gonna expose every one of you you lying sack of crap I&#x27;m tired of it we&#x27;re all tired of it everybody in this damn Forum the AAP forum is tired of it everybody on YouTube&#x27;s tired of it the people that are following these [ __ ] out here on the ecap world and even Sterling Allen at P PES sn.com they ain&#x27;t for the people buy the people they lying to you bought and paid for waiting to cash in on your stupidity you give these sons of [ __ ] some money and see what it gets you the same [ __ ] it&#x27;s been getting you all these years have a nice nice day</p>
