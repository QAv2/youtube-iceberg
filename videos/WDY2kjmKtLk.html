            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald abuse ads founder and chair of the International Society of unified science and president trans power corporation a commercial and custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company I work as a theoretical physicist and as a systems and mechanical engineer today&#x27;s screencast as with most of my screencast will be about reciprocal system specifically the micro cosmos database graphing facility you can see here in the left panel the main menu for the micro cosmos database and here on the right panel you can see the macro cosmos database I&#x27;ve already covered many I&#x27;ve already covered all of these layouts in previous screencasts so be sure to watch those videos and I&#x27;ve covered all of these layouts and you can Michael cosmos database already so let&#x27;s just go right to the graphs and we&#x27;ll stick with iron take a look at water later okay let&#x27;s go through the fields on this screen so here&#x27;s the element compound mix you can choose any element of compound and makes you want and then all the stuff comes up the iron the description here form number one and then we have solid of fluid descriptions here so how many molecular weight so all this comes up from the previous layouts so you can see for yourself melting temperature in Kelvin thermal factors and compressibility factors right here if there if this were a fluid and we&#x27;ll look at water in the moment you would see Tomic molecular weight the critical temperature in Kelvin and critical pressure in atmospheres okay so the graph title is here this this is our molecular density and you gotta choose solid liquid vapor or gas okay so those are the choices here so just click there see this is a solid so you choose that and then the abscissa is going to be the temperature in Kelvin or the pressure in atmospheres times 10 to the 6 with the ionization stage one disease atomic number and then here for the abscissa put in the low value which is zero in this case for 25 in this case for the high though the step value and the zero times okay and then since we&#x27;re doing this by temperature then you gotta fix the pressure so pressure atmospheres time sin 9 so this is just one atmosphere okay point zero zero zero zero zero one one times ten to the minus six is times 10 to the 6 will be one atmosphere okay and as for temperature graph so that&#x27;s what you would normally use unless you&#x27;re doing something involving the earth pressure and temperature now if you&#x27;re doing a pressure graph thing then you have to fix the team you put that here okay now the graph data will come but the present will calculate and then you can actually save that to a file if you want type the file name here now the key thing is are the Ordnance now let&#x27;s look at the possible choices now what carnem mechanics no other theory can do any of this so here we have let&#x27;s go all the way to the top here I could get enthalpy and count from oh I&#x27;ve been on thousand Cal per gram molecular enthalpy and Cal per moment I&#x27;ll be out there bad so we have both at month at the aggregate level was station accountabilities at versus the molecular and we have aggregate I can get entropy and Cal from okay count for gram K molecular on should be account from okay children I&#x27;m kidding you know specific key see sippy cup from okay specifically CCP caliper County that&#x27;s of course constant pressure mug is specific heat CP Cal volcano in specific heat CP Cal program now we go the same thing we have for constant volume process there is a difference between just looking at a single molecule or atom versus looking at a bulk material having unit cell volume 10 to the minus 24 centimeter cubed well 3 in the cell phones into minus 24 density here like of the density that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing when we have a good internal energy tell promote that cow for exam alack an internal engine fell from ball in California I&#x27;ll get cohesive enters in kilojoules per mole molecular cohesive energy curable criminal I&#x27;m get ratio volume to the baseline is your temperature and pressure and they can racial volume - that&#x27;s your temperature pressure area coefficient of I&#x27;m expansion rate I&#x27;m standing up to the minus 6 and then get over the molecular coefficient expansion that&#x27;s him he just did this to me have you get thermo power nuvosport oh I do for my power molecular electrical resistivity I&#x27;m centimeters I&#x27;m saying six thermo resistivity and Kelvin centimeter for watch molecular electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity let&#x27;s keep going down the list again it won&#x27;t find any of these in any other theory of the universe just resistivity our getting Reince number thermoelectric figure of Merit so look at this we still have healthier coefficient novels ocular Peltier coefficient was I was Thompson having constant coefficient and we like your Thomson coefficient but new folks individual ionization energies theoretical best fit specific heat CP specific a different units and the ones above which you will promote okay and the enthalpy job from all so these are just all the job promos and then we come down to here in time distance and angstroms compressibility amateurs times ten to the sixth or bulk modulus mr Thomson in the six modulus elasticity modulus elasticity gene that&#x27;s average index of refraction index infection AJ HB HC can be different in the cell the index of factions I&#x27;m different and then finally we have Sam speed longitudinal rod m/s one student bulk transverse all right so I&#x27;m gonna keep molecular density if this worked well we&#x27;ll do the fluid ones later so basically you would just click here generate the graph data it&#x27;ll take a few moments okay so the graph disappears now you can you these are the commands for the graph wooden airily you don&#x27;t have to change any of this okay if you wanted to add a regression if it&#x27;s available the regression function to the graph so the default command should so look at all the choices you have and then you click here so this is some like your density and as you would expect of us write down just like that temperature Kelvin okay now let&#x27;s look at water I&#x27;ll just do one more now this one it is gas density so this time I have the fluid from is here critical temperature critical pressure its G for gas absolutely temperature killing just like low value high value step value zero tolerance fixed P so this time this is under pressure okay because the one is there said at the end and okay this is temperature now for the ones we got a good enthalpy molecular bounty the entropy I can want to chase was the key molecular specific heat at constant pressure this was a pig my internal energy I mean you&#x27;re not going to find this in quantum mechanics it&#x27;s impossible there&#x27;s such a closed system completely utterly supersedes every other Theory coefficient of law and expansion theorem oh let&#x27;s go through sensitivities lens numbers coefficient we have the jewel cream okay for specific constant pressure [Music] we wanted to this is only for solids is for fluids so here we go from six hundred forty seven point one three here to twelve twenty seven here step value of ten and we generate the data see the temperatures first so there&#x27;s the batch so as you would expect with increasing temperature it&#x27;s almost a straight line down the gas density of steam again you can change the title style alright well we&#x27;ve covered a lot today so you can just see that the reciprocal system is now fully computational so now I&#x27;ve covered this entire month of Cosmos database I&#x27;ve already covered solve matter properties in atomic distance and Nalin specific heat energy and entropy thermal expansion compressibility electrical magnetic properties isotopes an atomic spectra i&#x27;ve also covered in previous screencasts liquid-vapor I gotta shut this month okay I&#x27;ve covered liquid-vapor gasps matter properties volume and density specific heat energy and entropy viscosity and surface tension and let&#x27;s go on thermal conductivity i&#x27;ve also covered cosmic elements and material cosmic subatomic particles and throat on properties and today would tell me class but not only do i have a micro cosmos database i have not good cosmos database and in previous screencast i&#x27;ve covered all of these astronomical properties the universe has they&#x27;ll hold galaxy clusters includes galaxies star clusters stars planets moons minor bodies maybe they gas and dust and voids if you wanted to stump two pictures and videos you click on events and I&#x27;ve covered the graphing functions of the macrocosmos database here general progression versus gravitation bass and star graphs as the properties of stars from the service to the core now this may be kind of advanced for some of you but if you want the simplest possible treatment please obtain my work the end mysterious universe it&#x27;s still imprint published decades together it&#x27;s gotten great many good reviews on Amazon it&#x27;s only $9.50 it&#x27;ll give you the basics of the theory then if you do want on the math in all the detail then please get my magnum opus existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything seven or eleven pages in the PDF file and 1711 slides in photography and file contains thousands and thousands of equations has numerous tables figures graphs everything will keep you busy for months then when you&#x27;re finished with that you&#x27;re in good shape to get these two database modules so micro cosmos database and the macro cosmos database now my theoretical physics mattered really Larson was also a theoretical economist and my main is work and you can almost also fully computation one that&#x27;s my software program called optimal economists and implementation or Sounion econo physics covers the microeconomics of individuals and businesses and business sectors and the macroeconomics of whole countries and regions completely entirely supersedes Keynesian economics just as the reciprocal system to ladies supersedes most of the modern theoretical physics alright that wraps it up for today as usual asks that you study the reciprocal system carefully and prove it for yourself and thanks for your attention</p>
