            <p>around 5pm on December 9 1965 eyewitnesses across six U.S states and even Ontario in Canada reported an incredible sight an object that rocketed across the skies creating a sonic boom and leaving a bright orange Trail like an airline contrail eventually it fell into the woods near the small town of Kecksburg within hours the area was sealed off by the military but not before locals caught a glimpse of something strange a bronze colored object about the size of a car with odd hieroglyphic markings around its base it was shaped they said like an acorn or a bell the witnesses didn&#x27;t know it at the time but it also matched the description of one of the most mysterious objects in history a mythical weapon allegedly forged by some of the most brilliant mines in Germany 20 years earlier [Music] it&#x27;s one of the strangest Tales to come out of World War II involving Nazi occultism aliens time travel Espionage and even a secret nuclear war in Antarctica taking in Nassau many of America&#x27;s biggest aerospace companies and perhaps even linked to events that are still unfolding right now so let&#x27;s rethink the evidence and ask how exactly could an elusive Nazi super weapon called de-glocker have ended up crash landing in Pennsylvania even now it&#x27;s hard to believe the technological advances that were made by German scientists and technicians during World War II from the first operational jet fighter to Rocket planes and the first cruise missiles designs like the Horton ho229 were not just years but decades ahead of their time influencing even the most advanced of today&#x27;s aircraft with the V2 rocket Germany not also pioneered ballistic missiles but became the first country to reach space and even had a viable design for a space bomber yet there&#x27;s also a lot of Nazi science that seems to come straight out of Indiana Jones vievelsberg Castle in Westphalia became the center of a bizarre cult led by Heinrich henler one of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s most loyal henchmen and leader of the notorious SS veevelsberg became the focus for Research into a bizarre range of occult and paranormal Fields the base from which he sent out raiding parties across the world to track down historical relics that he believed could possess Mystic powers that might Aid the Third Reich and yes that really did include a search for the Holy Grail not to mention the hammer of Thor and the spear that killed Jesus it may sound ludicrous but some claim it&#x27;s an example of the Nazis thinking outside the box trying anything that might give them an advantage whether natural or Supernatural there are many rumors too that the scientists mix these paranormal investigations with the cold hard science that powered their war effort to create weapons unlike anything the world had ever seen so-called vundavathan or Miracle weapons and perhaps they succeeded [Music] the object known as de-glocker or in English the Bell has been an enigma for 80 years no examples have ever been found and its very existence is uncertain in public at least it was reportedly around 10 feet tall six feet at its widest and made of a heavy metallic compound what powered it is also uncertain there are mentions of a previously unknown liquid codenamed xerium 525 perhaps one of the occult discoveries made by himless teams for unusually de-glocker appears to have been a project directly controlled by the SS an organization that was effectively himmler&#x27;s private Army it also suggested that SS operatives may have actually been in contact with aliens and that some of the incredible technical advances achieved by axis scientists were made using alien technology could de-glocker have been been an example of that Tech on the other hand one of the scientists often said to have been involved in the project was vernette Carl Heisenberg a legendary physicist who was one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics and a principal scientist in Nazi efforts to create a nuclear weapon deglocker was said to give off radiation so may have begun as a nuclear experiment that produced very unexpected results or perhaps the power source was nuclear experimental reactors such as this one were later discovered in one of the complexes where Heisenberg worked other Reports say it could have been powered by a derivative of mercury and when in operation would glow with an eerie light that has some plausibility as in the mid-20th century Mercury Arc valves were used to connect high voltage alternating current into direct current for all sorts of power into intensive applications from Ultra powerful Motors to radio and radar it&#x27;s believed that de-glocker radiated incredibly powerful electromagnetic fields and that would certainly explain the need for such high-powered equipment approaching the object when it was operating was said to result in either instant death or if exposure wasn&#x27;t as intense to a slow lingering demise it&#x27;s claimed animals and in some accounts human prisoners being used as test subjects near the device slowly decomposed while still alive and it seems to have been very unpredictable One account speaks of an incident that claimed the lives of 60 scientists the most common explanation for de-glocker&#x27;s actual purpose was as an anti-gravity or gravity control device a way of allowing a craft to seemingly defy the laws of physics and fly without wings perhaps versions of it were planned to power planes like the h0229 or even more advanced craft because now Declassified CIA documents do support the common theory that the Nazis were also working on flying sources some of the wildest accounts suggest that as well as doing all this deglocker also allowed occupants to see into the past or even travel through time Heisenberg&#x27;s theories of quantum mechanics could in principle open the door to some forms of time travel as could devices producing extreme electromagnetic or gravitational forces whether that&#x27;s actually true or not it&#x27;s easy to understand why Allied Forces would want to at least assess such radical programs especially as they&#x27;d been shocked by the advanced nature of the Weaponry that the Nazis had already deployed Way Beyond Allied capabilities of the time under code names including Operation Paperclip and the Outsource Mission the US and UK began a systematic search for these wonderwaffen and even more importantly the people who&#x27;d created them not just to secure such advanced technology for its own use but to stop potential breakthroughs from Landing in Soviet hands and high on the list of people the U.S wanted was Hans kamler unlike most of the Germans who headed west across the Atlantic kamla wasn&#x27;t an active scientist trained as an engineer he&#x27;d become a ruthlessly efficient manager who got things done whatever the cost in human life and he was also a high-ranking officer of himless ss by the war&#x27;s end he was in overall charge of all the Nazis bundavathan projects the man the Allies knew would have all the secrets and of course that would include the truth about diglocker he was also officially dead supposedly being killed around May the 9th 1945. there have always been suspicions that kamla faked his own death but shockingly recently revealed CIA files showed that the U.S probably helped him to do it as He&#x27;s listed as being an asset in U.S custody later in the year Donald W Richardson was an OSS special agent working on operation alsos he said he personally brought kamla to the U.S and supervised him until 1947 and that he was interned at a place of Maximum Security with no hope no mercy and without seeing the light of day according to Richardson kamla died for real this time in 1947 more likely Richardson was simply reassigned and told that kamla was dead so what was going on had camless struck a deal to supply Hitler&#x27;s secrets in return for a new life or was he being held against his will and forced to reveal what he knew and why was he being treated differently to other former Nazis such as Berner Von Braun the designer of the V2 rocket and soon to be designer of America&#x27;s Moon Rockets the most likely answer is in kamla&#x27;s record because he was among the worst of of the worst a devout Nazi who&#x27;d also run the Concentration Camp system once he became head of vunderwaffen operations he ordered thousands of camping mates to be moved to the underground sleigh factories that were producing the V2 rocket and me-262 fighter where they were worked to death in truly barbaric conditions though Von Braun faced awkward questions about his past nothing was ever proven against him but kamler&#x27;s hands were so covered in blood there was no way that the Americans could let it be known he was now working for them the international outcry would have been immense and of course it could also be that the things he knew were so sensitive that the U.S wanted it to look as if you really had taken them to his grave in 1945. so he had to be kept hidden and where better than a place where no one would look perhaps the same place of Maximum Security mentioned by Donald Richardson in August 1939 a German Expedition laid claim to 600 000 square kilometers of Antarctica giving it the name new schwabenland that much is established fact but many sources go much further as early as 1947 a book by a Hungarian Exile named ladislav Sabo then living in Argentina claimed a secret base had been established there called New betches Garden after the location of Hitler&#x27;s holiday home it&#x27;s known the Nazis had bases in the Arctic and though no records exist of anything similar in the southern hemisphere there were documented British and U.S military operations in the area around the end of World War II some reports state that operation taborin and operation high jump were attacks on the new Burgess Garden base one report even suggests that it was eventually destroyed by nuclear bombs but what If instead of destroying it the U.S had actually captured it and taken it over because it&#x27;s alleged that much of Germany&#x27;s work on ultra-secret weapons such as the deglocker happened right there in Antarctica perhaps kamla himself had given them the information they needed for an attack or even arranged the Takeover rather than handing over a few damaged examples of wunderwaffen he could have presented them with a whole intact and operational base full of them along with the staff who&#x27;d been working there all in return maybe for a new identity and the chance to resume his old role as the head of the program it would be a perfect layer for a monster like kamli and the perfect place to test deglocker if you want to develop flying sources wear better than a whole continent where the only Spectators are penguins interestingly there were actually nuclear explosions detected in the area after the war was this as claimed part of a test program named Operation Argus or was that just a curvy story for some secret saucer testing that went already if all of this were true though the Americans would need a way to launder the results of the work being carried out to help industry gain the benefits of the technology without anyone realizing its true Origins and surely there&#x27;s no evidence of a sudden interest in anti-gravity technology in the U.S during the 1950s you guessed it there was a very odd burst of activity based around anti-gravity devices and gravity control drives in the U.S through the 1950s and 60s to quote one report at least 14 United States universities and other research centers are hard at work cracking the gravity barrier and backing the basic research with multi-million dollar secret projects is our aircraft industry journalist AV clivair added that it wasn&#x27;t known which agency was behind it however that the effort is in progress there can be little doubt over time A Who&#x27;s Who of American aerospace companies took part in anti-gravity research Bell Boeing conveyor Douglas Grumman Hughes Martin Lockheed along with the U.S Air Force why this sudden interest could it have been just a cover for the work being carried out secretly by former Nazis locked away on an Antarctic Peninsula if so the link between the two could have been this man burkhard Heim as a student in 1943 he was known to have had meetings with none other than Werner Heisenberg the physicists rumored to have been a key part of the glocker project despite losing both hands along with most of his sight and hearing in a lab explosion he went on to publish theories for interplanetary propulsion by 1955 he was working with the Glenn L Martin company on gravity control drives the principle by which de-glocker itself was said to operate and from 1957 he was also acting as a consultant to Verna Von Braun which leads to a very intriguing question is it possible the genius behind the Apollo program might have benefited from the knowledge gained on an Antarctic base run by his former boss Hans kamler foreign ly on the face of it the idea of a secret polar base run by former Nazis creating Wonder Weapons seems ridiculous a base that&#x27;s also alleged to have worked on reverse engineering alien technology that would have seemed even more ridiculous until whistleblowers like David grush started to claim that secret parts of the deep state had been doing exactly that since before World War II so who knows perhaps a base in new schwaben land forms part of the operation grush and others are now describing nothing quite like diglocker itself has been spotted since the apparent mishap over Kecksburg but perhaps many UFOs including the weird uaps described during Congressional hearings tic tac-like objects that seemed to defy the laws of gravity are not of alien origin at all but just the latest generation of vanderwaffen all descended from that original design if Congress does force the disclosure of all the information on UAP activity as promised perhaps we&#x27;ll also learn a lot more about the secrets of diglocka and other Nazi projects too what do you think let me know in the comments check out this great video for more on time travel and to get the latest about uaps click here if you&#x27;ve
