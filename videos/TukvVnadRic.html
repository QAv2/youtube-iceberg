            <p>the jurgen experience i was doing my first documentary back in 1997 when i was just naive enough to think i can get an interview with steven spielberg we had a mutual friend involved this woman janet and she gets back to me and she&#x27;s like yeah so uh spielberg&#x27;s definitely not gonna meet with you but he knows you&#x27;re working on this ufo documentary he thinks you should look into this landing case that happened in africa at the school and i said to myself at the time and remind you know remind you guys that i was making a film on ufos and i dismissed it so quickly because i thought there&#x27;s no way that a mass landing with the sheer volume of eyewitness testimony at a school in broad daylight could happen and the whole world not know about it so i just walked away from that story for about 10 years 10 years later i&#x27;m doing an event at the national press club with with leslie kane who was part of the article in new york times it came out in 2017 and she introduced me to this guy randall nickerson and she&#x27;s like oh he&#x27;s working on this landing case in africa long story short he&#x27;s working on a film uh now i think it&#x27;s coming out next year specifically on just that case dan farah is producing it and he said i&#x27;m working on the case and and if you want to do something with me on it a small piece i could so i got back into it i licensed some of the footage that dr john mack the harvard psychiatrist that came and interviewed the school children on camera within a week of it happening he unfortunately looked the wrong way in london got run down by a car and died so i contacted the institute with the help of randall nickerson i licensed the archival footage we tracked down the witnesses today we flew them in from all different corners of the world brought them together a lot of them were standing right next to each other these they came face to face and one of the things i realized was that there were roughly a hundred kids in the playground broad daylight aerial school rule zimbabwe 1994 and they got within arms right armed some of them within arm&#x27;s length of these beans and brought these witnesses together for the first time in 20 years and a lot of them hadn&#x27;t even told their their you know significant others just because they said they were tired of having to defend this and i myself didn&#x27;t believe it when i first heard about it back in 1997 and that segment of the film is the most in my opinion is the most powerful segment very compelling you&#x27;ve got all these children saying what they saw on camera after it happened and then you see them 20 years later and then we go to africa and we meet with the headmistress she was a teacher at the time we meet with other witnesses we go to the landing site we talk to people at the school that case is absolutely and it was witnessed by lots of other people in and around the area for several days before it chose a school to land it&#x27;s so compelling because the children are all clearly they&#x27;re not actors so as they&#x27;re adults later they&#x27;re all talking about this moment and it&#x27;s like they had a religious experience together like they&#x27;re all sharing it and talking about it and you could tell it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s a deeply moving experience if if they were actors they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do such a good job because to convey the reality of that moment to them to to to to be able to have this interpretation of this event where they&#x27;re all consistent in the story and they&#x27;re all clearly still shook by this moment it&#x27;s really interesting because if you had that scene in a movie it would take like a really good actor to pull it off and they&#x27;d probably need multiple takes they&#x27;d probably want to get the best one but those kids the way they were talking about it the way they were drawing it you&#x27;re like wow it really does seem like something happened to that i i know how credible that the testimony of the children is because i i my partner rebecca she&#x27;s never had much of an interest in what i do making documentaries on ufos i do other things as well but when i was reviewing in the studio uh the archival interview of the children she just dropped off a cup of coffee and she stopped and went oh my god those children are not lying this is the most amazing thing i&#x27;ve ever seen because look i ask your audience to don&#x27;t take it from me just suspend judgment for a moment and imagine hypothetically if a ufo or several ufos landed at a school in broad daylight in rue zimbabwe africa and interacted telepathically with nearly a hundred school children not all of them had telepathic but seen the incident how significant of a story would you give that well not only that they had the same message yes but the telepathic message was that technology is a real problem yes and there&#x27;s things that people are doing with technology that are going to ruin the earth yes and they were trying to relay this to children which is very strange you know i mean maybe they just thought they were adults because they were the same size as the aliens i mean do you think they knew that they were children do you think they understood that it was a school i mean this is all speculation yeah right but no i definitely had to ask myself look during the production of the film paula harris actually turned me on to another landing case that happened in australia in 1966 at a school and this time there were roughly 300 witnesses that saw a disc land right outside a playground in australia and we went to australia and investigated that case went to the landing site talked to eyewitness testimony people that jumped the fence at the school playground and ran over to where this thing landed and then we even interviewed a guy who snapped a photograph of a disc a polaroid back in 1966 two days prior to the incident so it&#x27;s very uh probably that we have a photo we have photographic evidence we have eyewitness testimony and for the first time we&#x27;ve got testimony from a science teacher so why do these things land at schools it seems like and i&#x27;m just totally speculating here but it seems like if if i were going to do that it seems like a pretty benign environment when you have testimony from military guys that we take a fairly hostile position towards things that penetrate sensitive military installations and um you know so maybe i&#x27;m just saying maybe maybe stay safe maybe it&#x27;s safe we have to stop reacting to uh you know intrusions by ufos as a threat i mean that&#x27;s the whole thing behind this new task force and as much as i respect you know the task force my colleagues and i want to cooperate with them to the extent that we can bring information or resources to to what they do but there is more this is not should not be looked at specifically as a threat i mean with with the phenomena that we observe i mean if they wanted to blow up those f-18s i could do it okay obviously that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s all about and this idea of just labeling it all as a as a threat because it&#x27;s unknown that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a wrong idea 90 of information comes from the public comes from children comes and very very little of it is made up you know in france i mean the the data would we get you know with at the french space agency comes through channels where if people reported something that&#x27;s found to be untrue they&#x27;re going to be called by the police catch new episodes of the joe rogan experience for free only on spotify watch back catalog jre videos on spotify including
