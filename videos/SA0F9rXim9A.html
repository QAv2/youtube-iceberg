            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is for educational purposes and on this channel we take a look at Great theories of everything from the past and uh do deep dives into them delve uh into their um deepest layers and uh help you get some idea how to use them in your life to help with your Paradigm shifting your Awakening to 5D Consciousness and your formation of a holistic worldview today is our 520th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and the reciprocal system of theory was really first articulated by Larson in the 19 in 1959 uh uh when he articulated his two fundamental postulates about how he believed the universe operated and uh the first postulate is uh the main of main importance where he said that the universe is composed entirely of one component and that component is motion existing in three dimensions in discret units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so larsson&#x27;s universe is made out of motion not matter not energy but motion and motion is the relationship between space and time motion uh Spa uh uh motion is a relationship between space and time and motion is broadly applied meaning that all scientific phenomena are forms of motion and they can be expressed exclusively in terms of space and time a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator SpaceTime and motion come in three dimensions SpaceTime and motion come in discrete units only and uh if you&#x27;d like any more more uh details about um Larson&#x27;s postulates and the derivation of this theories uh along with this theoretical Universe you want to watch one of my first 474 videos on this subject where I go into it a little bit more deeply but uh for now we&#x27;re going to try to turn some pages of his book called basic properties of matter which is the result uh came out in 1987 just 3 years before he died and um it is um the result of comparing his theoretical Universe which is what he derived from his postulates what his Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and comparing that theoretical Universe with the measured empirical Universe of modern science um which they have compiled in uh their scientific tables so basic properties of matter has to do with chemistry and Larson arrives at equations for many of the basic properties of matter like the melting point and then he Compares his results with the scientific tables we&#x27;re actually about to start the final chapter of this book chapter 27 mass and energy and um again if you uh I&#x27;m going to basically assume that you have a working knowledge of LaRon system here or at least that you are an Intrepid Explorer into the unknown and um if you&#x27;d like to get um more background go to one of my first 474 videos on the subject okay chapter 27 mass and and energy the discovery of the mass energy relation equals mc^2 by Einstein was a significant advance in physical Theory and has already had some far-reaching physical applications it is of course entirely consistent with the reciprocal system of theory indeed this Theory provides the explanation of the relation that has her to for been lacking it is not always recognized that in the light of current physical thought this is a very strange relation why should the relation between mass and energy be expressible in terms of Speed Energy uh Einstein supplied no explanation he derived the relation from the mathematical expression of his theory of relativity but a mathematical derivation does not explain anything until an interpretation of the mathematics G gives that derivation a physical meaning the information that has been missing is now supplied by the reciprocal system in the universe of motion defined by that system of theory mass and energy are both reciprocal speeds differing only in Dimensions Mass being three-dimensional while energy is onedimensional unit energy is there for the product of unit mass and the second power of unit speed the speed of light and again that&#x27;s coming from you know the general idea that everything is quantized in the reciprocal system everything is in discrete units and so you have a unit energy unit mass unit speed unit acceleration unit everything is uh in discrete units this finding as to the true significance of the mass energy relation has an important effect on its applicability it shows that the current belief that a quantity of energy always has a certain Mass associated with it is erroneous reciprocal speed can exist either as mass or as energy but not both simultaneously a quantity of mass three-dimensional scalar motion is equivalent to a quantity of energy onedimensional scalar motion only when three-dimensional motion is actually transformed into onedimensional motion or vice versa in other words an existing quantity of mass does not correspond to any existing energy but to the quantity of energy that would come into existence if the mass actually converted into energy for this reason Einstein&#x27;s hypothesis of an increase in Mass accompanying increased velocity is inconsistent with our findings the kinetic energy increment could increase the mass only if it were converted to mass by some appropriate process and in that event it would cease to be kinetic energy that is the corresponding velocity would no longer exist actually this hypothesis of Einstein&#x27;s is inconsistent with his valid concept of the conversion of mass into energy regardless of the point of view from which the question is approached Mass cannot be an accompaniment of kinetic energy a quantity that increases as the energy increases and also an entity that can be converted into kinetic energy a quantity that increases as the energy decreases the two concepts are mutually exclusive in the theoretical Universe of motion now being described the mass energy relation is applicable only to those processes in which Mass disappears and energy appears or vice versa the the most familiar process of this kind is The Interchange between mass and energy that takes place as a result of radioactivity or similar Atomic Transformations as we saw in chapter 25 the primary mass is conserved in these reactions in the radioactive disintegration uh radium 226 to radon 222 plus h E4 for example the total primary mass of the original radium atom was 226 the primary mass of the residual radon atom 222 and that of the ejected alpha particle four likewise add up to 226 thus any mass energy conversion involved in atomic transformations of this kind is confined to the secondary Mass uh sorry I&#x27;m lost my spot here it looks like I&#x27;ve really lost my spot um okay here we go sorry current scientific opinion regards this secondary Mass component as the mass which according to accepted theory is associated with The Binding energy that holds the hypothetical constituents of the hypothetical Atomic nucleus together it must be conceded that this binding energy concept fits in very well with the prevailing ideas as to the nature of the atomic structure but it should be remembered that the entire nuclear concept of the atom is purely hypothetical no part of it has been uh verified empirically even Rutherford&#x27;s original conclusion that most of the mass of the atom is concentrated in a small nucleus the hypothesis from which the present day atomic theory was derived is not supported except on the basis of the assumption that the atoms are in contact in the solid state an assumption that we now find is erroneous and every additional step that has been taken in the long series of adjustments and modifications to which the theory has been subjected as a means of extricating it from difficulties has involved one or more further assumptions as pointed out in chapter 18 thus the fact that the binding energy concept is consistent with this aggregate of hypotheses has no physical significance all all available evidence is consistent with our finding that the difference between the observed total mass and the primary mass is a secondary Mass Effect due to the due to motion within the time region and that the conversion of this secondary Mass to energy is responsible for the energy production during radioactivity or other Atomic transformations the nature of the secondary Mass was explained in volume one the magnitudes of this quantity applicable to the subatomic particles and uh the hydrogen Isotopes were also calculated some studies were made on the higher elements during the early stages of the investigation and it was shown in the first edition of this work that there is a fairly regular decrease in the secondary Mass of the most abundant isotope of the elements in the range from lithium to iron Beyond iron the values are irregular but the secondary Mass negative in this range remains in the neighborhood of the iron value up to about the midpoint of the atomic series after which it gradually decreases and returns to positive values in the very heavy elements the effect of this secondary Mass pattern is to make both the growth process in the Light Elements and the Decay process in the heavy elements exothermic from the foregoing it follows that the secondary mass in the lower half of the atomic series with the exception of hydrogen is negative this conflicts with the general belief that mass is always positive but our previous development of theory has shown that the observed mass of an atom is the algebraic sum of the mass equivalents of the speed displacements of the constituent rotations where a rotation is negative the corresponding Mass component is also negative the net total mass of a material atom is always positive only because the magnetic rotation is necessarily positive in the material sector of the universe and the Magnetic rotation is the principal component of the total just why the minimum in the secondary Mass is at or near the midpoint of the atomic series rather than at one of the extremes is still unknown but a similar pattern was noted in some of the material properties examined in the preceding pages of this and the earlier volume and and it is not unlikely that there is a common cause many investigators have devoted considerable effort to the study and Analysis of atomic Transformations that might possibly serve as the source of the energy generated in the Sun and other stars the general conclusion has been that the most likely reactions are those in which hydrogen is converted into helium either directly or through a series of intermediate reactions hydrogen is the most abundant element in the stars and the universe as a whole this hydrogen conversion process if actually in operation could therefore furnish a substantial supply of energy but as brought out in chapter 25 there is no actual evidence that the conversion of ordinary hydrogen the H1 isotope to helium is naturally is a naturally occurring process in the stars or anywhere else even without the new information supplied by the investigation here being being reported there are many reasons to doubt that this process is actually operative and to question whether it would supply enough energy to meet the Stellar requirements if it were in operation it obviously fails by a wide margin to to account for the enormous energy output of the quazars and other compact astronomical objects as one astronomer States the case the problem of accounting for the energy of the quazars quote is widely considered to be the most important unresolved problem in theoretical astrophysics end quote the catastrophic effect that the invalidation of the hydrogen conversion process as the Stellar energy source would otherwise have on astronomical Theory leaving it without any explanation of the manner in which this energy is generated is avoided by the fact that the development of the reciprocal system of theory has revealed the existence of not only one but two hitherto unknown physical phenomena Each of which is far more powerful than the hydrogen conversion process these newly discovered processes are not only capable of meeting the energy requirements of the stable stars but also the far greater requirements of the Supernova and quazars uh when the quazar energies are scaled down to the true magnitudes from the inflated values based on the current interpretations of the red shifts of these objects perhaps some readers may find it difficult to accept the thought that there could could be hitherto unknown processes in operation in the universe that are vastly more powerful than any previously known process it might seem that anything of that magnitude should have made itself known to Observation long ago the explanation is that the results of these processes are known observationally extremely energetic events are prominent features of present day astronomy what has not been known here to for is the nature of the processes whereby the enormous energies are generated this is the information that the theory of the universe of motion is now supplying in chapter 17 We examined one of these processes the conversion of Mass to energy that results when the matter in the interior of a star reaches the destructive thermal limit this is the long continuing process that supplies the relatively modest on the astronomical scale amount of energy necessary to meet the requirements of the stable Stars it also accounts for the large energy output of one kind of supernova as we will see in volume three at this time we will take a look at what happens when a star arrives at a different kind of destructive limit the destructive limit identified in chapter 17 is is reached when the total of the outward displacements thermal and electric ionization reaches equality with one of the inward rotational displacements of the atom reducing the net displacement of the combination to zero and destroying its rotational character a similar destructive limit is reached when the inward displacement inward displac ments uh including rotation and gravitational charge are built up to a level that from the rotational standpoint is the equivalent of zero the concept of the equivalent of zero is new to science and may be somewhat confusing but its nature can be illustrated by consideration of the principle on which the operation of the stroboscope is based this instrument observes a rotating object je in a series of views at regular inter intervals if the interval is adjusted to equal the rotation time the various features of the rotating object occupy the same position in each View and the object therefore appears to be stationary a similar effect was seen in the early movies where the wheels of moving Vehicles often appear to stop rotating or to rotate backward in the physical situation if a rotating combination completes its cycle in a unit of time each of the displacement units of the combination returns to the same Circ circumferential pos position at the end of each cycle from the standpoint of the macroscopic behavior of the motion the positions at the ends of the time units are the only ones that have any significance that is what happens within a unit has no effect on other units and under the conditions specified these positions lie in a straight line in the reference system this means that there is no longer any Factor tending to keep the units together as a rotational combination an atom consequently they set separate as linear motions and mass is transformed into energy it should be understood however that this transformation at the destructive limit has no effect on the motion itself scalar motion has no property other than its positive or negative magnitude and that remains unchanged what is altered is the coupling to the reference system which is subject to change at the end of any unit if the conditions existing at that point are favorable for such a change the emphasis on the the emphasis on the ends of the units of motion in the forging discussion is a reflection of the nature of the basic motions as defined in the fundamental postulates of the reciprocal system of theory according according to these postulates the basic units of motion are discreet this does not mean that the motion proceeds by a succession of jumps on the contrary motion is inherently a continuous progression a new unit of the progression begins at the point where the preceding unit ends so that continuity in this sense is maintained from unit to unit as well as within unit but since the units are separate entities the effects of the events that take place in one unit cannot be carried forward to the next although the combination of the internal and external features of the same unit may be effective as in the case of the primary and secondary Mass the individual units of motion may continue on the same basis but but the coupling of the motion to the reference system is subject to change to conform to whatever conditions may exist at the end of a unit when the atom has returned to the situation that existed at the original zero as is true if the end of the rotational cycle coincides with the end of the time unit the motion has reached a new starting point a new zero we may say for the reasons previously given the limiting value the equivalent of zero in each scalar Dimension is eight units of onedimensional or four units of two-dimensional rotational displacement in the notation used herein the latter is a 4-4 magnetic combination however as indicated in chapter 24 the destructive limit is not reached until the displacement in the electric Dimension also arrives at the equivalent of the last magnetic Unit A rotational combination or an atom is therefore stable at zero magnetic ionization up to 4-4 D31 or the equivalent of 5-4 -1 which is element [Music] 117 one more step reaches the limit at which the rotational motion terminates if the rotational limit is reached in atoms whose individual magnetic ionization is above the general level in the aggregate of which these atoms are constituents the effect of approaching the limit is that the atoms become radioactive and eject portions of their masses in the form of alpha particles or other fragments this prevents the building of elements heavier than 117 but it does not result in destruction of primary Mass such as that which occurs in the destructive thermal limit thus the radioactivity is a means of avoiding the destructive effects of reaching the limit limiting value of the magnetic displacement this situation is analogous to a number of others that are more familiar for example we saw in chapter five that the limiting value of the specific heat of a solid is reached at a relatively low temperature Beyond this limit the atom or molecule enters the liquid state the transition requires a substantial energy input and since the lower energy states are more probable in a low energy environment the atom avoids the need to provide the energy increment by changing to a different thermal vibration pattern if it has the capability of doing so the atoms of the heavier elements make several changes of this kind as new limiting values of the specific heat are encountered at successively higher temperatures eventually however a point is reached at which no further expedients of this kind are available and the atom must pass into the liquid state similarly the probabilities favor the con continued existence of the combination of motions that constitutes the atom as long as this is possible the destructive effects of arriving at the displacement limit are are therefore avoided by the ejection of mass but here too as in the case of the specific heat a point is eventually reached where the level of magnetic ionization tending to increase the atomic mass prevents further ejection of Mass from the atom and arrival at the destructive limit can no longer be avoided the consequences of reaching this rotational displacement limit at the equivalent of zero are qualitatively identical with those of reaching the thermal displacement limit at zero the various rotational components cancel out and the motion reverts to the linear basis this transforms Mass into kinetic energy most of which is imparted to the residue of the atoms or to other matter in the environment the remainder goes into electromagnetic radiation from a quantitative standpoint there are some significant differences between the two phenomena the thermal limit applies only to the heaviest element that is present in the aggregate in a significant quantity and the rate at which the element arrives at the limit is regulated by a process that will be discussed in volume 3 the elements lower in the atomic series are not affected furthermore the conversion of rotational to linear displacement Mass to energy at the thermal limit does not necessarily apply to more than one of the magnetic displacement units of the atom and a large part of the atomic mass May therefore remain intact either as a residual atom or as a number of fragments consequently the thermal limit has no catastrophic effect until the temperature reaches the destructive limit of an element iron that is present in relatively large quantities on the other hand arrival at the magnetic displacement limit affects the entire mass of each atom and the only portion of the mass of an aggregate that remain remains intact is that in the outer portions of the aggregate where the magnetic ionization level is lower than in the deeper interior there is no process that limits the rate of disintegration at this destructive limit the resulting explosion known as a type 2 Supernova is therefore much more powerful relative to the mass of the exploding star than the type 1 Supernova that occurs at the thermal limit although its full magnitude is not evident from direct observation for reasons that will be explained in volume 3 while the thermal disintegration process is operative in every Star it does not necessarily precede all the way to the destruction of the star the extent to which the mass of the star and consequently the temperature increases depends on its environment some Stars will accrete enough Mass to reach the temperature limit and explode others will not but the increase in the magnetic ionization level is a continuing process in all environments and it necessarily results in arrival at the magnetic destructive limit when sufficient time has elapsed this limit is is thus essentially an age limit a process related to those that have been described in the foregoing paragraphs is the sequence of events that counterbalances the conversion of three-dimensional motion or mass into onedimensional motion or energy in the stars um yeah this is a very long paragraph so um I&#x27;m not going to keep going I&#x27;m going to stop right here and um we will resume tomorrow with the uh hopefully the remainder of this chapter and the remainder of the book as we are in the last chapter uh so um thanks for tuning in today and hope to see you tomorrow for the uh finale have a great</p>
