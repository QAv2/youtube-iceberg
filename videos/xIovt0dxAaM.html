            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel and we look at uh old and new theories of everything things that uh you can hang your head on things that are uh cosmologically significant and that you can uh build your Paradigm around your new paradigm moving into the five uh D world and uh making the transition to higher Consciousness and Great Awakening today is our 47th video on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson Mr Larsson uh was born in 1898 around 1930 he had some he was a a mining engineer fought in World War I and uh became an engineer after that uh was kind of did midling around working on a few uh different uh science projects trying to make some small contributions in his field stumbled across some uh potentially um Earth shattering ideas uh answered the call and did a lot of 25 30 years worth of research uh to kind of work out his ideas in 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates he had them he had all his ideas down to two sentences that he uh said the uh you know this is how the universe is constructed and then he took those uh postulates and he developed a theoretical Universe through a process of if if this then that he uh determined the characteristics of his Universe of his theoretical universe and then uh in the remaining years of his life up until his death in 1990 he was writing books more or less comparing his theoretical Universe with the empirical uh and measured universe of the um Legacy scientists um and in many cases he had uh very similar if not identical results um but uh Mr Larsson was doing that on um a minuscule budget with uh no modern tools and no uh other resources no other people helping him uh and it took the scientists multi-trillion dollar and probably uh hundreds of thousands of them over the course of uh centuries to come up with their tables so Larsson uh got a powerful Theory there if he&#x27;s able to uh come up with the same answers just off the off of his theory off of his top of his head um so basically uh his two postulates read as uh there are a few different versions of them so it&#x27;s hard to quote them directly but uh the universe is composed of one component most existing in three dimensions indiscrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and then the second postulate which is not as important is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian uh now so the first postulate is what we want to focus on here um basically the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it&#x27;s not made out of the four fundamental forces it rather is made out of motion and in particular LaRon identifies a kind of motion that is more unfamiliar to us that is uh less localized and um more General that is called a scape SC motion a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific direction or really its direction is either in or out uh you can Envision a scalar motion if you envision a balloon with dots on it or spots on it as you blow up the balloon all of the spots will be moving away from each other they&#x27;re not moving in any particular direction just away from from each other every spot will be moving away from every other spot and in fact even the uh the locations that are between the spots will be moving away from every other location on the surface of that balloon they&#x27;re all moving away from each other but in no particular direction that is a scalar motion you can fill in the third dimension if you uh imagine some something like raisin bread where you put the bread in the oven begins to rise all of the raisins will be moving away from each other but again not in any specific Direction the further away they are the faster they&#x27;ll be moving away from each other that is a scalar motion and that is the motion that even though the Legacy scientists know very little about scalar motion they do admit to its existence uh they&#x27;ve observed that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other but they have not recognized its significance for Larson he builds his whole universe on that scalar motion moving outward that is his background motion and the rest of the universe is built off that motion now uh the reason why Larsson calls it the reciprocal system of theory first of all it&#x27;s a system of theory meaning that if you get the theory you can you can plug in the reciprocal system to any subject uh doesn&#x27;t matter what it is um you can plug it into you know underwater basket weaving the reciprocal you know reciprocal under underwater basket weaving um I&#x27;m a historian I would like to apply it to history uh Larson himself has applied it to economics he&#x27;s got two books on economics one is called the road to Full Employment and the other one is called the road to permanent Prosperity we are going to look at that second book The Road to permanent Prosperity coming up here pretty soon uh you know in a couple months we&#x27;re going to go over that book it&#x27;s very interesting and uh but most of larsson&#x27;s books are on scientific topics such as uh physics and chemistry and astronomy but he also has a book on metaphysics which includes sections on philosophy religion and psychology and biology so he has uh you know employed his system of theory the reciprocal part of the reciprocal system of theory applies to the uh relation between space and time motion is the relationship between space and time uh that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time basically motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator space and time however come in three dimensions so that complicates things um but uh all of our scientific quantities are forms of motion so matter is a kind of motion energy is a kind of motion force is a kind of motion acceleration is a kind of motion pressure is a kind of motion electric current is a kind of motion electric charge is a kind of motion uh electrical capacitance is a kind of motion magnetic flux is a kind of motion permeability is a kind of motion viscosity and fluidity are kinds of motion they all have their own uh specific SpaceTime coordinates so that is the three di part of the three dimensionality of space uh three dimensions in a still frame uh the temporal reference system and the uh spatial reference system respective or not respectively but separately they are uh two separate um and generally the spatial coordinate system goes together with the scaler time system so a scalar Motion in space is coupled with a coordinate Motion in time and vice versa scalar Motion in time is coupled with a coordinate Motion in space we&#x27;re familiar with the latter really only in our sector of the universe we observe relations based on three dimensions of space in a still frame and time uh moving in a scalar manner or the flow of time time is always getting farther and farther and farther apart like on the surface of an expanding balloon but if we were in a different sector of the universe we would observe three dimensions of time in a still frame and we would see space as flowing or progressing uh space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart like on the surface of an expanding balloon and that sector of the universe is what Larson calls the cosmic sector now the cosmic sector uh can be derived out of the uh discrete unit postulate you know we said that the universe is made out of motion motion is a relationship between space and time but um motion uh universe is constructed out of motion existing in three dimensions like coordinate space and coordinate time in discrete units so space and time both come in only discrete units you have to have a full unit of space before you have space and you have to have a full unit of time before you have time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have those qualities those quantities and um if you have one unit of space in one unit of time space over time being speed you have what Larsson is called unit speed 1 over 1 equals 1 unit speed is also the speed of light so the speed of light is the um kind of the background motion of the universe it&#x27;s the midpoint uh Einstein sees it as the maximum speed of the universe Larsson sees it as the midpoint meaning that there&#x27;s an entire universe that Einstein doesn&#x27;t know anything about that is moving faster than the speed of light Larson refers to that as the cosmic sector and that is where you have the relationships that are based on coordinate time and clock space three dimensions of time in a still frame and um space is always moving farther and farther and farther apart uh contrasting with the material sector of the universe which is a sector that we are accustomed to that we live in and that is um moving slower than the speed of light okay now um we are looking at chapter 2 of larsson&#x27;s book called basic properties of matter basic properties of matter is a book where Larson um derives equations for the B it&#x27;s on chemistry derives equations for the basic properties of matter and then Compares them with the scientific tables in this chapter which is called interatomic distances Larsson attempts to specify the interatomic distance for uh all of the different elements uh you know the hydrogen and the helium and the um burum and Boron and lithium and or not in that order carbon um all the way up to uranium and Beyond um and uh he comes up with uh various equations the basic uh the basic gist of it is well first we have to form figure out about the time region and the space region in particular the time region if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space that&#x27;s the discrete unit postulate if you don&#x27;t have space then you only have time because the universe is made out of space and time motion so if it&#x27;s not space then it has to be time or both and so you don&#x27;t have space that means you have only time so when you have an interaction that occurs in less than one unit of space and one unit of space is 4.56 * 10us 8 m so approximately 500,000 of an inch um then you um only have that interaction in time because it&#x27;s less than one unit of space so you don&#x27;t have space you only have time Larson calls this the time region and the time region is where we have interactions of uh atoms and particles Co U material atoms and particles Cosmic atoms and Cosmic particles um or what we call antimatter they interact over in the cosmic sector uh where uh the speed is faster than the speed of light and um the the activity occurs in less than one unit of time where time is 1.52 * 10- 16 seconds so less than that that uh instantaneous kind of time interval uh then if you have less than interactions less than that then you don&#x27;t have time you only have space so the interaction URS in what he calls the space region when you cross those boundaries uh you know cross the unit speed boundary you have to switch the roles of space and time where you have to cross the unit space boundary then you have to or this unit time boundary then you have to reverse the order of the primary forces the progression which is the outward movement of the balloon uh surface um that is uh the outward movement when you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other Larson calls that the progression and when that occurs at the speed of light that is the progression of the natural reference system when you suck in the balloon and the balloon contracts and all of the dots are moving toward each other Larsson refers to that as gravitation the interatomic distances distance is the equilibrium between those two forces now when you have those forces in the time region they act opposite so um normally the progression is moving outward and gravitation is moving inward but when you are within one unit of time or space then the progression is moving Inward and gravitation is moving outward and this enables an equilibrium between the two forces and so the progression is constant it&#x27;s always moving outward at the speed of light in all directions gravitation is variable depending on the distance apart that the two apparently interacting particles are and so you have to find the place where gravitation is equal to the progression and that is the equilibrium point or what lson calls the interatomic distance so we&#x27;re going to uh go into this chapter uh this is our third installment of this so if you want to catch it at the beginning you want to go back uh probably really about 10 days to get chapter one also and chapter one is on uh uh solid cohesion uh which is a similar uh topic that leads into this okay the regular electropositive pattern electr positives are the kind of the left side of the periodic table um the regular electropositive pattern is also applicable um in division two which is the left side of the periodic table with uh veilance greater than four and a number of the division 2 elements of group 3A uh which is the row with uh I believe it&#x27;s the row that uh goes from uh sodium to argon but uh it might be the row after that from pottassium to Krypton we&#x27;ll see and a number of the division two elements of group 3A yeah I would think U okay crystallize on this basis crystallization is what happens when you move into the time region and that is a part of the uh you know interatomic equilibrium uh number of the group elements of group 3A crystallize on this basis with interatomic distances determined in the same manner as in division one as noted in volume one which is called Nothing But motion however the division 2 elements generally favor the magnetic type of orientation in chemical compounds because the normal positive orientation becomes less probable as the displacement increases the same probability considerations operate against the positive orientation in the elements of this division but instead of employing the magnetic orientation as the alternate these elements utilize a type of orientation that is available only where all all rotations of each participant in a combination are identical with those of the other this Arrangement reverses the effective directions of the rotations of alternate atoms the resulting relative rotation is a combination of X and 8 minus X or in some cases 4 - x as in the neutral orientation and the effective specific rotations are 10 for vibration one and five for vibration two a combination value of five or or 10 is also common uh larsson&#x27;s kind of into the in the weeds here um I don&#x27;t feel like this is all that uh crucial but he does have a table here where he Compares his calculation for the specific for the interatomic distance with uh the tables and um this is all measured in angstroms and he starts here with uh 2B which is I guess uh 2B is the row from sodium to argon and then I guess 3A would be the uh the row from pottassium to Krypton and U so sodium specific rotation 3-22 um and then it also has an orientation where it can be 3-3 uh his calculated value is 3.70 angstroms The observed value is 3.71 for magnesium specific rotation 3 2 and2 um let&#x27;s see here uh I&#x27;m not sure what this second number here is in the table but his calculation is 3.7 3.17 The observed value is 3.21 aluminum number 13 on the periodic table um calculated 2.83 observe 2.86 then moving to elements 3A uh uh in the row in the 3A row pottassium uh number 19 calculated 4.49 observe Reserve 4.50 calcium number 20 uh calculated 4. observed 3.98 number 21 Scandium uh calculated 3.18 observed 3.20 titanium number 22 calculated 2.95 observed 2.92 uh then moving to um uh the 3B row starting with rubidium number [Music] 37 uh calculated at 4.85 observed at 4.87 strontium 38 uh calculated at 4.32 observed at 4.28 and on and on and on and uh he actually just calculates a few in each row or shows the calculation here and um in all cases he is um relatively close there aren&#x27;t any any cases where he&#x27;s more than um just over 1% of the value um uh away from the uh observe value and um now back to the text he&#x27;s saying that um he&#x27;s talking about a reverse orientation uh which I think is um when uh uh the uh specific rotation is aligned in a different way um and then has different different numbers that go into the interatomic distance each one of these elements there there are different options for it to take some are some only have one option because only one is the one option is much more probable than any of the others but then in some cases the probabilities are fairly similar and so there might be two forms or maybe even more than two forms of um orientation of one particular atom and so they might have more than one interatomic distance he&#x27;s saying the reverse type this reverse type of structure makes it its appearance in the body centered cubic Crystal forms of chromium and iron which coexists with the regular positive hexagonal or face Center cubic structures vadium and niobium the first uh division two elements of their respective groups combin the positive and reverse orientations Beyond niobium and the positive orientation does not appear in the common division two forms of the elements the structures to which the present discussion is limited and all elements take the reverse orientation except europium and uh ubium which combine it with a unit specific rotation that is no electric rotational displacement at at all as in the in inert gases okay um LaRon is more or less writing this for an audience of chemists so he may have gotten you lost as he got me lost as we move through this and he keeps uh kind of diverting away from you know the actual Theory and he gets into some of the um finer points and I wish that Larson would do that with footnotes uh instead of putting it into the text I think it would make it easier to read but it&#x27;s kind of impossible to second guess Larson because he was doing this all by himself and he had no um resources to do it and it&#x27;s I know it&#x27;s very very difficult to articulate a new paradigm um you have to use a whole new vocabulary uh to uh you know to articulate points that have never been made before um and uh so you know I&#x27;m not going to criticize him for you know not using footnotes I but that&#x27;s what I would have done but I might be wrong this might be a better approach I don&#x27;t know but I it it&#x27;s causing me to get a little bit lost here and I suspect you might be too U figuring out all the different orientations uh but the bottom line is that Larson was able to predict these interatomic distances at least of those particular particles of of those particular atoms um with that equation he used that was introduced in yesterday&#x27;s video on the basis of the considerations discussed in chapter 1 the average effective specific rotation for such rotational combinations has been taken as the geometric mean of the two components where the orientations are the same and the only difference is in the magnitude as in the 510 combination and in the combinations of magnetic rotations that we will encounter later the equilibrium is reached in the normal manner if two different electric rotations are involved the two atom pairs cannot attain spatial equilibrium individually but they establish a group equilibrium similar to that which is achieved where n atoms of veence one each combine sorry about that each combine with one atom of veence n the division two distances are shown in table three so here he&#x27;s covering the division two elements of um of uh row 3A apparently that that begins with vadium uh number 23 calculated 2.62 observed 2.62 chromium calculated 2.68 observe 2.72 um in its alternate form uh the other orientation uh where it&#x27;s uh chromium is element 24 it could either um be attracted to the um z uh the zero you know to the um argon number 18 uh so it has a specific rotation of seven six + one or to all the way over to the other side of the um the other noble gas uh being um Krypton number 36 that would give us a veilance of 12 but apparently the specific rotation is always going to be 10 so with a specific rotation of 10 um he calculates 2.46 and the value 2.49 so chromium has two alternate versions manganese number 25 for some reason only has one version and that is uh calculated at 2.59 observed at 2.58 iron calculated at number 26 calculated at 2.56 observed at 2.57 uh for the first orientation which is specific rotation 8 and A2 second specific rotation is 10 and that this specific rotation is in the Electrical uh the third number every atom has three numbers two of them are uh magnetic rotations and one of them is an electric rotation matter is based on two photons which are vibrating units um or simple harmonic motions they&#x27;re wav like motions and they are the core of the atom but they are moving outward at the speed of light in all directions and in order to slow slow them down and stop them and get them to gravitate you have to rotate those photons in three dimensions to stop them um and so that uh is what the periodic table is based on you have to rotated in two Dimensions magnetically uh primary and two secondary um two diens rotations that makes three total and uh three total dimensions okay we&#x27;ll start again tomorrow</p>
