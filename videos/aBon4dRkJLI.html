            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>On February 19th, President Donald Trump posted a tweet ordering the Secretary of War and other federal agencies to begin identifying and releasing government files on alien and ET life, UAP, and UFOs. That post didn&#x27;t come out of nowhere. It was the final move in a week that built piece by piece toward exactly this moment. And today, we&#x27;re going to walk through exactly how it happened. Because if you blinked, you probably missed it.</p>
<p>As always, I&#x27;m here to report all the information and you can decide what to believe. You can find the extended sources in my detailed articles at ufonnews.co along with the main sources in the description box below. Hey you followers, I&#x27;m Christina Gomez and welcome to this episode of UFO News Updates. Before that tweet went live, while Trump was on Air Force One, a C-SPAN reporter brought up Barack Obama&#x27;s recent comments about alien life. And here&#x27;s exactly what Trump said.</p>
<p>Something that got a lot of attention this week. Barack Obama said that aliens are real. Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to Earth? &gt;&gt; Well, he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that, you know. &gt;&gt; So, aliens are real.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that. He made He made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information.</p>
<p>No, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, Peter? &gt;&gt; Well, the president can declassify anything that he wants to.</p>
<p>So, if you want to get him out of trouble, &gt;&gt; I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. &gt;&gt; Did Obama start the momentum to push Trump to talk about UFOs? Did Obama want to beat Trump to the punch about UFOs? There&#x27;s a lot of theories, but Trump did not answer whether he believes aliens are real. He accused Obama of leaking classified material, suggesting he himself could resolve the situation through declassification. None of that was accidental. The declassification comment landed and hours later, the tweet appeared on X.</p>
<p>His exact words in the post read, &quot;Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War and other relevant departments and agencies to begin the process of identifying and releasing government files related to alien and ET life, UAP and UFOs, and any and all other information connected to these highly complex but extremely interesting and important matters. God bless America.&quot; He used the phrase Secretary of War, which is a new title for the Secretary of Defense. But the directive itself was clear. Federal agencies are now formally tasked with identifying and releasing these files. So, what does identifying actually mean here? It means what can and can&#x27;t be released to the public.</p>
<p>Regardless, this is huge news. But if you blinked at all this week or missed any of the UFO news updates that took place right here, we need to look at what happened for that tweet to manifest. On February 18th, during a White House briefing, a Newsmax reporter Mike Carter asked press secretary Caroline Levit directly whether the Trump administration believes aliens are real and whether the speech that Laura Trump described actually exists. It&#x27;s really important to look at Caroline Levit&#x27;s body language and her voice inflections here. &gt;&gt; Obama Caroline was recently asked if aliens are real.</p>
<p>He says they&#x27;re real, but he hasn&#x27;t seen them. President&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Laura Trump, told Morirana Divine of the New York Post that the president has a prepared speech on this issue that he prepares to deliver at the right time. Is that true? And [laughter] does the Trump administration believe aliens are real? &gt;&gt; Well, a speech on aliens would be news to me. That sounds very exciting, though. I&#x27;ll have to check in with our speech writing team.</p>
<p>Uh, and that would be of great interest to me personally, and I&#x27;m sure all of you in this room and apparently former President Obama, too. So, we&#x27;ll keep you posted on that. She didn&#x27;t deny that a speech existed. She said it was news to her, which is a very different statement. And she didn&#x27;t say that the administration doesn&#x27;t believe that aliens are real.</p>
<p>She redirected it, kept the tone pretty light, and left every door open. The phrase, &quot;We will keep you posted,&quot; is not how a press secretary closes a story. That&#x27;s how they keep one alive. Now, watch the full clip and pay attention to her body language during that answer. She fidgeted with her bracelet in a way that she didn&#x27;t do for the rest of the briefing, and that alone is worth noting.</p>
<p>But there&#x27;s also something in the delivery itself. If you&#x27;ve ever watched any content or statement analysis or behavioral detection, one of the most consistently noted markers is a rising pitch at the end of a statement. Even if you watch any like lie to me uh YouTube videos or like the TV show for instance, there are certain little things that tell you, okay, this person isn&#x27;t telling the full truth. And in this case, you noticed that some things that she said sounded more like a question than a statement. When someone&#x27;s telling the truth, the delivery tends to close downward with confidence like no versus no.</p>
<p>So when the brain and body are not in agreement with what&#x27;s being said, the voice can betray that by rising, turning to what should be a firm answer and it is something that&#x27;s not necessarily very certain. &gt;&gt; A speech on aliens would be news to me. Almost like the person is asking you to believe them rather than simply stating a fact. That raising inflection is the body attempting to perform shock when the mind already knows the answer. It&#x27;s a very subtle distinction, but if you go back and listen closely to how Caroline answered that specific question about the speech, you will notice it.</p>
<p>You can draw your own conclusions, but it is worth a second listen. Lara Trump told Miranda Devine of the New York Post that the president has a prepared speech on this issue that he prepares to deliver at the right time. Is that true? And does [laughter] the Trump administration believe aliens are real? &gt;&gt; Well, a speech on aliens would be news to me. That sounds very exciting, though. I&#x27;ll have to check in with our speech writing team.</p>
<p>Uh, and that would be of great interest to me personally, and I&#x27;m sure all of you in this room and apparently former President Obama, too. So, we&#x27;ll keep you posted on that. And if you watch how she answers all the other questions during that same briefing, she&#x27;s much more confident. Very little touching of the jewelry and very few voice inflections. I&#x27;ll play this next segment just to give context.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So this legislation can get moved. &gt;&gt; Well, the [clears throat] president has a good relationship with Senate Majority Leader John Thun. They keep in very close contact and they work together all of the time. I hear your passion and your voice and I know it&#x27;s shared by many Americans across the country including the president himself. Now let&#x27;s talk about how this week built to this point because if you watched this channel earlier this week, you already know the foundation.</p>
<p>You have Obama&#x27;s comments and Laura Trump&#x27;s interview along with Congressman Eric Berles&#x27;s comments as well, but we need to very quickly cover it over again. It started with former President Obama in a podcast interview. He simply said that aliens are real. And then he clarified on Instagram the next day that he was speaking to statistical probability given the size of the universe and that he saw no evidence of contact during his presidency. But the initial statement was already in motion and thousands of articles across the globe were covering it.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t walk that back. Then a few days later, Laura Trump told the podcast Pod Force One that her father-in-law has prepared a speech on ET Live and was waiting for the right moment to deliver it. And then she also mentioned that exact same thing on her YouTube channel last week. Now, none of those three things, Obama&#x27;s statement, Laura Trump&#x27;s interview, or Levit&#x27;s non-denial happened in a vacuum. There&#x27;s still so much going on here, so don&#x27;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>In December of 2025, David Grush sat down with Fox News and said directly that members of the current administration are, in his words, very well aware of this reality and that the current president is very knowledgeable on this subject. He stated Trump has been briefed on the topic of UFOs. And Grush went further and said that if this information were publicly disclosed, Trump would be one of the most consequential leaders in modern history. A lot of people have mentioned that it will be Trump&#x27;s ego that will disclose UFOs. It&#x27;s also important to hold this in full context.</p>
<p>The Pentagon denied Grush&#x27;s core allegations about the information he shared about nonhuman biologics. NASA stated it has found no credible evidence of ET life. Researchers at NASA&#x27;s UAP independent study team mentioned they found nothing. A lot of people had a very hard time believing that. Then Missouri Congressman Eric Berles stated publicly that he had been briefed on species that Grush described.</p>
<p>In July of 2025, Berles appeared on redacted and revealed that Grush had personally advised him to attend the Bugosphere conference in June of 2025 run by journalist and researcher Haime Maan specifically to examine the Nazca bodies found in Peru. Berles said he didn&#x27;t want to go. He wasn&#x27;t planning on going, assuming the mummies were incredible. That all changed when Grush told him to go. Take a listen.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Also, we we had reports that there was mummies that were that were found in Peru that were alien mummies. And um and whenever I spoke with David Grush, who was the whistleblower from the UA from the Pentagon that studied this stuff, um I was actually probably not going to go because I thought that that there&#x27;s no way that that&#x27;s real. and he he recommended that I do because he said that based on the physiology of what he&#x27;s seen in some of these mummies, not all of them, some of them are faked, but some of the mummies that exist in in Peru, that based on the physiology, they are congruent with what he has seen in in briefings in his former role. &gt;&gt; A lot of people don&#x27;t know that, but that&#x27;s why you come here to get all the information and the sources to back it up. We also can&#x27;t forget that in 2024 on the Lex Freedman podcast, Trump was asked if he would declassify alien files and said simply, &quot;Sure, I&#x27;ll do that.&quot; Is he following up on that now? Even Chuck Schumer made a tweet in January of last year stating, &quot;Now do UFOs after Trump released files on JFK, MLK, and RFK.&quot; What the week of February 19th demonstrated was that the political conversation around UAP disclosure has reached a level where it is no longer a niche issue a reporter asks once about and then moves on from.</p>
<p>It was the story that followed the president from a C-SPAN exchange to an expost with the White House press secretary, a former president and the president&#x27;s own family in the middle of all of it. Whether the files we get release answer the questions this community has been asking for decades remains to be seen. The process of identifying and releasing is not the same as declassifying. But the directive exists, the legal framework exists, and the political momentum exists in a way that it had not before. Do you think this directive process actually document releases? And if so, what do you believe will be in them? and what would have to be in those releases for you to consider it a genuine disclosure rather than a controlled information drop.</p>
