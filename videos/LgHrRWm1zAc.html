            <p>So there is actually a a thing that we have in our government which is called the uh invention secrecy act and it is a thing that our government created that they can if let&#x27;s just say you come up with a cool invention that&#x27;s going to change the world. Government can just take it. They have no qualms, no problems, no nothing. There&#x27;s no laws that on the books that say that you have rights to what your information is. You come up with a cool ass idea match.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s ours now. Now, they will give you a fair price that they consider fair to you until you go on about your day. Now, if that&#x27;s still not good enough for you, you die. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s I mean, that&#x27;s literally how that works. &gt;&gt; Take the money.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Just take the money and shut up. There was a guy who &gt;&gt; made a water engine just happened to just die of some kind of weird poison or &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nobody knows why he died. So, there&#x27;s plenty of experience that we have for this to be true. And we&#x27;ve got plenty of stories, enough stories to where we have a patent office, right? Patent office now that has patents that are insane.</p>
<p>That could help us out tremendously. That could literally &gt;&gt; change the world as we know it. And those are all hidden and off the books. They will they will literally kill the company. And they&#x27;ve done it several times.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s been there&#x27;s been times where we have gadgets that are so far ahead of their time that a rich company will be like, &quot;I&#x27;m going to buy you out. I&#x27;m going to take this technology and I&#x27;m going to shelf it. &gt;&gt; Just we we just bought it just to buy it.&quot; And they&#x27;ll shelf it. And &gt;&gt; like I said, it take the money, shut up, go on about your day because if you know the other extreme end of that, you just don&#x27;t get to have your product plus you die. So that happens quite often.</p>
