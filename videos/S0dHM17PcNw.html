            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel this channel is for educational purposes and we try to look at theories of everything and cosmologies uh all-encompassing theories people who work their whole life on something and uh put it out and um never really got any credit for it other important uh scholarly work that has or research work that has been suppressed and uh anything else that might really benefit your life if you knew about it which you probably don&#x27;t and uh today is our 48th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and uh this theory was a system of theory was proposed originally by Dewey B Larson uh when he came out with his two fundamental postulates in 1959 then he took those two postulates and through a process of deduction um deduced his theoretical universe so he&#x27;s he boiled down his two postulates to really two sentences and then took those two sentences and said well if this is true then that&#x27;s true and if this is true then this follows from that and um so if my postulates are true this is what my universe would look like and then in his books over the next 30 years he compared his theoretical Universe with the empirical universe of the um Legacy science um you know what they over the course of the centuries in Millennia uh through through thousands if not hundreds of thousands of scientists and um billions if not trillions of dollars worth of research work and grant money and so on uh what they had finally uh compiled in their TAA scientific tables and so on um from their Laboratories what the uh you know various what the universe looked like and uh we&#x27;re uh looking at one of the results of that uh his book Larson&#x27;s book that&#x27;s called basic properties of matter uh we are going through chapter one uh we started this uh 3 days ago so if you want to go all the way back to the start of the book you go back about 3 days um uh we&#x27;re still in chapter one uh which is called solid cohesion so in this book basically properties of matter uh Larson focuses on chemistry and he focuses on uh his theoretical Universe in terms of some of the basic properties of of the elements of the atomic table and the chem and the chemical compounds um so he looks at things such as the co solid cohesion the interatomic distance uh the uh compressibility and uh the melting point and the critical point these different um measurements that uh Legacy science made in the laboratory Larson comes up with values for these things strictly from Theory and then he compares the results um so we&#x27;re going to go through that in just a minute uh first I just want to give you a quick once over on what are the fundamental postulates and what is Larson&#x27;s worldview about this Larson&#x27;s Universe uh is also known as Universe of motion because uh Larson says that the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy or force or something like that energ uh the universe is made out of motion and in larsson&#x27;s um estimation uh which is kind of what distinguishes him from some of his predecessors who also had the idea that the Universe was made out of motion is that he defines motion as the relationship between space and time it sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time uh so space space and time are the components or the contents of the universe uh motion is the contents of the universe not the setting in um thousands of years of uh science all the uh the basic Paradigm is that U you know the actions of the universe take place in this setting of space and time um but in larsson&#x27;s universe space and time are the contents of the universe and um motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator example uh speed the bicycle is moving 12 M hour 12 miles of space in 1 hour of time space over time speed is space over time and uh you can see the reciprocal relationship if you decide to double the speed you double the speed now you can say this uh the bike is moving 24 miles per hour or you can say the bike is now moving 12 miles per half hour you can multiply the space or divide the time that&#x27;s a reciprocal relation ship so um as far as speed goes at least we can see that there is a reciprocal relationship between space and time as far as speed goes but Larson applies this to all of our real scientific quantities not just speed but energy matter Force acceleration pressure uh electric charge and electric current current magnetic flux surface tension power density these are all relationships between space and time so that does represent an improvement um over the MKS system which requires really space time and mass and it becomes complicated uh when you got three variables there Larsson boiled it down to two space and time now when Larson talks about motion he talks about a more generalized non-localized kind of motion that he calls scalar motion which is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction it&#x27;s kind of like a more abstract version of of motion uh that you can Envision using a balloon uh spotted balloon and and if you blow up the balloon all of the dots will be moving away from each other each dot is moving away from each other dot there is no uh specific direction that they&#x27;re moving just outward they&#x27;re moving outward away from each other but in no specific Direction and likewise if you suck in the lson refers to this as the progression if you suck in the balloon and now the balloon is Contracting all of the dots will be moving toward each other and this is the opposite Force there or not really a force he&#x27;ll be talking about that today but um it looks like a force because a force is an action at a distance and it is uh seen to have a Direction um this inward Force this inward uh what Larson calls as if Force like so it looks like a force but it isn&#x27;t is uh what Larsson refers to as gravitation all of the dots are moving toward each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction but if you arbitrarily decide to assign one of those dots as being the reference point and say that it is motionless then you can start uh kind of seeing force fields between the dots like this dot is moving toward uh all of the dots will be moving toward this motionless Dot and so you can see that it appears to be a force um but it isn&#x27;t the force is the the direction is the result of the reference point not a result of the motion itself the motion itself is just a motion of uh all dots toward all other dots and so um that is also part of the reciprocal system and then um another major part is the discrete unit postulate um time and space and motion come only in discrete units you have to have a full unit of space and a full unit of time before you have those entities um and if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have what Larson calls unit speed otherwise known as the speed of light so the speed of light in Larson system is 1 1 over 1 equal 1 and that uh as you know about reciprocals is the center so whereas Legacy science takes zero motion as the center uh larsson&#x27;s Universe of motion presumes uh a motion outward at the speed of light in all directions as the zero point or the neutral point of the universe meaning that half the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light which Larson refers to as the cosmic sector and half moving slower is than the speed of light which is the material sector um and uh they are divided by the unit speed boundary and really there are two other boundaries in the universe as well a unit space boundary and a unit time boundary the unit space boundary is within the uh material sector and the unit time bound boundary is within the cosmic sector if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you don&#x27;t have space and so if you don&#x27;t have space you only have time because the universe is composed of space and time only in motion and so uh Larson refers to these as the time region and the space region respectively and within each one of those units you have uh within the space region you have uh the interactions that take place within a unit of space if they are within a unit of space they occur only in time and so this is the realm of the uh atom and the uh the chemical compounds molecules small areas less than one unit of space which is 4.56 * 10us is 8 m and um when you cross the unit speed boundary just like when you cross the um unit SP uh speed boundary you um reverse the rules reverse the order of space and time reverse the directions of space and time um then the other uh part about the reciprocal system is the uh uh three-dimensionality Larson observed three-dimensionality of space XYZ coordinates in a still frame here in the material sector and uh he extrapolated uh the same for time because reciprocals are identical to each other they have the same qualities but just in a different order and so um he uh presumed that there is an a threedimensional ity to time as well he calls this coordinate space and coordinate time in the COS in the material sector you have um you have coordinate space and then you have clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but in no specific Direction like a scalar motion but in you when you cross the unit speed boundary you move into the realm of the cosmic C vector and you have relationships based on coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart just like on an expanding balloon uh so a scalar motion okay now um let me just uh quote you the U postulate just so you uh the univers is composed entire ly of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and then the second postulate is not as important and um I think we&#x27;ll just leave it off here for today but it is that um the Universe um conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian okay now we&#x27;re going to get into this uh discussion on uh the solid cohesion uh solid cohesion is um something from the time region so it is an atomic phenomena it&#x27;s uh has to do with um with the progression uh because with within the time region the progression moves everything toward each other and gravitation moves everything apart from each other because you have to reverse the directions when you cross that boundary and so there is an equilibrium that is established between the two uh as as you know two atoms approach each other um you know within a unit of space they find an equilibrium distance uh that balances out the progression and gravitation the progression which moves them inward the gravitation that moves them outward um and he Larson calls that the interatomic distance and um if there is a force that moves uh that aids gravitation and moves them further apart there is a force of cohesion that resists that uh that force uh so or what Larson calls an as if Force so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s looking at in this chapter uh he just kind of went through a lot of the uh History of Science on this and was talking about how uh the basic uh the scientist uh the Legacy Sciences theory on this is the electronic theory of matter where you know matter holds together because of uh chemical bonding and um electronic forces you know positive and negative um attraction and Larson says that that&#x27;s it doesn&#x27;t cut it because uh it only applies to a small amount of compounds um most of them are nonionic and even if they were uh you would have to have two different forces forces not just one to establish an equilibrium there would have to be a force of attraction and a force of repulsion which is built right into his system and which also um he applies to many other things in the universe not just this one so you know he characterizes the Legacy Sciences approach as adhoc because they&#x27;re just kind of making up stuff for one specific uh pigeon hole um you know area of their science whereas Larson is using a generalized Theory and the progression and gravitation fit in perfectly in his the in this Theory but they also fit in perfectly in many other applications okay so we&#x27;ll start it right here as indicated in the original discussion of gravitation even though the various Aggregates of matter do not actually exert gravitational forces on each other the observable results of their gravitational motions are identical with those that would be produced if such forces did exist the same is true of the results of the progression of the natural reference system there is a considerable element of convenience in expressing these results in terms of force on a as on an as if basis and this practice has already been followed to some extent in the previous volume that was his earlier volume called Nothing But motion which is on Atomic physics mostly now that we are ready to begin a quantitative evaluation of the interatomic relations however it is desirable to make it clear that the force concept is being used only for convenience although the quantitative discussion that follows like the earlier qualitative discussion will be carried on in terms of forces what we will actually be dealing with are the Inward and outward motions of each individual atom while the items that have been mentioned add up to a very impressive case in favor of the new theory of cohesion the strongest confirmation of its validity comes from its ability to locate the point of equilibrium that is to give us specific values of the interatomic distances as will be demonstrated in Chapter 2 we are already Able by means of the newly established relations to calculate the possible values of the interatomic distance for most of the simpler substances and there do not appear to be be any serious obstacles in the way of extending the calculation to more complex substances whenever the necessary time and effort can be applied to the task and it would probably help Larsson if you had had a computer or even a calculator to to do most of the work but he was using a slide rule most of the time furthermore this ability to determine the location of the point of equilibrium is not limited to the simple situation where only the two basic forces are involved chapters four and five will show that the same general principles can also be applied in an evaluation of the changes in the equilibrium distance that result from the application of heat or pressure to the solid aggregate although as stated in volume one the true magnitude of a unit of space is the same everywhere the effective magnitude of a spatial unit in the time region is reduced by the inter Regional ratio um I did do a uh an episode on his paper on the inter Regional ratio um it&#x27;s uh seems to be kind of uh ad hoc but he uses it it um in every application that he needs to use it um it is convenient to regard this reduced value a fraction 1 over 15644 uh really that&#x27;s 9 over 1408 of the natural unit as the time region unit of space okay it is convenient to regard this reduced value 15644 of the natural unit as the time region unit of space the effective portion of a Time region phenomenon May extend into one or more additional units in which case the measured distance will exceed the time region unit or the original single unit may not be fully effective in which case the measured distance will be less than the time region unit so anytime basically the interatomic distance is what gets lost in the translation so when you&#x27;re peering across a uh into uh a unit boundary when you&#x27;re peering across a unit boundary into another region like into the time region what you see is not what you get um well maybe that&#x27;s not phrased right what you see is not what&#x27;s really there you&#x27;re only seeing a fraction of what is really there because there&#x27;s something lost in the translation it&#x27;s kind of like looking at the sun if you look at the sun you only see the surface of the Sun you don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s inside you don&#x27;t see the interior of the sun you just see a fraction of the body like what&#x27;s on the surface and it&#x27;s kind of like that I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a great analogy or or what but um so every time that you look into the time region you have to take what you see and divide it by 15644 uh that&#x27;s the number that that you and he derived it in the uh episode that I uh did on on the paper that he did um basically it&#x27;s uh 128 two to the two to the uh 7th power time 11 over9 and [Music] um hard to explain you know how he got that number without further uh understanding of the reciprocal system the reciprocal system is very difficult uh like I said for Larson to teach because there&#x27;s so much kind of background that you have to understand uh that is unfamiliar because you&#x27;re indoctrinated into a different system and so everything sounds uh it&#x27;s very clunky um I think that&#x27;s why um it hasn&#x27;t hasn&#x27;t ever gotten off the ground uh not because it doesn&#x27;t work and not because it&#x27;s not effective but because it&#x27;s too hard to explain um you know because there&#x27;s so much background uh and uh it all makes sense when you finally do get it but it&#x27;s difficult to get there that&#x27;s why I I would like to be working on a textbook for the reciprocal system where everything is laid out for you on a silver platter just like little boxes on the side to explain the inter Regional ratio and give you all the sources that you need for that and a little area here to explain the as if Force you know of gravitation and the progression and what is scalar motion and what is the time region and what is the space region how do you determine the uh unit distance and the unit time and so on and so forth um I think there is a way to teach the reciprocal system but it is uh it&#x27;s definitely a difficult undertaking um you know just here I mean I&#x27;ve read two pages of this book um and how many different uh culde acts did it go down that you have to kind of explain where this came from um so Larson definitely had his work cut out for him um not only in deriving the theory but then explaining it is even harder okay um so the um thus the interatomic equilibrium may be reached either inside or outside the time region unit of distance okay so the time region unit of distance is uh a unit of space divided by the uh inter Regional ratio uh another thing that Larson Larson probably could use uh some more sexy terminology um you know you&#x27;ve you got to remember the interatomic distance and the inter Regional ratio you know and the unit uh time region unit of space and [Music] um you know there&#x27;s just all this kind of very dry terminology and you can trip yourself over them if if Larsson would maybe come up with just would he if he would have come up with just one word to describe these different phenomena that might be a step in the right direction too instead of just calling it The Inter Regional ratio you know just just calling it uh you know the Q Ratio or something okay um the interatomic equilibrium may be reached either inside or outside the time region unit of distance depending on where the outward rotational for forces reach equality with the inward force of the progression of the natural reference system extension of the interatomic distance Beyond onetime region unit does not take the equilibrium system out of the time region as the boundary of that region is at one full sized natural unit of distance not at one time region unit so far as the interatomic force equilibrium is concerned therefore the time region unit of distance does not represent present any kind of a critical magnitude okay well I believe that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re going to stop you know uh I would like to you know move uh faster through this but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s really possible uh to uh do that with a kind of a a freestanding video like you you have to kind of cover the background information as well as move forward and um I don&#x27;t mind uh rearticulating how the reciprocal system works over and over again because I believe that even a good student of the reciprocal system kind of needs to hear it repeatedly it needs to hear it over and over again the the basic uh fundamental postulates of the reciprocal system and what they mean but then um you know that takes a while and then it takes a while to kind of backtrack about what he&#x27;s saying and then move forward on what he&#x27;s going to say um so it&#x27;s a difficult uh pedagogical problem and um but I think that it&#x27;s just better to move slowly through this because I think that even if you watch every one of my videos you can get something new out of each one of them um even if it appears that I&#x27;m are you know rearticulating the same thing I&#x27;m saying them in a slightly different way each time and so I think you can always get a new nugget of uh information a new piece in the puzzle from each episode and um you know to a great extent the uh understanding of the reciprocal system is like uh putting together a puzzle and it is like you have to get one clue at a time and it&#x27;s not all going to be there for you but then when it the when the puzzle starts to fill up you kind of start to see the bigger picture okay we will uh we&#x27;ll pick up where we left off uh tomorrow and uh move forward uh in our slow way and um thanks for tuning in today have</p>
