            <p>[Music] what&#x27;s up humans and welcome to a newo so on Monday journalist Michael shellenberger released an article that many considered to be a bombshell I still have my doubts I&#x27;m very very highly skeptical but uh essentially the gist of it is that he spoke to a a new whistleblower that&#x27;s what he calls him uh they we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a a woman or man uh we don&#x27;t know their name or anything like that but shellenberger released a term called Immaculate constellation which is the name of this alleged saap special Access program that is unag Ed shellenberger says he claims that this sap um was uh inaugurated in 2017 right after the article from The New York Times he says also that this program has all the material uh photographic video documents that is the smoking gong of UAP disclosure he claims that uh this program has all the goods that uh this control disclosure movement has been looking for for a while and um there are a couple of quotes that I got to show you guys it says the whistleblowers report includes seven categories of evidence it describes in detail various UAP sightings collected by technical assets and US military personnel and I quote the multitude of wavelengths collected by these sensors have captured UAP characteristics that are difficult or impossible to observe with the human eye alone subtle atmospheric effects associated with UAP are also visible through the sensors employed by the US Military and intelligence agencies the verifiable chain of custody for UAP IMT quality imagery intelligence collected by US military assets the person wrote ensures a high level of confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the data gathered get a little of this the report concludes that the exist existence of Immaculate constellation demonstrates an extent capability to detect quarantine transfer UAP and arv alien reproduction vehicle collection incidents before they are observed and circulated within the military intelligence Enterprise thus serving as a means of enforcing internal information security a former IC official confirmed to public the existence of Immaculate constellation that program is run out of secdef office of the Secretary of Defense the person said they don&#x27;t want to acknowledge it&#x27;s real the same person warned that simply printing the name Immaculate constellation could trigger government surveillance under the foreign intelligence surveillance Act of whoever publishes it they won&#x27;t comment on it the red flags that I see here are very specific so let&#x27;s begin with the one that I was giving a lot of um Flack about which is I am trying to report in this but people who don&#x27;t believe any of the people from the control disclosure movement Alando grush uh shellenberger Ross coldheart uh blumthal Leslie Kane all of these people they go at me telling me that I shouldn&#x27;t trust them the reality is that trusting anybody in this field is really really difficult because anybody could be lying really uh we don&#x27;t know about the intentions of people who are like telling you stuff about UFOs but then they publish books with the permission of the dod or when grush was testifying he kept saying that he didn&#x27;t have permission to say something from the dod the this means that it is controlled by the powers that be so whenever any information about this comes out I understand anybody who questions it but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m not going to report on it so I&#x27;m sorry but I have to report on this even though it may be also possible that none of it is true uh and we&#x27;re dealing with something different from what they trying to report on or push having said that I think that shellenberger has a good track record he uh doesn&#x27;t only do UFO stuff he does a lot of different uh aspects of the um world occurrences like world news and I have a lot of respect for him to be honest with you because he&#x27;s done a lot of great work I even said that if this article is true about Immaculate constellation if this sap exists this could potentially get shellenberger a lot of awards because it is one of the most dangerous potentially uh pieces of of uh written media that I&#x27;ve seen in a while if it&#x27;s true because he&#x27;s risking a lot um he&#x27;s already being surveilled uh if this is true uh more than likely so there&#x27;s that another red flag that I saw was that shellenberger mentions arv which is alien rep production vehicles um there is a documentary that got me into this topic initially from director James Allen who when he was finishing the documentary he was editing it he got a one of the most um aggressive forms of cancer that um I remember it affected all of his organs and it killed him in a matter of months I don&#x27;t remember if he managed to see the finished product but the documentary is called Z point the story of Mark mandish and the flux liner what is a flock liner you ask that is essentially an alien reproduction vehicle it is the story of a sketch artist from aerospace companies uh Aerospace magazine companies uh his name is Mark mccandlish and he spoke to Dr Greer and other people who were documenting his story about one of his co-workers who visited an air show that he missed just at a chance where he was presented uh with a vehicle that was hovering above the ground and there were three three vehicles one was really big the other one was not that not that big and the other one was for like two people and this is the classic um arv rendition that mandish has uh promoted in many of uh Dr Steven Greer&#x27;s uh documentaries and interviews uh it is the same and it raised the red flag from a lot of people because this term arv is known as a term that Dr Steven Greer uses quite a bit and we already know what a lot of people feel about Dr Greer he&#x27;s a polarizing figure to say the least I know that uh he is very controversial and I get why people are instantly skeptical about the mandish story but I do got to say uh whoever says that they&#x27;re skeptical about the mandish story not about Greer if it&#x27;s not just because he&#x27;s linked to Dr Greer would you be equally skeptical or less skeptical I would love to know what makes you skeptical in the first place the fact that he&#x27;s not a um firstand account he&#x27;s not he&#x27;s a secondhand account but he did die under him mysterious circumstances and his story does tie up to a lot of stories of many scientists who either disappeared or were killed under mysterious circumstances I as you guys know have been following the hako Greenberg story for a while and he also disappeared under mysterious circumstances when someone is getting a little bit too close to something whether it&#x27;s a truth or a scientific breakthrough I don&#x27;t know but it is weird how some people die some people disappear don&#x27;t you think so what makes you skeptical exactly I would love to know because this story I think it&#x27;s compelling and the fact that shellenberger is already using this term I want to know why who&#x27;s he talking to is this one of Dr Greer&#x27;s people would be nice to know I did here that um The Whistleblower was Legit by uh at least a couple of sources were close to this but then again we go back to what I was talking about earlier about uh this story still having many holes and many inconsistencies the control disclosure story so it makes you wonder and question everyone and everything and I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t mean to um go against the narrative or whatever but I think it&#x27;s fair to just question some of the inconsistencies don&#x27;t you think so what makes you skeptical about this particular um report so here is uh Ross cart with Michael shellenberger and a couple of Clips uh where he talks about the article the sap Immaculate constellation and an encounter that an F-22 had that is also reported in this which is also new to me so here it is a new whistleblower has come forward with a written report that this person has shared with some members of Congress and with me and the report is quite extraordinary it says that there is an unacknowledged special access program called Immaculate constellation which is the parent program is the language used for exactly what you said UAP crash retrieval uh reverse engineering and apparently a very large database of high quality photographs videos infrared videos uh apparently much more sophisticated documentation of many more UAP encounters than have been released and so without the article is really about the allegation that this program exists and that it has been withheld from Congress illegally I think it&#x27;s important for viewers to understand that the first article of the United States Constitution requires congressional oversight of all of the activities of the executive branch of the United States government so whether or not you think there are extr terrestrials or non-human intelligence or anything even if you think that all of this is just some sort of advanced craft the allegation here by a new whistleblower verified by other sources in a position to know is that uh the Pentagon has the defense department has has withheld kept secret this information from Congress which is a violation of the Constitution and illegal so I think that what we&#x27;re looking at here is really a story about the abuse of power including in Potential disinformation from the Pentagon just as much as it is this large this other question of what exactly are people seeing in uaps let&#x27;s get into the nitty-gritty some of the detail that you do reveal in your report and there is as you&#x27;ve already acknowledged a little bit earlier an absolutely incredible incident involving an F-22 Raptor which is the top Frontline fighter jet in the United States military Arsenal and it describes orbs surrounding and forcing an F-22 out of a patrol area the F-22 broke trajectory and attempted to evade but was intercepted and Boxed In by approximately three to six uaps now the thing about that Michael is I often cop it from some viewers who are very much of the rosy view about non-human intelligence that they&#x27;re all benevolent and kind what you seem to be describing here is something where at the very least a UAP or a group of uaps are essentially trying to behave like an adversary they&#x27;re boxing in a fighter jet what&#x27;s going on what does the um whistleblower think about that finding and what conclusion did you reach on the basis of the evidence that you read in the report yeah I mean the the first thing I mean so again I I want to stress I&#x27;m new to this I have uh you know beginner mind on this issue I me it&#x27;s it&#x27;s I not by any means an expert on it or a military expert so with those caveats out of the way I mean the first most obvious thing you&#x27;re struck by with that particular case is that this technology or form of life or whatever it is adversary is demon ating dominance I mean that just the most simple the most simple basic thing is that there&#x27;s somebody in in if there&#x27;s an interaction uh you know it can be cooperative or among equals or it can be hierarchical and there&#x27;s dominance by a by a greater power and in this case that those craft or phenomena or whatever are demonstrating dominance and that does have to do with that Tick Tock incident that uh the Navy Pilots descri I mean um I think you could argue that it wasn&#x27;t um not necessarily we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s say hostile and another words nobody was shot down and there&#x27;s no evidence that anybody was harmed but dominance is about power and about a demonstration of capabilities and so clearly in that case and there are other cases in that in that report which again I hope is made public um yeah these are phenomenon showing dominance it&#x27;s not showing uh you know benevolent space Brotherhood it&#x27;s it&#x27;s demonstrating dominance at a just at a very basic physical level you don&#x27;t need to do a lot of interpretation to see that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on so in the in the report you actually describe how one UAP maneuvered very close to the jet to the starboard of the cockpit and it established a rigid spatial relationship with the F-22 so that when the jet was rolling and Diving and trying to get away from object it stayed fixed that&#x27;s what I find fascinating whatever the technology is Behind These objects what they were able to do was track exactly what the F-22 was doing it couldn&#x27;t shake it amazing I mean it it&#x27;s I mean one I think yeah anybody that knows some of the history of this it sounds a lot like Foo Fighters you know from World War II these similar orbs I mean orbs are very a common UAP but yeah um not uh because I think another important piece of context is that and I I describe and okay so what do you guys think about this um Ros was very quick to um report on this with this interview kudos to Ross he was already on it why that name that name is kind of weird has like a little religious even connotation to it and if you guys remember the name zodiac which I already talked about that George snap confirmed that it it is a name that is talked about in uh closed circles it&#x27;s all constellations so I don&#x27;t know if zodiac no longer exists maybe this is the new name so let me know what you guys think about this report from Michael do you believe it do you not believe it at all let me know everything you think about this and what the reaction from this has been and what do you think about the ARB stuff alien reproduction vehicle what do you think about the term and the fact that shellenberger just used it in his article let me know in the comments if you like the content you see you can like share comment subscribe and hit the Bell notification so you can get notified when a new video drops let me know I want to know everything I&#x27;ll be talking to y&#x27;all in the comment section and I&#x27;ll see you guys until tomorrow&#x27;s video bye-bye [Music]</p>
