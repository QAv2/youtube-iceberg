            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this uh channel is for the purposes of education and um we generally look at theories of everything all-encompassing theories uh Paradigm shifters um obscure and esoteric um cosmologies and philosophies that uh can help you become more well-rounded and uh more grounded and today is our 3502 video on dwey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory and the reciprocal system of theory was originally uh originated ated in about 1930 by dwey B Larson he eventually uh wrote up his two fundamental postulates in the late 1950s and from there took his postulates and through a process of deduction uh derived a theoretical Universe how everything would look if his postulates were true and then he took his theoretical unit universe and he kind of uh you in his books he compared his theoretical Universe with that of the Legacy scientists and the results were you know similar to um you know maybe the 20th century early 20th century Legacy science where they uh basically affirmed uh everything that Newton had said except for uh the so-called relativistic areas the areas of the very small the very fast and the very large and in those areas the new Newtonian mechanics broke down and Einstein stepped in and provided these relativistic equations and and philosophies um to uh bridge the gap but uh so Larson kind of does the same thing but he Bridges the Gap in a much more convincing manner than Einstein and a much more holistic and conceptually based Einstein a lot of times just he he can give you some math that he borrowed from somebody else but um he doesn&#x27;t tell you why these things uh happen why he&#x27;s imposing these equations on this a particular uh circumstance Larson is providing uh in some cases the same math but he&#x27;s providing the underlying Concepts because he&#x27;s dealing with a universal theory that you can apply to anything and that&#x27;s why it calls it the reciprocal system of theory it&#x27;s a system if you know how the system works then you can apply it to whatever subject you like you know if you are uh you know uh you&#x27;re a chef you can apply it to the reciprocal system of you know chicken catori or whatever you know you can you can apply the reciprocal system to any subject and come up with fruitful answers so uh we are uh let me just basically say that the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe made out of motion not matter and not energy not force but motion in fact uh eal mc^2 Einstein&#x27;s equation uh energy equals matter time the speed of light squared uh shows you that well energy can be converted into matter and vice versa uh if that&#x27;s the case then that means U that by definition neither one of those things can be the most fundamental thing in the universe if one can be converted to another there must be something that underlies both of those things and uh you might want to instead look at the C squ part that is the speed of light squared that is much closer cler to uh the composition of the universe uh which Larson said says is motion in particular uh it&#x27;s what you would call a scalar motion that&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction and uh that can be visualized using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but in no particular direction and if you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other but in no specific Direction and the Hubble telescope discovered that all of the distant galaxies are also moving away from each other but in no specific Direction and um Larson calls that clock time and clock space the clock is also another example of a motion that is uh lacking Direction um the clock is always getting later and later and later but in no specific direction that is a scalar motion and uh clock space uh to uh go along with clock time well first let me just say that motion in Larson&#x27;s formulation is the relationship between space and time so that sets up a reciprocal relationship between space and time hence the reciprocal system of theory and that space and time don&#x27;t really exist independently they only exist together in motion motion is really a fraction with time or space as the numerator space or time as the denominator and um such as speed speed is space over time the I drove the car at 14 mil hour 14 miles of space and 1 hour of time space over time uh and all other scientific quantities are likewise relationships between space and time and as reciprocals of one another space and time both have the same qualities and so if we&#x27;ve got this clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later then we&#x27;re also going to have what LaRon calls clock space and that is uh a motion that is a scalar Motion in space which uh you know can be modeled using this uh balloon with dots on it if you want you could uh add another dimension and you could use something like raisin bread uh that you put in the oven as the bread Rises all the raisins are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction um and uh lson refers to that as clock space the space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and then there is what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time this is three dimensions of space and three dimensions of time XYZ coordinates in space and uh possibly something more like I JK coordinates in time and um this is a uh kind of a specialized case of uh space and time which occurs within a gravitationally bound system and then we have also that time and space come in only discrete units there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space uh you if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have anything you have to have a full unit of space or time before you have that that entity and uh those are very small but they are still significant uh you have to have a uh 4.56 * 10us 8 m uh which is like 1 500,000 of an inch and then uh for time you have 1.52 * 10 the- 16 seconds which is 1 um 6576 quadrillionth uh of a second so very small but nonetheless you have to have a full unit uh of time or space before you have that entity now if you have one unit of space in one unit of time one over one uh space over time which we remember we uh said was speed then you have the speed of light speed of light is 1 over 1 equals 1 Larson calls the speed of light unit speed and that is the um background of this universe this is what he calls the zero point or the state of rest of the universe of motion is outward Motion in all directions at the speed of light so that also gives more Credence to this eal mc² kind of idea that uh the fact that energy can be converted into matter and vice versa uh eliminates both of those things as being the fundamental thing but uh sheds light on the c squared part this this the uh speed of light as being uh more fundamental and uh in a universe of motion it makes sense that motion is the fundamental thing that is there before everything else and um so that speed of light is the background or the reference uh datum and um it also means that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light as well as half that&#x27;s moving slower the Legacy scientists only understood the half that&#x27;s moving slower Einstein himself said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the Universe um whereas in Larson&#x27;s formulation is the midpoint of the universe and H an entire half the universe is uh defying Einstein&#x27;s dictum and uh fortunately the relationship between the two halves of the universe which Larson refers to as the material sector slower than the speed of light and the cosmic sector faster than the speed of light is a reciprocal relationship so if we know uh which we claim to do uh to know about what&#x27;s going on in the material sector then we automatically also know what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector because is is reciprocal all we have to do is reverse the roles of space and time so in the material sector you&#x27;ve got coordinate space and you have clock time but in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and clock space and it goes on from there but basically those are that&#x27;s Larson&#x27;s first postulate his second postulate is that the Universe conforms to to the relationships of ordinary commutative mathematics its uh primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian now we went through an article last week talking about uh a revision of uh those two postulates especially the second one where projective geometry was plugged in instead of um ukian geometry as ukian geometry is just the subset of projective geometry uh and a few other words were tweaked um and that was an article that was uh done by Dr Bruce pet uh who is one of the main revisers of Larson&#x27;s after larsson&#x27;s death in 1990 uh pet came on on the scene and um I think did a great job of uh really being in the spirit Spirit of larsson&#x27;s reciprocal system but at the same time um um updating and uh you know making strategic changes to the reciprocal system that allowed it to be a little bit more [Music] um stand stand the test of time uh Larson admitted that he could uh he was fallible that he he would that he was subject to error uh he believed that the postulates themselves were correct but that you know his application his derivations may be incorrect and so uh Bruce pet has about nine articles here that he calls rs2 reciprocal system 2 or the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system and he numbers them 101 102 103 and and today we&#x27;re about to start number 106 which is called dimensions and displacements okay uh we&#x27;ll get started with this it probably take us two or three days to get through it in the reciprocal system everything is based on scalar motion which is simply a ratio of some magnitude of space to some magnitude of time this ratio constitutes a dimension of motion where there are three possible States uh which he calls orientations in a different context the three possible states are unity where the magnitudes of the aspects of space and time are equal this is the default condition of a dimension of motion which Larson refers to as the progression of the natural reference system so this is the 1 over 1 equals 1 idea of the speed of light if you have one unit of space and you have one unit of time then you have unity and he&#x27;s it&#x27;s right here he says where the magnitudes of the aspects of space and time are equal at that place space and time both equal one one unit and um so this is the speed of light which Larsson refers to as the progression of the natural reference System since unit motion equates to the speed of light the default motion of the universe is outward at unit speed in other words words everything in the universe wants to fly apart from everything else at the speed of light just for the heck of it no energy required okay now that is the first orientation of the uh ratio between space and time now then the other two are when space and time are not equal so obviously one of them is going to be where space is greater than time and the other one is going to be where time is greater than space so uh we&#x27;ll go to those right now speed where the temporal magnitude the time magnitude is larger than the spatial magnitude results in motion that is less than Unity speed forms our conventional frame of reference where everything is moving at sublight speeds Larson uses the ratio of space over time to represent speed which is the conventional way to represent velocity to move some amount of space per some amount of time now the only difference between space and velocity is that uh speed and velocity is that speed is a scalar motion with no um Direction attached to it energy is the third option where the spatial magnitude is larger than the temporal magnitude results in a motion that is greater than Unity greater than unit speed greater than the speed of light Larson uses the ratio of time over space to represent energy which is the conventional concept of mechanical work how much time does it take to move something a specific distance so that&#x27;s energy time over space it took me 2 hours to move that thing one mile two hours of time and one hour of space time over space energy over Unity faster than light speeds are not directly observable so this energy uh this Co from the cosmic sector faster than light speeds are not directly observable from our conventional reference system this is our stationary reference system where we are uh positing that something is actually not moving but we can observe how energy changes space through the use of a device known as force fields these lines of force are the lines of energy per unit distance time over space per distance so time over space to the second power time over space over space so that is force force is time over space to the second power and um you can kind of think of these force fields in terms of your balloon analogy uh so you&#x27;re blowing up the balloon and all the dots move away from each other when you suck in the balloon all the dots move toward each other but in no specific Direction because they&#x27;re um all moving toward each other toward each other and so you know there&#x27;s no specific Direction assigned to that until you arbitrarily choose a reference point um I&#x27;d like to also point out that the not only are the points the dots on the balloon Mo moving toward each other but even the spaces between the dots are also moving toward each other um but at a certain point you can arbitrarily decide that okay one of these points I&#x27;m going to say is not moving this is my reference point this is what is not moving and then voila you have distances then uh you I mean you have directions then you can determine okay this dot is moving in this direction toward me this dot is moving in this direction toward me and that that straight line direction from one dot to another is analogous to uh what he&#x27;s talking about here with the force fields it appears as if there is a force field between the two dots because they&#x27;re moving toward each other but there isn&#x27;t um it&#x27;s only the result of assigning a reference system so the scalar motion itself does not bring out a u a force field the force field is a fiction uh which is the result of you fixating a reference point uh an arbitrarily motionless point because that dot that you&#x27;re choosing as the reference point is actually in motion toward all the other dots but you&#x27;re you&#x27;re negating that and you&#x27;re just saying No this this dot is motionless and so then all of a sudden all of the other dots are moving toward that dot and it appears as if there&#x27;s like some kind of force field that is U bringing about that motion but that is a fiction okay so um when a dimension is at Unity nothing manifests as it is equivalent to the expansion of the cosmos at the speed of light in our conventional reference system the first unit of motion is speed creating a material structure such as a particle or atom the first unit of motion can also be energy which also creates an inverse particle or atom that Larson calls Cosmic matter uh which is conventionally called antimatter so in the material sector you have atoms particles atoms and molecules in the cosmic sector you have Cosmic particles atoms and molecules or what conventional science calls antimatter this difference between speed space over time and energy time over space defines the two sector approach of the reciprocal system the material sector which contains speed space over time reference to clock time so clock time is the reference there in the material sector so you have basically coordinate space and clock time and the cosmic sector uh which contains energy time over space referenced to clock space okay I think we&#x27;re going to stop right there uh and then we will take over tomorrow with uh the section that starts uh number of Dimensions so we just kind of defined here this First Dimension um you know uh when Dimension is at Unity nothing manifests um if in a universe of motion the first the first unit of motion is speed and uh in the material sector and energy in the cosmic sector and so um he&#x27;s going to talk about Dimensions here one thing that we have to keep clear is there&#x27;s really uh in the reciprocal systems kind of two different kinds of Dimensions there are dimensions of motion and uh there are dimensions of scalar motion um it takes three or really dimensions of space like coordinate space and then dimensions of motion or dimensions of scalar motion it takes three dimensions of space to Define one dimension of scalar motion so that is uh a sticking point that uh it takes a while to overcome or to you know surmount is that you have dimensions of space like coordinate space three dimensions of space but it it requires three dimensions of space just to Define one dimension of scalar motion so use that uh analogy of the balloon expanding balloon again the the expanding balloon occupies three dimensions of space but that is just one dimension of uh of motion that is you know space is always getting farther and farther and farther part and um we really are only able to observe one dimension of scalar motion at a time um so we are bound kind of in that reference system but there are two other scalar Dimensions that we can perceive uh in a limited way okay we&#x27;ll get into that uh starting tomorrow um in the meantime thanks for tuning in and uh have a great day</p>
