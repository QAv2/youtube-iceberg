            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Okay, so apparently we&#x27;ve got a huge announcement from Trump thanks to my interview with Barack Obama just a few days ago. Trump just posted on Truth Social, quote, &quot;Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War and other relevant departments and agencies to begin the process of identifying and releasing government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena, UAP, and unidentified flying objects, UFOs, and any and all other information connected to these highly complex but extremely interesting and important matters. God bless America. Let me just say that I dealt with god knows how many people telling me that I made a generational fumble massive mistake by not asking Obama a follow-up to this question. Are aliens real? &gt;&gt; Uh they&#x27;re real, but I haven&#x27;t seen them.</p>
<p>And and and uh they&#x27;re not being kept in uh what is it? &gt;&gt; Area 51. &gt;&gt; Area 51. there there&#x27;s no underground uh facility unless there&#x27;s this enormous conspiracy and they they hid it from the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; But here&#x27;s the reality. Had I asked Obama the follow-up question, he would have said what he said in his clarification, which is that he believes aliens are real by virtue of the sheer size of the solar system, but hasn&#x27;t seen them, and there&#x27;s no evidence that the US government has either.</p>
<p>And then that would have been it, asked and answered. The fact that I didn&#x27;t ask a follow-up meant that it was an open question, which meant that the discourse could truly thrive in that vacuum of a clear answer. And now we&#x27;re going to see the truth about aliens and UAPs and UFOs expressly because I didn&#x27;t ask a follow-up and this thing took on a life of its own. So, am I going to take credit for being responsible for people knowing the truth about aliens and UFOs and UAPs with no modesty at all? Yes, I am. And this announcement came in the aftermath of Trump saying this just this morning when asked about the same topic.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Something that got a lot of attention this week. Barack Obama said that aliens are real. Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to Earth? &gt;&gt; Well, he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that, you know. &gt;&gt; So, aliens are real.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that. He made He made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information.</p>
<p>No, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, Peter? &gt;&gt; Well, the president can declassify anything that he wants to.</p>
<p>So, &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll get him out of trouble. I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. &gt;&gt; We know illegal aliens. I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Illegal. Only illegals. &gt;&gt; What have I done? Okay, let me just say if my speedrun question in the 44th minute of a 47 minute episode results in a prosecution attempt against President Barack Obama, I&#x27;m not sure how I continue on after that. Now, in terms of Trump&#x27;s response, he says that Obama revealed classified information. What Obama actually revealed was his belief that aliens are real, but that he has no tangible information to back that up, that he hasn&#x27;t seen them, and that if they were here, it would be a conspiracy so vast that even the president of the United States wouldn&#x27;t know about it.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s his words. In other words, Obama has plausible deniability based on what he said. But when Trump says that Obama revealed classified information, he is in effect saying that they are real and that it&#x27;s classified and that Obama exposed it. In other words, Obama didn&#x27;t actually reveal anything, but Trump inadvertently revealed the thing that he blames Obama for revealing. And that&#x27;s a point, by the way, that even Fox News picked up on.</p>
<p>So, at least one Hill Republican tonight is telling me that he is reading this as the president all but confirming what Barack Obama said that aliens are indeed real. Uh, so we followed up with the White House here. We asked them several questions. We wanted to know what part of Barack Obama&#x27;s comments did they feel did the president feel were classified? Was it the part where he says that he believes in aliens or was it the part that they were not in Area 51? They were also asked if uh the DOJ was going to look into these comments uh perhaps uh because they were classified. The White House told us there&#x27;s nothing to add to the president&#x27;s comments tonight.</p>
<p>Brett, all of this comes as the president&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Laura Trump, told a podcast this week that the president has a speech prepared about extraterrestrial life that he will give at the right time. Listen, we&#x27;ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this. We all want to know about the UFOs, right? We all want to know what&#x27;s going on. And he played a little koi with us. I have just heard kind of around that.</p>
<p>I think he&#x27;s actually said, I think my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has that I guess at at the right time, and I don&#x27;t know when the right time is, he&#x27;s going to break out and and talk about and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life. And Brett, the White House press secretary Caroline Levit, you&#x27;ll remember this week, um was asked about Lara Trump&#x27;s comments and she said a speech on aliens would be news to me, but we are expecting more reaction from the Hill in the coming hours and days. Brett, &gt;&gt; and look, to be clear, I think Obama was joking and I think or hope Trump is joking, but it&#x27;s also worth noting that Trump has tried prosecuting his enemies for much less. This guy&#x27;s entire presidency is littered with attempts to go after his political opponents. He did it to James Comey, Leticia James, Tim Wall, Jacob Fry, a group of Democrats, including Mark Kelly who dared acknowledge what the Uniform Code of Military Justice says.</p>
<p>And granted, while none of these prosecutions went anywhere, that&#x27;s not to say that Trump still didn&#x27;t try. And so, the notion that he wouldn&#x27;t try with Obama is certainly not off the table. Although, even I think that trying to prosecute the most popular political figure in the world would be dumb even by Trump standards. Also, it is not lost on me the irony of Trump claiming that Obama is the one spilling classified information. Trump was quite literally indicted for taking classified documents from the White House, refusing to return them when asked by the National Archives and ultimately requiring a judge to approve a search warrant to be executed at Mara Lago.</p>
<p>And thanks to Judge Ailen Cannon, he got away with it. Of course, never held to account. And yet now this guy has the audacity to claim that his red line is recklessness with classified documents. If Donald Trump was any less self-aware, he wouldn&#x27;t be able to see his own reflection in the mirror. I spoke with Obama&#x27;s National Security Council spokesman and co-host of POS of America, Tommy Vtor, about this exact point.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what Tommy had to say. So that was Donald Trump saying that Barack Obama spilled classified information by uh affirming the existence of aliens. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do we think that&#x27;s what happened here? &gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t think it was what happened until Trump said that it was classified information. The craziest part is it again like the internet was split as to whether Obama really, you know, was offering up some some the scoop of the century by talking about aliens.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But but there was always like a a real healthy degree of plausible deniability. But when Trump comes out and he says Obama just revealed classified information, there&#x27;s no ambiguity there. He is saying that that is that that is not only real but classified. &gt;&gt; Do you think you&#x27;ll be called to testify? &gt;&gt; I I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m not &gt;&gt; what can you imagine? Just &gt;&gt; you&#x27;re sitting in court in like 3 years. You&#x27;re like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &gt;&gt; Do you know the crazy thing is that isn&#x27;t even the most far-fetched thing I could think of right now.</p>
<p>I get hauled into a courtroom to testify on behalf of Barack Obama, who&#x27;s being prosecuted for spilling state secrets about the existence of aliens in the speed round of my podcast. &gt;&gt; It would be memorable. &gt;&gt; It would be memorable. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a good story for your second book. &gt;&gt; Also, one last point, while I have a captive audience, while talking about aliens is fun, I have to say, if you have the resources to release the Alien Files, guess what else you have the resources to release? We can walk and chew gum at the same time.</p>
<p>We will not forget about the Epstein files. We will not stop talking about the Epstein files and we will not allow ourselves to be distracted with any other files. Donald Trump is engaged in the biggest government cover up in US history and we have every intention of making sure that it&#x27;s exposed and no amount of distractions notwithstanding how otherworldly they are going to stop us from getting the information that we are owed.

<p>But second, the reality is that we are now in a political environment where this administration can lean on any of the social media platforms to suppress certain voices if they don&#x27;t like critical coverage. That means my longevity here is in the hands of a few tech billionaires who are already making it clear that they are willing to cater to this administration.
