            <p>software to die for the promise software scandal and how the u.s justice department became software pirates in the name of national security with ted st ring or teed if you prefer brought to you by tour camp and torcon.org check them out www www.mediaarchive.com proudly presents this material thank you for watching also check out www.promusscandle.com and so um so they installed the software on the hud machine and mysteriously hud lost like four point three trillion dollars you don&#x27;t hear about that anymore heads out of business they lost all their money you know where to go and so that was the test run before they sold it to fincen in the fina and swift the uh the equivalent in in europe is called swift and google that term as well and so um we&#x27;ll be talking about swift in a second and so the um but anyway so so the next step is so they did hud as a test to see if they could extract a bunch of money and nobody would know where it went it&#x27;s like those programs that used to work at the banks and they&#x27;d siphon off every quarter of interest from all the accounts and funnel it into this other account or they go and change their mag strip readers on the deposit slip so when somebody go put a 500 deposit it trance it into another account because they had re-encoded the mag strip you know same kind of thing but in this case um you know on a global scale and so so basically what what this investigative report found that a lot of it was kept secret was that um you know this was the payoff for the october surprise we&#x27;re keeping you know the iranian hostages uh hostage for another 28 and a half days or whatever it was 22 days to keep you know to make sure that reagan won the election um this was the payoff promus software is who paid these people off that handled all that this is what they wanted they wanted the software and then they all turned up dead but that&#x27;s okay so anyway so these guys are dead um anson young and ning this is an interesting one uh he was down i think in brazil somewhere or something and and he was murdered i didn&#x27;t have a photo of him some of these photos are very very hard to find it took me it took me a month well it actually only took me like three days but i&#x27;ve been working on the project for many months and you know i&#x27;ve got about 150 slides we&#x27;re only halfway through what are we doing on time over there oh excellent we&#x27;re exactly halfway through the tape and we&#x27;re halfway through the slides we&#x27;re on target and so all these guys started turning up dead and so anybody here seen this guy gerald bull he he developed the rail gun the super gun that was he was supposedly sold you know saddam was on our team you know saddam was on our team osama was on these are all made men you know they&#x27;re all working for us you know until you know they become expendable and then you know they fly saddam out and his family out on the jet and then they you know and he&#x27;s living in the bahamas and you know who knows where everybody else is and so all these star people you know these real innovators started turning up dead you know this guy was assassinated outside of his apartment and so then there&#x27;s bill mccoy and bill mccoy had heard this isn&#x27;t him of course it&#x27;s just somebody looks like him maybe sitting in his chair uh he or there was a contract out on his his life and that several people were coming to kill him so he decided instead of being killed he was just going to stop taking his heart medication and they found him dead in his chair but right before he died he was working on a project called l-bit and there&#x27;s all sorts of l-bits now this is lbit systems actually no no relation to the l-bit chip of course and it&#x27;s basically like i was talking about before these little burst transmitters you can see them up there uh on the key for an example and there&#x27;s a little diagram and a circuitry and here&#x27;s just a couple other ones that one up the upper right is an infrared burst transmitter and then of course we just got a regular um 433 gigahertz megahertz you know transmitter so they&#x27;re very common you know back then they weren&#x27;t they weren&#x27;t as common but uh you know they basically you know made a deal with intel you know that&#x27;s why i prefer the power pc max because you know they don&#x27;t have an intel chip in them we&#x27;ll talk about in a minute um and so uh so that&#x27;s the problem is these l bit chips are supposedly in all computers everywhere and they can literally just store up every keystroke that you&#x27;ve made over your entire lifetime and send it in a matter of seconds just some satellite that&#x27;s orbiting overhead you know this is the technology that exists they can pick up just like they can pick up what&#x27;s on your screen from a van outside the you know from outside the thing using the electromagnetic waves that come off your screen you know it&#x27;s basically the same technology and this is what promise allowed them to do you know basically it increased their sophistication like tenfold enough where they could start you know receiving singles from laptops you know flying overhead oh and there&#x27;s the flow flying receptors ah however evil they are and i should also mention um another website i have hacker dvds some of the some of the titles in fact they just emanuel goldstein from the hope just gave a great presentation last night and hopefully this week coming up i&#x27;ll have him post on hackerdvds.com if you go to hackerdvds.com that goes to my youtube page where i have like a lot of different things you can also go to freevideoarchives.com if you go to free video archives it links to my youtube account that&#x27;s got about three or four hundred different hacker videos tour con shmukon not a camp and i just want to thank you know natacam for letting us film in their um their tent the other day uh our tent was actually blown down by the dust devil you know you&#x27;re in bad condition when somebody says it&#x27;s coming this way the last two times my life were in danger i was nearly hurt out here the other day was somebody was saying uh the first time was i was sleeping in a restaurant oh there&#x27;s a tornado and it&#x27;s headed this way and then two days ago i was in there we&#x27;re getting ready to film actually i was supposed to go present but then the octopus like putting into that and so then there&#x27;s a dust devil and it&#x27;s headed this way that&#x27;s the last thing i heard and it was all over from there but go to my myspace ted&#x27;s adventure with 2d t-e-d-d-s adventure.com to check those photos and all the other photos here um so anyway so all these people uh so anyway so we have these we have these hacker chips and all our computers they&#x27;re put there by intel you know in the cia and and you know now google&#x27;s you know got it&#x27;s google get anybody got google gears installed i do uh i don&#x27;t mind you know one question about the el chip though it should be detectable yeah well it depends on what frequency yeah you think you you think you&#x27;d be able to detect it and the other thing about these is it uses latent power supposedly it doesn&#x27;t you don&#x27;t even have to have the thing plugged in i mean you have to have plugged in but the machine doesn&#x27;t have to be even on well it just uses the latent power from the circuit you know when you plug your you know it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s that dead power you have when you plug in it uses that latent it&#x27;s tied into that latent power circuit and um so your machine could be off you know in the closet and it could be sitting there transmitting but yeah i know that would be you know an interesting thing to do a bandwidth scan or you know now these days you know it might go out over the internet you know you have a packet sniffing you know who knows what&#x27;s going on but uh but but so there&#x27;s this concern that another question not just turn them off track the battery out of them right right yeah yeah yeah hot on the hook it&#x27;s called yeah sure hot on the hook and this is what promise did yeah you know the hot on the hook technologies you know he&#x27;s a perfect example google that one you know um so anyway all these people started turning up dead uh ian spyro and his wife were killed out in california they were involved with reconnaissauto and this all you know made the papers you know it&#x27;s big news back then and so just more and more once again i&#x27;ll have all these slides posted on my website promuscandal.com you can um you can check it out um diet found dead of poisoning spyro um interesting and so then there&#x27;s this guy robert maxwell this was a difficult photo to find um all these people started dying around 1991 same time the castellero died um 1991 huh we still got audio over there you can hear me come out of there check check audio yeah okay um and so robert maxwell was found drowned in 1991 in kind of a mysterious uh you know drowning accident like natalie wood you know except that one was pretty explainable um and so uh so basically uh this was the guy that helped broker uh promus sales worldwide uh he was a big um he was a big uh a publishing magnet out of london and he helped broker sales to like hundreds of nations and all these people worldwide and he was even investigated by the fbi for sale for sales of pro for sales of promise for for sale in the software um yeah we&#x27;re probably like a half hour or less um but anyway so uh so so all these people just ended up starting up dying anybody related to the case that were or friends of theirs or whoever knew the story or who could make connections they just all ended up dying and one after another there&#x27;s this dead dead dead dead um oh it looks like i did pull the carradine photo out um that one will be in the thing i block out the actual body but it&#x27;s interesting when you look at the keratin photo you&#x27;ll see a red mini skirt red lingerie on the bed um and what&#x27;s interesting and you know and you don&#x27;t you aren&#x27;t found dead in a hotel room you know hanging from a hotel room in bangkok with you know out some kind of sex involved probably you know and so there&#x27;s probably some kind of other involvement there but what&#x27;s interesting is that same that autoerotic asphyxiation that we just heard so much about and once again carradinetribute.com for the uh for the video i just met him like four months ago unbelievable he&#x27;s gone but very interesting video it&#x27;s basically a a good cap on his life um and so a lot of other people uh this guy here jonathan moyle is his name and he was investigating the promis iraq connection and he was found dead of auto erotic asphyxiation down in santiago down in chile and so so a lot of people you know associated with this this one of the ways that they you know kill people make it look like a suicide you know so and i&#x27;ll go on the record to say if i ever commit suicide 100 it wasn&#x27;t me man i didn&#x27;t do it but anyway so uh so then there&#x27;s others uh anybody know who this is phil schneider he would be another one that might have been here he was basically charged i had a contract to help develop underground bases across the country especially one down in uh underneath supposedly the denver international airport there&#x27;s supposedly a big underground complex under there that can house four five six ten thousand people and so he helped develop all this stuff and uh you know talks about all this went public in fact one of the uh conferences that i uh uh got the rights to distribute called the global sciences congress the global global sciencescongress.com is where eventually it will end up but i have some lectures from him in fact here&#x27;s a string clip from that lecture where he&#x27;s talking about all these you know you know weird things and all this stuff going on and how he helped build these bases and this is how they were built and this is what they did um and then of course he he was found dead um they thought it was suicide or forget you know it wasn&#x27;t auto effective but he ended up they didn&#x27;t find it because he was swung enough you die you swell up and stuff they didn&#x27;t find him for a few days i guess he lived alone don&#x27;t live alone anybody that&#x27;s the worst thing but um and um live with roommates so they can get killed too um but uh so they found it with piano wire right but they couldn&#x27;t find their original autopsy they didn&#x27;t find the piano wire because he was so swollen up and they did a second autopsy found piano wire around his throat you know tortured usually they torture you for the information you know and then you know it&#x27;s over and so some other interesting things jim keith here once again he helped write that original octopus book and shortly thereafter uh you know ended up dead no i should mention about this guy it was like within um it was in about within about three to five months of him presenting this lecture that i have the rights to that he ended up dead and so that&#x27;s not a um that&#x27;s not a good thing but you know hopefully i&#x27;ll last longer and so jim keith uh you know he was all into this stuff and writing he wrote like 45 books on conspiracies and stuff and he he burned he he he fell off a stage at burning man and hurt his knee and they rushed into washout county hospital where he died in surgery from a blood clot apparently that went from his leg and lodged in his lung and killed him and supposedly you know supposedly the secret government killed him if you follow you know like some parapolitical researchers um you know that that the secret government killed him uh by you know putting an air bubble in there or something but it&#x27;s very interesting so that happened and then uh within about a year or so uh his publisher pictured there on the right left john ron bonds another friend of mine used to buy the books from um he&#x27;s ended up dead he went out to he went out to eat at his favorite mexican restaurant in atlanta and um and ended up with food poisoning or something he was dead in like in 18 hours he was dead the guy who published jim keith&#x27;s book and so you know the universe has an interesting way of of of correcting things sometimes and and you know i&#x27;ve heard of like remote viewers who are like on the leading edge and they die in some freak car accident you know it&#x27;s like the other side there is another side folks i don&#x27;t know how much you investigate the mind and and where we all go after all this stuff but anyway so let&#x27;s move on um here we got gary webb um anybody know who gary webb is he wrote an article in the san jose uh weekly news i believe it was or daily news uh about crack cocaine and how the cia was was basically uh creating the crack out cocaine epidemic and cia chemists that were actually the ones that develop the process for developing crack by adding the baking soda and firing it and heating it and melting it and blowing houses up and stuff and so um and so this is the guy that broke all that whole story gary webb rest in peace uh he ended up dead a few years ago two gunshot heads wound to the head one i guess wasn&#x27;t good no good</p>
