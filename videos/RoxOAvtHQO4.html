            <p>David won being a Quantum physicist he tapped into what is now generally known as The Observer observed effect when we discussed the Observer and the observe being separate see with a space between them that&#x27;s in the image right now that would imply that there would be time to act on the it would take some time to cross the space and there would be enough Independence of the Observer so that he could think about it a little while and then do something with you see having that space and time but if that is just simply an image not and in fact it&#x27;s all one thought process they observe whatever you call the Observer has already been affected by the thing he wants to observe mainly he wants to observe anger he&#x27;s already been affected by anger in a distorted way right so far it has been an elusive Chase for Quantum physicists actually to observe the reality because by their very observation they&#x27;re changing the reality that they are actually observing</p>
