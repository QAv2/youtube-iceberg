            <p>all right hello welcome to my channel uh this channel is for uh educationally uh interested and uh especially people who want to learn about uh new and exciting theories of everything uh particularly obscure uh things that you probably wouldn&#x27;t know otherwise if this channel didn&#x27;t exist then you probably wouldn&#x27;t know and one of them is the reciprocal system of theory from Mr Dewey B Larson today is video number 218 on the reciprocal system and I love the reciprocal system because it puts power back into your hands you can do science you can do liberal arts uh yourself you do not have to rely upon uh the experts in the white lab coats or the Tweed jackets to tell you you know how things work you can just take Larson&#x27;s simple rules and apply them yourself and uh you know figure out how the world is put together and how it makes sense and uh you know in general the science scientists they know the equations they can usually get the right answers but they don&#x27;t know how or why they don&#x27;t know what the equations actually mean they know they work but they don&#x27;t know what they mean they were arrived at uh you know algebraically uh or otherwise mathematically whereas Larson&#x27;s theories and equations are arrived at theoretically so he understands what the equations actually mean and that counts for something so um today we&#x27;re looking at his 1979 book called Nothing But motion and nothing but motion is something that kind of sums up his theory in general Larson believed that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion and motion for Larson was the relationship between space and time it sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time uh basically motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator uh the best example of that is speed I was running at 10 miles per hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time space over time now we could say if we wanted to double the speed we could say I was running at 20 miles per hour it&#x27;s pretty fast uh I was running at 20 miles per hour or equivalently we could say I was running 10 miles per half hour so you can either multiply the space or you can divide the time either way gives you the same result that shows a reciprocal relationship between space and time as far as speed goes but speed isn&#x27;t the only thing that you can uh isn&#x27;t the only kind of motion in fact energy and matter are also two kinds of motion energy is actually the uh inverse of speed where speed is space over time energy is time over space it took me one hour to move that thing 20 feet it&#x27;s one hour of time 20 feet of space and that is energy matter is actually time to the third power over space to the third power so that complicates things a bit because it shows that both time and space can come in multiple Dimensions uh three or more Dimensions Larson calls that the coordinate aspects of time and space time and space generally have the same qualities because they are reciprocals of each other just like three and one-third are reciprocals of each other they have the same quality three but one has the three at in the numerator and one has the three in the denominator um and so uh coordinate time and coordinate space we recognize coordinate space three dimensions three or more dimensions of space x y z coordinates or x w x y z coordinates in like Buckminster Fuller 4D and um you know we&#x27;re comfortable with that you know we we live in that world but then there is also coordinate time three or more dimensions of time and that is something that the Legacy science hasn&#x27;t uh you know accepted at this point uh but it&#x27;s a a natural result from the reciprocal relationship between space and time the other uh quality the space and time both have is they are both in scalar um clock aspects clock time that&#x27;s something that we recognize the the clock is always getting later and later and later but in no particular direction so that is the flow of time or the progression of time but there is also by the reciprocal relation there is also clock space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and you can see that you can visualize that using uh a balloon and a magic marker put a bunch of dots on the balloon you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but in no particular direction you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other the further away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving toward each other these are scalar motions or clock space and um you can also use something like raisin bread to Envision this all of the raisins as you bake the bread all of the raisins are moving away from each other or you can gaze through the Hubble telescope and notice that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other the farther away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other and so these are all the progression or the flow of space then in addition to that space and time both have their um discrete aspects meaning that they come in small chunks they do not come continuously there is a minimum chunk of space and a minimum chunk of time and they&#x27;re very small so you can&#x27;t really you know resolve from one from the other without the most sensitive equipment but um but they they do have their chunk aspect not continuous and one chunk of space in one chunk of time recall a space over time is speed one chunk of space in one chunk of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is basically one in Larson&#x27;s system one unit of space in one unit of time and Larson says that that speed of light is the midpoint of the universe so this is the uh difference between Larson and Einstein are one of the many differences where Einstein says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson says that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and that half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light that is the half that we recognize that Einstein recognized and Larson calls that the material sector and then there is half of the universe that&#x27;s actually moving faster than the speed of light and that&#x27;s the half of the universe that Einstein didn&#x27;t know about um and uh Larson calls that the cosmic sector and you can see the the relationship between the material sector and the cosmic sector we know things about the material sector because that is where we observe and we make our measurements um and this is where science has uh you know expounded their theories um but we don&#x27;t know really anything about the cosmic sector it&#x27;s basically invisible to us even though it&#x27;s right there right in front of us and but with Larson&#x27;s system because of the reciprocal nature of it we can extrapolate Knowledge from the material sector to the cosmic sector because what goes on in the cosmic sector is exactly the same you know as far as the generalized picture um macro picture uh is exactly the same as what&#x27;s going on in the material sector except that you reverse the roles of space and time uh easily uh can be seen in the material sector we recognize coordinate space and clock time three or more dimensions of time and a flowing uh three or more dimensions of space and flowing time but in the cosmic sector we have coordinate time and clock space three or more dimensions of time and flowing our progressing space um okay now uh this book here nothing but motion is primarily on Atomic physics and so this is uh trying to figure out what&#x27;s going on within the atom and that within the atom you&#x27;re talking about uh what Larson calls uh the time region and the space region the time region is within the material sector the slower than the speed of light sector uh where we have coordinate space but when you go less than one unit of space you don&#x27;t have space anymore because space comes only in discrete units so if you&#x27;re dealing with less than a unit of space you are in a rural a world of time and so Larson and so that is a subset of the material sector that Larson refers to as the time region and that is the realm of atomic physics and then over on in the cosmic sector again you have the rules reversed roles reversed of space and time and within a unit of time you do not have time because time only comes in chunks so less than one chunk of time is a world of space so this is what Larson calls the space region and this is where Cosmic Atomic physics occurs or as Legacy science scientists would call it they would call it anti-matter um okay so uh Larson in this book develops some of the basic rules of atomic physics an atom is a combination of many different kinds of motion within an atom you always have two photons these photons are simple harmonic motions waves and Larson says they they come from a combination of a uh translational motion and a vibrational motion uh 90 degrees apart and the combination of those creates a sine wave some of Larson&#x27;s followers have disagreed and they say that it comes from a by rotation a combination of two rotations either way it&#x27;s a combination of two different kinds of motion and then once you have those two photons then you when you rotate them in two different dimensions independent Dimensions that creates an atom and then a third rotation which Larson calls electric or one-dimensional rotation then uh creates uh kind of the the uh the gaps between all of the noble gases so that has more to do with uh electric valence and that&#x27;s actually what he&#x27;s talking about in this chapter which is called Simple compounds and uh he talks about the various different so a compound is a molecule a a kind of a combination of atoms so an atom is a combination of many different kinds of motion and a compound is a combination of many different kinds of atoms and in this chapter he&#x27;s talking mainly about simple compounds the next chapter is on complex compounds and uh we&#x27;ll just uh read a few paragraphs here to give you a feel of where Larson is going uh you know don&#x27;t worry don&#x27;t fret if you don&#x27;t really get it because we&#x27;re picking up in the middle of a chapter and uh this is somewhat difficult stuff again this is atomic this is really organic chemistry I guess or chemistry and um you know he he basically sets up rules that are quite different than what you would get from your normal chemistry class and there&#x27;s different forms of bonding of different atoms uh not only based on their electric valence but also on their magnetic valence and I think that&#x27;s where he&#x27;s going right here um okay here&#x27;s Larson in his own words for at least a few paragraphs there is also an alternate type of inter-atomic orientation that gives rise to what we we may call second order valences as has been emphasized in the previous discussion an equilibrium between positive and negative rotational displacements can take place only where the net resultant is zero or the equivalent of zero because any value of the space-time ratio other than Unity or zero displacement constitutes motion and makes fixed equilibrium positions impossible so you know when you&#x27;re bonding um you cannot do so uh in a condition of motion um when you&#x27;re trying to establish uh simple compounds you need a fixed equilibrium in the most probable condition the initial value from which each rotation extends is the same zero point or where the nature of the orientation requires different zero points the closest combination that is possible under the circumstances this Arrangement the basis of the first order valences is clearly the most probable but it is not the only possibility in as much as the separation between the natural zero points or unit speed levels is two linear units or eight three-dimensional units it is possible to establish an equilibrium in which the initial level of the positive rotation the positive zero is separated from the initial level of the negative rotation or the negative zero by two linear units the effect of this separation on the valence is Illustrated here in figure two um so in in figure a here you got uh v v on one side and V on the other side then um in figure two you have V uh and then you have two and then on the other side you have V plus two and then on the um other side you have V in number c you have V on one side and then two uh on the other side along with v minus two the basis of the first order valences is shown in a here the normal positive valence V balances an equal negative valence V at an equilibrium point represented by the double line in B the initial level of the positive rotation has been offset to the next zero point two units distant from the point of equilibrium these two units being on the positive side of the equilibrium point add to the effective positive displacement and the positive valence therefore increases to V plus two that is V plus two negative valence units are counterbalanced in C it is the initial level of the negative rotation that has been offset from the point of equilibrium here the two intervening units add to the effective negative displacement and the positive valence decreases to V minus two as the V units of positive displacement are now able to balance only V minus to negative valence units by reason of the availability of the zero point modifications Illustrated in figure 2B each of the positive first order valences corresponds to a second order valence an enhanced valence as we will call it that is two units greater in the case of the direct valences X plus two and two units less for the inverse valences eight minus the quantity X plus two equals six minus X compounds based on enhanced normal valences are relatively uncommon as the normal valence itself has a high degree of probability and the enhanced valence is not only inherent inherently less probable but also has a higher effective displacement in any specific application which decreases the relative probability still further the probability factors are more favorable for the enhanced neutral valence as in this case the effective displacement is less than that of the corresponding first order valences the compounds of this type are therefore more numerous and they include such well-known substances as sodium no sulfur dioxide and potassium chloride um an interest or that is uh pcl3 uh although it looks like it says i p c I3 but I believe it&#x27;s pcl3 an interesting application of this valence is found in Ozone which is an oxide of oxygen analogous to sulfur dioxide okay now it doesn&#x27;t look like uh looks like we should stop right there um don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t really understand this we are I think we&#x27;re just gonna trudge ahead here tomorrow try to get to the end of this chapter and I think we&#x27;re gonna end up skipping the last three or four chapters of this book um which go further into organic chemistry and we&#x27;re just kind of into the weeds here uh it&#x27;s all pretty difficult stuff and we&#x27;re gonna try to move into uh some different subjects I mean we&#x27;re going to stay with the reciprocal system we&#x27;re going to look at some of the other authors who have written on this topic along with maybe some of Larson&#x27;s other stuff so um you know hang in there uh don&#x27;t be discouraged if you don&#x27;t get it you&#x27;ll get it eventually and have a great day talk to you tomorrow</p>
