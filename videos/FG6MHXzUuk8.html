            <p>Dr Paul leviolette telling of TT Brown&#x27;s rotating disc phenomenon really captured my attention in secrets of anti-gravity propulsion laviolet described TT Brown&#x27;s high voltage experiments a YouTube example of these tests is in the description below perhaps there&#x27;s another way to run these experiments could I simply measure lift I constructed a cage for my protection that suspended a single disc by applying progressively higher high voltages I hope to measure any lift created that this weighed 116 grams was hammered aluminum plate filled with a 50 50 barium tightening epoxy mix the upper much larger saucer-like plate was positive and the smaller flat lower plate was negative 16 500 volts is not enough to Loft this disc iting stuff but real scary I never did get comfortable with it I moved on for now</p>
