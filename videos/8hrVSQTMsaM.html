            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel this is a channel for educational purposes we tend to look at uh theories of everything uh all-encompassing theories cosmologies Paradigm shifters um things that you can use for your Awakening 5D Consciousness and uh otherwise use it for the benefit of your life but you probably don&#x27;t know about them because they&#x27;re too obs obure and have been suppressed today is our 439th video on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larson uh Larsson was an American engineer and lived out in Portland most of his life born in North Dakota in 1898 died in 1990 and uh around 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how the operated and then uh through a process of deduction he arrived at his theoretical Universe what his Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then um in some of his books he compared his theoretical Universe with the empirical universe of the scientists that they had uh measured in their Laboratories and compiled in their tables and in particular he uh did this with um chemistry uh in his book basic properties of matter he came up with equations for uh many of the basic properties of matter and then compared them with the uh scientific tables that were present at the time and uh we&#x27;re looking at that book today in particular uh chapter 4 on compressibility and um before we get to that we&#x27;ll just um try to summarize the reciprocal system it&#x27;s um pretty complicated but it is way simpler than um uh Legacy science Legacy science you have to learn a different set of rules for every little uh pigeon hold subject uh for the reciprocal system you learn one set of rules and you can apply it to every subject and um Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system is also known as the universe of motion that&#x27;s because Larson attempted to construct his Universe based on motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not even made out of energy or Force it&#x27;s made out of motion and uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s called the reciprocal system because for Larson U motion was the relationship between space and time and um there are a few caveats here Motion in larsson&#x27;s system was um what he called scalar motion not uh exactly the motion that you&#x27;re normally thinking about which is a vectorial motion a motion that has a Direction scalar motion is a motion that has no direction or no specific Direction really in or out you can Envision a the surface of an expanding balloon uh if you put a bunch of dots on the balloon you can see that all of the dots are moving away from each other as you expand the balloon and uh but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction every dot is moving away from every other Dot and even the spaces between the dots are also moving away from each other every spot is moving in every direction and so there is no specific Direction and the same is true if you if you suck in the balloon and it contracts then um all of the dots will be moving toward each other um Larson called these two motions uh the progression the outward motion is the prog ression and the inward motion as gravitation and um so for Larson uh the universe is made out of scalar motion and uh motion is the relationship between space and time basically um motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator you can can see that in the most basic uh aspect of motion speed the bicycle&#x27;s moving 15 M hour 15 miles of space in one hour of time and if you double the speed you can now say the bike is moving 30 mph or equivalently you can say the bike is now moving 15 m per half hour you can multiply the space or you can divide the time that shows a reciprocal relationship between space and time in speed Larson expands that to include all of our basic scientific uh phenomena uh they are all forms of motion and they are all um relationships between space and time but space and time and motion have uh multiple Dimensions he says three dimensions so um you know the exponents of those fractions could be uh more than one you can have space to the third power over time or you can have time to the third power over space to the third power uh which is matter you can have time over space which is energy time over space to the fourth power which is pressure you can have space to the second power over time to the second power which is momentum uh and so on and so forth so all of our basic scientific phenomena are relationships between space and time it can be expressed in fractions like that which serves as a phenomenal check for uh equations at to um you know to um figure out whether they are dimensionally um what&#x27;s the word um valid and uh so the other another so space and time both have three dimensions lson uh okay now say you&#x27;ve got your expanding balloon uh going inward uh your shrinking balloon and uh there is no Direction all of the dots are moving toward each other um but in no specific Direction but now you decide that you&#x27;re going to arbitrarily say that one of the dots is motionless you&#x27;re going to say that this is the reference point this dot I declare is motionless well then all of a sudden you have directions you can make uh impute directions to the other dots they will all be moving toward that one dot uh and it will appear as if there is is a force field emanating from that dot and that um all of the dots other dots are attracted to that Central uh reference dot these are all functions of the reference system not of the scalar motion not of the motion but of the uh reference system of assigning a reference point and that is kind of what goes on in both the spatial reference system and the temporal reference system Larsson refers to this as coordinate space and coordinate time three-dimensional coordinates XYZ coordinates um and so in our uh environment of the of the universe we observe space as coordinate we observe three dimensions of space in a still frame you know we are uh space is still and uh but we&#x27;re moving through time so we basically observe the universe as coordinate space three dimensions of still space and clock time or a scalar Motion in time time is always getting later and later and later and later or further and further and farther apart um but it is not moving in any specific Direction so that&#x27;s a scalar Motion in time but a um coordinate or vectorial motions in space and um so that that uh coordinate space is very much like abstracting the universe or picking a reference point we are anchored to a spatial reference point and so the um the reference system the spatial reference reference system that we&#x27;re seeing is very limited uh in fact the three dimensions of space only take up one dimension of motion and in Larson&#x27;s postulate um motion space and time all have three dimensions so our reference system is very limited in what it can express it can really only express one dimension of scalar motion um now if we were in a different environment in the universe we would uh observe the reciprocal of that which is that we would re observe coordinate time three dimensions of time in a still frame this is the temporal reference system um three dimensions of time in a still frame and progressing space or scalar space uh clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and uh this happens in what he calls the cosmic sector and the cosmic sector is um an outgrowth of another one of larsson&#x27;s um first postulates uh is the discrete unit postulate that is that space time and motion are all quantized you have to have a a full full unit of space or time or Motion in order to have any of those things so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit you don&#x27;t have a squat you have um nothing without a full unit it&#x27;s just like with uh many other things in the universe you know I&#x27;m uh you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t say uh you know go to the tree and pick me half an orange that&#x27;s uh absurd you either get a whole orange or you don&#x27;t get any orange or you get two or three or four but you don&#x27;t get four and a half now once you take the orange off the tree I suppose you can cut it in a half or whatever but um it comes only in full units and the same is true of space time and motion now space the unit of space is approximately 1 500,000th of an inch and the unit of time is approximately um 16.5 quadrillionth of a second uh 6.5 * 10 15 uh units of um units of time per second and um now if you have uh unit speed would be a combination of those remembering that speed is space over time so speed would be one half one or two millionth of a sec two millionth of a an inch per uh one six quadrillionth of a second that turns out to be the speed of light so the speed of light is what Larsson calls unit speed that is one unit of speed um uh which is approximately 3.3 uh * 10 8 m/s and um that is what Larson calls unit speed and that is the background motion of this universe Larson&#x27;s Universe in Larson&#x27;s Universe the universe of motion you have to be able to conceive of motion without anything that&#x27;s moving motion precedes the thing that&#x27;s moving and that is what this unit speed progression is so we have unit speed outward at the speed of light in all directions um that is what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system okay so he has a spatial reference system with coordinate time and clock space or coordinate space and clock time he has a temporal reference system of coordinate time and clock space and then he has a um scalar reference system or the natural reference system with it which is just one unit of space one per one unit of time and that is the expanding balloon um progressing in both space and time and he calls that the progression of the natural reference system that&#x27;s the zero point of larsson&#x27;s universe uh that is the uh source of all matter and everything else in the UN Universe comes from that source and that&#x27;s the empty universe that&#x27;s the universe where you don&#x27;t have anything when you don&#x27;t have anything you still have the everpresent omnipresent and eternal progression of the natural reference system and um that is also the boundary or the midpoint of the universe so this is where Larsson makes his measurements from and it also means that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light and half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light Larson refers to these as the cosmic sector and the material sector and in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and clock space and in the Co in the material sector you have coordinate space and clock time now within each one of the material uh within each of the material and Cosmic sectors you have a sub region uh that has to do with the discrete unit of time in the in the cosmic sector and the discrete unit of space in the material sector in the material sector you have atoms and particles and molecules that interact and when they do interact in less than one unit of space then they don&#x27;t interact in space because there isn&#x27;t space in less than one unit and so if you don&#x27;t have space then you have to have time because the universe is made out of space and time are motion and so it has to be one or the other or both if it&#x27;s not space it has to be time Larson refers to this as the time region and this is the region of atomic interactions and molecular interactions in the material sector the same is true in the cosmic sector but with uh in less than one unit of time you have Cosmic atoms and Cosmic particles and Cosmic molecules interacting and they interact in What&#x27;s called the space region and uh Cosmic atoms are otherwise known as antimatter um in Legacy science so Legacy science does know something about the cosmic sector but very very very little uh Einstein&#x27;s dictum was that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe in larsson&#x27;s system the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe and uh so atoms come about from uh basically taking that out outward motion of the progression and through um first vibrating it in uh two dimensions and then rotating it in three more Dimensions um you end up getting uh atoms and you end up getting that progression which is in three dimensions Motion in three dimensions you basically uh turn it back and it now becomes that uh Contracting balloon so the expanding balloon of the progression uh through rotation and vibration uh becomes uh atoms uh which are gravitating uh so they are on that Contracting balloon of the uh that earlier example and so for Larson matter uh doesn&#x27;t just have one number for uh it&#x27;s period in the periodic table uh each element has three numbers uh one two-dimensional rotation one secondary two-dimensional rotation and or the the a number is the the primary two-dimensional rotation the B number is the secondary two-dimensional rotation and the C number is the uh onedimensional rotation that is in the opposite direction uh and the first two number numbers alternate and the third number uh is optional it can be zero in the noble gases and it can be plot positive or negative so that&#x27;s what Larson per his periodic table looks like now also in the material sector and Cosmic sector when you cross those boundaries into the into the inside regions into the time region and the space region you have to invert again just like you do when you cross the boundary uh of the speed uh of the speed boundary the unit speed boundary so in the time region the progression is moving Inward and gravitation is moving outward which is the opposite of what it was in the outside region so this uh eventually causes the um interatomic equilibrium between atoms because the uh progression which is moving inward is constant and omnipresent whereas gravitation is variable based on an inverse Square law and so there is a point different for every atom uh and even within atoms different orientations of atoms they have they establish a different equilibrium point where gravitation and the progression are the same and that&#x27;s where the equilibrium is established Larson measured those and came up with equations for those in the first couple chapters uh on interatomic distances now we&#x27;re on chapter four on compressibility so this is the rate of compression now the uh internal um pressure uh is caused by the progression the progression is always there and it so it&#x27;s called internal pressure it&#x27;s always there and that is bringing the atoms closer together but but the rotational forces or the gravitational forces of the atom are resisting it um and those forces get activated more and more the higher the pressure becomes and then there can also be an external pressure um coming from outside the system that can uh Force the atoms closer and closer together as well so Larson comes up with various expressions or equations for uh various um you know permutations of the compressibility here in this chapter and we&#x27;re going to just let him go here and we&#x27;ll see um I&#x27;ll try to clarify but um we&#x27;ll just try to get a a feel for what Larson&#x27;s talking about here furthermore we&#x27;re in the middle of the chapter toward the end we might even finish today furthermore we are able to show that the slope of the last section of the experimental curve for each each element is identical with a theoretical slope determined by the calculated maximum values of the internal pressure and the slope of each of the intermediate sections is in agreement with one of the possible intermediate values of that internal pressure now lson sets up uh the curves for the compressibility are uh in line in line segments basically because at certain critical points the atom or the molecule um has inflections uh based on uh first order Transitions and second order transitions the first order transitions are the result of an Al of a changing of the crystal structure of the atom in the solid state which is like the interatomic equilibrium um the which and then uh which really has something to do with orientation of the atom and then um also the second order transitions have to do with uh the atom bringing more of its rotational forces to bear um in opposing the pressure because pressure is a two-dimensional thing whereas the matter is a three-dimensional thing and so the amount of pressure uh kind of depends on how the atom is oriented if the whole atom is is kind of uh resisting it there&#x27;s going to be less Force than if like just a little bit of the atom is resisting it so um at those at certain uh pressures the atom will begin to to employ more and more of its rotational forces against that pressure that is at least the way I understand it at this point um my um understanding of this is evolving okay an exact theoretical definition of the curves we&#x27;ll have to wait for a fur for further progress along the lines discussed earlier in the meantime the amount of the theoretical information already available will serve as a means of testing the validity of each set of empirical results and will also enable a reasonable amount of extrapolation of the compression curves beyond the present limits of the shock wave technology uh back in the early 20th century like the maximum that they could really produce was about 100,000 atmospheres but now in the 80s when Larson was writing this they were arriving at this shock wave technology which could uh get up to several million atmospheres so um this filled in this is it currently filling in a lot of the you know maybe um theoretical gaps in our understanding of uh comp compressibility table 20 is a comparison of the theoretical volumes based on empirical uh reference volume for each of the sections of the curves as in the preceding tables with the shock wave results obtained at Los Alamos on the elements that were investigated over the widest range of pressures unless there is an increase in the compression factors in the vicinity of 100,000 atmospheres the compression curve established on the basis of Bridgeman&#x27;s measurements extend into the lower range of these shock wve experiments in these cases the theoretical volumes up to the first change in the compression factors are calculated on the basis of the reference volume uh selected from the Bridgeman data and uh no reference point is identified in this table okay so he&#x27;s looking at the shock wave compression questions in this table he gives the uh ay numbers which are very much related to the ABC numbers of the atomic uh configuration or the atomic factors for larsson&#x27;s periodic table and then he gives the um he gives the initial pressure or the initial pressure is one uh one um interatomic distance cubed is basically the the initial volume and then due to pressure the volume contracts and so for example I think he&#x27;s looking here at Gold um gold at the first um pressure which I&#x27;m not sure how many atmospheres that is it looks like it&#x27;s uh 100,000 atmospheres uh the calculated value is 9972 the obser serve value is 970 and uh he comes up with the same um type of results for Tungsten and malib denim or however you pronounce that and then um he&#x27;s got uh goes to Higher and Higher and Higher pressures when you get up all the way to a million atmospheres gold is all the way down to 610 he calculates it at 610 the uh observed value is [Music] 612 and um gets all the way up to um looks like two million atmospheres doesn&#x27;t have gold in here for that though but um yeah so this table has several different atoms several different molecules or or atoms and it has a a large range of different pressures all the way from 100,000 up to 2 million atmospheres and um it looks like Larson is pretty much always uh very close to the uh observed value um you know within certainly within 1% of the value in it looks like pretty pretty much every casee he&#x27;s um you know 748 he&#x27;s got 747 779 he&#x27;s got 780 768 he&#x27;s got 768 so uh however Larson&#x27;s doing it he&#x27;s able to get a pretty accurate result uh as far as the um shock wave results of these extreme extreme High uh pressures okay a rather surprising feature of these comparisons is that the agreement between the shock wve results and the theoretical volumes is as close as the agreement between Bridgeman&#x27;s static values and the theory Bridgeman is the early investigator that uh from uh that did this way back in the early 20th century and so larsson&#x27;s agreement with the shway values is as close as his agreement of Bridgeman&#x27;s even though Bridgeman&#x27;s values only went up to 100,000 U atmospheres it is true that this set of measurements was deliberately selected uh for the comparison and it represents the best results rather than the average but in any event the close correlation is a significant confirmation of the validity of both the shock wve techniques and the theoretical relations that he developed Lars the question that now arises is what course the compressibility follows beyond the pressure range of this table uh in some cases a a transition to a smaller base volume appears to be possible copper for instance May shift to the rotations of the preceding electropositive elements at some pressure above that of the tabulation aside from such special cases the factors that determine the compressibility in the range below 2 million atmospheres have reached their limits at the present stage of the investigation however the possibility that some new Factor may enter into the picture at extreme pressures cannot be excluded a collapse of the atomic structure of the kind envisioned by the nuclear theory is of course impossible but as matters now stand uh we are not in a position to say that all aspects of the compressor ibility situation have been explored it is conceivable that there may be some as yet unknown capability of change in the atomic motions that would increase the resistance to pressure beyond what now appears to be the ultimate limit now keep in mind that he says that that&#x27;s impossible for the nuclear collapse because Larson doesn&#x27;t believe in the nucleus he believes that the atom is the nucleus and that all of the electron cloud around the atom that is the space between the atoms uh in the interatomic equilibrium some Shock wve measurements have been made at still higher pressure levels and these should throw some light on the question unfortunately however the results are rather ambiguous three of the elements included in these experiments lead tin and bismuth follow the straight line established in table 20 up to the maximum pressures of about 4 million atmospheres on the other hand five elements on which measurements were carried uh to maximums between 3 and 5 million atmospheres show substantially lower compressions than a projection of table 20 curves would indicate the Divergence in the case of gold for example is almost 8% but there are uh equally great differences between the results of different experiments notably in the case of of iron whether or not some new Factor enters into the compression situation as pressures above those of table 20 will therefore have to be regarded as an open question okay that&#x27;s the end of the chapter and just to pep you up and that is the hardest chapter of any Larson book that I&#x27;ve ever read is that particular chapter at least for me uh that&#x27;s why it took us 12 days to get through it but now now we&#x27;re through it and we&#x27;re headed on to chapter five which is on heat so the other aspect of this interatomic thing heat and pressure so heat coming up next thanks
