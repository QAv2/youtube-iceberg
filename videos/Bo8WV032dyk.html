            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In the last video, I showed that if I put a magnet above a superconductor, it kind of just floats there like magic. What I want to do now though, is show what happens if I do it the other way around.</p>
<p>For this one, I&#x27;m using a much bigger superconductor, and I&#x27;m again cooling it with some liquid nitrogen. By now, it should be good, and I can take it out and drop it onto this little magnet</p>
<p>track that I made. It actually stays on the track, and if I push it, it&#x27;s able to move without falling off. It&#x27;s also surprisingly strong, and even if I push it decently hard, I can&#x27;t get it</p>
<p>to touch the track. As it warms up though, it eventually loses its ability to superconduct, and it stops floating.</p>
