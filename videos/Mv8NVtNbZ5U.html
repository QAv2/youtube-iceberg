            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>have you stood in front of a recovered UFO I am uh I have had in my possession material that was allegedly recovered from a UFO it was very I cannot say former Pentagon and intelligence official Lou alesandro L alzando L alzando I was told several years ago that I could never talk about crash retrievals or material ever people are wildly fascinated to hear from someone who was apparently inside the Pentagon looking at the most mysterious thing that exists in our world now are there people out there in the government that know more probably they&#x27;re out there man there&#x27;s there things that are going on that yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not our technology it could be like some sort of scop ooh this could cause ontological shock or an existential crisis if we just dump this on people you&#x27;re talking about a conspiracy on a level you would have to keep a long running secret and you&#x27;d have to back stop it for years beforehand like decades you allegedly left the Pentagon in 2017 do you guys ever really leave come on what&#x27;s up guys if you haven&#x27;t already please smash that subscribe button and hit that like button on the video and if you don&#x27;t have time to watch this episode right now I&#x27;d really appreciate it if you saved it to your watch later playlist on YouTube finally if you&#x27;d like to follow me on Instagram or X those links are in my description below how&#x27;s it feel to have the number one book in the United States of America wow what a great first question just just throw me into the deep end right just there you go dude um you know in I don&#x27;t think about it is&#x27;t that terrible I I I not at all I I don&#x27;t because it must be nice having the feds help get you all the way to the top of the list huh yeah if that was only the case if that were true I&#x27;d probably be be a senator um you know I I I I wrote that book for a very specific reason um I I never expected it to even be successful um I wrote it because I wanted people to know know the truth about what was going on in the government and how their tax dollars were being spent and at the end of the day I wanted it to be a record um you know people write books for different reasons and for me written word unlike spoken word is indelible what do I mean by that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s forever and I&#x27;ve said before this is why the Egyptians wrote the Book of the Dead on Papyrus it&#x27;s the reason why the Magna Carta was written on parchment it&#x27;s the reason why our Declaration of Independence was written down because written word outs survives those who wrote it right it&#x27;s it&#x27;s becomes a permanent record and then when it goes to the Pentagon for a security review right now I know for the first time I am actually allowed to talk about this I won&#x27;t I won&#x27;t get in trouble because I&#x27;ve said something that&#x27;s either classified or something like that and so that was really my motivation to write the book in the first place whether it sold one copy or million copies I I never paid attention that wasn&#x27;t my motivation and so I I purposely tried to avoid looking at at statistics how good something is doing or how bad something is doing um it was no diff you know I&#x27;ll share something with you actually um I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve shared this before so um some time ago I had a little TV show and we were doing on History Channel with some other folks and um I remember the pull that mic in a little bit I&#x27;m sorry I remember the producer coming to me and she was really really excited she&#x27;s like oh my gosh we just got green lit you know it&#x27;s fantastic and I said oh that&#x27;s great and she said well aren&#x27;t you aren&#x27;t you excited I said well do you know do you know when you obviously show got green Li but do you know the very first moment when a show&#x27;s about to be K when the show&#x27;s going to get canceled she said no she got like really almost like concerned like how do you know a show is going to be canceled I said the very day it&#x27;s green lit because no show lasts forever so yes in some cases it&#x27;s celebrating a marriage but it&#x27;s also awake because at some point every show comes to an end yes and so I don&#x27;t allow myself to if you will Revel in the moment because it&#x27;s kind of for me a little bit of a distraction from what my my my core mission is um so I know it&#x27;s probably not a satisfying answer no it&#x27;s perfectly fine it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s interesting talking to someone while they&#x27;re in the middle of that like this book obviously has been out now over the last month it&#x27;s taken off because people are wildly fascinated to hear from someone who was apparently inside the Pentagon looking at the most mysterious thing that exists in our world allegedly right so we&#x27;re going to get into all that today there&#x27;s there&#x27;s first of all your book&#x27;s very very good and there&#x27;s a lot of different details you delved into there and I&#x27;d love to get through some of those stories and break them down but I think one of the things that gets a little lost with you in the years I&#x27;ve seen you on the internet is the fact that long before 20 8 2009 when you got to atip and started working on UAP you you had 11 12 years or something like that before that where you were in the Army and then specifically within like Army intelligence and doing some pretty badass around the world I was actually only uniform for a very short period of time before I got recruited into into another program um I it was right after college and I did spend some time in uniform uh I was a lower enlisted grunt um I actually explained it in in in my book the reason why I could have come in as a army officer in with my medical background and my degrees I could have been in the Army Medical Corp but you know my father when I was a kid used to always tell me you know You&#x27; always call me Chino Chino uh my father being Cuban uh used to always tell you Chino um you know in order for a leader to be a good leader they must first what knows know what it means to follow right know what it&#x27;s like and so that stuck with me and I also wanted to have freedom to do the job I wanted to do I didn&#x27;t want to be stuck looking at more Petri dishes or you know mending broken arms so I went into the army as a lower enlisted guy U purposely um and um was there for a short period of time uh Military Intelligence did some some support to Special Operations uh spent some time in Korea um very interesting wonderful time to be there actually there was a lot of stuff going on North Korea was always being provocative and you had uh students and riots going on and uh back in the mid 90s and then came back to the United States and did some more investigations conas and then I I went into the civilian side where uh initially I I spent some time in Latin America down in uh in year banama gosh 1990 8 to 99 and then 99 I was in the Caribbean um and then uh came back for a short stint conus and then what happened is at 9/11 happened and uh we had just my wife had just given birth to our our second daughter um she was born very premature my wife had all sorts of medical complications she had a thing called preclampsia and help syndrome H PP I believe uh and so my daughter was born very premature after a month or so in the Nick unit tubes sticking out of her body and was awful um we brought her home and she was at the time the small baby ever ever released from the hospital I think she came home at either 3 lb or 2.9 lb like like know look at my hands I got sausage fingers and you know my hands look like a they&#x27;ve been through a meat cleaver and here&#x27;s this tiny little fragile life that&#x27;s been popped into my hand and said okay here you go take care of it I mean what I mean she her vocal cords weren&#x27;t even developed so when she cried you couldn&#x27;t hear her uh my God what a what an incredible experience that was so anyways 911 happened and uh a few months after we brought her home and I W up going um over to Afghanistan Kandahar right uh Kandahar yeah that&#x27;s right Kandahar we were the first really the first group group of folks over there uh spent some time there and then long story short we got involved in the Iraq stuff spent some time in the Middle East and then finally my wife came to me U and she said look you got to stop going on these deployments you got to you got to find another job here you either got to get promoted or do something because you&#x27;re not going to make it back home real quickly you had said you went into the civilian side this before 911 or whatever for people out there can you just explain what that means yeah sure so the intelligence Community um has a requirement to have people operators that work collection operations but also have military experience right because a lot of people think the CIA is sitting you know some Embassy somewhere you know James Bond and having cocktails and they do well some of them do yeah some of the lucky guys uh but then you&#x27;ve got um you know the other folks that are doing ground ground collection um human operations and Counter Intelligence operations and investigations and they they&#x27;re on the ground a lot of these folks have military backgrounds um for example I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re probably way too young to remember this but in the beginning of Afghanistan we lost a couple really good folks one of them was a gentleman named Michael span Michael span was a CIA officer who uh who died in in combat over there um anyways long story short there&#x27;s a requirement to have uh military people um or formerly trained military people and they kind of transition into these these more tactical roles and so U did that for a while and finally my wife was like look you know I I don&#x27;t like you&#x27;re doing this so from there I took a uh a promotion and I came uh back conus W up going to DC where I actually went Washington DC actually just true just south of DC it was uh at Fort belor um where I was running rather than doing investigations I was supervising investigations so uh you know you get promoted yourself to the desk and you Trad in your gun and you&#x27;re you know you you traded for a for a pen now you worry about desk poops yeah ex exactly and worried about budgets and you know Inspector General investigations and the lawyers you know coming down and you why are you opening this investigation without blah blah blah blah uh and then from there I went to um back up to DC worked with several different intelligence agencies um some with DOD some outside of DOD uh and then um in 200 Maybe seven I&#x27;d have to see seven or eight seven um I went from the national Counter Intelligence executive which is where I was working there uh at NCIX and I went to the Director of National Intelligence the dni actually it&#x27;s odni Office of the Director of National Intelligence and then the director&#x27;s called the dni is that under DIA officially no no they are the they are the top dog so let me great so great question if you don&#x27;t mind let me digress because I think this is important after n so the the real cause of 911 of course we know it&#x27;s terrorists doing bad things but that was a result that wasn&#x27;t the cause the cause was there was Intelligence failure within our country oh yeah you had pockets of information that were held at the CIA pockets of information at the FBI and pockets of information at the Department of Defense and we weren&#x27;t sharing that information so after 911 there was a commission 9911 commission that realized basically what the failures were so they created a new position that fell directly under the president and it was called the um intelligence reform terrorism prevention Act of 2004 irtpa 2004 that created a a national level Bubba a guy a gal a point of contact that is the director of the National Intelligence and says you will now manage and coordinate all intelligence across US Government so basically even the director of the CIA even the director of Dia NGA nro everybody L doy you are all responsible to that guy or that gal whoever that is and so they created that position the first one was a gentleman named John negroponte John negroponte was a uh he was a a politician then I guess you became a diplomat for a while an ambassador and then became the first dni then you had some guys like McConnell and Blair that filled those were the times that I that I worked at dni this show is sponsored by better help one of the unfortunate things that happens sometimes as we get older is we stop that Curiosity of wanting to learn new things and that can even extend to learning more about ourselves and What Makes Us tick which is why therapy can be a great tool I&#x27;ve talked about it in the past on my show but there have been a couple times in my life where therapy really helped me reset my mind and get through some difficult situations a big thing I struggle with is that I&#x27;m an overthinker so having someone across from me during those times to help me organize my thoughts and focus on what actually matters was incredibly important so if that sounds like the kind of thing that could help you and you&#x27;re thinking about starting therapy give better help a try

also living as we had discussed prior uh I I decided to raise my family on an island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay because DC was just not for me not a great place to raise two girls young girls I feel you there you know so I beautiful area by the way the Chesapeake down there it is gorgeous you know and so we&#x27;ve always been on the water um you know maybe because I&#x27;m Cuban right we love the water uh but uh surrounded by Cuban I know man hey you know what can I say you know um but I grew up near the water a lot and uh that was part of my life and I wanted my girls to to kind of share in that experience and not worry about crime and the hustle and bustle and sirens and horns and traffic and you know I wanted them to have normal life ride your bicycle in the neighborhood not worry about you know being run over or something worse oh yeah it&#x27;s so quiet like my my aunt used to have a place in Tilman Island down there yeah tman beautiful yeah so you get it right St Michaels I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s come if you got to work in DC and don&#x27;t want to live in DC that&#x27;s where you want to live how far is that though from that ah so now you&#x27;re getting to my point why okay so it&#x27;s almost as if I gave you a script or something you&#x27;re you&#x27;re so that&#x27;s precisely the issue quality of life is fantastic but the commute out to past Langley which is where I was at past there was a 3-hour oneway commute oneway 3 hours so I was and if there was any traffic like dude I am I&#x27;m literally in the car longer than I am at work and I&#x27;m at work 8 to 10 hours right so Z zero quality of life I&#x27;d come home I I I cram some frozen food down my throat and I go to bed and I wake up and wash rinse repeat all over again so my quality life was terrible my kids had a great upbringing and my wife had a great life out there but my life pretty much sucked and so I had an offer in 2008 late 2008 to come back to the Pentagon for a bit and establish a information sharing relationship between n still part of the 911 Commission hey we&#x27;re not sharing enough information so now that we&#x27;re getting FBI CIA and DOD to share information and whatnot we&#x27;re still not getting that information down to those who need it like the cops on the ground right those folks who don&#x27;t necessarily have a national security clearance but they also have a need to know because if you want to stop and prevent terrorism or anything else you got to ultimately that information is useless unless it gets to the right people so I was brought in to work with DHS to try to figure out a way where we can take National level intelligence information and get it disseminated down in a way that didn&#x27;t that was still effect effective and useful but didn&#x27;t compromise National level secrets because these guys didn&#x27;t have a lot of these guys and gals at the local level didn&#x27;t have security clearances so you can&#x27;t share with them a secret document because they don&#x27;t have a secret security clearance so how do you do it well long story short I I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll spare you the details but you do it through terar lines and you do it through certain capabilities on automation that can strip out certain sources and methods information and still get most of the information that&#x27;s needed down to the level so that&#x27;s what I was brought there to do uh and then it was um as you said correctly um soon right soon after that uh is when I got exposed to the government&#x27;s UAP program UFO program okay and this is I believe Jim ly correct Dr lki yeah so um this is and this is what I I try to explain to people if you want to want to know a little bit about Jim he is the epitome of a rocket scientist literally a rocket scientist and in fact if you were to ask me in my opinion probably the world&#x27;s Premier rocket scientist certainly one of the best in the US government has ever had this is a guy that can tell you the burn rate of a first stage solid rocket motor booster he can tell you the trajectory and re-entry speed of a MV uh Warhead coming in from low earth orbit I mean this guy is amazing and so uh I didn&#x27;t know at the time but when I when I finally met him um you know he he actually looked like I hate to say typical rocket scientist but he had the glasses and you know the nice tie a little bit crooked and the hair he was more interested in doing the work than he was in his own appearance right because he&#x27;s a rocket scienti he&#x27;s got a real job to do uh and I remember him uh asking me a very blunt question uh at the end of our our first discussion together and uh he said to me he said uh what do you think about UF and this just came out of the blue I mean where was I wasn&#x27;t even even I&#x27;m like what and so I thought let me get my join out please yeah right I&#x27;m like is this uh is this a trick question like a psychological evow uh and so um I answered him truthfully I said I don&#x27;t and so he he kind of looked at me and he said what do you mean you do you not believe in UFOs and I said no I didn&#x27;t say that you asked me what do I think of UFOs and they said I don&#x27;t think about UFOs because frankly I don&#x27;t have the luxury to I&#x27;m too busy you ever thought about it before like on your own time no I was never into like a science fiction kid I wasn&#x27;t into Star Trek or Star Wars or anything like that I may have seen an episode coming home from school once because someone had on the TV but I couldn&#x27;t tell you anything about the story lines or anything like that I wasn&#x27;t I wasn&#x27;t overly interested in that stuff I was more of a more of a GI Joe kit and um yeah so long story short uh he said to me after that he said look I just want to warn you don&#x27;t let your your your personal or analytic bias get the best of you because what you might learn May challenge any preconceived notions or narratives that you have on the topic and I I found that very peculiar and and and realized very soon after that what he was saying was 100% legitimate why was he meeting with you and where was he meeting with you like what was the pretext here because obviously he dumps it on you in the meeting like hey what do you think of UFOs but that&#x27;s not that wasn&#x27;t what was what was on the schu there right so what earlier on I had several meetings with some people that were part of his program they had blue we call them blue Badgers is what I had is a member you&#x27;re a member of the intelligence community so that means you have the top secret seci security clearance you can get into any any building you need to so these folks had the ne requisite clearances and they were telling me that they have this program that&#x27;s very sensitive they need some Counter Intelligence support um which is my background um I I initially thought it was because of my background in advanced Aerospace Technologies I had spent an earlier part of my career doing technology protection for high energy lasers unman AO vehicle vehicles um tomaha Cru missiles Apache longbo avionics you know some Advanced space based systems um only later did I learn that they just needed a really good Counter Intelligence guy and security guy for this program they were worried in essence in the vacular they worried if the Russians or the Chinese you know were trying to penetrate the program so um that&#x27;s what I initially thought that this was it&#x27;s just another special access program another sensitive program in the US government you know not not really that uncommon and they just needed some EX expertise to to help them out was this first meeting in a skiff yeah in my building yeah yeah in my building so here here&#x27;s the problem when I when I wrote the book I actually put those details in there unfortunately the government redacted them so I&#x27;m not allowed to to say the specific location because were sensitive buildings uh but they were in the NCR national capital region um they were I can say very very close to Washington DC downtown I can&#x27;t say anything more than that um so a rundown townhouse that&#x27;s a safe house really masquerading for the CIA basically look you you can fill in the blanks as you want I I personally I&#x27;m going be filling them in all day I don&#x27;t look good in an orange jumpsuit so I&#x27;m going to I&#x27;m going to mind mind my manners here um and so uh yeah I went to I went to his location after they came to my location several times I went I went to his location uh again another undisclosed location in the DC area um looked like a normal building it was not and uh visit him I think it was on the 10th floor 10th or 10th floor all right that narrow is it down un ly star Googling I know someone&#x27;s going to be out there right now looking for all buildings that at least have that it&#x27;s got to be this one um so uh so yeah so I met him this place and then uh the rest as you say is is is history I guess yeah and and this whole concept of a skiff though this [ __ ] is so cool to me like cuz you talk about it so nonchalantly because you&#x27;re doing all the a lot of these meetings in in these places but essentially these are like they&#x27;re like container ships that are like blocked out from the world so that nothing no type of like counter Intel can get in there or something like do we just have Skiffs like sitting in the middle of the hallways in the Pentagon like how this how does this work we do so think look think of this room that we&#x27;re in here as a skiff right it&#x27;s it&#x27;s designed to be sound efficient meaning that we can have a conversation like this and you&#x27;re not going to get any outside noise from outside well a skiff is kind of the same way but in Reverse um we don&#x27;t want the noise in here being heard out there so you build a room that has been accredited to be a sensitive uh compartmented information facility um SCI facility so you have three levels of of classified information you have confidential you have secret and then you have top secret so think of like a rainbow while at that top tier of top secret there&#x27;s several categories within that that top secret so you have top secret SEI sap caps and some other things and so a skiff like you&#x27;re showing up there yeah we have it on the screen right is a and that skiff there is actually a tactical type skiff so that&#x27;s a mobile skiff so they&#x27;re built in a container as you see there um they are soundproof they&#x27;re also RF proof radio frequency proof so you can&#x27;t Eaves drop into a conversation um and those are those are portable ones now not all skips are portable right that that is that&#x27;s really something that was built uh for the initially for the Special Operations Community during right after 911 and you could put them on a boat put them on a plane and you could drop it off anywhere in the world and you could do what you needed to do yeah look at the soundboards in there too with Obama well and there&#x27;s also white noise makers I don&#x27;t know if you know what that is no so uh a white noise maker and you probably pull that up it creates a level a baseline level of Ambient sound to restrict people from if they do happen to hear as a glimpse of a conversation it confus them so those are those are are uh white noise makers and you&#x27;ll see those in the skips and then you have shielding um because bad guys are really good e dropping and there&#x27;s all sorts of ways to do it um another one is to coat if you most gifts don&#x27;t have Windows but those that do have special coating on the glass because if you know what you&#x27;re doing and I&#x27;ll be careful what I say here um there&#x27;s technology out there where you can allow the vibration of class and you know translate it into voice and sound and pick up on someone&#x27;s conversation so there there are these things that that um people do um in in the world of Espionage to try to collect information another very interesting program which I I can talk about now it&#x27;s unclassified type in the word Tempest and look at what Tempest means from a uh from a uh secure Communications and it will pull up um type it yeah Tempest secure communication there you go perfect okay andas can we click that first one Al yeah go ahead l so basically everything electronic gives off emanations right cameras this microphone everything computer monitor and so it&#x27;s possible if you know the frequency of the oscillations of of certain things in again I would careful of certain electronic equipment I can see what&#x27;s on your monitor your computer screen without ever looking at your computer screen and so you want to you want to prevent that by by having your conversations and having your equipment in these Skiffs so the bad guys can&#x27;t can&#x27;t collect information so skips are really really common they have to be accredited periodically but really it&#x27;s nothing more than than a room like this on steroids I mean you&#x27;re kind of like in a skiff yourself except for it&#x27;s the opposite you&#x27;re trying to limit noise from the outside coming in or the skiff is trying to limit noise from the inside going out but you&#x27;re telling me in like 20072 2008 this was standard technology we had oh absolutely it&#x27;s older that brother it goes back to the 70s man are you kidding me that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying I feel like darp is 50 years ahead man yeah that&#x27;s crazy so you&#x27;re doing all these initial meeting where you&#x27;re getting read in with like the Jim lais obviously all everything in a skiff everything in a skiff yeah you basically you go into a building go through a door that&#x27;s got a bunch of security codes then someone goes and says okay let me see your identification okay you&#x27;re good yep you got the blue badge which means you have commen amount and then if you go into certain like a sapf facility so if you think of skiff is something try getting into a sap F facility that&#x27;s like a vault within a vault within a vault right and that&#x27;s that is obscene level of security requirements um and uh yeah yeah and so I had I I worked out of one of those um they could kill you in there no one would ever know it oh or here yeah I mean it&#x27;s hermetically sealed in fact some of these are have uh well I I better not say but how often does that happen where they whag someone in there well I mean I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you would I it&#x27;s not a denial to be clear just that for the record truth be told um those are for for our guys we use we use sap fs and we use um SKS for our own people we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t you typically unless you have a security clearance you&#x27;re not getting into a skiff I mean you you there&#x27;s some exceptions to that if you know you&#x27;re being escorted and whatnot but for the most part you don&#x27;t get into a sapf unless you&#x27;re redon and you don&#x27;t get into a skiff unless You&#x27; got at least tssci U for the most part got it so I I think one of the things often gets mixed up online when people are looking at the alleged history here of like the program is the whole all saap and a tip thing it&#x27;s like eventually it was known as a we&#x27;ll get into that whole acronym and whatever soon but when you&#x27;re getting read in on this and then I guess within a few meetings brought in as the counter Intel guy my understanding is that this was when at the time Senator Harry Reid who was a major Senator and at one point the majority and minority leader in the Senate had basically started this thing called assap and was saying we need to look into not just our history with with UAP but we need to look into what this is from a national security threat perspective at the time was it already funded though like like was was this something that the rest of the other people in the Senate were read into or was this strictly like some kind of offshoot Harry Reids talking with you know people in the Pentagon and they&#x27;re doing this private team that no one knows about so great question let me wewi the tape here a little bit and see if I can help do a level set on this first of all it wasn&#x27;t necessarily just a Harry Reed thing a lot of people think oh it&#x27;s Harry Reed Pet Project no it wasn&#x27;t okay there was two other Senators that were involved you had Senator Ted Stevens from Alaska uh who was also a military veteran and you also had Senator Inu from Hawaii so he was bipartisan both Republican and Democrat love that yep absolutely right and these were senior dudes and who literally all were veterans and in some cases literally gave their right arm for for their country right um Stevens himself had his own UFO sighting his own UAP sighting while he was flying a mission then you also had Astronaut John Glenn at the time who was also part of this effort trying to push forward um now the impetus to that is still up for debate I can&#x27;t tell you in the early days of AAP because I wasn&#x27;t there I know there was a lot of people that say a lot of things what I can tell you personally because because Harry Reid told me before he died when it we&#x27;d see him periodically in Vegas and whatnot unfortunately um he passed away as everybody knows but um all right P yep absolutely rest in peace um he did some very good stuff for this country politics aside he did some very he was a patriot um so long story short uh he told me um that he had at one point when he was a senate majority leader he had been accidentally and I say accidentally you know quote because that&#x27;s what he said to me that he was read on to the UAP program and then very quickly they came back I think it was maybe the next couple days or a week later and he said Hey listen we need you to sign this document we accidentally read you onto something you shouldn&#x27;t know about and he was in sense he saywhat do you mean I&#x27;m not signing anything I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m the Senate Majority Leader I should be read onto every program that&#x27;s part of my job as the oversight I&#x27;m part of the gang uh that is responsible for all intelligence operation they said no you&#x27;re we&#x27;re reading you off administratively meaning we&#x27;re not we&#x27;re not going to even talk about this with you and so he indicated to me that he was really really upset and and this is how he started getting very vocal and about his concern that certain elements in the US government were hiding the truth about about UFO about UAP and so uh again I I can&#x27;t tell you what he did other than with assap because I wasn&#x27;t their Fort I can tell you what he told me and and there&#x27;s other individuals I can probably tell you earlier on like James lat or even even uh Jay Stratton will probably tell you more about the ASAP how it started so ASAP was a contract vehicle that looked at UAP but also looked at other stuff contract vehicle yeah contract vehicle is a mechanism by which the US government funds projects right so you have a contract because most people think oh the government does all the work they don&#x27;t they contract out they they subcontract oh yeah and so this is now we&#x27;re getting into the good stuff so this is where Bigalow uh Aerospace gets involved um he bids on the contract by the way people think oh was a sweetheart deal no it wasn&#x27;t in fact he was the only one to bet on the contract he had the expertise and the capabilities to do it his staff and OB by the way he funded a lot of this stuff himself out of his own you&#x27;re talking about Robert piga correct so people give him a lot of crap not realizing that the guy really is a patriot he&#x27;s done some incredible stuff for this country out of his own out of his own pocket so anyways long story short um the contract gets awarded and they start ASAP and ASAP is also looking at other things like for example the Skinwalker Ranch again things that I wasn&#x27;t really involved in my focus really was more and initially Counter Intelligence security then it became when a tip became a tip itself and the assap program kind of faded off when was that 2012 2013 so the contract for oap ended in 2012 I believe it went from 8 9 10 11 12 so 5 years and it it petered out we had requested another $10 million for fy13 and fy14 funds we did it under what we call year fiscal year right FY which is different than you government guys got all these goddamn terms and [ __ ] I know man it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an entire Forest of acronyms and I know I know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s his own language if you ever if you ever want to have a secret language conversation with somebody just talking government speak no one know what the hell you&#x27;re talking about E4 E5 that&#x27;s right um I have to tell you about this game-changing product I used before a night out with drinks it&#x27;s called zbiotics pre- alcohol pre- alcohol is the world&#x27;s first genetically engineered probiotic it was invented by PhD scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking when you drink alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in your gut it&#x27;s this byproduct not your dehydration that&#x27;s to blame for your rough next day pre- alcohol produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down just remember to make zbiotics your first drink of the night drink responsibly and you&#x27;ll feel your best tomorrow look I won&#x27;t lie I was a bit skeptical when I first heard about zbiotics but I recently had my buddy&#x27;s wedding and I figured why not let&#x27;s give it a try so I drank zbiotics before a night of great festivities and to my surprise I woke up the next morning feeling pretty damn good I was able to work out go for a walk take some calls clean my apartment life was good so whether it&#x27;s vacations weddings birthdays reunions or just a good night out make the most out of your

more focused on nuts and bolts so we were looking at military encounters aircraft encounters Navy ship encounters with UAP and things that we were picking up not just uh with gun camera footage and Fleer footage pod footage things that we could also cooporate with radar data hard data right and also Witnesses like the F-18 fighter pilots um that were coming up close in some cases very up close and personal to these things so you had several issues going on and so the a tip program was initially you know some people depending who you talk to and what day of the week it is they&#x27;ll tell you a slight variation of it I can&#x27;t tell you really much about ASAP because that wasn&#x27;t my focus I I can tell you about my involvement with atip um from my understanding from my observations because ATP became a very legitimate program and and to still recognize how you can talk to Harry Reed and other folks are like it was real you know I don&#x27;t have to tell you I know put it in memo yeah I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a real that&#x27;s what peace stands for a program now it may have started off in the early days before I came on board as a nickname or whatever it is I don&#x27;t doubt that but it was a real real program um towards certainly from 201 10 onwards um and as all saap faded away a tip kind of contracted um meaning it we we really we limited the number of contractors that were involved there were really only maybe five or six contractors we kept on board from like the loeds and the Norths and stuff like that I mean contract people I I don&#x27;t want to say their names right now because I don&#x27;t have permission to say their names oh you&#x27;re oh you&#x27;re referring more on an individual individual basis yeah so like a Bigalow but again I&#x27;m not putting names in your mouth I&#x27;m just saying yeah something like that uh where we had certain people um that had a a deep amount of expertise that was really really what we consider low density in the US government but the people who are involved with AAP when you come into it and a tip on the inside of the government it seems like that group is kind of the same it is transitioned it&#x27;s exactly my point well you just that&#x27;s what I was trying to allude to just now without saying people&#x27;s names so a lot of the the core expertise that were in ASAP came over to a and stayed with us right but there was also a lot that like ASAP I think with Bigalow and the contract had like I think the ini list was like hund and some people by the time we were really focus focusing on the E tip piece we had really very very few contractors most of the folks were government people at the Pentagon or at strategic command or within other agencies and it was it was it was not focused on the Skinwalker Ranch stuff after certainly after 2012 when the contract died we were we were focusing only on Military incur incursions into military controlled Aerospace uh oversensitive military installations um in and around our our ships and stuff like that so and you know it&#x27;s convoluted so it&#x27;s totally understandable when people I mean first of all the government&#x27;s already complicated let alone you know the nuances the eaches of each um so it it I totally totally get it and I think even even some assap and a tip guys might even be kind of confused because some of them weren&#x27;t there for every meeting right some of them weren&#x27;t necessarily brought into everything we were doing so including you technically sure absolutely yeah sure yeah so yeah cuz I I try to simplify these things and make it easier from a 30,000 ft view essentially it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re walking into places and there&#x27;s a giant sign on the door welcome to the atip meeting welcome to the AAP meaning it&#x27;s like get in the [ __ ] skiff and let&#x27;s talk about this right well look here&#x27;s a perfect example you you you and your producer right you guys work on this project together you&#x27;re in a lot of the same interviews together and yet he might go out get a cup of coffee you might go out and get a sandwich and you now get involved in a different conversation with somebody else out on the street and you come back you know but you&#x27;re not necessarily going to share every little Nuance of hey I went to get a Frappuccino and I ran into Bill and he told me his dog needs to be walked and just got shots at the vet you know it&#x27;s not that&#x27;s not realistic you know but essentially to keep it simple maybe the focus of the exact types of events you&#x27;re looking for or or context of UAP technically like has a shift or whatever between ASAP and ATP at the end of the day you guys are a group of government individuals who are read in on serious secret [ __ ] that even people above you technically in rank don&#x27;t know that is corre and you are you are evaluating the National Security implications of UAP which is the term you guys I guess were coming up with back then correct and there&#x27;s reasons for that you know people say well you why didn&#x27;t you just say UFOs stigma well that&#x27;s one that&#x27;s one but also the fact is it&#x27;s not even accurate right so when the word UFO started getting used back I guess 50s and 60s um what does UFO mean unidentified flying object well what&#x27;s flying well flying is let&#x27;s say this is a plane right there&#x27;s four fundamental forces you have thrust lift drag and weight and when you understand that you create wings and wings create lift and then you fly that&#x27;s what flight is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s lift these things don&#x27;t have wings they don&#x27;t have ruter they don&#x27;t have control surfaces they don&#x27;t have aons they don&#x27;t even have cockpits sometimes so they&#x27;re not really flying they&#x27;re in there they&#x27;re in the sky but they&#x27;re not really flying in a conventional sense and also we see them underwater oh and also might see them in low earth orbit so you don&#x27;t fly underwater right so you you do other things underw but that&#x27;s not actually technically flying so there were several reasons first of all stigma taboo with the UFO term but also it wasn&#x27;t accurate and then it became unidentified aerial phenomenon and then it got changed to what unidentified anomalous phenomenon because we&#x27;re now we&#x27;re talking multiple domains we&#x27;re talking multiple environments that we are we are encountering these these things in and so I think part of the effort was just to make the term more accurate yes remove the stigma and taboo Associated but at the same time be more precise in our in our in our verbiage yeah so when you first like agree to be brought in on this though you&#x27;ve had a few conversations obviously you can&#x27;t go home and have pillow talk with your wife about this stuff this is this is pure intelligence so you are you&#x27;re walking out of Skiffs and you&#x27;re living with the information unable to speak with anyone about it and like you said in the first meeting when lki asks you have you thought about UFOs and you&#x27;re like no well now suddenly you&#x27;re thinking about UFOs uaps right do you have a moment where I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s like you laugh to yourself like is this really my life like are we doing this or you&#x27;re like holy [ __ ] like this stuff&#x27;s real and I didn&#x27;t like was there this reality moment where you&#x27;re just sitting outside and looking into the looking into the sky going oh my God like what am I getting myself into here yeah so there&#x27;s typically two in my experience and I can&#x27;t speak for other people I&#x27;ve noticed two types of people how they how they deal with this information first of all when you have a security clearance and you&#x27;re read on to a lot of programs it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really hard to be surprised because you learn a lot of things and you kind of start getting I want to say numb but used to the idea that you&#x27;re going to learn a lot of things that most Americans are never going to know about till the day they die um and so it&#x27;s not really that big of a deal this is a little different because you&#x27;ve been told for so long that it&#x27;s BS right now it&#x27;s like well okay wait a minute so the two types of people I&#x27;ve noticed there&#x27;s this group of people that have this aha revelatory moment and I&#x27;ve seen it when I&#x27;ve been briefing them even at the Pentagon it&#x27;s like oh my God it hits them like a ton of bricks like you mean they&#x27;re real like this is real like no kidding this isn&#x27;t a joke and it&#x27;s this this kind of this um revelatory moment where where it&#x27;s like an epiphany right and then there&#x27;s the other group of people which I probably fall under uh which is more of a slow and steady gradual realization that we&#x27;re dealing with something that&#x27;s certainly not conventional it&#x27;s definitely not our technology and there&#x27;s a really high likelihood it&#x27;s not adversarial technology and um that&#x27;s been my experience and that&#x27;s that that&#x27;s the way I I came to terms with this it wasn&#x27;t this you know I left the meeting all of a sudden we&#x27;re talking about aliens you know we talking about UFOs that wasn&#x27;t the case for to me it was always well could this be adversarial technology could this be Russian could this be Chinese right is there some sort of and as you continue to go down and and you start getting more and more details and facts you start realizing okay well it&#x27;s definitely not Russian could it be Chinese well let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let&#x27;s see what the red Force Technologies are right let&#x27;s see what their capabilities are because it&#x27;s not just technology like hey I see this thing flying as this Chinese it&#x27;s okay what does it take for this thing to do what it&#x27;s doing right and do they have that technology to do it it&#x27;s not just simple as saying oh yeah that that&#x27;s clearly Russian or Chinese because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not just the object it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the signature of the object and I got to be careful not to go into a lot of detail on that because signature sometimes signature information is more important than than identifying the object itself because you can recognize performance characteristics through data collection that you can&#x27;t necessarily get visually or optically and so can you explain that a little more yeah sure uh I I don&#x27;t look good in an orange jumpsuit so let me explain this uh I&#x27;m testing your physics here yeah I was on the phone with Jack sarfati last night he&#x27;s like ask him some Physics questions he thinks he&#x27;s a physicist oh I&#x27;m not a physicist at all no no i&#x27; I&#x27;m definitely not a physicist not even close um so a signature is kind of like um a boat in the water right we so here in this your wonderful Studio you&#x27;ve got the water nearby and you see the boats going by um signature data is looking at not necessarily the boat but the type of wake the boat makes in the water the sound the boat makes right the perturbance in the water and if you look at the back of the Wake does it have two streams or one stream I can tell you if it has two engines or one engine right um for example look at a plane flying up ahead you can tell the difference between a small Jet and a big jet because usually you have more engines on a big Jet right you can see the contrails so separate contrails from each engine also there&#x27;s an acoustic signature right is it a military combat plane that&#x27;s breaking the sound barrier because you would hear that that&#x27;s a signature right or is it sounding like just a regular passenger jet at 35,000 ft so so signature data can tell you a lot about things that the looking at the object hand they can tell you velocity and trajectory they can tell you all sorts of extra details that the physical object itself can&#x27;t tell you so signature data is very very important okay so does that make sense I try to get another example if you need me to no I I I I think that&#x27;s pretty good the thing with you is that if we get stuck on so many rabbit holes we&#x27;re going to be here for like 36 straight hours I know there&#x27;s so much here but when you you&#x27;re asking me about intelligence right so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a lifelong journey oh my God yeah yeah and and it&#x27;s like you know you don&#x27;t at the beginning you don&#x27;t know the scope of it at all you you just realize okay we are all right I&#x27;m being told that there&#x27;s some real [ __ ] out there that we can&#x27;t really identify so yes that&#x27;s a meaning of life crisis potentially but you don&#x27;t know how much what the volume is how how many of these allege sightings are even real and then you start getting pulled on or pulled into the actual intelligence and in your book the description of the colares meeting feels like a [ __ ] Team America Meetup because you get pulled into this skiff with Legends of the game how put off jacqu valet Eric Davis I think was in there well that was actually a dinner that was not a in a ski believe it or not it was a it was not in a skiff negative no it was actually you&#x27;re just sitting in an Olive Garden talking about this well not an Olive Garden but but no and it was it was it was the room had been you know fairly secured okay uh but we weren&#x27;t sharing uh us Secrets it was somebody else a foreign National that was sharing their their experiences with us so technically it&#x27;s not classified right um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just just them telling us classification classified information only applies to information that is US government derived that&#x27;s class nice little loop around right here well you know like I said there&#x27;s there&#x27;s ways to have conversations you know and then there&#x27;s right ways to have conversations and then there&#x27;s definitely ways not to have conversation but it seems like between the the Cadre of incredible individuals that you had in this room that you&#x27;re like whoa in between I think Bigalow was in there too in between that and what you were hearing from in this case Brazilian counterparts about what happened in Karis this was a huge moment for you where you&#x27;re like wo so would you mind just explaining what when this case was and what allegedly happened and what you were told in that meeting yeah and and let me you know put this out bluntly I&#x27;m not an expert in the kis investigation I wasn&#x27;t there for the investigation I was there for the for one of the you know if you will the debriefings so to speak um from this from this General General um it&#x27;s in a nutshell without going too far down the rabbit hole um Brazil had been experiencing some UAP issues and in some cases these U UAP or UFO encounters were were disruptive to the local population and so there is a area in brail called kadis where uh these incidents became so prevalent that the U the Brazilian government became involved and they sent one of their top generals uh you know to go I hate to say it but to go knock heads right because when things get really out of hand he sent in the military um they wanted to get control of the situation see what&#x27;s really going on is this just BS or whatnot so they sent in their military and their military and they sent in doctors and other investigators and um the result of which was yeah that these guys were actually some of the Brazilian soldiers were injured by by UAP um and had experienced in the things themselves and so it wasn&#x27;t just like going sending the military to debrief a bunch of civilians they were having experiences as well and some of these individuals were being injured yeah what do we when you say injuries what was the scope and and what was the evidence they showed you there sure well it seemed to be primarily the injuries were like some sort of directed energy think of like a laser or perhaps a burn where you have a superficial burn some folks reported uh other um other issues uh possibly consistent with directed energy more internal organ damage um and then some people had some terrifying experiences as reported by them uh in some cases uh not just being terrified but potentially even being being pursued by these by these UFOs by these UAP which is by the way fundamentally different than a lot of the experiences that people people may report here in the United States you know people here tend to to tend to feel they&#x27;re a little bit more benign well down there they definitely had the impression these things were were were not benevolent they were malevolent now I also want to draw a distinction here um it is possible it is certainly possible that some of these injuries were not deliberate right they&#x27;re just a a simple process of the technology so what I always say is look when you go to an airport and you jump 737 there&#x27;s no real threat but if you go on the tarmac onto the runway right of that and you go behind the jet engine while it&#x27;s spooling up you&#x27;re now going to yeah there&#x27;s a threat right it&#x27;s not intentional but you&#x27;re going to get burned you&#x27;re probably going to lose your hearing and maybe even worse it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just a product of the technology it&#x27;s a part of the propulsion it doesn&#x27;t mean to hurt you it&#x27;s just you got too close to it when it was spooling up so that is also part of the calculus that we try to look at say okay was this in I know you might that it was intentional but was really intentional right if I again go on the road here and I stay on the middle of the road I&#x27;m probably going to get run over by a car right that intentional probably not but you know I&#x27;m at the wrong place at the wrong time so those are some of the other considerations as well I always try to keep an open mind um the folks at ATP always tried to keep a very open mind um we actually approach investigations with the exact opposite approach that people think they came in oh you guys were trying to investigate UFOs no we actually worked our butts off off to find prosaic explanation first because praic explanation praic meaning um a normal explanation right so oh what you&#x27;re seeing there is actually the contrail of a cruise missile that was being test fired over Vandenberg at this particular date at this particular time that&#x27;s not a UFO or what you&#x27;re looking at is a uh those lights on the horizon are actually on the Mast of a sailboat It&#x27;s Over the Horizon but you can see the Mast because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a little bit higher and that&#x27;s a navigational light you&#x27;re seeing or an anchor light or oh actually what you&#x27;re seeing is so we went into looking an incidence with prosaic explanations trying to say okay this is pro more than likely something that is just being misidentified the problem is and this is why the five observables were so helpful because once you lay that data over the five observables and they start fitting into those categories now you&#x27;ve got something that is outside the normal parameters of something conventional can you define the five observables for people yeah sure um the first one is you want me to go into a little detail of each as well okay so the first observable is instantaneous acceleration so what is instantaneous acceleration uh well acceleration uh is a a change in velocity so if I&#x27;m driving 50 m hour and I kick up the gas to 100 milph I am changing my velocity how quickly I achieve that speed there are inertial forces inertial forces that are experienced and we we we call those forces we equate to them on a scale called a G Force 1 G is the effect of Earth&#x27;s gravity on us 9.8 m/s per second per second squared because of the mass of the Earth we all experience gravity relatively equal and so uh if in comparison if I do a high G maneuver in a combat aircraft that&#x27;s about up to a 9g which is a lot nine times the force of gravity so now your head goes from being 14 lbs to now you know almost 100 lbs plus right so and that&#x27;s your whole body so now you you&#x27;re you you weigh over a th000 pounds when you&#x27;re pulling these maneuvers we wear gits to negate that effect and the human being can withstand about 9 G forces for a short period of time before you start having medical consequences and ultimately death right you have blackouts and red outs and and you die to compare that to our technology we have one of our most highly maneuverable man aircraft Mann aircraft it&#x27;s an old aircraft but it&#x27;s still one of the most highly maneuverable is the General Dynamics F16 the F-16 uh at the unclassified level can pull about 17 G&#x27;s before you start having structural failure meaning Wings begin to snap off and that&#x27;s the F-16 right there right the Falcon um highly maneuverable um now we have other vehicles that are unmanned that can you know perform much more than that but but that is that&#x27;s pretty much the limitations of of a man vehicle okay what we are seeing are objects that are performing at 2,000 3,000 4,000 G forces right so well beyond the healthy limitations of anything biological to withstand and certainly well well beyond anything from a Material Science perspective so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s observable one the second observable is Hypersonic velocity now what is Hypersonic velocity it is five technically it&#x27;s five times the speed of sound so speed of sound Mach 1 is roughly 760 some miles hour at sea level um so you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re booking right multiply that by five and you&#x27;re you&#x27;re put that in comparison an average uh commercial jet fly is about 550 M hour if you&#x27;re lucky with you know with the good Tailwind um now do we have aircraft that can do that we do we have for example the locki yf12a SR71 aka the Blackbird it can fly about Mach 5 you can but when it wants to do a right-and turn it takes roughly half the state of Ohio to do it right these things are not flying at 3,200 x m hour some of these UAP are flying at 10,000 14,000 miles an hour and they&#x27;re doing it in a low low earth atmosphere environment where that the the the co the friction coefficient is is really really high and they&#x27;re not taking a you know a slow steady turn they&#x27;re doing instant 180s 90 degree turns so you have to scratch your head and say well who has that technology right so the third observable it&#x27;s a bit of an oxymoron um it&#x27;s called it&#x27;s low observability meaning it&#x27;s hard to see with a naked eye you see something but it doesn&#x27;t look like anything you&#x27;ve ever seen before it&#x27;s hard to explain even on radar data it&#x27;s coming back the the radar is suggesting there&#x27;s some sort of jamming potentially going on or some sort of spoofing going on on the on the radar systems and then the fourth and by the way do we have low observability yeah we do we&#x27;ve got we&#x27;ve got aircraft that are super sleek and and they&#x27;re hard to see we have stealth bombers right like the B2 bomber and the valkyrie that we have to lower the cross-section just a little bit so we can sneak in under the radar um these things are different we&#x27;re not talking about stealth technology we&#x27;re talking about something fundamentally different and then the the fourth observable is something called trans medium travel yes forgive me so what is trans medium traveler it is the ability to operate in multiple domains what&#x27;s a domain it&#x27;s an environment um so we are seeing these things operating in lower atmosphere underwater in the air do we have transm medium technology we do look we&#x27;ve had them for for decades look at a sea plane perfect example a sea plane can fly in the air and it can float on the water but let&#x27;s face it a SE plane is neither a really good plane or a really good boat because it&#x27;s a compromise and so the more environments you want to compromise and perform in the more of a sacrifice there is to Performance and design it&#x27;s the reason why the space shuttle came in and glided down like a brick it wasn&#x27;t a very good plane because it was compromised because it spent a lot of its time up in space so it&#x27;s hard to make a it&#x27;s just why it&#x27;s the reason why a submarine looks like a submarine and a jet looks like a jet because they spend most of their time in that one environment right if you want an object to operate in multiple environments there&#x27;s more sacrifices to your design and your performance capabilities that&#x27;s just the way it is we&#x27;re not seeing that with these UAP they are able without having to change their performance or their their design they can operate seemingly and seamlessly both in air and underwater and possibly even outer space so we&#x27;re talking about a something that&#x27;s really beyond what we currently have in our inventory and then the last observable which is a terrible word in in the science Community which is anti-gravity yeah but it&#x27;s not anti-gravity in the literal sense it&#x27;s it&#x27;s simply the ability to defy the effects of Earth&#x27;s gravity without the associated Technologies so we talked a bit earlier about flight right with wings so there&#x27;s really only three ways we know how to fly right now and how we can defy Earth&#x27;s gravity one is through flight itself we just talked about that the other way is through um buoyancy so think think of a hot air balloon think of a helium balloon where you have a cavity and inside that cavity it&#x27;s less dense than outside and so it will rise till it reaches its equilibrium right that&#x27;s that&#x27;s how hot air balloons work and and myar balloons and things like that and then the other way is uh simple physics um Force equals mass times acceleration um put enough energy behind something and it will go it&#x27;s called ballistics right to think of an ICBM an intercontinental ballistic missile where you put enough thrust behind it and you can have it literally counter the effects of Earth&#x27;s gravity take thing same thing as a baseball take a baseball throw it in the air that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that is that is ballistic if you will um energy you&#x27;re putting energy into something uh Newton&#x27;s law of gravity for every action there&#x27;s an equal opposite reaction and it goes and it moves for a little while um we&#x27;re not seeing that these things don&#x27;t have any obvious signs of lift they don&#x27;t have any obvious signs of propulsion they don&#x27;t seem to have a cavity in there for buoyancy and yet somehow they are able to defy the natural effects of Earth&#x27;s gravity so now when you have an object that you&#x27;ve detected on radar that you have electrooptical data that the pilots are reporting and they&#x27;re fitting into these categories right now you realize okay this isn&#x27;t a drone this isn&#x27;t a quadcopter this isn&#x27;t a balloon this isn&#x27;t you know you&#x27;re dealing with a fundamentally different type of technology and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s when ATP really gets involved that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s like okay we&#x27;re dealing with something I mean could it be a red Force technology it might but if it is we&#x27;re in a lot of trouble because we&#x27;ve been seeing these things for a very long time over our controlled us airspace over our sensitive military installations um and so it&#x27;s obviously from that perspective we it is a national security issue for sure 100% yeah now we got into this tangent that was a great explanation by the way but we got into this talking about it in relation to the Karis incident so what what about that incident and maybe some more details of of exactly what happened would help here but what about that incident made how put off and Jack and these guys go yes matches all the observables we think this one&#x27;s real you&#x27;d have to ask them I I think it was the evidence um and the testimony if you will by by uchoa and military personnel that reported to him um it was very well documented so you know you may consider Karis as almost a the Roswell of Brazil um it was they had a lot of Manpower behind this and you know Ooa was a was a serious dude he wasn&#x27;t you know just some guy who Flights of Fancy he was fourstar General in Brazil in Brazil yeah um so you know you you have to look at it from from that perspective um you know they they&#x27;re not amateurs by by any stretch so I think that probably is one of the reasons why that but you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s just one example that&#x27;s just an incident that&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s at the end of the day it was very interesting to me I don&#x27;t know how valuable it was didn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t change anything for me it didn&#x27;t change my view or my I you know I&#x27;ve always told people my background um I went to to college to study science I I studied microbiology immunology and and parasitology not parasoy parasitology the study of parasites microorganisms and then later in my career I was an investigator um special agent so you know I was always consider myself just the fax man kind of guy um I&#x27;m not really interested in Inu windows and supposition I just just give me the data and we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll let the data speed pick the wrong field for that boy ain&#x27;t that the truth brother man you ain&#x27;t kidding um yeah don&#x27;t I know um so again we we tried to approach the UAP topic the same as we did anything else right whether you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re hunting terrorists or spies or you hunting UFOs um there&#x27;s there&#x27;s an applied methodology when you&#x27;re looking at these things it&#x27;s not just you know Grandma saw some lights in the backyard I mean this is we&#x27;re well beyond that we&#x27;re using really sophisticated capabilities um you know you&#x27;ve got some of the best trained individuals like on the Spy one radar people don&#x27;t neize this but the the the radar operator on the USS Princeton was also Top Gun trained people think oh only fighter pilots go to Top Gun no they don&#x27;t the radar operators can also go to Top Gun and they are there to support these guys who are flying combat missions these guys and gals um and so uh I remember Kevin Day actually saying explaining one time that it was it was for days it was raining UFOs at the Spy onead so what is the Spy radar so um let&#x27;s say this is a radar so the radar were really invented towards the end of World War II they were used to try to identify uh enemy aircraft that were coming in Over the Horizon before you could hear them before you see them you want to know that they&#x27;re coming so you don&#x27;t get surprise um but radar data back then and Radars were very primitive they basically sent out a signal and that signal bounced off an object and returns back to to uh to to the radar array The Radars we have now The multi-array Radars are kind of like um a super type of of radar where you have rather than just just one radar you&#x27;ve got multiple Radars all in different slightly different frequencies so you can get really good pinpoint Fidelity on what you&#x27;re trying to track okay and also you can also send these signals way far you can you can adjust you know you got to be a little careful with this but there it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot more it&#x27;s a lot smarter technology so you get a lot more Fidelity and in this case the Spy one raidar as you see radar as you see up here uh in on the Princeton this could pick up a baseball at 80,000 F feet now think about that 80,000 ft right that&#x27;s that&#x27;s look if if you ain&#x27;t breathing up there no you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re talking about probably 17 miles away yeah and you&#x27;re tracking with an electronic piece of equipment a baseball I mean that that&#x27;s and it could probably even do more than that but that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what that&#x27;s what they claim um and then you have Airborne radar right you have like for example the E2 Hawkeye which is a a radar platform flying radar platform if you pull a picture up of a E2 Hawkeye I can explain that for you a little bit too because it&#x27;s important because these are the radar systems that were being used and are used even today to to prosecute combat missions so this is an E2 Hawkeye um and you can see that big big dish on the top and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a radar that&#x27;s a radar all it is is a flying radar uh and you can dial in and tune into you know with a great deal of fidelity objects and it gives you this um air air control and Supremacy in the sky when you&#x27;re flying combat Mission so you&#x27;ve got cabbas radar and Airborne radar and some landbased radar all detecting the same thing while at the same time you have gun camera footage while at the same time maybe Fleer pod footage while at the same time you have you have Pilots that are also actually seeing this thing so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s count these up for a second right so you&#x27;ve got maybe five or six sources of information different collection capabilities all reporting the same event at the same time at the same place under the same circumstance right so if this was a court of law always I told people look we&#x27;re Beyond Reasonable Doubt I mean this is this is the same equipment we use to you know put Warheads on foreheads and it works so you know you&#x27;re you&#x27;re questioning it now when we&#x27;ve been using it for for decades and and it works so this is why I think you know if a tip contributed anything it it it contributed a level of rigor behind the UAP topic from a national security issue and I want to be clear because a lot of people say you know fearmongering it&#x27;s a na it&#x27;s a national security threat I never said it was a threat said it&#x27;s an issue because we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a threat in in government parlament there&#x27;s there&#x27;s it it&#x27;s a very easy it&#x27;s a very simple calculus to determine if something is a threat there&#x27;s only two pieces it&#x27;s capabilities versus intent now we&#x27;ve seen some of the capabilities we have no idea the intent so it&#x27;s impossible to say it&#x27;s a threat and so one of the examples I I use a lot of times um and uh I don&#x27;t mean it to scare people but this is kind of how how I see the issue from a national security issue um you know you you live in a beautiful area here uh I won&#x27;t say where uh but people know it&#x27;s h to school do do you lock your front door at night before you go to bed [ __ ] yeah yeah me too me too you know probably most Americans even though you don&#x27;t expect anything bad to happen probably a good idea to lock your door before you go to bed Y and some folks may even go the step forward uh step further they might just check their Windows to make sure they&#x27;re locked especially if they live on a lower floor and and they might even turn their alarm system on before they go to bed let&#x27;s say one Sunday morning you walk downstairs to have a nice hot cup of coffee or tea and as you walk downstairs you see size 11 muddy bootprints in your living room carpet that were not there the night before now no one&#x27;s been hurt nothing&#x27;s out of place nothing&#x27;s been stolen but despite you locking the door that night before and checking the windows and turning on your alarm system there are now bootprints in your living room carpet that were not there the night before my question to you is is that a threat and so my response is it could be if it wanted to be so we should probably figure out how the hell they getting into the house it&#x27;s the same thing with this we&#x27;ve got we have these these technologies that are being deployed over our controlled us airspace over our most sensitive military installations and quite possibly that potentially interfere with our nuclear equities is that a problem well if these things had a Russian star on the tail or a North Korean tail number You&#x27; damn right you you be on the front page newspaper right you were saying people inside the Pentagon though were kind of like when you when you literally couldn&#x27;t say it it had a sticker of another country on there they&#x27;re like ah what are we worried about anyway right like so it&#x27;s almost like they needed The Branding to car that happened in in 2022 on ABC Secretary of the Air Force Kendall said yeah we know they&#x27;re there but you know this not really a priority right now we we don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re from there not a priority does that drive you nuts well listen let me ask you this if a sub were to pop out of the pomac and it be some sort of ballistic submarine that doesn&#x27;t have a flag on it would that be concern to you yeah absolutely right I mean what what do you mean it&#x27;s not a concern because we don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s insane you know how that is the that&#x27;s the antithesis that&#x27;s the opposite of National Security yes that is most important because until you know who that is it can be a problem and so yeah it drives me crazy because you know people say well we have other priorities what other prity do you have than that there&#x27;s a technology that can come in unimpeded anytime anywhere and there&#x27;s not a damn thing you can do about it but because you can&#x27;t explain it you don&#x27;t want to have the conversation um I hate to tell you this but that&#x27;s a problem you yeah now you talk about there being three possibilities though with these things that they&#x27;re benevolent benevolent or they&#x27;re neutral right I think I think one thing that&#x27;s that&#x27;s an interesting point to get into with this is is the nuclear history because you just brought it up yourself so so let&#x27;s go there when I look at the different sightings that have largely happened not just in America but in other places around the world where these UAP are identified at at often military bases where there are nuclear weapons or on tankers like the USS Roosevelt or something like that where there are nuclear weapons present carrier carrier carrier I&#x27;m sorry so when I when I see that I say that cuz my Navy buddies would be telling me you correct him yeah listen I&#x27;m from Jersey don&#x27;t take it personally but you know when when I see these patterns and I see that despite as having this technology since the Manhattan Project in the 1940s the fact that since Hiroshima and Nagasaki no nuclear bombs have been detonated in a Warf footing type scenario meaning they&#x27;ve been detonated in tests around the world and stuff so they&#x27;ve been allowed to happen when I see that and I hear stories like these things are [ __ ] with our nuclear reactors and telling us like no no no no like the old Bob Salis story it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re taking matches out of a hand hands of a baby it almost seems like they&#x27;re watching us like a god a little bit if this is the case to make sure we don&#x27;t destroy ourselves so I interviewed a number of eyewitnesses regarding that aspect of the phenomenon and that is particularly during the Cold War the height of the Cold War they are witnessed in Russia and all scattered across the United States and this launch control officer Robert Salas I&#x27;ll never forget this he said well James the message I got when they shut our nukes off it&#x27;s almost like they were taking matches out of the hands of a [Music] baby you know I tend to think that these it&#x27;s almost like whoever they are be we can get into this later be they future humans be they aliens be they some [ __ ] civilization or something it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re telling you no no no don&#x27;t do that you guys have gotten too much power that said your argument is more that yo this looks a little more manev malevolent to me because they&#x27;re they&#x27;re basically they&#x27;re showing us they can take our capabilities and they&#x27;re and they&#x27;re [ __ ] with whether or not they&#x27;re these things are actually going to go into you know whatever the pre-launch codes are then who&#x27;s to say like they wouldn&#x27;t go off or something like that my point is why would that why would it not have happened then why would it be the pattern that literally none of them have gone off since 1946 well we made that decision we made that nope no one did that but us we decided as a world we&#x27;re not going to drop them on each other at least not yet but let&#x27;s let&#x27;s look at this poorly speaking so in 1945 we vaporized almost 800,000 Souls off this planet yeah dropping two bombs Hiroshima and Nagasaki okay UAP did not stop that they were not there when we were going from the atomic age to the nuclear age okay which is by the way goes from kiloton yield to megaton yield right now we have the power to literally erase entire cities off the map vaporized completely there were no there were nowhere to be found or stop us from testing these things in the Nevada desert they were nowhere to be found to stop the proliferation now of nuclear weapons getting into the hands of countries like oh I don&#x27;t know North Korea right and all these other count I went from one country us to now everybody&#x27;s got nukes okay&#x27;s a great guy I trust him yeah that wonderful boyish face um so and then you look at things like um Three Mile Island you look at uh Chernobyl you look at Fukushima they didn&#x27;t stop that right so so there isn&#x27;t any information to suggest that it&#x27;s necessarily here to help and they haven&#x27;t stopped you know world hunger and pandemics and things like that so there really isn&#x27;t a whole lot of information to substantiate that people it feels good oh they&#x27;re here to take matches out of the hands of children but and they always say you know well look what happened up in up in uh with uh with the flight I think it was November flight um might be Oscar flight uh of our nukes when entire flight of missiles were brought down off fly allegedly by UFO people like oh see they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re turning them off yeah but in Russia they turn them on right because they have an opposite where we have to put our fingers on the on the proverbial buttons they have they have like a dead man switch their fingers are always on the button and when it comes off that&#x27;s when they go you know proverbially speaking so uh you know Russians are very clever um you know assured Mutual destruction and so uh you know and over there there&#x27;s reports of them turning them on so so there is nothing nothing to suggest that they&#x27;re necessarily helping us now let me put on two different hats here okay one is a national security hat and by the way it&#x27;s different than the way I feel my I I can have two different perspectives and and unbelievable absolutely I didn&#x27;t know that was possible absolutely yeah sure so there is my National Security hat right okay what do I do see I do see these things very interested in our military equities I see their ability to interfere with their nuclear capabilities um and I see them particularly over our c of military installations what does that look like to me that looks like preparation of the battle space it looks like ISR intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance it looks like an active campaign to understand our capabilities now that&#x27;s my National Security hat right so if you&#x27;re paying me as a three star general to think on behalf of the American people if there&#x27;s even a 5% chance he thinks could do something bad to us then my job is to make sure that gets down to 0 per. now let me take that hat off for a second to put on my Louis elisondo hat okay do I see any evidence that they&#x27;re here to harm us as a species or whatever it is no I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t but but let me now put on my my my special agent hat on right third hat yeah third hat now got got a whole bunch of them on the shelf right so you come to me and you say Lou um listen I&#x27;ve got this problem um went to sleep last night and I had this crazy experience I I woke up and I was being taken somewhere um somewhere I didn&#x27;t want to go but I was being taken there uh okay well that&#x27;s kidnapping it&#x27;s Federal Federal Char youve been taken away from against your will yeah when I was there Lou they were they were touching me they were doing these things to me and it scared me okay well that that&#x27;s assault okay another another felony fence keep keep going right so that&#x27;s not a nice thing and you know I&#x27;ve got daughters if my daughter got into an Uber and she wanted to go to the mall and instead they took her somewhere else that&#x27;s kidnapping yes right that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not a nice thing you&#x27;re talking about experiencers who say they were abducted right now who claim that they&#x27;ve been abducted right abduction think of the word abduction yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a crime that&#x27;s a felony baby you ever did you ever come across cases that you felt had a great burden of proof evidence to prove that that had actually happened because you know how a lot of people are skeptical of this and to be fair you and I were having a great conversation before the cameras were rolling about how unfortunately in this space so many people are like I just want to [ __ ] believe and they believe everything every single case no matter what and actually sets the stigma back further it absolutely does and this is where we get into the conversation of True Believer and true Skeptics right they&#x27;re really one and the same I know they seem opposite sides of the spectrum but the mentality mentality is the same and this is not an attack on anybody so let me just preface that but a True Believer no matter what information you provide them they will always always believe that everything they hear is correct and then you have the professional skeptic that no matter what evidence is provided they will never accept the fact that their narrative could be wrong so those two folks those two sides of the of the of the equation are really never my focus um people always say well you know are you trying to tell us they&#x27;re real I&#x27;m not trying to tell you anything my job is to provide the the data and the facts and allow you guys to decide what it means to you and this is why I&#x27;ve always said to people don&#x27;t shoot the messenger and don&#x27;t ask me what I think because it doesn&#x27;t matter what I think what matters what you think there&#x27;s so many people in the UFO community that want to tell you what they think because they have the answer they have the solution and they&#x27;re the only ones they have a monopoly on thought and unless you agree with them then you&#x27;re crazy right and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s across the board I think the approach we need to take is look let&#x27;s put all narratives aside whether they&#x27;re from outer space Inner Space or space in between here are the here are the facts here are the facts of what we are dealing with we are dealing with a technology that is real we are dealing with a technology that is interested in our equities we are dealing with the technology that can outperform anything we have that we do know what do we know we don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re from we don&#x27;t know what they want we don&#x27;t know what they intend we don&#x27;t know a whole bunch of other stuff we don&#x27;t know motivation maybe there is no motivation right we&#x27;re looking at things through anthropomorphic eyes you and me are human beings so we judge everything based upon this why we give our dogs people names because we we are we are whether we realize it or not we are imposing our own understanding of of of what it means to be a human onto everything else and presume everything else is like us but that&#x27;s not necessarily the case especially when you&#x27;re dealing with things like let&#x27;s say oh I don&#x27;t know artificial intelligence where it&#x27;s binary there is no motivation intent it just is right um and so we have to really limit ourselves from going down that temptation of assuming everything is like us everything has motivation everything has the same type of desires that we have um and we do that all the time we do it subconsciously and let me if I can digress here for a second um hubris is is really ultimately responsible for this because we are a species where we have pride and ego and we have a narrative in our head and rather than in the face of new data and facts reframe our own narrative we reject that data and hold on to our own narrative because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s this is what I believe and therefore any new information must be wrong right and let me give you some examples I I went to like I said University of Miami um and i&#x27; I&#x27;ve always consider myself a disciple of science um I believe in the scientific method scientific principles right um I believe in physics I believe in mathematics um it works and and uh when I was in college I learned that it was the Greek so if you look at modern human Homo Sapien sapian most anthropologists agree that modern humans have been around for the last 100,000 to 200,000 years okay as a modern human being and if you look at that it wasn&#x27;t until the last 2,000 years that we realize there&#x27;s only two dominant life forms on this planet you are either a plant or you are an animal it was the Greeks who who recognized that and humans being an animal uh if you look at a 24-hour clock right so 200,000 years ago and then 2,000 years ago it&#x27;s really just the last maybe 10 minutes we realize that and it wasn&#x27;t until the Renaissance 300 years ago uh during the days of Enlightenment that we recognized and discovered an entirely other form of life on this planet that we&#x27;ve been sharing all along that is neither nor animal and that is the world of fungus and so we tap ourselves on the shoulder and say wow what a great great discovery and it wasn&#x27;t until the last maybe 5 Seconds of our existence as Modern Man on this planet last 120 years think about it that we had the technology to actually discover the true dominant or Alpha life form on this planet and in fact if you take all the biomass of every plant and all the biomass of every animal and all the biomass of every fungus and add it all up together it still does not up to this life hidden life form that has been on this planet longer than any of us and that is the world of microorganisms it&#x27;s the things that are inside you that make you up that live on the skin of the ISS space station and can Thrive miles beneath the crushing depth of the Arctic Ice it&#x27;s everywhere and it wasn&#x27;t until we could have the technology to curve glass and look through a little metal tube and and famously shout the words little beasties little beasties did we discover for the first time the true dominant Alpha life form on this planet that&#x27;s been here all along and so until we discover the next one here all along 100% you&#x27;re tracking right until we discover the next one and that&#x27;s why oh this is the greatest discovery in UAP that mankind no it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s just just another one we&#x27;re always if there&#x27;s one thing mankind is right about is that we&#x27;re fact that we&#x27;re usually wrong A lot of times when I grew up in science I was told and this is recent all life forms are based on ultimately the building blocks of photosynthesis all life form well that&#x27;s not true in fact if you go to the deepest parts of the ocean where there are these things called black smokers uh these vents heated vents super heated vents underwater volcanic vents um life is abundant down there and it thrives off of a process called chemo synthesis there is no light down there and they&#x27;re thriving because they are metabolizing and getting energy based upon chemosynthesis complete opposite of photosynthesis so you know we keep learning all these these new fundamental realities about what life can be and what it can&#x27;t be and then you have you have the what I call the human issue because it is definitely a human issue we have five fundamental senses by which we judge the universe and if you can&#x27;t touch it taste it hear it smell it Etc um it&#x27;s very hard for us to understand anything that be that&#x27;s beyond that and yet the reality is most of the universe lies beyond that so what do I mean um take my cell phone for example if I had the ability to see in cell phone Vision right I would perceive the world through Wi-Fi and through 5G and through GPS yes and I would see a completely different reality it&#x27;s just like you and me sitting here right now I&#x27;m using my eyes behind you there&#x27;s a reality that you can&#x27;t perceive I can see it perfectly and right now behind me there&#x27;s a reality that I can&#x27;t perceive or interact with but you can right and we&#x27;re in the same place we&#x27;re in the exact same place and there&#x27;s two completely different worlds that you and I are experiencing right now then you have so where I live in Wyoming beautiful night skies and if you look at the skies wonderful for stargazing if you look at that same part of the night sky with a radio telescope you&#x27;re going to see a completely different reality you&#x27;re going to see nebula and you&#x27;re going to see things gas clouds there in different frequencies that we can&#x27;t perceive and that&#x27;s reality is where most of the universe lies in the ultraviolet and the infrared Spectrum the X-ray spectrums and that is that&#x27;s the real Universe we see a perceive a tiny tiny tiny little sliver of what really is there and we pretend oh that&#x27;s well that therefore that&#x27;s the universe no that&#x27;s actually 0.2% of the universe and then you&#x27;ve got a scalability issue okay what I mean by scalability if you look in any direction around you in Space the scientists say that the universal Horizon of light the farthest we can see into the depths of our of our universe is roughly 13.6 to 13.9 billion billion billion with a B billion Lighty years in any direction right and we are this infant teson Speck in the middle what is a lightyear it is the speed the distance that light can travel in one year so let&#x27;s do the calculation here real quick for your audience light travels at 186,000 miles per second okay s and a half s and a half times around our planet in one second imagine how far you can go in a year and now multiply that by 13.9 billion so if we are in the middle I can see that way 13.9 billion that W 13.9 billion that&#x27;s roughly 27 billion Lighty years across and that&#x27;s just the visible Universe scientists actually believe that there that&#x27;s only 10% of the actual universe and in our in in in just our universe we can see more stars in our visible Universe than there are grains of sand in all the beaches in all the world yeah right and so so if the universe is actually a 100 billion Lighty years across and possibly bigger compared to us that is enormously huge but but then look at avagadro&#x27;s number real quick and this is important because I&#x27;m about to make make make a a my point here if you compare one hydrogen atom okay to the on the screen yeah okay good so that that is to the power of 23 1 * 10 23 that is roughly one one hydrogen atom is roughly the same scale and size as to us as we are to the universe meaning we have that infinite amount of space and scale inside every single human being but as humans we can only interact with maybe one or two orders of magnitude up or down because this is our size right we kind of SM smack right in the middle of the universal scale if you were to to have a scale most of the universe is either too big or too small for us to even interact with that&#x27;s reality that&#x27;s that is the real realness of of The Human Experience but because we live in this little narrowly defined where we can only perceive a little bit and we our scale is too most of the universe is too big or too small there in lies most of reality that&#x27;s where the universe is and so for us to say that oh well you know the only things out here and you know there&#x27;s a bunch of nonsense in whoie man I mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s math that&#x27;s real that&#x27;s real right that&#x27;s not L aland telling you that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s real um and so huis is something that we we have to we have to be careful of because we&#x27;re always trying to squeeze Mother Nature into a little box that we have invented we&#x27;ve created but Mother Nature doesn&#x27;t operate that way she she she doesn&#x27;t need to be confined to a box we&#x27;re the ones living in a box we just don&#x27;t realize we do it to ourselves which means that things that we may put outside of our box through Hollywood or story that we tell such as like alien abductions may actually be something that we need to consider because there are things that don&#x27;t have an explanation in our current physical world as we know it there was there was a great quote in your book you talked about the former director of something something at Skunk Works who said impossible is impossible until we&#x27;ve [ __ ] done it that&#x27;s right I put the [ __ ] in there from Jersey you&#x27;re right you know you understand what I&#x27;m saying so these things you had to open yourself up to the stuff you previously said was czy olog is yesterday&#x27;s magic yeah and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that is fact you know everything that we do we&#x27;re time and time and time again there we put these limitations we there was a time we said well Earth is the only thing uh object that&#x27;s made of rock and the heavens are up there and there&#x27;s there&#x27;s nothing else out there and yet this is all the while that we knew meteors existed they were rocked for falling to Earth all the time how do you explain that right theying from somewhere um there was times where we we would always presume certain things we&#x27;d never break the sound barrier until we did it right there&#x27;s all these things that science has said well we can never do until we do and then it becomes routine and it&#x27;s not science&#x27;s fault it&#x27;s our fault because we make these presumptions and assumptions of what life should and could be not realizing that we are overlaying our own Human Experience onto the data so we are by necessity the fact that we&#x27;re humans we&#x27;re already polluting the data because we have a hard time looking through any other lens than a human lens and so we tend to ascribe human emotion human intent human motivation to things that may not be and so back to where we&#x27;re talking about the science and this is why I bring up this long drawn out story about size and perception and things like that people say were they from outer space they could be but this I&#x27;ve always said it could be from outer space Inner Space or frankly the space in between as you said they are these things uh interdimensional could be are they aliens from outer space could be are they as natural to this planet as we are absolutely is it to the point where now techn ically we&#x27;re at a point where we&#x27;re now beginning to interact with them just like the little beasties little beasties could be are these things maybe from underwater because look we&#x27;ve only mapped less than 10% of the ocean floor we know or all the above or all the above right we know more about the surface of the Moon than the depths of our own oceans I had a submarine Commander once tell me and he&#x27;s he was dead serious it&#x27;s a little funny I&#x27;ll sh share with your audience but it it it&#x27;s both disturbing and funny um they were tracking an object um these submarines are huge I mean some of these are imagine the Empire State building sideways underwater right these are big big submarines some of these 500 ft long right um big boys and you&#x27;re traveling underwater and you pick up something on Sonar that&#x27;s traveling roughly between 400 to 500 miles an hour underwater and it&#x27;s bigger than you right oh yeah and so I asked the commander I mean honest question I was kind of shocked I&#x27;m like well in those cases what do you do and he he looked at me no he looked at me straight face he said we go around like you know a dumb question makes sense yeah I guess I would too you know just like that totally like yeah we go around I&#x27;m like yeah I&#x27;m not messing with that either cool so um you know there there&#x27;s a lot to this conversation and the problem is that we&#x27;re always going back to the original conversation we were having about you know people on both sides of the spectrum Skeptics and Believers both of them are stuck to their own narrative both of them in the face of new information even though that we live in a world that&#x27;s Dynamic um they are very hesitant to change their opinion because they&#x27;re stuck in a static mindset but the universe isn&#x27;t static the universe is dynamic so we have to recalibrate our the way way we think we can&#x27;t think in a static way we have to be dynamic with the universe if we want to understand the universe and so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of my my my philosophical perspective on the topic that&#x27;s great philosophy I I appreciate all the depths of that that&#x27;s that was I was riveted by some of that again I I got you&#x27;re sneezing taking a nap and I&#x27;m not I haven&#x27;t been snoozed in one second I&#x27;m kidding I&#x27;m kidding I&#x27;m already extremely pissed off that we only have 3 hours though because like holy [ __ ] is there so much here like you&#x27;re saying something every two seconds I&#x27;m like oh we could go there we could go there we could go there we could go there I can come back any time you want brother all right we are well we&#x27;re definitely doing that then but well we&#x27;ll see we&#x27;ll see about your what uh people say online I&#x27;m sure well listen listen just don&#x27;t look at the comment section okay just don&#x27;t do that cuz people are going to say what they&#x27;re going to say in there but you know going back to the abduction stuff because we keep getting off it did you come across cases that you again it&#x27;s not like you were there so you can&#x27;t say a th% this happened but did you come across one out of the billion people who are like yeah I was abducted and [ __ ] by an alien where you&#x27;re actually like oh wait might have happened so for me the most compelling remember we go back to data right data data data let let the facts be for themselves um there was some situations where an individual had claimed to come up close and personal with a UAP they sustained a medical consequence now I&#x27;m not a trained medical surgeon right I&#x27;m not uh but we had people that were medical professionals that were supporting us and they were working with individuals who could quantify and qualif they could quantify and qualify medically changes in in the person&#x27;s physical health they they actually sustained injury so there&#x27;s there are several doctors I want to be very careful because I don&#x27;t want to mention their names until them I&#x27;m publicly allowed to say their names um because of for privacy reasons I don&#x27;t want them getting slammed and you know harassed uh but there is enough information to substantiate from a medical perspective that we&#x27;ve had military service members and intelligence officials intelligence individuals harmed by rendam 1980 I I had Nick Pope in here to break down that whole thing brother those two guys are on full 100% medical disability I saw the paperwork from the US government and it says because the reason why the medical disability by the US government your tax dollars are paying for it because of their involvement in renam and that&#x27;s just one example and thank God it was for for Senator John late Senator John McCain because he if it wasn&#x27;t for him these guys would have been totally toast he was the one who got their medical records out were classified by the Air Force right classifying your medical records who the hell do you who do you think you are that you can do that anyways it&#x27;s my medical records they classified him and if it wasn&#x27;t for John McCain getting them Declassified these guys would be suffering today probably dead yeah so and that&#x27;s one example I mean there are other individuals I can tell you right now a very senior former senior Cia official very very senior like one of the top guys um I do not have permission to talk about his story but him and his spouse came up close had a very terrifying experience and actually a foreign object was removed from from removed from his body from her from her so there was it was a husband and wife team okay without saying name like what was the what was the nature you know it I want to be really careful there&#x27;s Hippa and patient confidentiality so I I I&#x27;m sure that person is going to probably at some point come out this is why Congress is now taking this topic seriously because there are people like hey yeah guess what that senior dude who I know is now coming and telling me about their experience people are feeling that it&#x27;s a little bit more safer now to come out and and have this conversation with the right people we are trying very hard to create an environment where people feel safe they can come out and talk about their experiences whether they worked on Legacy programs or that they were uh a somebody under Medical Care by the US government um you know these are all little factoids that most people have no idea even exist well you talk about your own experiences too and and it hasn&#x27;t affected you healthwise like some of these other ones but you talked about how you know I guess like shortly after being assigned to this test for the first time you started to notice orbs in your house in in in Kent and your wife did too can you can you tell me what happened and let me be clear cuz I don&#x27;t I can&#x27;t tell you the straight face that they&#x27;re UFO related or they&#x27;re UFOs I can&#x27;t that&#x27;s good so you&#x27;re you&#x27;re open-minded on this oh 100% brother yeah let me let me tell you again let&#x27;s go to the facts right I get into this program matp and here&#x27;s the facts we start seeing these green luminous balls of light diffused some the size of maybe volleyball some the size of a little baseball and they&#x27;re witnessed not only by me otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have said anything they&#x27;re witnessed by my spouse and they&#x27;re also witnessed by my kids and even some of our neighbors are seeing these balls of light outside your house inside the house inside down the hallway just going by almost like a like a really bizarre um volleyball up to that side yeah like well but remember diffuse right so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s the glow pattern comes up to about here and then so these are being witnessed and at the same time other individuals that were part of atip are also having a similar experience so what we do know is that other people in the a program were also experiencing this now could it be could it be ball lightning sure could it be say almost fire sure could it be faulty wiring and now it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s ionizing the air local around it and it&#x27;s creating these luminous plasma balls 100% but makes it interesting is it wasn&#x27;t just us it was other people in ATP who were also experiencing it while they were working in a tip before a tip didn&#x27;t have the problem and after a tip didn&#x27;t have the problem only during a tip so that&#x27;s the facts but whether they were actually UAP or related UAP I can&#x27;t tell you that I don&#x27;t know approximately how many times did this happen and over what type of time period are we talking about so 2010 to probably 2017 16 um probably you know I say like once every couple months people like oh then you know every two months no cuz sometimes you&#x27;d see it back to back in a couple days and then it might be two three four months and then all of a sudden three more days go by and you you&#x27;re seeing these green balls of of light in the house uh even in outside as well um so there wasn&#x27;t any pattern that&#x27;s one thing you know obviously trying to find a pattern to this is coming every Tuesday during random yeah random random and of course we&#x27;re asleep at night and I&#x27;m not at home during the day so I&#x27;m only seeing them while I&#x27;m at home and same with my family my kids are at school my wife is working too so it could have been much more frequent but we just weren&#x27;t there to see it did you report this to put off or or Davis or or people on the a tip team yeah they they called it they had a term for it they called it high strangeness High St what what do you mean I don&#x27;t know ask them I don&#x27;t know what the hell it means got high strange okay yeah strange you&#x27;re right did they come in and investigate it though like did they try to set up anything no they they had no issue with it at all they said it very very normal for for that was normal so someone on the a tip team counter Intel guy is now seeing not counter Intel oh yeah I was counter Intel that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying is now seeing orbs in his house while you&#x27;re working on this project about these uaps right and the team that&#x27;s in charge of uaps doesn&#x27;t want to go investigate that no they&#x27;re saying that they&#x27;re having the same issue too they&#x27;re like what do you want to do about it I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know set up a camera Ghostbusters get Bill Murray in there do something right yeah well unfortunately once every few months you&#x27;d have to have a lot of cameras I don&#x27;t have a setup like this I can&#x27;t afford anything that&#x27;s fancy listen I&#x27;ll donate these we&#x27;re going to find man bear pig in there baby let&#x27;s get out on the line there are uh there are other individuals that are I think going to be coming out uh of the Shadows here soon that will also expound upon their experiences um this is really just kind of the tip of the iceberg um fortunately for us it was just orbs for other people that had other experiences not my story to tell um I did not experience it with them but you know it was it was peculiar it was all right real quick I just got to go to the bathroom we&#x27;ll be right back well that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m I I have the mentality of a first grader I I&#x27;m I mean I I&#x27;ve got to I&#x27;ve got to keep [ __ ] simple because I am I you know I&#x27;m I tell people all the time when I walk into a room the IQ drops about 20 points automatically so you know I got to keep I got to I got to color by the Numbers man otherwise I I I I can&#x27;t keep up all right well let&#x27;s get back on we&#x27;re good over here all right all right we&#x27;re back Lou one of the things that that you laid out throughout your book just for like context I thought was really good was a lot of the alleged and I would say even like known history involving UAP that have been witnessed or incidents that have occurred and what what you explained is that you once you were first brought into this you started going through whatever government documents you could which include stuff that we could all get through Foya and then also included some things that would be like classified that you couldn&#x27;t there was actually a lot of classifi you&#x27;d be surprised there&#x27;s actually a lot now they have since I think Titan the range on it and probably put some restrictions but in the early days um on the classified system on the high side what we call high side the the the top secret system uh you could just do a word search and just you avoid someone what we call the dirty words get you in trouble yeah hot words but man you could find all sorts of great intelligence out there man about these things and it was really really helpful it was really helpful how did you know yeah you talked about these hot words terms like oh if you do that you&#x27;re going to get flagged and called in somewhere and maybe be pull from the program how did you even know what those words were did you ask like how put off about that so where I was we knew what some of those hot wordss would be um especially if there were people in a legacy capacity that didn&#x27;t want you to know so certainly like you know uo right unidentified flying object uh no surprise there uh but you could look at things like um anomalous another one would be uh unidentified aircraft because a lot of time people would write a report saying we have an unidentified aircraft doing you know Mach 22 right which there&#x27;s no aircraft that is mach 22 um or you could also write in for example Lumin as a word um which is uh bright right so when you talk about a luminous object in the sky well you would type luminous and then type in sky and then all the reports about something that was luminous in the sky right so there&#x27;s ways to do it now now could be a rocket test rocket right where now you could say well the the the rocket I was ascending up to 25,000 ft created a luminous Halo up in the atmosphere that was observed for the last you know for for 120 miles and so that&#x27;s a rocket test obviously but then when you have others where they&#x27;re talking about luminous balls of light doing other things and you&#x27;re like okay well that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not a test rocket Rockets go in a very specific trajectory right um and they don&#x27;t change directions very often um so when you&#x27;re seeing reports of these things maneuvering in a certain way over a certain country the problem is it gets kind of kind of difficult because a lot of the information is classified because of under the circumstances in which it was collected right so we we classify information in this country for two reasons to protect sources and to protect methods it is in fact illegal to to classify information simply for the for the sole purpose of of trying to hide information that&#x27;s of uh either illegal activity or malfeasance or even embarrassing to the US government you can actually look at I there&#x27;s a DOD directive I can show you at some point if you&#x27;re interested but the problem is that the government was doing that they were they were classifying information simply because they didn&#x27;t want to tell people the truth about UAP and that&#x27;s a problem and so you have this data that&#x27;s out there and let&#x27;s say we get this information from uh uh a human Source we&#x27;re trying to protect or we have some information from um signals intercept over a particular country you don&#x27;t want to broadcast that right you don&#x27;t want your enemy to know what you&#x27;re doing and where you&#x27;re doing it so you classify that information but what you can&#x27;t do is classify information that doesn&#x27;t relate to the protection of sources of method right the how does it not relate to it though if it&#x27;s involved with UAP which is like the ultimate like National there&#x27;s no Source the perfect example um the fact that North Korea has um a nuclear capability that&#x27;s not classified now how those things work and what are they aimed at and how that that&#x27;s classified that&#x27;s sources and methods but the mere fact that country X has nukes that&#x27;s not a classifiable fact the mere fact that we&#x27;re not alone in the universe that&#x27;s not a classifiable fact right it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like Galileo when he first proposed that the Earth was not the center of the solar system right what happened burned him to on the stake right so we had to recant um that&#x27;s not a classifiable fact you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t restrict the citizens of a country from knowing forgive the pun an inalienable right this is this is this is Facts of Life of of Truth so you&#x27;re telling me that all of our adversaries or countries out there that may not be necessarily benevolent if you will you&#x27;re telling me that any Weaponry they may have including things that are beyond our imagination right now let me just throw an example out there some sort of biological warfare weapon that&#x27;s not sarin gas or something more basic that we at least understand you&#x27;re telling me that all that right now if it&#x27;s not Declassified should be here&#x27;s the reality right yes it should be look the fact that Russian has Hypersonic weapons that&#x27;s not they we&#x27;ve admitted that they know it we know it everybody said it that we have news reports on all the time now how they work and how are they deployed and where are they deployed and what are their capabilities are I absolutely keep that classified because we don&#x27;t want the bad guys to know that we know all of that but the mere fact that they exist that&#x27;s not classifiable fact the fact that something exists now you can classify a US capability that exists because we don&#x27;t want to let the bad guys know so what is the difference in the gray area with this and that if we think I&#x27;m just playing hypothetical because I want to know all of it by the way but if we we have data on UAP that we think no one else may have or don&#x27;t know if other people that would keep classified because that&#x27;s capabilities remember so we&#x27;re talking about sources and methods and some of the methods by which we collect information is very classified where we&#x27;re doing it how we&#x27;re doing it you don&#x27;t want the bad guys to know that so you would classify certain things regarding capabilities right again North Korea has nuclear warheads we know that how they work and how they&#x27;re used and the technology behind it yeah you protect that of course okay so so there is there is some great area excuse me and there is also some some there are some incidents where the mere fact of something existing can be classified so for example the fact that a US government is involved in a particular Mission under certain authorities like covert action that is kept classified we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t admit that we&#x27;re involved in that effort okay so you can under certain legal circumstances classify information and protect that information but what you can&#x27;t do is classify information that&#x27;s not really related to source of methods or covert action and that is that is trying to hide a a fact about something um that is not that is not a classifiable fact you know it&#x27;d be like when the church tried to classify the fact that the Earth wasn&#x27;t the center of the solar system well that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s reality that&#x27;s her you know that&#x27;s our current Paradigm um and so for my my perspective my what drives me every single day isn&#x27;t the UAP topic people think oh UAP it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s it&#x27;s ultimately it&#x27;s I took an oath to defend this country from all enemies foreign and domestic and I&#x27;ve never been relieved of that oath and it turns out that in this particular case it was the bureaucracy that that we had some trouble with um the government US government is really good at a lot of stuff I mean it&#x27;s fantastic the best country in the world Bar None and this country afforded my family opportunities no other country could or would so I am extremely loyal to my country I&#x27;m extremely loyal to my government I&#x27;m extremely loyal to the citizens of this country the problem is is that there were there were people in government making decisions on behalf of the American people that they had no business making those decisions they did not have the authority to do and so for me transparency and accountability if you want a government to be accountable you first have to be transparent that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;re going to get accountability I had a conversation I&#x27;ll share with you I&#x27;ve started sharing it was very personal to me um so in the book I talk about my my my mother passing away uh my father recently passed away a couple years ago sorry to hear no no it&#x27;s okay it&#x27;s it&#x27;s life you know he he literally died with his boots on uh old revolutionary from your dad was a Savage dude dude he was yeah he was something else that&#x27;s uh yeah tell people who your dad was come on so my dad was a uh revolutionary he fought with Castro against Batista in Cuba and then when Castro went communist he joined the CIA program uh trained in Guatemala and was part of the Bay of Pigs invasion he was a member of the Brigade 2506 served several years in pris prisons and Castro jails and uh came back to the United States um and uh you know he um he had a he was a wounded Soul um he experienced things there that I&#x27;m sure probably made him do certain things later in life um incredible human being very hardworking came to this country with not a dime in his pocket and and was self-made uh and all legitimate um and he instilled in me the sense of patriotism that I have and he always told me think um you know about what it is to serve and and why it&#x27;s important to serve and sacrifice but my father was also very intelligent he was a um you know I don&#x27;t know what happened cuz I didn&#x27;t get his I didn&#x27;t get his brains but my dad was uh was a intellectual as well and I remember so my dad died two father&#x27;s days ago uh so Father&#x27;s Day a couple years ago and towards the end you know he never told me he was he was dying but I could tell I I could tell he was sick he had cancer but he didn&#x27;t tell me but at towards the endend he stopped eating and you can see when that starts to take its toll so about a month before he died I had an opportunity to go on a road trip with him so he went from Wyoming a month before he died month before he died so we dude my dad was guy has cancer month before from cancer taking a road trip yeah and he&#x27;s going Rojo so we went Wyoming all the way day yeah for me I&#x27;d be laying in bed and eating Cheetos and all the crap I&#x27;m not supposed to eat and doing all the stuff I supposed to do he goes on a road trip with his son and we go from Wyoming down to I know Miami right where where all of us right so we&#x27;re going uh to Miami to see the family and um about halfway through I think we&#x27;re probably in Kansas somewhere and I asked my dad and and I feel guilty about this because I act I asked him almost flippantly like just to fill in you know that what do you think so I said dad what do you think is the greatest threat to humanity now I&#x27;m thinking to myself is it a you know pandemic is it a disease is it is it Warfare is it Terror ISM my father sat for a moment moment and he looked at me and he said corruption and I said corruption like what Financial corruption he said no no no corruption corruption is the act of sacrificing or giving away a core value you have in exchange for something else so whether it&#x27;s Financial corruption religious corruption governmental corruption moral corruption you are you are trading away a more a a core value in exchange for something and so in government when you do that no matter what where it is you if you are corrupt in government you start chipping away at the very Foundation of what democracy is and my father warned me he says son it&#x27;s a very slippery slope from that to tyranny it happens fast believe me it happens fast so so we have an obligation this country this is a country where we have a government for the people and by the people this is a government where if you&#x27;re working in government your job is to serve the interest of the American people not the other way around but people forget that in government they start to think no actually you know this is this is this is my job and I can start making decisions and when they start making decisions on behalf of the American people that they&#x27;re not allowed to for example in this particular topic UAP where you have people not informing members of Congress who have a need to know who are supposed to know they&#x27;re not informing the chain of command and they&#x27;re not informing the president of the United States that&#x27;s a problem that&#x27;s illegal you cannot do that right and either this country either this this Constitution and these rules mean something or they don&#x27;t and my response to them look if the rules don&#x27;t apply anymore that&#x27;s fine just tell the American people because we know how to fix that [ __ ] trust me we&#x27;re pretty good at that so you know but don&#x27;t this these rules apply to thee and not to me especially in government you have a moral responsibility you work for the people and if you forget that then you got to get the hell out of government that is not that is and this is for me this is part of transparency and accountability it&#x27;s not just the UAP issue people say oh you&#x27;re the UFO guy no not that&#x27;s that&#x27;s one thing I am I am for government accountability and transparency that&#x27;s the only reason why this government works that is the only reason we have faith and and and our our the faith and confidence in this government that is the only reason why we have it because it is supposed to be working the right way and when it doesn&#x27;t because a few people make a unilateral decision that they don&#x27;t want it to that&#x27;s a problem okay I appreciate that and it&#x27;s interesting though to hear the depth of that explanation though and but before I go into what I&#x27;m going to go into I I do want to say you allegedly left the Pentagon in 2017 do you guys ever really leave come on you did say you haven&#x27;t given up that oath or something didn&#x27;t he say that like like 10 minutes ago Le is&#x27;s like I still have never given up that I I I&#x27;ve said this before I I I still maintain my security clearance and I do consult with the US government on an as needed basis I I&#x27;ve always made that very clear I&#x27;ve never hid that fact he has never hidden that I&#x27;ll give so but what what I&#x27;m going to say is that you have any disclosure that you&#x27;ve done including this book and everything since 2017 you&#x27;ve been very careful to do everything in a legal manner 100% your colleague Chris Millan when he walked the paperwork into the New York Times in 2017 was able to do that because of I forget the name of the law and the stipulation but because of a recent stipulation that had been passed in Congress that allowed him to do that obviously this is something you were involved with so you guys have done it by the letter of the law I do need to say that however you talk about about a government for the people and by the people and that you have I believe you phrased it something like a moral responsibility to report to people if something has been done that is compromising that and yet you are also a guy who has strong criticism of Edward Snowden now let me be very Frank on how I look at Edward Snowden I look at him as being stuck between a [ __ ] and a fart okay slippery slopes on both ends on one end he sees the United States Constitution being being trampled on by the government through some weird legal Maneuvers that basically obfuscated what they were really doing from the courts and when he did try to take that up the chain of command they told him [ __ ] off get out of here so that&#x27;s one problem on the other hand though the minute he goes and reports something and breaks his oath right he he had an oath that said I swear to secrecy anything that I&#x27;m told to keep secret in the government he is now like maybe his situation is good enough to do that but he now sets a precedent where the next person can say oh I reported I reported because Snowden did it and maybe theirs is 99.9% the importance of his and so on down and eventually you know you&#x27;re down at 1% and people are reporting everything that happens in government so either way it&#x27;s a problem however if you have that moral obligation like you said could you not see how someone like Snowden felt the way he did totally different scenario from uip to be to very fair here but felt the way he did from a constitutional perspective to come out and make that type of disclosure problem with the way Snowden felt I have a problem with what Snowden did he took his information and gave it to the Russians that&#x27;s the problem he gave it to the Russians yes that&#x27;s the problem he didn&#x27;t come out and whistleblow he came out and spy he leaked information classified information I&#x27;ve never done that I&#x27;ve never purported to do it I don&#x27;t support it what do you mean he leaked it to the Russians brother that&#x27;s why he went to Russia for to well his plane got down by at the time Vice President Joe Biden he was flying from brother he&#x27;s living in Russia I know but he was flying from I know but he was flying from Hong Kong to Ecuador and his plane got downed in Russia by you know what he had with him right he he he gave up that it wasn&#x27;t just to Julian Assange this is not like like uh private Manning did where you know they were just trying to expose some things which by the way was still wrong there&#x27;s a right way and wrong way to do situation yeah he actually compromised people who died and that is a problem there there there are people who are no longer alive right now so that&#x27;s been that&#x27;s been disputed though there&#x27;s there&#x27;s people that say that there&#x27;s no one who died as a result of though he may have risked it no there there there are there there are I can&#x27;t go into details there are sources who died and so from my perspective I never took this information and ran to the Hills first of all everything I&#x27;ve discussed has always been unclassified and if I wasn&#x27;t sure I went to the Pentagon and I asked so there is a big difference between going and running from your country and taking a bunch of classified information with you and releasing that I never did that and I never will do that and I never have done that and I think anybody who does I should go to jail okay what I&#x27;ve done is to have the conversation I&#x27;ve used the system to my advantage and to all of our advantage I believe I hope and if you look at the track record I think it&#x27;s fair to say that we have by doing it the right way look no one&#x27;s gone to jail and look how far we are we now have Congress involved we now have an arrow established we now have rules and laws on the books right we have whistleblower protection we have we have right now new legislation that&#x27;s being proposed right now as part of the new ndaa that&#x27;s in the last seven years brother think about it we have gone further in disclosure in seven years than the last 70 and we didn&#x27;t have to break any rules we did it the right way no one&#x27;s gone to jail and we can can still still have this conversation so you know I there&#x27;s there&#x27;s I&#x27;ve always said there&#x27;s a difference between doing things right and doing them right now and I think if you have only one chance to do it right then we need to do it that way now could I be wrong sure are there other people that would have a difference of opinion and think it should be done the other way sure and my response is be my guest do what you want to do what you want to do you know yeah like like I said it it does need to be said that if you&#x27;re that if you&#x27;re looking at the record of what we know publicly about you about the people involved the things have been done more by the book and there there&#x27;s some there&#x27;s something to be said for that for sure and I also think you know this is also I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t want to delegitimize it or anything by any means but it&#x27;s also such a pop culture phenomenon too cuz people are like oh I want to know right so you can kind of develop and this doesn&#x27;t always go the right way but you can develop like a fanboy syndrome where people want to know more they want to know more and you&#x27;re going to give it to them 100% And and that&#x27;s why no that&#x27;s a problem and this is this is you&#x27;re hitting the nail on the head for me I if I if I can just jump in here you know people confuse a messenger with a message all the time and and this is this is one of my personal struggles with people because people will see someone in a and I&#x27;m sure this happens with you too right you have this Persona that they have in their mind of view of what you&#x27;re what you&#x27;re doing and then all of a sudden you know um you become the more important thing than what it is you&#x27;re trying to communicate and from my perspective I try to remind people look I&#x27;m just like you I&#x27;m I have I have the same issues as you I pay my bills like you I&#x27;ve the same bias as you I&#x27;ve I&#x27;m just a normal Schmo the only difference is I was in a position where I felt I needed to do something about it I&#x27;m not a hero I tell people that all the time I have this horrible impostor syndrome that I have because people say oh you&#x27;re a hero no I&#x27;m not a hero because I serve with Heroes and a lot of them didn&#x27;t come back so I know what a real hero is and I&#x27;m not a hero I&#x27;m just a guy finishing the job that he was given to begin with and fr frankly there&#x27;s probably always told people this before anybody else in my situation including you or anybody else who took the same oath I did and was in my job would have probably done exactly the same thing I did and arguably you might have even done a better job than me so I just happen to be the guy in the in the chamber at the time and you know okay guys here&#x27;s the reality of things but by no means you know I people say well you&#x27;re leading this disclosure effort I sure hope not I really do because I&#x27;m not the guy for that this is a relay race and and my job is just to carry the Baton as far as I can here you go you know I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not the guy who&#x27;s going to win the race I&#x27;m just one of the guys in a long chain to get us where we are look you were just a part of this chain as I am you&#x27;re having this conversation with people right now in your audience you have a global reach now think about that for a second think about that responsibility you today&#x27;s day and age right now have a larger Global a audience than many of the world leaders just 10 years ago you have that right so so you are very much part of this this effort as well so I&#x27;m just one dude just like you&#x27;re just one dude but we also all and this includes you too we also don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t want to be a useful idiot in that as well you know what I mean you can only know what you know I mean really from my SE cuz I literally sit in an armchair here you&#x27;ve at least been on the inside but have you ever thought about that too because it&#x27;s not like you were head of the CIA or something you were high up or whatever but have you thought about the idea that maybe you were given access to things like and I&#x27;m not delegitimizing you as person I&#x27;m saying like oh o like let&#x27;s drop some nuts and let&#x27;s get the best squirrel that we know is going to manipulate yeah then we can manipulate him to go and put on message that&#x27;s always a possibility but then you&#x27;re talking about a conspiracy on a level that would that would be it would be so cost prohibitive and the coordination so tight because most of these people like me had access to just about a lot I mean almost everything so you would have to keep a long running secret and you&#x27;d have to back stop it for years beforehand like decades yes if you wanted to execute this and then you have to ask a reason why why there&#x27;s so much easier ways to do it if you want more funding for space technology all you got to say is look this is what the Russians are doing okay here&#x27;s your money you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t got to go through this elaborate dance and you know hire a bunch of people to pretend that they saw something and make fake radar footage and make fake Fleer videos and make fake you know gun camera footage I mean that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so much simpler ways to do it you know and more effective ways you would spend more money creating this illusion than you would ever get as an end result trying to fund some sort of program it it doesn&#x27;t make Financial sense you&#x27;re going to spend a billion dollars to make a million just tell them the UFOs are eating the dogs they&#x27;re eating the cats can go get all the funding you want yikes yikes I&#x27;m not going there with oh man the 10 foot pole that&#x27;s okay I had to throw that one in there I see what you&#x27;re saying though I think I think that&#x27;s a I think that&#x27;s a fair point it&#x27;s like why would you why would you go away from what works just for the sake of doing it it&#x27;s been proven over and over again it&#x27;s not like the military-industrial complex has a problem saying yes to a bill if it&#x27;s a threat from another country that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s I mean it&#x27;s that&#x27;s what make that&#x27;s what funds the war machine why why would you come up with some cockamamy elaborate I mean first of all anybody who would approve that would be [ __ ] I mean I&#x27;m like I&#x27;m sorry that&#x27;s a big no know and oh by the way if it ever comes out cuz eventually it will if that was a case then we&#x27;re all going to jail you know yeah but you also with this topic because of the nature of its relation to meaning of life if you will you know you ran into a problem in the Pentagon that I mean you described it as like mind-blowing to you that this would ever happen and it&#x27;s mind-blowing to me too which is like with the quote unquote colins Elite so you at some point within a tip growing as a Hub within there you started to run into people where you you didn&#x27;t the way you described it in your book is that you you didn&#x27;t necessarily know who they were they almost operated silently where there was a large contingent in this 22,000 person [ __ ] place the Pentagon that had their biblical beliefs dictate how they wanted to handle something like this which was really in a lot of ways to say don&#x27;t handle it and I believe there was there was one guy who you had previously respected who at some point and still respect by the way I still respect that person okay so he pulled you aside at one point and said Lou you&#x27;re getting into demonic [ __ ] here have you read your Bible lately and you&#x27;re looking at him as an Intel guy whose job is National Security going I&#x27;m sorry my Bible right like do you understand why at home this seems wild to someone like me or a lot of people listening that like a religious belief is brother don&#x27;t look now but when&#x27;s the last time you pulled the dollar out of your pocket what&#x27;s it say in there in God we trust yeah I mean look I hate to break it to you but you know a lot of a lot of our country was based on certain moral principles and and even religious values um that&#x27;s a fact you know there&#x27;s a reason why we have a National Cathedral right and things like that doesn&#x27;t that&#x27;s not a bad thing you know this country is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s okay to have faith in this country in fact I I am a man of Faith um I don&#x27;t wear my religion on my sleeve and I&#x27;m very personal about it but people know when you read my book I was I was raised Jewish that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the way I was raised I went to Hebrew school and War yamaka um and on my father&#x27;s side they were they were catholic um so my mother&#x27;s side that she chose to raise me Jewish um I don&#x27;t have a problem with faith in fact I think faith is important it gets people through a lot of things what I have a problem with is when people overlay their faith on a national level security issue now is it that strange that that happens no we have we have National prayers all the time that our presidents lead right so faith is important in our country and I&#x27;m not blaming anybody if they believe that these things are demonic or they&#x27;re anti-christian and by the way I don&#x27;t want to villainize the Christians either because it&#x27;s not a Christian issue yeah neither am I by the way yeah yeah yeah no I got it but but I guess I want to make clear that look extremism by any other word is still extremism whether it&#x27;s Muslim extremism Christian extremism Judaism is extremism extremism is extremism we can all agree on that my and that&#x27;s my concern it&#x27;s when people that are in the government are are exercising their View use in a way that&#x27;s unilateral without allowing other people to be part of that conversation that is a problem for me now you I&#x27;ve have believe faith is great to have and if it if it&#x27;s a moral compass for you fantastic but I don&#x27;t think that we have the right to impose our religious views in a decision process over other people who may not share that look there&#x27;s two this is i&#x27; I I often try to explain to people there&#x27;s really two types of truths in the world because people say oh there&#x27;s only one truth no that&#x27;s not true there&#x27;s actually two types of truths in the world there is a universal truth like gravity right affects us all the same and there&#x27;s a personal truth the personal truth is like religion or politics right it can be just as truthful to you as gravity but it might not be to him it&#x27;s a personal truth and it may not be backed by the evidence and it might not might or might not be backed by the evidence and so we have to understand what we can&#x27;t do is apply a personal truth in a universal decision a universal truth like gravity yes but you cannot this why whether it&#x27;s political or religious or anything else a personal truth should never be be used in a decision that affects affects more than yourself and this it&#x27;s hard to do it&#x27;s hard to do because you think you&#x27;re doing the right thing you think everybody feels that way and everybody&#x27;s like you but they&#x27;re not and that&#x27;s what we have to avoid this is part of that Human Experience again right we we&#x27;re we are looking through a lens that say well this is my personal truth and it&#x27;s a universal truth well is it really though it&#x27;s a personal truth but is it really a universal truth and if it&#x27;s not then maybe you should try to remove that personal truth out of the equation and just stick to the universal truths and but that&#x27;s hard to do because a lot of people don&#x27;t even know the difference I look I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re liberal or conservative or anywhere in between people have their opinions and man there are people that are really believ in their opinions they&#x27;re willing to do extreme stuff because their personal truth they think is a universal truth man and they do things that um don&#x27;t think for one second somebody who who hate to be crude here but Burns himself alive in protest that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a universal truth for them even though for us it may be a personal truth I mean they are willing to give their lives for it right right um so we have to understand that um and and in government&#x27;s no different religions are different you know where where personal truth becomes a universal truth it&#x27;s the reason why Isis felt the way they did because you know they think well the whole world needs to be the way this is universal truth and I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not bashing on anybody who&#x27;s Muslim most of my friends were Muslim in college but extremism again is extremism whether it&#x27;s Muslim extremism Christian extremism Jud you know does matter extremism that&#x27;s right it doesn&#x27;t matter what it is and then you have governmental extremism and that&#x27;s also a problem how much did they impact how much was that a a constant thorn in your side with as it pertains to actions that could or could not be taken by a tip you know what there was some people I won&#x27;t say the person&#x27;s name there was another individual that was part of the uh under secretary defense for intelligence who&#x27;s very well known very vocal about his personal views religious views and he made decisions based off of it um you know I again it&#x27;s one of those things it it didn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t affect us other than maybe for funding um but I did not I did not feel dayto day that there was this pressure by them it was we got up to a certain point they kind of said stop here yeah like whoa okay and we didn&#x27;t we didn&#x27;t stop so um you know other than a curiosity of saying wow that&#x27;s interesting I actually came face to face with one of these guys um it did not I don&#x27;t think it really impacted uh now there&#x27;s other people in they that will probably violently disagree like oh man these are the ones these are the guys that created such a headache for us and they did they did I mean I think that story will probably come out at some point they they did make our life hell for a while ironically enough right but um it uh it it didn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t affect me that much personally well one of the arguments a lot of people who may be purely on the religious side make is that you know they&#x27;ll point to the fact that we have no physical evidence of this stuff it just leaves the mark so it&#x27;s a demonic creature and you know look at Leviticus 1015 will&#x27;ll tell you that&#x27;s why that hole is right there in in in the wheat field or whatever but you isn&#x27;t religion itself what what facts are they basing in it other than scripture I mean religion itself takes Faith exactly right religion self is belief in the Supernatural whether you like it or not now and and it&#x27;s not a bad thing it&#x27;s just it is and so there&#x27;s no evidence that you have right now it&#x27;s a story that someone written down and you decide to accept it as truth but and by the way that&#x27;s a personal truth right that you feel is a universal truth but at the end of the day you don&#x27;t have evidence you weren&#x27;t there you didn&#x27;t see The Parting of the waters you didn&#x27;t see the Miracles and the and the the water into wine you weren&#x27;t there agreed entirely and to your point that you brought up earlier in the conversation it can exist on the other side side of this with a religion and UFOs or something saying like oh were you there in Virginia in &#x27;96 that&#x27;s right you know what I mean that&#x27;s right which by the way can I you make a really good point here which is I think something I&#x27;ve never really addressed if we&#x27;re not careful with this UAP topic if it hasn&#x27;t already started to it could become a religion and we need to avoid that oh it has started hope not because that is that that is not the intent of these conversations and it should not be it should not be a religion and I am concerned that in 20 30 40 years 100 years 200 years from now it could very well be a religion and it should not be a religion yeah Lou I I I I think it I think it already has become that way and I think you&#x27;re actually a I guess like unwitting guinea pig with that unfortunately because again you talked about being the messenger with you know just delivering a message here and there&#x27;s people who view that as prophetic on the other end of it there&#x27;s people that also view that as whatever the opposite is you know like the devil so when I when I look at you this this is a good time to go into this to to Really address like head on where you&#x27;re coming from in the past episode 151 I had Ron James in here who&#x27;s talked with you before for his documentary and then episode 179 I had a Nick Pope I think like three hours into Nick Pope&#x27;s we talked about yours Nick is another guy who comes from government or whatever and in in these conversations and in some others a point where I&#x27;ve been critical of you is based on the words that you&#x27;ve said yourself in the past and actually said to me before we we were on air today which is is that you know this this is a fact like you are an Intel guy so I always joke and go all right am I&#x27;m I&#x27;m like all right fed like what do we got right here right but online you see two things you either see people who are like no he&#x27;s been sent by God you know not literally God himself to deliver the great word of UAP and then you have people on the other side who are going who are like you know abolish every three-letter agency this is our scum bag fed coming out here and doing whatever I was more in the middle in the sense that I&#x27;m like okay maybe may he just really is a part of an op and he&#x27;s read in on things that I&#x27;m not so maybe there&#x27;s a good reason for that but I don&#x27;t [ __ ] know so my job is not to sit here therefore and believe what he says because again he&#x27;s worked in the government and you know it could be like if this is a topic I&#x27;m interested in like I am in UFOs uaps he may be saying things that are not true maybe for a good reason maybe for a bad reason too maybe you&#x27;re a bad gu Lou but like I don&#x27;t know this now I see three doors with you I&#x27;m going to maybe there&#x27;s like five but we&#x27;re going to put it down to three number one is you know let&#x27;s call it like the Steven Green Street door he&#x27;s completely full of [ __ ] he&#x27;s making it all up there&#x27;s no record of anything and I disagree with Stephen on some of the evidence that he&#x27;s un that he&#x27;s uncovered there but he&#x27;s like kind of the the heel to it right he&#x27;s the opposite the second door is you&#x27;re either mostly telling the truth or like almost all the truth maybe there&#x27;s some things that you know you reviewed the evidence and you got it wrong but like you&#x27;re out here and you&#x27;re actually giving all the information and it&#x27;s in a purely kind of benevolent way like you&#x27;ve said where you feel like you have a moral duty to tell people things that they have a right to know that Humanity has a right to know to say nothing of the United States of America citizens the third door is it&#x27;s a mix and the third door could be that it&#x27;s like you know and this is a strong word to use but it could be like some sort of scop where let me just paint a picture here you guys on the back end you know a 22-year intelligence veteran if you&#x27;re still in a 29-year intelligence veteran you have access to such crazy information that you have been able to simulate how Society may handle this information if it was given to them to the point that you are able to see using all your great tools back there that like o this could cause ontological shock or an existential crisis if we just dump this on people therefore someone like a Lou alzando someone like a Chris melon someone like a David grush could be sent out there to reveal some truths in the midst of other stuff that might not true or more more likely revealing truths to make it sound really important when when in reality the crazier [ __ ] is over here and you want to I don&#x27;t know limited hangout get people away to focus on this so when you look at these three doors obviously the first one you&#x27;re going to disagree with which is that you know Lose full of [ __ ] his career wasn&#x27;t real yeah but when you look at the other two doors could you see why people might make the argument on door three there I can see why people see all three doors that&#x27;s that&#x27;s and there&#x27;s more doors than that I I can I can tell you the door that that I that I think I&#x27;m in okay you know but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a little different um first of all let me put cards on the table if you ask me to choose between National Security and disclosure like real National Security I will always choose National Security I&#x27;ve never made any bones about it I love my country and I will protect and defend this country period full stop um secondly um I want government accountability that&#x27;s what I want whether it&#x27;s with this topic or another topic there is a right way and a wrong way to do things I am very concerned and it&#x27;s probably because my old generation based upon the previous studies that some people can find this information disruptive okay what we call catastrophic disclosure I don&#x27;t want that I want constructive disclosure I want to tell the American people let them have whatever they can have legally up to that point that they can&#x27;t have it anymore but that&#x27;s not my decision to make all I can do is continue to try to push for It ultimately it&#x27;s the government government&#x27;s decision to do that and I won&#x27;t override the government I won&#x27;t do it I won&#x27;t I I&#x27;ve made it very very clear I am not trying to hurt or disrupt our government I&#x27;m trying to help it it backed itself into a corner for 70 years plus potentially for decades and now we&#x27;re at a point that people have the lowest level of faith and confidence in our government and our institutions why because we haven&#x27;t been honest with the American people oh the the Pentagon never lies right unless you talk about the Pentagon papers unless you talk about you know Iran Contra unless you talk about the Afghanistan withdrawal I mean we we haven&#x27;t been and our government has done some terrible things to people in the past look look at the syphilis experiments we let people die man I mean that&#x27;s die government killing people would never happen yeah right so you know my my point being is that the government hasn&#x27;t always been necessarily looking at the best interest of the American people but this is a topic I think where I always believe that that that America can handle the truth I think America deserves the truth and I think there&#x27;s a right and wrong way to have the conversation and I I I want us to have a conversation like I said both from a national security perspective but then there&#x27;s the other part of the conversation that affects everybody differently and yet equally right whether it&#x27;s philosophically or psychologically or sociolog Ally or even theologically my hope is that the American people can have the conversation for themselves and at that point make the decision what it means to you and then if at the end of the day you guys say yeah great me get a Big Mac fine but at least you had the opportunity to have the conversation right you can then you make that decision for yourself and at that day I go I&#x27;ll go work at Walmart I&#x27;m cool no sweat done but at least be able to have the conversation that&#x27;s what I want to see happen that is the door I am in and yes I am still very loyal yes I will still defend my country and work for my government if asked to and when asked to but it&#x27;s not either or it&#x27;s like oh well since he does that he must be not for the people that&#x27;s [ __ ] man that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a that is a that is a you we are creating a a fake narrative we&#x27;re creating a binary Solution that&#x27;s this is not a binary thing it&#x27;s not either or either you you&#x27;re loyal to the government you&#x27;re loyal to the American people it shouldn&#x27;t be that way you should be able to be loyal to both that&#x27;s what you should be and it can be that way and that&#x27;s what it used to be and that&#x27;s what it should be again because remember government for the People by the people it&#x27;s not this big monolithic thing there that&#x27;s oh there&#x27;s government then there&#x27;s a people CU if that&#x27;s a case and man we&#x27;re lost we&#x27;re done this is then you know what forget Society we&#x27;ll go move to Canada or something because that&#x27;s not the way our government was supposed to be people died in wars we fought revolutions so we could have that power so the people made the decisions and you have a representative government that are interested in in the in the in the interest and the will of the people this is my we are going to lose the whole thing if we don&#x27;t recognize that it&#x27;s it&#x27;ll be gone and then everything that everybody&#x27;s doing is going to be a waste this is my concern and I know what Revolution is because my family came from it and people don&#x27;t realize that and all these little nit noids out there in the Twitter sphere who armchair quarterbacks whove never served their country never served a day in their life doing anything other than being selfish and doing something for themselves have no freaking clue what&#x27;s actually going on and they create drama they they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re not interested in the drama they manufacture the drama they&#x27;re actually out there wanting the drama then they watch how it goes down oh look look I made an impact someone made a comment you know that is that is not my focus that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t deal with it I don&#x27;t care about it my focus is on this type of conversation this is a national level conversation and by the way it&#x27;s not just with UAP you can see it right now look at the two people we have that are that are that are vying for president okay yeah now I&#x27;m not going say bad or good about either one but let me ask you this is there anybody else probably maybe kind of sort of literally qualified yeah right is that really really really America&#x27;s best no you know or are we just uh well you know what I&#x27;ll go ahead and compromise with you know that person because that one over there I hate just a little bit more right you know and so and and we see this all the time and then we see the active pitting against each other there are people out there that are these agent provocators that thrive off of it you know wouldn&#x27;t it be great like online you&#x27;re saying everywhere even the media mainstream media wouldn&#x27;t it be great if a president C candidate came out and said you know what I&#x27;m not going to say anything bad about my my uh opponent in fact my opponent probably make a damn good president but let me tell you where we differ this is my perspective on how we should fix things and then the other person well this is how I think we should fix it imagine that that&#x27;d be nice instead of just throwing he said she said he said she said which is all it is which is all it is that&#x27;s all it is and it&#x27;s to the point where we think it&#x27;s normal now it&#x27;s like a Super Bowl my team versus your team it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not a Super Bowl man this is life this is our country it&#x27;s not US versus you we&#x27;re all in this [ __ ] together man and so forgive me for being emotional about this but but this is this is what drives me and when people try to put in a a false narrative or try to you know well L must think this or L must think that you know what think for yourself don&#x27;t don&#x27;t worry about what L thinks it doesn&#x27;t matter what L thinks what matters is the facts and the details and then make your decision for yourself don&#x27;t be lazy do your research right understand what&#x27;s actually happening here and and don&#x27;t expect some person to give you a sound bite because now we watch the media not only do we want to know the news but we want we want to know even what to feel about it right so what do we do we turn into our little Echo chamber depending on what side of the aisle we&#x27;re on politically and we watch our shows and we&#x27;re not willing to watch oh I don&#x27;t like them they&#x27;re bias hey don&#x27;t look now dummy so are you you know how about expand your horizons and look at other sources of information and start thinking for yourself that is what this country used to be there used to be a point where you could get on the news you had no idea the political affiliation of any of the reporters because it was just the facts that was a nicer world I got Walter KRON kite up in the corner up there because absolutely was a better world to live in in an honest world to live in even when we were doing dishonest things right and this is my concern this is my concern with with where we are now as a country hey guys if you haven&#x27;t already please be sure to share around this episode on social media with your friends Instagram Facebook Twitter Reddit it&#x27;s all a huge help and I appreciate all of you who have been doing that each week and this is why it frustrates me so bad because ultimately at the end of the day my focus is not the UFO Community it never has been it&#x27;s on the other 9 9.9% of the population that&#x27;s never even considered this topic seriously that&#x27;s my focus and through this we maybe we can have a bigger conversation about what accountability transparency and anti-corruption that&#x27;s really what I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m hoping to pursue here this is why this topic this is just one example it&#x27;s a big one a really big one but this is just one example of things we got to fix in this country but if if if you can recognize and I agree with you that we&#x27;re living in a country now where people it&#x27;s devolved to such a point of he said she said in [ __ ] that like these are the presidential candidates we have to choose from and it&#x27;s a giant reality show just at a high level one example right there to say nothing of the rest of the internet that we can all see I can see how psychologically people that you&#x27;ve spent your career around sitting in serious rooms like Skiffs that have seen all the worst [ __ ] that this world has to offer and know things through the literal job description of your jobs that you know we&#x27;ll never know or you know maybe we&#x27;ll find out 100 years from now when it gets Declassified I can see how psychologically there&#x27;s this boundary that forms where suddenly you guys in your group thinking this scenario are like look we actually know what&#x27;s going on here and we&#x27;re going to save the people from themselves because they have no [ __ ] idea what 100% there are PE and this is this is one of the things I explored because there are people this is why people I&#x27;m so glad you brought this up you could not be more accurate there are people now who want disclosure and they want their pound of Flesh all these people that are part of Legacy efforts put them in front of a court and put them all in jail for lying to the American people I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the way to do it I think what we do is we incentivize them we give them an award give them a promotion say Hey listen great thank you for your interest in National Security good job now it&#x27;s the time to have the conversation I think that most of these people that kept this so secret for so long actually believes in their they were doing it for the right reason I think there were people out there who actually felt look we already had studies done we know that the American population can&#x27;t take this right now that they they cannot process this information they&#x27;re too worried about Russians and nukes and all this other stuff um we&#x27;re not going to put that as a priority right now and by the way no use having this conversation with the American people because we still have no idea where they&#x27;re from or what they want or how it works or anything like that right we&#x27;re just now scratching the surface so it&#x27;s just like when we were flying the U2 over Russia and Russia never ever ever made an issue you know we flew it in contravention of an actual treaty with them that we would not fly man reconnaissance missions over Mainland Russia and what did we do we built the U2 With the CIA and locky Martin Skunk Works and we start flying them and the Russians never reacted so we thought hey the plane flies too high and too fast they can&#x27;t detect it the Russians were were were were tracking every single flight from day one the only reason why they didn&#x27;t make an issue of it is why because they didn&#x27;t have a capability to neutralize it and it wasn&#x27;t until they were able to actually successfully shoot one down with an sa2 surface missile did they tell the world the reality hey look what America is doing right so why admit a problem for which there is no solution I can understand from a national security perspective people in our own government having that same mindset why are we going to acknowledge a problem which we don&#x27;t even understand yet I get that I don&#x27;t agree with it but I can respect that understanding I can un I can respect that mindset and in their hearts they feel like they really are doing their patriotic Duty so from that perspective I get it and back to what you just said to me a bunch of guys sitting around in skiff and saying hey you know what these morons can&#x27;t handle it I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s their attitude I&#x27;m saying it comes it like it&#x27;s like a passive feeling that comes in like oh my God if only these people knew you know what I mean but that&#x27;s every day in the intelligence World brother I mean that&#x27;s listen there&#x27;s I don&#x27;t sleep all at night because of crap I&#x27;ve learned and it has nothing to do with the UAP Community I mean I&#x27;m telling you there&#x27;s that&#x27;s the cost of information people say I want to know but you know you go to the doctor doctor says Hey listen um uh before we talk you want me to be truthful with you everything right on your your yeah I want my to tell me about my medical JY um you sure you want to be truthful with you yeah I want you&#x27;d be truthful with me you have stage four cancer oh [ __ ] I wish you would have been truthful with me you know I mean I would have been better off not knowing that or going to uh a friend and saying hey um listen um this fiance you have um yeah yeah great guy great gal do do you want to I&#x27;ve got some information do you want me to share with you yeah yeah let me know you yeah of course I want to know they&#x27;ve been cheating on you the entire time oh I didn&#x27;t want to know right so in intelligence is like that you learn things all the time that that you know probably would be better off not knowing but it&#x27;s your job and so that&#x27;s not just with the the UFO stuff that&#x27;s with a lot of things National Security there&#x27;s a lot of things that would keep people up at night fortunately we have really good people in the intelligence commun that are professionals and they can do their job and their job is to stop the worst thing from happening and most of the time they&#x27;re very successful with that so you know if there was any type of consolation prize in this is that there are very very good people very patriotic people who are who who lose sleep every night so we don&#x27;t have to yeah um and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important that we don&#x27;t villainize everybody in the government you know the moment you said I worked into oh you&#x27;re one of those all right look it was a job okay but we didn&#x27;t do it to deceive anybody else we deceiving the enemy not you not the American people weren&#x27;t the enemy you know um denial and deception and information operations and all those things um you know you do it to fight and win Wars you don&#x27;t do it because you&#x27;re bored you don&#x27;t do it because you know you&#x27;re just oh let&#x27;s let&#x27;s go figure something out to go and be disruptive that&#x27;s not the way it works um and I think that&#x27;s that&#x27;s part of the problem we have in this conversation because not our conversation but in the bigger conversation because there&#x27;s such a lack of trust in the government now this is why important now more than ever we need to show good faith in the government we have to do it and because right now oh I see I thought you said okay yeah yeah yeah so you see in the context I&#x27;m trying to say here right so this is again why this accountability and transparency is so important now at the end of the day is there a better way to do it could be could be could I be wrong in this approach yeah sure absolutely yeah I think people are always going to be skeptical because of the fact that we&#x27;ve seen such as you laid out yourself with some examples we&#x27;ve seen such a breakdown in the trust of in stions through some things that they have done wrong which again and this is this is unfortunate but my friend Jared dillian who I had on the podcast for episode 182 or 183 he is a former Leman Brothers guy and he had this line in in a memoir he wrote about Leman Brothers is that he he put it like this he said there were approximately 20,000 people who worked at Leman brothers and I can tell you 19,994 of them were really good at their jobs and tried very hard that&#x27;s right now I always amend it to probably 19,90 but you get the point it takes a very small turd in the punch bowl to ruin that punch bowl right and that&#x27;s why in government especially it&#x27;s so important this is my anti-corruption issue here because it just takes a few people in government to do bad things and the entire government looks like crap and this is this is another concern because it&#x27;s easy to blame the government oh this government is Big you know huge monolithic thing no government&#x27;s just made of people and there are some good people really good people in government and there&#x27;s a couple that you know not so good not not so good right and unfortunately it kind of paints with a broad stroke the entire government and so it&#x27;s important we don&#x27;t villainize a government don&#x27;t you know it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like a police officer yeah there&#x27;s a couple dirty cops out there but most of them are putting their life on the line to save your ass you know and you know they&#x27;re they&#x27;re good people they go home they pay their bills they and they&#x27;re putting their life on the line every day for you same with our military same with our intelligence professionals but it just takes one or two and now you&#x27;ve got a corrupt Police Department that&#x27;s right now look if we&#x27;re going to be fair and we&#x27;re going to be assessing the morality and the actions of the government we also have to look at the other side of this which is something you outlin in your book pretty well which is the the contract side the the private side so you learned through this program that companies I&#x27;m just going to name a couple here like Lockheed and Northrup had been in I&#x27;ll just use my own term like in lock step with previous UFO related things with the government to the point that you alleg you you had you saw evidence through the files you had access to to show that companies like a locked like a Northrup had been in charge of UFO crash retrievals and given so much Authority by the government in this case as like a hand inhand military industrial complex I guess in a way such that the evidence recovered from these were in places that you had no idea about in the government and couldn&#x27;t ever access yourself therefore it&#x27;s pretty much on the private side for them to potentially reverse engineer things that you the government wouldn&#x27;t even know about correct that was kind of an issue no yeah it was uh let&#x27;s let&#x27;s look at a real real case scenario here um let&#x27;s look at let&#x27;s look at the uh the Apollo missions okay and the early days of the US government&#x27;s Space Race and Race To The Moon um it was about 10 years it&#x27;s when Kennedy said we&#x27;re going to put a person on the moon and not because it&#x27;s easy but because it&#x27;s hard etc etc and that was in 1969 we we successfully landed somebody on the moon that was a 10-year Endeavor now we had to invent everything from scratch to do that no one had been to really space before and no one had ever been certainly to another Celestial body and no one knew what it was even like and how to do it and how to get there and what was involved the Technologies uh and so we had about 9 to 10 years to figure it out maybe a little less as a result of that over and think about this 6,000 [Music] 200 Industries and products have were invented and created to do that so for example things like the LED light bulb velcro right the CAT scan these are Technologies in some cases that have changed Humanity forever have benefited our well-being all because of a space race and a a competition for for a little less than a decade with a foreign adversary right um these technologies have long out live the initial purpose for which they were created right imagine a company that has access to material or technology and without Fair competition able to do things and make money based upon that now I&#x27;m not against capitalism at all capitalism works it&#x27;s fantastic as long as we all play by the same rules right capitalism doesn&#x27;t work when one company gets a unfair advantage over another and there en Life part of the problem because if you have material that was in the possession of the government and says okay you can use this to analiz it for us that doesn&#x27;t mean you can just turn around and start making profit off of it and creating stuff that we don&#x27;t agree for you to to make that prop that property belongs to the American people that belongs to the government not you let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let&#x27;s make make that clear up front you don&#x27;t own that property unless we sell it to you right um and so there in lies part of the problem also you have legal consequences so let&#x27;s for example example say here we go company that&#x27;s I won&#x27;t do that uh there we go we got this and we got this company a and Company B on the government right and I find something interesting in the desert and I say hey uh company a I want you to go ahead and analyze that for me okay Company B don&#x27;t worry about that you just just go over here and do your thing 10 years later what happens company a becomes a multi-billion dollar Aerospace company company me what happens well they went bankrupt 200 jobs were lost and the investors who had that money in there gone right what just happened well the US government gave an unfair advantage to company a instead of Company B right they make the money they make the profit now there are actual rules and laws and regulations like SEC violations that if if I do that and this company goes bankrupt now there&#x27;s a real legal liability on my part because I broke the law I did something that I wasn&#x27;t allowed to do because as a government as a government yeah because I gave an unfair advantage to one company over another right there&#x27;s rules and mechanisms to do stuff I want a company a material there&#x27;s rules and procedures to do that I can&#x27;t just go and give it to them there are unless they are a prime contractor and they have these avenues that are taken care of and blah blah blah blah blah blah there are laws against being able to give these unfair advantages because why there is money behind it they&#x27;re in a capitalist world people invested in Company B because they thought they were going to be a company that has the same type of Pop potential as company a but we didn&#x27;t know that there was an unfair relation a ship between couple people in the government and Company a so here we&#x27;re going to slide that to you right it&#x27;s like all these sweetheart deals where you&#x27;re paying $22,000 for a toilet seat for an airplane yeah right I mean what well how does that happen well it happens happens because someone in the government has a sweetheart deal with somebody here and they get away with it right so we gave are you saying and maybe I&#x27;m taking this a little too far but are you saying we gave sweetheart deals to certain companies as it pertains to say UFO crash retrievals and we had now created a beast that we cannot tame it appears that may very well be the case that may be one of the issues that we&#x27;re dealing with and if that&#x27;s the case okay well there&#x27;s real legal consequences how do we fix this without you do you give them amnesty I think you do people are going to say oh you can&#x27;t do that well listen do you want the truth or not what&#x27;s the cost of it you know there&#x27;s there&#x27;s examples where we do this Truth and Reconciliation we did it in Rwanda we&#x27;ve done it with other countries where we we say look a lot of bad things were done on both sides we&#x27;re willing to forgive all of it if we can if we can reconcile and we can we can move forward together towards the truth and I think that&#x27;s the way we do it this is why I said we don&#x27;t villainize those who were part of these efforts I know it&#x27;s easy people want to do that and they want their pound of Flesh and I say no I say yeah but it but but the company on that end I want to stick with your example here company a if they became a multi-billion dollar whatever the government making that mistake is not their fault they just reap the benefit of it so what incentive do they have to come to the table like what can the government legally say to them you you allowed them to do it this is part of the eminent domain conversation isn&#x27;t it ah yeah it is which is by the way I&#x27;m not going to get into it&#x27;s very controversial but look the government has the right through ENT domain to do whatever the hell I want if you got some and it&#x27;s better and it&#x27;s in in the interest of national security or national interest we&#x27;ll buy your house we&#x27;ll put a highway right through it we&#x27;ll do whatever we need to do make no mistake we will absolutely do it right the same holds true with this the problem is the government&#x27;s been saying no for so long it doesn&#x27;t exist they don&#x27;t want it back they&#x27;re I don&#x27;t want it you you you you keep it you you figure out I don&#x27;t want nothing to do with that you know um so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a double-edged sword um this is you know this is a very it&#x27;s actually a great conversation because it kind of highlights some of the complexities we&#x27;re dealing with you know people just say I just want the truth well but it&#x27;s not that simple it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not just okay here&#x27;s the truth because the consequences of that how you get the truth can make or break something and there are people there that don&#x27;t want that to happen well a huge problem with the truth that people have with anything involving the phenomenon is that as meuk Kaku says we have no physical evidence you know steal a pen for God sake steal something do you believe in god well I believe in the god of Einstein he believed in God but not the god that intervenes in human Affairs it was the god of order the god of Simplicity and elegance Einstein was asked the question did the universe have a choice is it unique so universes you you can create universes in an afternoon but most of them are unstable most of them fall apart most of them don&#x27;t work our universe is stable it works everything fits together and then the question is what set off the bang that&#x27;s what we do for a living we have the Big Bang Theory up to the point where the universe is going to explode why did it explode we think it was a Quantum event and we are here because we are in the universe which decided to explode so Einstein said was it all an accident and he thought no it could not have been an accident you know and like I hear him because you know like I I had Jessie I just recorded with Jesse Michaels that&#x27;s be G to be coming out one or two episodes after you but like he talked about like the Bine that he saw and showed it with Gary Nolan that Jack Fil-A had brought to him so like maybe there&#x27;s something physical there but like it&#x27;s not like we have when David grush came out who was able to like remove the remove the curtains and say Here&#x27;s the UFO we recovered in 1933 and it&#x27;s the same thing with you you&#x27;re you&#x27;re out here saying I&#x27;ve seen the the evidence written up in papers and I think you&#x27;re also saying like maybe you&#x27;ve seen some physical evidence too but like C can you understand why Skeptics out there are saying well this is religious as well if we don&#x27;t have physical evidence yeah my response well first of all we do have physical evidence it&#x27;s just you don&#x27;t see it because it&#x27;s with the government and it&#x27;s or with the private companies with the or the private companies right who work for the government by the way right so allegedly yeah or should anyways right uh and uh and you&#x27;re right you should don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not asking you to believe me your government&#x27;s already told you that you you had a former Director of National Intelligence Radcliffe former director of the CIA Brennan you had a former president of the United States you had a president just now a week and a half ago the former president that said hey if I get elected I&#x27;m going to release the UFO files because the guy asked him would you do it he said yeah I&#x27;ll do it and by the way I tried to do it before but I got a lot of flack for doing it I mean do it did well no but did you hear that what he says he says I tried to do before but I got a lot of resistance wait a minute you know what that means that&#x27;s ackn that&#x27;s saying yes I&#x27;ve been briefed to it I want to do it but someone is telling me no so you know don&#x27;t don&#x27;t believe Lando don&#x27;t listen to L I don&#x27;t give a [ __ ] do say do your research man don&#x27;t be lazy get out there and and be proactive read what&#x27;s out there read what people are saying people in Authority who are telling you this not forget L alzando you know it&#x27;s there yeah it&#x27;s there you you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t need it from me all you need from me is maybe a little bit of my background and you know XYZ but there&#x27;s already data there there&#x27;s already data there you&#x27;ve already had an acknowledgement by the US government in many ways of the reality of this topic you&#x27;ve already had these reports to Congress where they said look every time we go and try to figure these things out we have more not less right government said oh we have complete air domain awareness over our country what happens if we start reali celebrating our Radars to look for UAP boom surveillance satellite from China are just wafting over Northern continental United States right so if you if you look at the data what the data is suggesting that is all I&#x27;m asking people to do I&#x27;m not and this is why I don&#x27;t give my opinion because what do you think L it doesn&#x27;t matter what Lou thinks what matters what you think stop asking me that don&#x27;t make me think for you because that is a your ability to look at information objectively is sacred no one should be thinking for you you should be thinking for you and so my job is easy here&#x27;s the facts and the data you decide what you want to do with it that is that is really what this boils down to have you stood in front of a recovered UFO I am uh boy I can talk about what&#x27;s in the book because I got cleared for it so let me say this I have had in my possession material that was allegedly recovered from a UFO it was very I cannot say okay it was but I I don&#x27;t I have been told I was warned very very clearly this I&#x27;ll share with you I was told several years ago that I could never talk about crash retrievals or material ever and I signed a paperwork for it right so that in itself is should be evidence for you but more importantly than that it&#x27;s only been recently I&#x27;m allowed to talk about the one piece of material because it&#x27;s in my book and I got cleared for okay let&#x27;s talk about that&#x27;s I have to be I have to honor that that so it just so you understand I&#x27;m not trying to be evasive I just I don&#x27;t want to go to jail I hear you so uh there is material that I&#x27;ve had um access to that was clearly engineered uh it was we had one of the very best I can&#x27;t say which one one of the very best aerospace companies and government contractors okay so you can try to figure out who that was try to replicate try to replicate I&#x27;m not not saying one way or the other tried to replicate that material and at a cost of a million dollars and it broke the machine they able to create this material at a macro level a sandwich between one piece and another piece this material um up to three years ago I don&#x27;t know about now but three years ago we could not replicate we could not we did not have the technology to manufacture it when you look at this material and you found that when we know for sure we&#x27;ve we we we found it where it was found temporally there&#x27;s a problem because this material has obviously been engineered with a technology that at least we&#x27;re pretty sure we don&#x27;t have maybe the Russians maybe the Chinese sure back in the 1990s 1940s definitely not that is equivalent to us as if you have a piece of material that says hey this from 1940 whatever and you look at you say oh wow that&#x27;s pretty interesting because we didn&#x27;t have that technology that&#x27;s like going into as I&#x27;ve said before going into into King tutt&#x27;s tomb for the very first time as we&#x27;ve discovered it and as you chisel away the plaster wall and you peek inside you see a fully assembled 747 jet it doesn&#x27;t make sense they did not have the technology to do that back then I don&#x27;t care what you think but there it is right so how to get in there um it&#x27;s the same thing it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the same same issue we have here if we don&#x27;t even have the technology now someone did it came I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s see from somewhere and when you look at the atomic so we&#x27;re go there&#x27;s there&#x27;s three levels of of of analysis and maybe it might be helpful if I explain it real Qui so um I find this okay um that makes noise by the way if you want to do it no on the bottom on the bottom see the one button now hit it okay what the he you&#x27;ve got to be kidding okay little known trick so imagine being Da Vinci and walking in a desert in the 1600s and finding this right yeah it&#x27;d be trippy yeah so made of plastic uh and it talks It&#x27;s Magic right it&#x27;s magic so um so my point being it&#x27;s kind of in the same way um you know you D Vin you would never expect something like this and would have no idea its use right and understand what a battery is and and how this speaker works and the pl It&#x27;s Magic um there are three types of analysis you would do first of all if I find this in the desert and um I was let&#x27;s say I was Da Vinci and I had the technology first I&#x27;m going to do is I&#x27;m probably going to weigh it and I&#x27;m going to do a physical analysis I&#x27;m going to say okay it&#x27;s hard it&#x27;s solid it&#x27;s made of some sort of plastic material it weighs half a kilogram roughly this Dimension um it&#x27;s uh not electric it doesn&#x27;t conduct electricity but something inside does blah blah blah blah if that&#x27;s interesting enough that&#x27;ll warrant a chemical molecular analysis now I want to see I know it&#x27;s some Hard Solid Surface but I want to see the relationship between the molecules themselves how are they arranged what what is a relationship with the other molecules in there well I analyze this it&#x27;s got some copper in it uh it&#x27;s got some lithium um it&#x27;s got some plastic uh polymer it&#x27;s got some uh aluminum in it right and if that&#x27;s interesting enough then I say okay I&#x27;m going to spend the extra money I&#x27;m going to do a a I&#x27;m going to do a atomic analysis at the Nano level I want to see how the not the molecules but how the atoms are actually arranged because within the natural environment there&#x27;s a variation of isotopes that we find here on this planet and it turns out that they&#x27;re natural there are some that are not natural and that&#x27;s the reason why speaking of King touch tomb this is why it&#x27;s kind of important because for decades there was a little dagger that we found in King tutt&#x27;s tomb that we just thought was a neat little dagger it wasn&#x27;t until we did the analysis on it that we realize it wasn&#x27;t from Earth the metal came from a meteorite and we know that and that&#x27;s when all of a sudden became important like oh my gosh that&#x27;s is why they buried him with the dagger because this is made from meteorite it&#x27;s not from Earth right it&#x27;s magical or whatever there significance behind it you know that by doing looking at isotopic ratios at the atomic level and how they are arranged and when you find that atoms are arranged with such a level of precision that takes a lot of Technology it&#x27;s really really expensive right and the uses of for that are are fairly finite at least from our own technological perspective there&#x27;s only so many reasons you would want to invest and making something with that level of accuracy remember at a cost of a million bucks we were able to put two pieces together this is much much more complicated than that so that is why material analysis is so important that&#x27;s why when you come across a piece of material that&#x27;s been engineered and then you find out when it was recovered right that kind of changes you know you could say yeah maybe Russia China has that ability now or has in the last five or 10 years not decades ago and so that is part of the compelling evidence and now I&#x27;m not a material scientist but we had people that looked at it right there&#x27;s people that that even to this day and age in the government are analyzing stuff can&#x27;t say who can&#x27;t say where but they are interested in in analyzing this type of material and it&#x27;s happening so I know I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not scratching your itch specifically but I&#x27;m trying to have a conversation while getting around any issues that might get me in trouble I can&#x27;t be specific but I&#x27;m giving you an example of how you do analysis why it&#x27;s important what makes a piece of material so compelling that&#x27;s what makes that material compelling yeah it always [ __ ] with my head thinking about this because you&#x27;re assuming you have some whether it be a crazy Advanced civilization or future humans whatever it is it&#x27;s like these beings would have so much more understanding of whatever the physical world is than we do to the point that I&#x27;ve always said like wouldn&#x27;t they be able to simulate everything ahead of time like wouldn&#x27;t they be able to simulate a crash happening or something like that so that it wouldn&#x27;t happen I mean you talk in your book about your conversations with how put off for example on Roswell where he&#x27;s he&#x27;s got some fascinating thoughts there but he&#x27;s like hey it was probably some sort of EMP interference from our universe that [ __ ] with the craft falling to Earth and boom now well there were two of them and one of them we were then able to recover and then the Government tried to cover it up and say it was a balloon so you know when you see things like that it&#x27;s like our way less Advanced squirrel species is able to have some capabilities that [ __ ] up these civilizations so much that we&#x27;re able to even get evidence like that allegedly yeah so your argument is that you know we&#x27;re the the monkeys on the ground it couldn&#x27;t these things if they&#x27;re those so Advanced how are they allowed to be so vulnerable and susceptible right yeah okay so uh we are in a beautiful place here in Hoboken and again I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll be respectful of privacy but I noticed this morning when I was getting up and walking outside the hotel yeah had this beautiful view of the of of the Hudson I mean it&#x27;s just gorgeous just beautiful beautiful and um you know it was only a few years ago that um you had a uh you had a a what some call a miracle here you had a commercial jet yep Sully Sully and and and crashed what you want to remind your audience what happened so this was it was a Tom Hanks movie later but they took off from LaGuardia went up into the sky as they were coming up Sully solenberger the captain realized there were Birds the birds came into the engine suddenly the plane failed and Sully used unbelievable skills that he had acquired over 40 some years or something of flying was able to pull it back around right out here correctly as you point out on the Hudson in between Manhattan and Hoboken and basically land the plane perfectly such that it didn&#x27;t crash on impact and split apart and saved everyone on the plane yeah yeah amazing huh if you&#x27;re a bird wouldn&#x27;t you be asking the same question these humans are so Advanced How can a dumb bird bring down a jet full of people and almost kill every single human being a bird that&#x27;s a good parallel you just gave don&#x27;t forget to uh tip your bar tenders in your waitresses so so you think that that some of this is just straight up a mistake that because again maybe we but let me counter argue that maybe we are the the separation and advancement of us to birds which is quite large let&#x27;s be honest maybe it&#x27;s not nearly as large as it is with these civilizations how can we even know that like you talk about you talk about in your book you talk about in your book not knowing whether or not this is a threat but treating it as it could be and like maybe they&#x27;re on the on the battlefield getting ready for battle right here and they&#x27;ve just been doing it for the last I don&#x27;t know 80 years specifically or something like that because time is you know 1 second to them what is 80 80 years to us like you see where it gets a little convoluted and it gets beyond what we can even like have a scope of intelligence well I do and this is why I think this type of conversation is so important because we you know we we are always we&#x27;re putting ourselves always in that box of well you know anthropomorphic if there&#x27;s so much advantage and I mistake remember we may be dealing something that is uniquely potentially not human at all right so um it and it&#x27;s hard it&#x27;s hard to do that because we are innately human how do you how do you not think like a human if that&#x27;s all we do right so it is I can see how it gets fuzzy I can see how people get frustrated and they kind of go through these mental gymnastics of okay well you know there are millions of years ahead of us well maybe not maybe they&#x27;re not 10 years 50 years ahead of us you know we we we have evolved more in the last hundred years technologically than we have in the last 100 thousand yeah so so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a l Ric yeah it&#x27;s a curve that&#x27;s right and so so is it possible that 100 years from now that we&#x27;re going to have the exact same ability that they have possible possible right they may not be million they may just be 100 years ahead of us or they could be from right here they&#x27;re just like I said little beasties we&#x27;re at the point now where we&#x27;re beginning to interact with them they&#x27;ve been here all along baby we don&#x27;t know so we have to keep this is why I always tell people in my opinion which I don&#x27;t like to do very often we should keep all options on the table until they&#x27;re not on the table and are there people out there in the government that know more probably probably yeah and that they should come out they should be able to talk to Congress you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to do is create an environment where where ultimately the conversation can be had and people have the truth whatever that truth is whatever whatever that truth looks like give the people the opportunity to have the truth and have the conversation for themselves and then I&#x27;m done I&#x27;m out well you&#x27;re you&#x27;re a veteran of this game having been in it for the last 16 17 years whatever it is when you were first read in and yet when you come into it you&#x27;re joining a guy like Hal put off who&#x27;s been read in for at that point like 45 years oh brother let don&#x27;t think that that that fact didn&#x27;t uh weigh on me every single person there had more experience than me by a lot um but you&#x27;re also you&#x27;re you&#x27;re there with like Michael Jordan like how do you even concept or conceive like you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t compete with Michael Jordan you help Michael Jordan when you&#x27;re on the team and you come into the new team and you&#x27;re with Michael Jordan Scotti Pippen you don&#x27;t compete with them you support them you&#x27;re Steve cerr um not even that I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m the guy who&#x27;s in the sidelines you know giving them towels I&#x27;m the I&#x27;m the towel boy and the water boy um no you don&#x27;t you know and and everybody has I think and God I don&#x27;t want to say everybody&#x27;s a tool because people a tool but the reality is that I look at I look at all of us as as Tools in toolbox and some of us are hammers some of us are are wrenches some of us are are screwdrivers and you don&#x27;t use a hammer to do a screwdriver work yeah and you don&#x27;t use a screwdriver to do a Hammer&#x27;s work right so we all have our own skills just like you have yours you know with your audience I could never do your job I&#x27;d fail miserably there are people in the government have very specific Niche capabilities and when you can bring them all together that&#x27;s what makes a successful team that&#x27;s why you Su you have a great producer you doing what you&#x27;re doing here and you&#x27;ve got the right people and the Right audience and it&#x27;s a team effort it&#x27;s the same thing with atip it&#x27;s the same thing with anything in the government whether it&#x27;s Special Operations or anything else it is a team effort it&#x27;s a team that succeeds and there is no I in team in fact I used to make a a point when I talk to people about leadership because everybody in government for some reason thinks they&#x27;re a leader and they think rank means something no know I would never believe that it&#x27;s insane yeah um and you know I usually tell people anybody who says that they&#x27;re a leader probably isn&#x27;t um because a real leader never says it there What&#x27;s Understood doesn&#x27;t need to be explained 100% And you know I I in in government a leader should never say the words me minor I it&#x27;s always us we and ours right this is this is our team and and we succeed together and this is my staff you know get the hell out of here it ain&#x27;t your staff government people are paying for it [ __ ] you know you&#x27;re a manager you&#x27;re not a leader big difference you manage people and by the way there was a saying by somebody a quote that I used to like where they um they say a a manager will always say go a leader says let&#x27;s go and I would take that even a step further a great leader says I&#x27;ll go first I&#x27;m through the door first um and those are the signs of leadership and and that is that is how you succeed um whether it&#x27;s Chasing UFOs or it&#x27;s chasing bad guys or or being a politician um you know we are just so used to people in these positions of authority saying me mine and I you know yeah and I&#x27;m the director and my staff and my Administration well hold on there Cowboy ain&#x27;t your Administration it&#x27;s my Administration it&#x27;s our Administration we&#x27;re paying for it right you just you&#x27;re just doing the job we ask you to do that ain&#x27;t your Administration that&#x27;s the people&#x27;s Administration but we&#x27;re so accustomed to it we&#x27;re so used to it that we just accept it now yeah and I I I reject it man I I think this is part of our problem and it&#x27;s not just in the Department of Defense it&#x27;s not just in the CIA or in the intelligence Community it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the whole government now man and we are okay with it why why have we got so used to so accustomed to to that mindset that we just not only do do we not do anything about it we agree with it well yeah and I understand what you&#x27;re saying and and also like you&#x27;re a humble guy but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s from the outside based on the story we&#x27;ve been given which is what we can go off of I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any evidence to not say you haven&#x27;t had a clear leadership role whether you like it or not in and whatever this is the disclosure movement or something like that I mean you&#x27;re you&#x27;re one of the guys this was a little hazy for me just to so correct me if I don&#x27;t want to be a leader in this in this in this convers we I shouldn&#x27;t be there should be no one more important than anybody else but you&#x27;re one of the guys that&#x27;s responsible or I think the leader that&#x27;s responsible for like releasing the gimal video getting getting getting those things sure I was one of the first guys out of the plane door but you know I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not the invasion Force brother I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not it&#x27;s this is where again well it shouldn&#x27;t be anybody it shouldn&#x27;t be a who that&#x27;s that&#x27;s my point to all this we there shouldn&#x27;t be any one person in charge and I think that&#x27;s part of why we&#x27;re succeeding now because this has been such a Grassroots movement it has really been something amazing this is global man there are people all over the world man that are rallying for for full disclosure and that&#x27;s not because of me I mean they see you know me on a TV show or something like that but but I didn&#x27;t make this happen this is I I think this is a coalescing of of people really if I had to if I had to really give anybody credit it&#x27;s you guys it&#x27;s it&#x27;s your generation My Generation spent the last 70 years screwing this topic up you know it&#x27;s your generation that are saying you know what we want the truth you know what got the internet you know so I think I think you guys you know my generation has done a good job of blaming you guys like it&#x27;s oh you guys in social media why do you always on stuck on social media and YouTube look we in my generation invented it right so who are we who&#x27;s at fault here ain&#x27;t you us um I think we are where we are today in this conversation because your generation has decided not to allow the the stigma taboo that my generation impose on this conversation and you&#x27;re just having dialogue and that&#x27;s really why we&#x27;re having the conversation well and it&#x27;s also the tools that are at our disposal to be able to spread things around the internet such that when we get evidence like the 2004 fraver videos the Fleer video or the 2009 gimbal video which involves some of our carrier ships and everything like we can at at least look at something physical on the screen and say oh [ __ ] right now you now you saw the 2004 video for the first time in 2009 I believe right yeah that was actually by Chad Underwood it wasn&#x27;t by fraver fraver was there as an eyewitness but the video was actually taken by another aircraft afterward by Chad Underwood okay and that one again showed the Tic Tac that was moving in ways that would match some of the five observables correct correct correct what what was the first time you saw that did you I mean you talk about being one of these gradual guys like where you gradually start I saw I saw other videos that&#x27;s just one I I mean that&#x27;s it was there were some that were I mean there&#x27;s one I really wish I could talk about it it was an 4K ultra high definition video anybody sees that video and there&#x27;s people in the Intel Community have seen it and they&#x27;re just like okay yeah that that&#x27;s a game changer I mean that there&#x27;s no doubt we&#x27;re looking at that at that point that that is not ours um that&#x27;s what frustrates me because those videos are there there are people uh that are aware of it a lot of people it&#x27;s kind of a bad kept secret at this point the problem is how that video was taken where it was taken under the circumstances is very classified so I probably won&#x27;t ever see the light of day convenient yeah no I got tell you look honestly where where I was I mean I looking at it I can say yeah that probably shouldn&#x27;t come out um you know as as compelling as it is because it it is there&#x27;s reasons to keep that that type that those there&#x27;s a couple videos there well more than a couple that that really are sensitive um because of the circumstances of of of the collection uh that we were doing um but there&#x27;s other videos that I think should come out I think you can scrub the metadata out of it so you don&#x27;t have locational data um you know there&#x27;s ways where you can um depixelate if you need to to allow something to be released and I&#x27;m for that as long as we don&#x27;t give away sources and methods I think we should be as open as possible the more videos we can release the better and look some of them might have prosaic explanations which would be great right okay case Clos on that one what about these other 10 what about these other 50 what about these other 100 right every time Arrow comes out with a report and they try to and you know good on them at least they&#x27;re being honest with that they&#x27;re like yeah we had 144 incidents that that we couldn&#x27;t figure out and then it became 300 then it became 600 then it became 800 right and the numbers keep going up why because the more we look the more we realize [ __ ] they&#x27;re out there man there&#x27;s there things that are going on that yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not our technology we know that because we had no assets in the area at the time and you know if that&#x27;s adversarial technology then we got a real problem because God forbid God forbid that this turns out to be adversarial technology because what would that mean that would mean for the last 70 plus years some foreign adversary has managed to engineer and deploy this capability over our sensitive military installation over controlled your airospace and has done so with complete anonymity now where was China back in 1950s in the middle of a famine yeah where was Russia I mean yeah right it there&#x27;s there&#x27;s no way and so this goes back to that question what would that mean well this would be the greatest intelligence failure this country has ever experienced eclipsing that of even 911 because despite the billions of dollars that we spend trying to keep in a competitive technological advantage over our adversaries has been eclipsed by by again order of magnitude by some s some sort of adversary so you know it that in itself is a is a problem people bring that up as a counterargument well what if it&#x27;s for an adversarial okay well if it is now we&#x27;re in big trouble if it&#x27;s from back then we are even bigger trouble but there&#x27;s a third door here and I got to play Devil&#x27;s Advocate on this and it doesn&#x27;t by the way I know what you say I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think it ex there&#x27;s so many different possible sightings of UFOs and capabilities I don&#x27;t think this can explain everything to be clear and I think mathematic just to put my opinion out there so people know where I stand I think mathematically from what we even know about the Galaxy there has to be intelligent life out there somewhere whether or not it&#x27;s been here we can have that debate but you know I agree with you I don&#x27;t think it could be an adversary because they would have already [ __ ] taken us at this point that said just in your program in the Pentagon you had a situation where guys like you were on such a small team that people above you and Below you didn&#x27;t even know it existed that&#x27;s correct okay so who&#x27;s to say that the same thing doesn&#x27;t exist with oh I don&#x27;t know DARPA you know where there&#x27;s such a limited number of people who are in on the that thatal world that we have as our current laws of physics yeah we had that figured out after we paper clipped everyone in 45 you know what I mean let me just say I hope that&#x27;s a case I would love that to be the case because then I can sleep a lot better at night L sleep&#x27;s better at night the Nazis helped us my point being is that we have the technological advantage right I that that this would be some sort of Blue Force technology um unfortunately I would not be able to discuss at all what capabilities we might or might not have uh regarding any type of exotic Technologies look we got a lot of cool toys if you even knew about it though I if whether I knew about it or not I I I cannot confirm or deny anything regarding any type of Blue Force capability what I can simply say is what we don&#x27;t have but I can&#x27;t say what we have I mean let me see if I can be more Express explicit with this I cannot tell you what we might have and again and I&#x27;ll take that a step farther for you I&#x27;ll say probably mathematically statistically you also as much as you may know there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that you and anyone else on your team and on other secret teams in the government don&#x27;t know about each other too that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s set ups we we we ran into that all the time yeah absolutely absolutely but the problem is someone needs to be the belly button that&#x27;s why what 911 happened remember because the CIA had information FBI had information DD had information well it&#x27;s useless if you don&#x27;t have somebody coordinating it that&#x27;s right that&#x27;s a problem so yes if these other organizations existed which looks like some did then there needed to be a single belly button and there wasn&#x27;t and what does that mean that means that leads to to to waste of money it uncoordinated effort you know which is again what is it that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a dysfunction of the government so that needs to be fixed that&#x27;s the bureaucracy I was telling you about the issue with the bureaucracy and also therefore if the bureaucracy set up so the everything&#x27;s in cells it makes it even more difficult to get through the various chains of commands the need or the urgency to do certain things where you know the information and yet people above you who are assigned to make the decision don&#x27;t so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any better example of this than what you allege in the book which is that you had this thing called operation interloper where you wanted to basically set up a [ __ ] you know Master Honey Trap on involving one of your carriers out in the sea where a lot of trans medium UFOs are allegedly spotted to basically set up this enormous nuclear situation to try to draw into the motherload if you will whoever these beings are to come to the ship and you were going to use some sort of impetus to like clap them and and collect the evidence and in the end the government you know through the chain of command they said you can&#x27;t do this yeah so you&#x27;re referring to the to the issue of compartmentalization and you compartmentalize information because it&#x27;s so sensitive you want to risk any type of compromise to it right so you say this is really really secret so XYZ XYZ the problem is if it&#x27;s overly compartmentalized the information never gets to the person it needs to get to in the first place and I I&#x27;d like to quote real quick for inop you&#x27;re talking about it by the way um Jay was very helpful with that he was really one of his Mastermind yeah he was one of his his masterminds him and we we put this together but he really he did a good job it&#x27;s a shame it didn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t get approved because it was really it was phenomenal uh he really did most of the heavy lifting on that uh um so I&#x27;d like to quote from my my friend Chris melon um Chris melon is a uh from the melon family the famous melon family so I think Carnegie melon uh yeah think of uh melon Bank melon University right Gulf oil uh he&#x27;s an incredible human being though and he was uh he was a senior staffer for uh Bill Cohen Senator Bill Cohen and then later when Bill Cohen became the Secretary of Defense he brought him with him to the Pentagon and became the one of the senior most intelligence officials in in the the Department of Defense and Chris always reminds me um even when I don&#x27;t want to be reminded because he&#x27;s he&#x27;s absolutely right he says um we didn&#x27;t win the Cold War because we kept better Secrets the Russians did we won the Cold War because we knew how to move information more efficiently than the Russians and he&#x27;s absolutely correct what does he mean by that well classified information if I collect information on XYZ and you&#x27;re the guy who needs that information to do something with it I have a way to get that information to you very quickly and if you&#x27;ve got a colleague over there that needs that information maybe Parts x and z you know then how to get that information to him very quickly right so we start moving information very fast to actually do something with it actionable right you don&#x27;t just keep a secret for the sake of Keeping a Secret because if it doesn&#x27;t get to who it needs to get to then it&#x27;s useless it you&#x27;re wasting your time and your money secret information is only valuable because you can do something with it when you need to right and this goes kind of through the conversation I&#x27;ve always said about secrets secrets a lot of people think are like a fine wine where the longer you keep a cork on it the better it gets um and I disagree I&#x27;ve always told people I think Secrets have a shelf life they&#x27;re perishable they&#x27;re like vegetables in the refrigerator and the longer you leave them in the refrigerator at some point they&#x27;re going to start to rot and they&#x27;re going to stink and then you&#x27;re going to have a bigger mess on your hands to clean up and so secrets are only as good um for the time that you need them and to get them to the people who need it the information otherwise you&#x27;re you&#x27;re wasting your time and your money there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s no reason to have classified information or collect intelligence if you&#x27;re not going to do anything with it so that is part of my with this the a tip conversation you need to have a single belly button and this is why Arrow was such a I think such a pivotal moment for us for disclosure because now the government&#x27;s recognizing yes we need a single belly butd now can they do a better job yeah I think we all agree they can do a lot better job but they&#x27;re getting there I think I think with this new director we might start seeing some some new Focus so I&#x27;m very optimistic about that but was something like interloper it was not in a place it needed to be obviously couldn&#x27;t do it correct the right people in the chain of command didn&#x27;t know what was going on and you can&#x27;t talk about we couldn&#x27;t say UFOs yeah yeah but I&#x27;m saying for the actual planned event you were doing correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here it&#x27;s it&#x27;s classified information exactly how you were going to I can&#x27;t discuss exactly correct I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t discuss the the the the methodology um I could probably go back to the Pentagon and request permission maybe I I should yeah let&#x27;s do that let&#x27;s give them on the phone yeah St them up you got to go through doser it&#x27;s a little more complicated it it took my book almost a year to get through that process it was like birthing an elephant um and still then he they still redacted information believe it or not a little bit I tried like hell man to keep that I wanted the whole thing to go through but um wasn&#x27;t much though coule names you know yeah well no there there was there signant Pages exactly whichit did they shorten that meaning like was it way more like it it would black out like 15 lines but was it really like you know 1500 Lines no it was 15 lines I made it exact I wanted everybody to see exactly the portion they didn&#x27;t want you to see I did that on purpose I want that&#x27;s full transparency right I can&#x27;t sit here and scream I want government transparency if I&#x27;m not going to be transparent myself so what you see is what you get that book was put in and what you see in those black lines is exactly the paragraph or the line or the names they did not want to released and I said okay you know I&#x27;m not gonna I&#x27;m not going to leak information yeah it wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t in my opinion as some as just like a person read I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t think it was like that much there was there was one there I really wish they would have left in because it would have been an eye opener uh but I can&#x27;t yeah it was it was I&#x27;m sorry man it&#x27;s not remote viewing stuff is it no no no it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a a particular UAP incident that really was you know would have definitely been another gold standard but they didn&#x27;t want me talking about all right let&#x27;s see if we can get it later but the remote viewing thing is actually on on that note interesting because you you know you&#x27;re making a big claim in there you are also explaining within your book that you did some remote viewing yourself like when you found out this was a thing with project Stargate which allegedly had been shut down and all that with guys like Joe MCM monacle and for people out there obviously remote viewing is the ability to be able to see things that are happening in in another place at another time because you access what is that thing called again the PC in your brain the oh that&#x27;s yeah the the quate paman no but that&#x27;s yeah talking am I mixing up Gary Nolan yeah that&#x27;s okay okay but either way like you&#x27;re able to do some wild [ __ ] and there&#x27;s also something about a lot of the people who are able to do this have some sort of blood that ties back to Cherokee Nation yeah that was some of the the analysis that was done by by the medical professionals and let me also stay for the record I never thought I was really good at remot viewing I think remot viewing is frankly it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a vestigal capability I think most human beings can do it actually quite easily um I always say look you know you&#x27;re out of town you you call your significant other because you have this urge to call them and they&#x27;re like oh my God I was just thinking of you right uh it&#x27;s I am I my own person which I don&#x27;t like to do but my own personal belief is that this is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s nothing any anything woo woo it&#x27;s just based in science probably quantum mechanics a lot of a lot of scientists now neurosurgeons and neuroscientists believe that human consciousness when I say Consciousness I don&#x27;t mean like the weird you world is a but about the blossom I&#x27;m talking about the the the cognitive ability of the human being outside of necessarily intelligence what what makes you you right not your body and not even your intelligence it&#x27;s there&#x27;s something else that&#x27;s uniquely you and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re calling Consciousness that some neuroscientists are speculating it may be actually a form of quantum entanglement that occurs in the brain um and that is what is that is where that that lies that that that self-identity that that sentience if you will um it&#x27;s possible that if that&#x27;s the case that remote viewing is a something we&#x27;ve always had for a very long time before we had the language skills that we have now and the ability to verbally communicate simultaneously in a language all around the world um you know we didn&#x27;t have that before we were living in tiny little little Villages and caves and whatnot so when you came across another human being there probably wasn&#x27;t much of a spoken language and there probably wasn&#x27;t much ability to communicate so you had to be able to identify if something is a threatening or not it&#x27;s kind of like when two dogs walk into a room when they first walk into a room there&#x27;s some sort of nonverbal communication that is occurring and it&#x27;s quite possible that this is nothing more than a vestigal capability left over when humans were much more basic and maybe relied upon it for survival you know this was a survival mechanism you know is that friend or Foe you know am I going to be eaten or is he going to help me that&#x27;s right catch a tiger so um the problem is that you know we always like to put labels on things you know and I used to give a a little presentation where I would I would kind of H highlight that I&#x27;d say look what is your what is your uh what is your definition of when I say parachute for example and I&#x27;d show a picture of a parachute and um I&#x27;d say you know what is parah comes from the trunc it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a Latin prefix meaning above meaning above or beside and so when you say parachute you think of a thing that shoots over your head and helps you hit the ground with a with a hopefully a thump and not a thud uh and then I say what does the word paramedic mean to you and then you know people say oh it&#x27;s First Responders and it&#x27;s a medic you know that&#x27;s helping you and then I usually ask people well what about paranormal and then people will see you just did it right there right some people will smile kind of look at you kind of crazy H you know why he did that because there is a stigma associated with the word paranormal now I would submit to you the word paranormal is no different than parachute or paramedic in fact it just means um something that is outside of our current understanding of what normal is current understanding current in fact I would tell you I would submit to you that the definition of of of anything in science is Paranormal till it becomes normal my cell phone 40 years ago absolutely paranormal right the electromagnetic spectrum absolutely paranormal 150 years ago now it&#x27;s routine right so we have created these artificial barriers in our understanding of what could just fly just be Advanced science um but because we don&#x27;t understand it we stigmatize it with terms like Paranormal right and then we have think of tinfoil hats and Ghostbusters and things like that when in reality it may not be it just may just be new science and so we have to kind of limit that when you talk about remot viewing people kind of put that into the Paranormal category I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s paranormal at all I think it&#x27;s probably just some sort of quantum process in the brain yeah I actually think your explanation here this is one place where it was way better than in the book because in the book I think it maybe it&#x27;s just how it gets written on the page sometimes it made it seem like you had the superpower or something in in some ways and I think that&#x27;s where people criticize you that&#x27;s I don&#x27;t think so not at all no I think think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s probably rudimentary I think most everybody has it to some degree and I wasn&#x27;t even particularly good at it so I think once you understand how it works then were you able to recover I forget were you able to recover like some sort of data wasn&#x27;t there something involving like a terrorist that you were able a remote view into yeah yeah well I mean we got some guys there was an ambush that was set up I Hadad some some I get into it but there some there&#x27;s some people colleagues of mine that were there for and witnessed it um how did you see that you know that&#x27;s a whole another conversation uh we we could sit here for 2 hours and talk about there&#x27;s other people that are way more qualified like Joe mcmonagle and and uh some of the you know engos Swan and some other folks that are you know who you should have is probably Hal pudol because he was the Godfather of Mo program I will be very excited he&#x27;s he&#x27;s the guy to have um he is the Godfather of it he actually uh I&#x27;ll drive him here myself created it for the CIA and then later on uh the went it was called Grill flame and some other names before that before it became Stargate um you know I would often ask him later on in my career we would he would ask me I would tell him things that we would do and you know uh ask him to tell you about the uh about the Metro DC Metro incident okay uh I I&#x27;ll let him tell you they say hey how Lou told me to ask you about when he told you about the 90 days and the and the DC Metro issue and then see if he remembers that yeah now Lou I&#x27;d say I have one more question for you but that&#x27;s a lie but I only have one more question for you strictly cuz I have to get you the hell out of here in a couple I&#x27;m a Gemini I like long walks on the beach and uh P coladas that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to ask isn&#x27;t it no but we I I want to if if we can I I&#x27;ll talk to you off camera afterwards I want to get you back here in November because there&#x27;s a lot including that last topic right there that we got to go deeper into and of course I&#x27;d love to talk without put off that&#x27; be incredible but you know you talk about still being religious yourself and being you the word you use in your book is spiritual and now you&#x27;ve had access to so many things that relate directly to the meaning of life so through it all do you as it currently stands do you believe in God absolutely um I think I think knowledge reinforces it might religion uh it might it might modify a little bit of our interpret look information doesn&#x27;t threaten God all it does is threaten our understanding of God and there&#x27;s a difference right there&#x27;s a big difference here it&#x27;s like when the church with Galilea oh you&#x27;re going to be so the fact that you&#x27;re saying that the Earth is not the center of the solar system you&#x27;re going to be going against religion no actually what you&#x27;re doing is you&#x27;re reinforcing the notion of the of the preeminence of of of of something bigger and greater and that the universe is much more complex that we could ever possibly comprehend um and that&#x27;s been my experience this hasn&#x27;t threatened my my spirituality at all in fact it&#x27;s reinforced it significantly wow yep all right we&#x27;re going to have to dig into that next time thank you so much for doing this I I really appreciate the fact that you know you have answered a lot of tough questions today as well no my honor privilege I&#x27;m still I&#x27;m still going to keep some of my skepticism but there&#x27;s other things that I I I think you have really good Arguments for hey healthy skepticism is important I I&#x27;m not asking you not to be skeptical about things I&#x27;m asking you not to be a skeptic there&#x27;s a big difference healthy skepticism is important because it takes it takes all sides to have the conversation agreed you know and I think the fact that we can do this here in a civil way respectful of each other is proof that you know some of the folks in the community can do the same thing you know and stop throwing arrows at each other and and and being petty let&#x27;s let&#x27;s yeah let&#x27;s work together right as much as we possibly can let&#x27;s focus on the 80% of the stuff that we agree on and maybe table the 20% that we don&#x27;t fair enough well Lou thank you so much I&#x27;ll see you
