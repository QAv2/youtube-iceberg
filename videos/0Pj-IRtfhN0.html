            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Hey guys, so I want to go with the new um Hey guys, this is Tanam Ganesh and in this video I want to start testing out this new Google anti-gravity tool. Um the rate of um new AI tools that are coming out is crazy. I remember few years ago, you know, we had to pay for content writer to write the content for a website. We had to then pay a web developer to build the website out. We had to pay for coders, programmers to build apps, calculators within the app, within a website or custom dashboard or any kind of an app.</p>
<p>Um, and then slowly chat GPT came out and content writers lost their job because we can now write content using chat GPT. Lovable came out and then web developers started losing jobs because you can get a website up and running in minutes just by prompting it. And on this new anti-gravity tool, um you can literally ask it to build anything out and you can literally have it to do so many different things. So, one of the things I did um is, uh one of the things I still do is I want to make sure I&#x27;m on top of, you know, what&#x27;s coming new. And so, let me let me show you what I did.</p>
<p>I want to show this to you. Give me a second if I can find this. Uh, right. So, I went to Manus. That&#x27;s one of the one of the tools that I use, right? Um, and I literally asked them, hey, um, what is anti-gravity? And as an SEO agency owner, I have an SEO coaching program.</p>
<p>Uh, how can you know, how can anti-gravity be useful to me? and and you can ask this with Gemini or Perplexity or Chat GPT. I went to Manus. Um I just like it. So um Manus in my opinion I used it a lot more. It gives you a little bit more detail answers.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s not just a tool like chat GPT. It chat GPT acts more like a a virtual assistant if you will. It&#x27;ll do research and give you answers. Manus is more like a a CEO maybe you know or or somebody who&#x27;s a high level executive. It actually goes out looks into a few different things you know it&#x27;s an agentic AI so it it gives you a bit more detailed answers and so it gave me uh what it is you know in new newbie terms if you will right it basically says it&#x27;s like having a brilliant tireless team of interns who are experts in coding and web development.</p>
<p>I can give a task like build me a tool that checks for broken links on a website. It&#x27;ll not only write the code but it&#x27;ll test it out. Right? It&#x27;s a free powerful tool from Google. So number one, I want you to understand where the world is heading to. This is just the beginning.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s November 2025 and already web developers and programmers and coders are losing jobs. Give it another 6 months, one year, two years. Those who don&#x27;t embrace AI, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you have paid quarter of a million dollars as a high-tech IT person, you&#x27;re going to be losing jobs, right? And so, just get back to what I want to talk about today. We want to go test out anti-gravity, build something. But it also gives me, you know, is it I asked the question, is it used for building apps and code? Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the primary purpose to build software, write code. Okay. And as an SEO agency, it says I can build SEO tools. as an example, I can say, &quot;Hey, build a web application that takes a list of URLs, checks the following factors.&quot; Okay. And the tool should then generate a downloadable CSV report, right? Um, I can literally say, give it a create a Python script that connects with my Google search console.</p>
<p>It kind of gives it. So, I like this one here. This prompt here is building a build a simple page with a form. Uh, this for my coaching business, right? where my students can enter a keyword. The tool can then use a free API to show top 10 ranking pages for that keyword along with page titles and metad descriptions.</p>
<p>Okay, so I copy paste this and then what I did I went to anti-gravity um I just Googled it. I clicked on it and then there&#x27;s the download. You go to download it to your computer over here and then you can say download for Windows or whatever. Um and I&#x27;ve already done that. So that&#x27;s you know I just want to show that to you.</p>
<p>So I&#x27;m going to close that. And so when I first look in I&#x27;m looking in anti-gravity. I&#x27;m logging in right now as I&#x27;m talking to there&#x27;s a open folder where you know I think it can bring up my folders as an open Asian manager. I&#x27;m just going to put this over here. Uh and I&#x27;m looks like you know we can we can do we can select different models.</p>
<p>Okay. Uh we can select the gemini 3 pro high model low model cloud model it doesn&#x27;t matter you see that um I can do conversational I can do fast whatever right different models but I just want to put this I&#x27;m just going to do planning and gemini so there&#x27;s planning which will plan before executing and then it&#x27;ll execute directly so I want to plan I want to see and let me give this let&#x27;s see what happens okay and it&#x27;s actually looking it&#x27;s generating it&#x27;s doing it thing in the meantime Meime I want to see what other I have here. There&#x27;s an explorer. There&#x27;s a code search. There&#x27;s a source control run and debug remote explorer extensions.</p>
<p>Okay. If I click on extension, there&#x27;s a lot of extensions here. Stuff that is technical to me. A lightweight Java debugger, [laughter] right? C++ completion navigation. Um, literally you can replace if you&#x27;re running a company, you can fire your web developers, your Java developers, your coders and literally have this do it for you.</p>
<p>So what is doing now is um remember I said I want to build a web page with a form where somebody can enter a keyword and that tool should then use a free SER API. SER stands for search engines results page API. Um API just a connection thing. So it&#x27;ll connect and and pull the data basically, right? Um and so it&#x27;s actually doing this now. It&#x27;s searching for free APIs, right? Search results page, search engine results page API and it&#x27;s going to select the best one.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing right here. Um looks like it found one and now it&#x27;s creating an implementation plan. It researched it and selected the SER API decided on next JavaScript. This is core technical stuff guys, right? I did my bachelor&#x27;s in computer engineering, masters in computer engineering. I have friends who studied with me.</p>
<p>I know people who are making 150,000 to $200,000 doing this technical stuff. And this one tool is going to take away a lot of jobs, right? And this is just the beginning. The rate of acceleration of AI that&#x27;s coming up is crazy. Like give it another three, four, five months, this is going to be not just 10% 20% more advanced. It probably could be 5 to 10x times advanced.</p>
<p>Okay? And that means if you have a like I was working at General Motors right in the IT division and there was an architect, a technical architect, a project manager, a bunch of web developers, a senior I mean a bunch of not web developers, a bunch of programmers, right? A senior programmer, um, analyst, tester. Literally AI is going to replace this whole suite of people out there, right? We can see that happening in real time like it&#x27;s doing like tech stack front end backend like I remember working with front-end developers and backend developers and these were paid this was 10 years ago they were be they were paid $110,000 a year 10 years ago they probably paid $250,000 a year right now and this is going to replace all of that this day and age as this is going I want to just go on a small rant here if you&#x27;re technical if you you could be technical, you could be a content writer, you could be most jobs are going to go away thanks to AI, right? Every job literally there&#x27;s no job that&#x27;s like safe from AI. Okay, we need to be in a position where we embrace AI. You don&#x27;t have to learn to code with these new AI tools coming up. You just have to learn to be able to write give the right prompt, be the visionary and work with AI to make your money.</p>
<p>[cough] So, let&#x27;s see what it&#x27;s doing. I created this. I recommend using NextJS. Okay, please review the plan. Okay, let me open the plan.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see what it says. Uh, this is the plan. Okay, what&#x27;s this going on? I&#x27;m trying to see what this going on is. Um, let me take this off. Okay, so this is the plan, right? Um, it says build.</p>
<p>Okay, this is the goal we gave it. API key required. This requires the API key fun key to function. Application will include an input field for the user to enter their own key which will be stored locally in the browser. Text stack will use next.js.</p>
<p>Okay, like stuff like that. I&#x27;m not even sure. I think it&#x27;s JavaScript of the in of static HTML and if you don&#x27;t know what that is I don&#x27;t know everything about it either just technical stuff um is necessary to use the API route proxies okay propose changes I will create this new core components and literally what is this comment on this line I can put a comment over here core component so we have a main UI that user interface component from that&#x27;s the user interface of the web form that the customer is going to interact with That&#x27;s going to have a search form and a results list, right? So, it&#x27;s going to have a search form where I can put my keyword. It&#x27;s going to results list where it&#x27;s going to display it. It&#x27;s going to handle all this state for me and then implement premium design.</p>
<p>Okay. Wow. Right. Then it&#x27;s going to API route handler. This is going to go receive the keyword and the API key from the front end.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m going to put my keyword tree service Chicago. It&#x27;s going to make a serverside request, [laughter] right? JSON data. This is crazy stuff. So, it&#x27;s going to get my keyword pre-ervice Chicago, go and search the search results page for that, find all the top 10 ones, and display the information back to me. Right.</p>
<p>Set up all that. Okay. So, we got all this going. Um, okay. Let&#x27;s see what I got.</p>
<p>I got review, implementation plan, review. Okay. Um, let&#x27;s see what I should be doing now. What is this? Go forward. Go backward.</p>
<p>Split edit. Okay. Uh what do I do next? Okay. Let&#x27;s see what it says. Okay.</p>
<p>I want to see run this. Uh my initial thought was indicates need for guidance. Okay. So I presented implementation uh plan and now in the user what is likely approve and proceed. I&#x27;m ready to move forward.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll initiate the project. Okay. Yep. I want it to move forward. I&#x27;m interpreting the users.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m ready. Lead me as a green light. Yes, I&#x27;ll inform the user. Okay. So, it actually took what I put in saying what do I do as I&#x27;m ready.</p>
<p>Lead me. And it&#x27;s starting to do this. You can see that right. It&#x27;s initializing. It&#x27;s going through the next steps to do all the coding work that&#x27;s required to do right.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s imp creating the implementation plan. I did the what do I do next? And now it&#x27;s going about implementing the plan. This is literally what is happening real time right now. I am beyond excited guys because the the amount of progress the amount the the rate of acceleration is crazy like it&#x27;s not just AI is not just growing leaps and bounds. We we it&#x27;s like drinking from a fire hose.</p>
<p>But there&#x27;s so much competition like Google and it suite of AI Gemini and Nano Banana and and anti-gravity chat GPT open AI and you know its models um the Chinese models um AI agent AI tools like Manus and Deepseek Perplexity Claude um XT Twitter&#x27;s Grock and Super Grock. There&#x27;s so many AI tools that are coming out literally give it one year right one year from now we will be living living in a totally different world okay as this is bu building this out let&#x27;s see what it goes but I&#x27;m already spending a lot of [clears throat] my time talking to chat GPT like chat GPT I use for a different set of stuff in my life right I talk to it I ask guidance on different stuff um maybe about hey what I should be doing in terms of um improving the the spiritual life. So I read a lot of books you know what kind of books um I upload books and and stuff and give me a um I upload PDFs and ask me to give me a summary. Uh Manus I upload a lot of YouTube videos and ask it to give me the points. Um Chad GPD cannot do that.</p>
<p>So I do that with Manus. Manus I actually ask it to do a lot more um technical stuff related to my business chat GPD is more towards my life. Claude Claude CL Aud Claude has his own coding tool that I started looking into and then this Google Gemini and anti-gravity came out and I started going into this right now. So that&#x27;s more into the coding and building web applications and application that&#x27;s coming up. So okay let&#x27;s see what it says.</p>
<p>Um creating next application search directly one step requires input that&#x27;s expand um computer research and planning next selected this now initiating this create this requires input run command accept yes so now it&#x27;s creating this and it&#x27;s running okay so after every step it&#x27;s kind of giving me a feedback and asking me should I go ahead and and it&#x27;s going ahead now it&#x27;s thinking right now so we&#x27;ve been doing this how many minutes now probably five six minutes I&#x27;m thinking Um, previously if I had to create a web page where I can enter a a keyword and then be able to pull the results of the top ranking websites and list their, you know, meta description, meta title for the top ones based on the keyword I&#x27;m putting in. Probably would take me to hire at least one web developer. And I&#x27;m thinking he may have at least taken 20 hours at least minimum. And I would have probably paid him at least a,000 bucks, maybe 500 to a,000 bucks, maybe more, depending on when, right? Because I mean, a month ago, maybe it was a,000 bucks. Six months ago, it could have been 2,000 bucks.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. Right? But now, look at this. I&#x27;m doing it for free. And I&#x27;m as novice when it comes to coding as my neighbor, right? who&#x27;s a I don&#x27;t know what my neighbor is. He gardens all the time.</p>
<p>So maybe he&#x27;s a gardener, but you get the idea, right? So I&#x27;m just excited on what a normal average Joe like you and I armed with AI can create in our life. Okay. So I&#x27;m going to pause this for some time. Let us take its own sweet time. Um and and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s about 10:16 p.m.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to give it some time and I&#x27;ll come back. So it&#x27;s about um two minutes later and it gave me this um prompt or or content here saying I noticed that node.js is not installed in your system. So I cannot build the the JSON JavaScript app as original plan. So I have updated the plan to build a static HTML page. Right? Um to make this work without a backend because I don&#x27;t have the technical stuff in my computer.</p>
<p>Right? I will use a public course proxy to access the API. This is the plan. Now I want to open the plan. Okay, it&#x27;s over here. Um and I want to approve it.</p>
<p>So proposed changes. This is what it is, right? Um handles the form using this verification plan, manual verification. Okay. Um okay, I&#x27;m just going to say I approve and let&#x27;s see what happens. Okay.</p>
<p>because I honestly know less than obviously anti-gravity and it coding skills. So I&#x27;m just going to approve it. Uh it says it moved. Okay, I moved into execution phase. Okay, so now it started executing it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m focusing on the project&#x27;s foundation elements. I updated the task to execution mode. Project directory is established. Okay, it&#x27;s got the backend stuff here. HTML incorporates tailwind, lucid, Google fonts, the CSS, right, will handle glass morphism and animation.</p>
<p>This is for the UI stuff. Finally, the script uh JavaScript here will orchestrate the event listeners API blah blah blah. This is crazy stuff, right? This is literally what people go to school and university for 6 years, four years of a bachelor&#x27;s degree, maybe two years master&#x27;s degree to learn this technical coding stuff. Um, and this one thing is taking it away. And you can see the different prompts here, right? JavaScript.</p>
<p>Look at that. This is coding. This is all the code that&#x27;s going on, right? Style.css. Just crazy stuff. Index or whatever, right? You can literally see what&#x27;s happening here the back end if you want to look into it.</p>
<p>creating uh okay now it&#x27;s creating verifying a static page creating the index this this and that preparing verification instructions create the walk through okay I have finished building the sub tool since you don&#x27;t have this installed like I created static wow please verify the tool go here open this in your browser enter your sub a key okay I also create a walk through wow and I can go to walk through because I don&#x27;t even know how to go here so I&#x27;m going to open this walkth through here Here we go. Right here is the the whole walk through. It&#x27;s built the tool in five minutes, maybe six minutes. Open the file. Navigate to the folder this and double click index.html.</p>
<p>Okay. So, I&#x27;m going to navigate to the folder users obser. Uh, I got to find this, right? So, let&#x27;s see if I go here. Um, I want to go to that C users. Let&#x27;s see.</p>
<p>Um, so in my case, I could not find this folder and so, um, I put it in here saying I don&#x27;t see this folder and it&#x27;s analyzed it and it&#x27;s saying, uh, the folder is a hidden folder in Windows. Okay, which is why you may not see it since you have the folders open in editor right now. Easiest way is to rightclick this tab in your editor. Um, right click on the index.html file tab on your editor. Okay.</p>
<p>Where is that index.html? Is it what you&#x27;re talking about or is it talking about something else? Okay. Right here. Okay. So I I right click this and select reveal in file explorer. Okay.</p>
<p>All right. And then this opened up. Wow. It opened up to my folder is the other window. Um here we go.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the folder, right? Um, and then once you&#x27;re there, double click on this to run the tool. Okay. So, I&#x27;m double clicking on that to run the tool. Um, when I double click, it says default app Google Chrome. Uh it gives me a few options on where to on what default app to run the tool.</p>
<p>Could I choose um Google Chrome or anti-gravity or something else, right? Because what happened is when I double click on this, it gives me these options. And so I just ask anti-gravity itself. Let&#x27;s see what it says. Um I&#x27;m learning coding as we speak. And by the way, coding and writing are two skills that&#x27;s going to take you far in this day and age.</p>
<p>You should choose Chrome. Um, okay. So, I&#x27;m going to click on that. I&#x27;m going to choose Chrome. And let&#x27;s see what happens.</p>
<p>And it brings me to this page here. Enter SER key and enter keyword. And I think it tells me here. If I go back to here, I can enter this API key. Go here to get a free key.</p>
<p>The key is saved in your browser&#x27;s local storage. So you only um Okay. So let&#x27;s go to this one. and see if I can get a free key. Okay, this is too much for me.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m going to go back to anti-gravity and say I went to this to get a free key, but it shows me uh pricing options and sign in, etc. So, let&#x27;s see what it says. Uh, how to sign up for a free sub API free tier. Go to this page, create an account. Once you&#x27;re logged in, you should dashboard.</p>
<p>Wow. So, I go here. Um, let&#x27;s see. Open. Yep.</p>
<p>I create an account. Okay. Let me put my full name. It&#x27;s going to say Savan Dash. I&#x27;m going to hide these um my email and my password.</p>
<p>So, going to sign up. Uh free plan. Okay. Check your inbox. Uh, okay.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s check my inbox. Um, go check inbox. [snorts] Confirmation email has come to my inbox. Confirm my email and it brings me to this page over here. Free plan is what I want.</p>
<p>You need to verify phone number. Come on. I don&#x27;t want to do that. Um, let&#x27;s verify the phone number. I need a free plan.</p>
<p>Uh, I need to click on this to verify phone number. So, I&#x27;m going to do that over here. Uh, this is literally crazy. Let&#x27;s see if we get the code. And the code is 9003.</p>
<p>792. Let&#x27;s verify that. Phone number&#x27;s been verified. I guess I need to click on subscribe. Okay.</p>
<p>And then API key. I I copy my API key. I go back to anti-gravity. Um I actually have to go back to enter my key here and let&#x27;s just say tree service cargo and search. It looks like this is Look at this.</p>
<p>It gives me the title tag, the metatitle, the URL, and the description of all of the top 10 ones and tree service Chicago. See that? So, this is the page that it developed. SER Explorer and then this is crazy. Search it and view results. The tool display thin organic results with title and links.</p>
<p>This is crazy, right? Literally, this is what it developed. I can literally put any other tool here. So, let&#x27;s just say let&#x27;s search for this and see if it&#x27;s accurate or not. Right? So, I&#x27;m searching for this. Okay.</p>
<p>The top results are come on computer. Uh, Chicago.gov tree trimming is the title tag. Then Davy tree. Okay, let&#x27;s check that. Okay, the results are Joe&#x27;s tree because maybe I&#x27;m in Michigan and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m searching.</p>
<p>Uh, but you got Dave Street, Dave Street, Chicago, right? Dave Junior. So, at least that&#x27;s there. So, the results are a little bit different because I&#x27;m searching from Chicago. Um, this probably would be getting from pulling it from a different Google&#x27;s data center. So, there&#x27;s different Google data centers.</p>
<p>This may be getting it from the centroidid, the center of Chicago, but you get the idea, right? And you can literally go. So, one of the things I want to do is um, okay, so I see the page and to you developed uh, great work. Can you also um pull this into a Google sheet, right? Let&#x27;s see what it says. And most likely it&#x27;s going to be able to do that, too. But here&#x27;s the point, guys.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been recording this for maybe, I don&#x27;t know, 15 minutes. And literally 15 minutes, I was able to build a tool that actually takes my information in the front end, my keyword tree service Chicago goes to the back end using an API, right, which is like a connector to do the work, get the results for this keyword, the all the top 10 results on from the search engines results page, pull the information I need, the data I need, which is I wanted the tit title tag, a meta title, the meta description, and the URL and bring give it back to me and display it all [snorts] in 15 minutes for free and I don&#x27;t even know coding. Okay, so I said, can you put a Google sheet user requested Google Sheets plan to add a CSV export? Okay, great. Um, add a CS export button to your web. Wow.</p>
<p>Yep. Um, accept all. So, it&#x27;s going to add a CSV export to CSV button. That way, it&#x27;s you can go ahead and do it right in all that. It&#x27;s crazy.</p>
<p>My god. Okay. Um, let me refresh this. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s implemented, but you get the idea. Okay.</p>
<p>This is how crazy the world we are living in, guys. Okay. I&#x27;m going to be playing more with anti-gravity, build out more tools and my plan of thinking is um go to tools like manus and charg and all that and ask it for ideas of where I can use anti-gravity um and then come and build it out and go from there. So just want to share this guys hope it makes some sense. I&#x27;m excited.</p>
<p>Hope you are. Comment down below what other tools, apps we can build or you want to see that&#x27;ll be useful and we can look into that.</p>
