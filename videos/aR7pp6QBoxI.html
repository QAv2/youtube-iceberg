            <p>all right so this is one device that I have recently constructed what it is is a series of these asymmetrical capacitors on this rotor here which turns quite easily but maybe not easily enough I don&#x27;t know so in here you can see the curved electrode here and then down here is just a single wire electrode so that should give it a converging electric field so it&#x27;s kind of like a an umbrella shape capacitor and there&#x27;s a brush over here brush from them not really a brush on the bottom but anyways so it charges up through these wires here and then through the outside here so another thing too I&#x27;ve been messing around with wadis is the high voltage charging and discharging and it appears that there was and some of my experiments there was a an impulse effect or it seemed like it was the body was being repelled away with every spark discharge see that and the piece of bismuth 36 this is the lead weight its 284 grams I&#x27;ll do a few experiments with that as well so here I&#x27;m testing some of the principles that titi brow talked about in his patent the converging electric fields we also have the advantage of the discharging effect or the discharging as well in this setup to see if there&#x27;s any sort of extra impulses or or forces developed so the idea is that this thing is going to rotate this way so what I have here with the generator is probably based on the thirty kilovolts per centimeter of dielectric strength of the air probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 60,000 volts developing across here so let me just get started here cranking it up and see what happens so I&#x27;m going to start with there&#x27;s some there&#x27;s some weaknesses in this design so there&#x27;s some arc overs that happen here when it gets to a high enough voltage so that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a downside of this some of the features of what I made here but I should be able to get up to yeah so I&#x27;m just gonna I&#x27;m not gonna be able to get a very high steady state voltage with this so what I&#x27;m gonna do is do spark discharging that&#x27;s jumping about here you can see the flash Rovers here that&#x27;s probably somewhere on something like 40 30 40 kV neighborhood this dielectric powder in here is mostly titanium dioxide so far I&#x27;m not not seeing any any motion I&#x27;ll leave that one for now and just a quick test here with a source of high frequency high voltage here I will demonstrate that so now it&#x27;s hooked up to the central part here coming through these wires into the wire electrode it&#x27;s going to the dielectric so I thought maybe maybe it might do something high frequency high voltage so you can see a little little arcing there plasma arcs nope no motion so my thoughts are on that were that because the electric field would be going into the dielectric Mori would be asymmetrical and so if there was any effect to do with to do with that the energy going in one direction creating possibly creating a thrust a force but who knows maybe with a much better coil a hundred thousand volts two hundred two hundred thousand volts don&#x27;t know always pushing away from here when there&#x27;s a discharge so this is a different test - with cobalt oxide powder in it it seems to perform a little better actually okay this is the same just now a different test tube with manganese dioxide powder in it</p>
