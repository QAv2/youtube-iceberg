            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p> TRAVIS:  Hey, here are the boys. What&#x27;s up, fellas? We&#x27;ve been struggling for more than a month now to drill an eight-inch borehole up through the mesa where we first encountered</p>
<p>a massive dome-shaped object back in 2021. According to recent ground-penetrating radar scans,  this thing is also surrounded  by several smaller anomalies and may be composed of metallic materials that are similar to what NASA has used to protect</p>
<p>the surfaces of spacecraft.  So we&#x27;re attempting  to drill two boreholes  through the mesa,  one on each side  of the dome-shaped object.  Then we&#x27;ll insert</p>
<p> scanning devices  that will hopefully enable us  to identify what it is.  TRAVIS:  Today  the drillers  are extracting the rods  from the mesa</p>
<p> so that we can assess  the drill bit for damage  from possible contact  with the dome-shaped object.  This device sends a signal  to a receiver on the surface  so that the drillers  can keep track  of the drill bit underground.</p>
<p> But just when it may have  hit the dome-shaped object,  the beacon stopped working. Okay, Jared.  Go in with this next rod. I still got him,</p>
<p>so that&#x27;s a good sign. -It&#x27;s right here now. -KALEB: Yeah. TRAVIS: He&#x27;s absolutely broadcasting.</p>
<p> We were holding our breath, hoping the beacon would stay connected so the team could complete this borehole all the way through the mesa  and help us get some answers  about the dome-shaped object. It&#x27;s getting all wonky. And I lost him.</p>
<p>-You lost him? -I got him back now. Well, that is something. Something&#x27;s making their beacon jump around in frequency.</p>
<p>And it shouldn&#x27;t be doing that. It is extremely erratic. Still got him? No, I lost him. So I really don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m at.</p>
<p>-Really? -Yeah. (machinery rumbling) TRAVIS: Listen to that, he&#x27;s struggling. KALEB: Yeah, he&#x27;s trying</p>
<p>to push that thing in right now. TRAVIS: What the hell is in that mesa? Yeah.  THOMAS:  Hey, guys? Go ahead, Tom.</p>
<p>We have no idea where this, uh,  drill head is up in this mesa.  THOMAS:  But, uh, we just sucked out  the spoils pit.  So, Jared is just bringing</p>
<p> that spoils down to dump. All right, see if we get any metal hits, then mark it out -and then test for it. -Yeah, dude. If you need me, yell,</p>
<p>I&#x27;m right here. BRYANT: Thank you. What the hell is that? Hey, Erik! At first, I thought it was a green-colored rock.</p>
<p>ERIK: Yeah, that&#x27;s... that was my first impression. BRYANT: And then I went to pick it up, and the first chunk</p>
<p>squished in my fingers. That&#x27;s the strangest thing I&#x27;ve seen. Uh, honestly, without identifying what the hell that is, I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>know that I&#x27;d be touching it. -Well... I picked it up. -ERIK: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yep, understood. -Hey, Travis, Kaleb. -TRAVIS: What? Come take a look at this. Bryant&#x27;s got something here.  These things are not at all</p>
<p> like anything else we&#x27;re bringing out, so the question is, what have we hit here? It&#x27;s gelatin, it&#x27;s like... But you don&#x27;t want to pick it up, like... -Look at it, it&#x27;s like a...</p>
<p>-KALEB: What? Are you kidding me? It&#x27;s green jelly. BRYANT: It really is. Hey, Jared, does this look like stuff that comes</p>
<p>from your equipment? It&#x27;s, yeah, it&#x27;s like a gelatin-y... That doesn&#x27;t look like anything like I&#x27;ve seen before, -out of any of our tanks. -Really? That&#x27;s bizarre.</p>
<p>That is bizarre. ERIK: All right, I say we bag this. -Yep, where are the bags? -ERIK: Over here.</p>
<p>BRYANT: I&#x27;m gonna keep looking for more of these. TRAVIS: That was the last thing</p>
<p>in the world I&#x27;d be thinking about right now. Green jelly!  ERIK:  What is this material? Is it mineralogical or is it potentially biological? I don&#x27;t think I want</p>
<p>to put that in a bag. -I&#x27;m gonna try to... -Oh, that&#x27;s a good idea. I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t know. But it has</p>
<p>my imagination running. -You want to just put that in there? -Sure. ERIK:</p>
<p>And I want to have these green,  potentially organic specimens  examined by the proper means and by those who have the ability to discern what they are. What the...? All right, this is getting stranger and stranger.</p>
<p>Hey, Travis, will you bring a water bottle over real quick? Tell me what color is underneath this one. It&#x27;s that jelly stuff. What? -But it&#x27;s pink.</p>
<p>-BRYANT: But it&#x27;s got pink.  TRAVIS:  Finding green jelly  in the drilling spoils  was weird enough.  But then the pink material really made me wonder</p>
<p>if these substances might be organic or even biological. I would never expect to find stuff like that in solid rock. It&#x27;s all just clay.</p>
<p> So Kaleb and I kept searching  through the spoils hoping that we&#x27;d find something more definitive that might give us some answers. There&#x27;s a piece of wood in there.</p>
<p>-KALEB: What? -TRAVIS: L-Look at that. This has been carved. I mean, this ain&#x27;t like a tree. -This is like a piece of lumber.</p>
<p>-KALEB: Yeah. I wonder if it&#x27;s like a... -It&#x27;d be a... -KALEB: Like a mine shaft? That&#x27;s what I was just wondering.</p>
<p>Could there be, uh...? Uh, maybe there was a tunnel or a mine shaft. That&#x27;s-that&#x27;s wood. How did this get inside the mesa?  We&#x27;ve never heard  that mining operations  took place here on the ranch.</p>
<p>So it was really odd that possibly machined or hand-crafted wood came from that deep in the mesa.  We&#x27;ve got to uncover  whatever is actually in there  and figure this out.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m absolutely keeping this.  TRAVIS:  Hey, guys. So, you guys obviously recognize -the samples we have here on the table.</p>
<p>-BRYANT: Yeah. We&#x27;ve reached out and connected with, uh, Dr. Power from the University of Utah to have an analysis prepared for us.</p>
<p>And so I&#x27;m going to bring him up on videoconference now. -TRAVIS: Okay. -That&#x27;d be great. Hello, Dr.</p>
<p>Power.  Hello there. Thanks for jumping on with us today. We&#x27;re really interested in, uh, in your analysis of those</p>
<p>samples that we provided. So, what did you think of the samples that we sent you? So, uh, the samples were-were, um, kind of interesting to me.  Uh, the first sample,</p>
<p> I have it here in a, in a small vial. This is the piece of wood that we pulled out of the spoils pile, correct?  That&#x27;s correct.  Um, we did a little bit of preliminary analysis on it.  Um, and then</p>
<p> we started to, uh, play around  with some lighting  and some imaging. And as we zoom in, we start to see some structure.  You can start to see, uh,</p>
<p> these pore spaces showing up  in what we think is a stem.  And now, if these are  indeed pore spaces,  uh, there&#x27;s-there&#x27;s only  a few types of plants  that can do that.  And plants that produce</p>
<p> a lot of spores in their stem,  or-or pore holes,  tend to be aquatic plants.  So our-our best guess, uh,  for this particular sample  is that it-it&#x27;s likely  a stem of an aquatic plant.</p>
<p> And if I zoom in a bit more,  you can see  in these two pictures, -you really start to pick out... -BRYANT: Wow. ...those-those, uh, pore holes.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> I was shocked  when Dr. Power revealed that he believed this wasn&#x27;t crafted wood but part of an aquatic plant. But I was also confused</p>
<p>by what it was doing that far inside the mesa. What is your guess of why something like that would be inside, uh, a mesa about 200 feet?  Well, um, I was hoping  you guys might have some idea  about that. (chuckles) (laughs) Uh, you all know better than I.</p>
<p> As you were drilling through,  it sounds like it was  a predominantly  like a sandstone,  -very little organic matter. -That&#x27;s right.  But it seems pretty clear  to me that at some point  in your drilling operation,</p>
<p> you penetrated  some type of, uh,  ancient, buried wetland. I was not expecting to hear that at all. No.</p>
<p> ERIK:  We are looking  at biological specimens, prehistoric specimens of some kind of very porous plant material from an ancient era in a location that may fit the profile of a debris field</p>
<p>inside the mesa. What about the, the second sample?  The second sample was  the jelly sample.  And, uh, the jelly sample, uh,</p>
<p> is kind of interesting.  Doesn&#x27;t really match  with what I see in terms of the, the geological history of the area. Um, so I-- what I did is, I took</p>
<p>what&#x27;s called a smear sample. And so, um, I don&#x27;t know if you can see here in my video,  there&#x27;s a  small microscope slide. BRYANT:</p>
<p>When we sent that sample in, it had a kind of a green coloration to it. Do you know what could account for the green coloration of it?  Originally, uh, we were thinking it was, uh, some kind of algal material.</p>
<p>-You mean algae?  -That&#x27;s right, yeah.  I didn&#x27;t see  any algal structures.  So it&#x27;s not a biologically-driven color as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s not chlorophyll?  I don&#x27;t think so.  So, I thought  I&#x27;d dig in a little deeper  into this, uh, smear slide. So we-we washed it down to see what kind of material was left.</p>
<p> And so what you&#x27;re seeing now  is, the organic slime  or jelly sample  has dissolved away, and the particles you see are pieces of burnt plant material.  And what was surprising</p>
<p> is the abundance of burnt plant material in a relatively small sample size. -Wow. Wow. -What? TRAVIS:</p>
<p>You mean, like something caused a fire deep inside the mesa?  Absolutely, yeah.  TRAVIS:  Wow.</p>
