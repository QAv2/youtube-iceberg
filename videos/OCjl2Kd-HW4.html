            <p>zero-point energy is a quantum mechanical foam that operates throughout the universe it&#x27;s almond present and makes up the substance of space-time this zero-point energy can also be harnessed and turned into real electrical energy by conversion polarization of the cpe produces electrical current and it&#x27;s possible to create antennas that will do this one of the original patents on zero point energy tetanus was by Robert forward Robert Ford&#x27;s patent uses two parallel plates with a coil of wire between them because this is zero-point energy of course they&#x27;re on the nanometer scale this is a version of his antenna 30 nanometers in length it&#x27;s modeled on the mitochondria if you look at the antenna the structure of the antenna looks very similar the structure of mitochondria and human cells in this way the parallel plates are connected and are connected and joined in an oval at either end of this antenna is a magnet one Norv once off at either end of the antenna on the top half of the antenna between the parallel plates are dendritic in tennis these dendritic antennas are modeled on tree growth and they&#x27;re excellent for electrostatic antennas using their electrostatic intended design we put these antennas between the parallel plates on the top part of the antenna they don&#x27;t make contact with the plates but stay between them they harness the zero-point energy and radiate it into useful electromagnetic energy</p>
