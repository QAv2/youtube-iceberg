            <p>[Music] Okay. So, you gave us a lot there that I&#x27;ll unpack over the course of the conversation. Um, one thing that you said, uh, which I think is a very important point is that, um, the focus on a possible, uh, threat or national security threat is a very narrow lens through which to view UAP. And yet, very interestingly, at the at the beginning of your new book, you start out by giving a a couple dozen pages to some events in Southern California that suggest something like a threat or at least injury and maybe maybe violence. and and you had said to me before this that you thought these were very important events and you&#x27;d been struck by the fact that uh in over about a dozen interviews no one had asked you about them.</p>
<p>So so maybe you could say a word about those. And you know it&#x27;s I I understand why people didn&#x27;t spend time on that because they there are some current questions that people want to ask about and and they rush into into those standard questions. Um there are several things in in this book um that are not mentioned anywhere else which are things that um that I I made an effort to go and explore because I had heard or somebody had contacted me um about some exceptional cases that were affecting them in their lives. And those were not reported anywhere. Um and you know a number of researchers of my my colleagues and uh will will tell you that there is a lot that people are not reporting to the media at all either because they affect their property uh their their cattle if they if they are farmers and or ranchers uh and and the reputation of their family or their reputation in business.</p>
<p>I have CEOs of Silicon Valley companies who have said, you know, Jack, can we have coffee together because I&#x27;d like to I&#x27;d like you to know about something that that I saw, you know, uh on the weekend with my family and by the way, you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t report it. And those are precious. And this came from a family who lives in the Mojave away from Los Angeles and uh in an area which is the the playground of the the major um aerospace companies. So it&#x27;s a very often a testing ground for new new things and they love to see new aircraft and new prototypes. Um those are not necessarily I mean they may be classified because of their performance but you know I mean you&#x27;re going to see them uh because you know those those prototypes can be seen over a wide area.</p>
<p>Um the the particular case involved something very strange. It involved discs just like what people are reporting now as drones except that those were didn&#x27;t have propellers. They were large discs about 10 10 to 12 feet as far as they could tell that appeared in the sky and they seemed to exchange light um light rays, you know, uh or light flashes. But it was most of the time it was most mostly like a laser between one disc and another and they thought that this may be some new weapon that was being developed and they started in the late &#x27;7s. Now I learned on I learned of it after uh 2010 2012 uh but that had been going on for a long time and when one disc was hit by the beam the disc would vanish.</p>
<p>um which is reminiscent of you know some of the things around the Nimmits and more recently that that everybody has known about it. It it would vanish but it would reappear somewhere else and there were sort of structured dances among these these objects. Um the um this happened in the evening and at night and I go into it at some I I went there several times, met with the people, met with their families and recalled you know what they had seen. The the recollection was very interesting because they they do not all remembered the same things which is you know any investigator will tell you that&#x27;s a classic in in multiple witness cases. people are not going to tell the same story but we could reconstruct from where they were the the total observation.</p>
<p>Um, in daylight when they came to the site, there was a truck there with what uh what they inter first interpreted as a as a dead body there, which may have been, you know, uh maybe a decoy or something else. But there was somebody setting, you know, some someone had set fire to the truck and there was a man there uh who was in a uniform and told them to go home and that there was nothing to see that. Um but that was at the place where those beams had been had been exchanged at at night. So they got very scared and um did not report anything and and it only came out because I happened to know somebody in that family who led me to the site. It happens that in in in my computer files, of course, in something like that happens, I&#x27;m going to go back to the computer and see if there is anything similar or relevant that happened in in that, you know, in that time.</p>
<p>um was a very interesting professional from Hollywood who is a high technology um consultant to the studios for special effects. So he has his own company that develops special effects for the for Hollywood, but he was also recruited by the NSA, National Security Agency, to go into the desert into that same area of the Mojave. And this would have been in the in the late in the mid to late 80s uh to expose and they would they would give him a particular set of coordinates where some something would happen in orbit that they wanted him to photograph with a very very high special infrared film that and it as as you may know it takes uh a lot of experience to to deal uh professionally with infrared film especially at the very very high response index and that was his special team. That was why he was recruited. there were other teams like that and he learned that in one other team the truck had caught fire and the both of the agents from NSA had been killed.</p>
<p>So at that point he resigned and went back to Hollywood and uh I knew him because he was involved in some research that Dr. Hinek and I did um in in Hollywood in a special case where he had recorded some of the some of the effects of the of of the phenomenon of another phenomenon. And so when I went back to talk to him about um about the cases in the desert, he told me the whole story and he said that uh he just couldn&#x27;t continue to to work. He had a family and didn&#x27;t want to be exposed to that. But you have two cases involving very strange things in the sky, involving the intelligence community and the satellite community back in the 70s and 80s with things that resulted in the death of some of the some of the people u involved in the in the sightings.</p>
<p>And um &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. So I I had no way to investigate further and uh uh I just recorded the information and it&#x27;s in it&#x27;s in the book. [Music]</p>
