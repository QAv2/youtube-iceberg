            <p>Did you know that Nicola Tesla, the brilliant inventor, had many inventions that were never seen by the public? In this video, we will look at some of his most important inventions that were lost forever. And we will try to answer the question, why were they suppressed? Tesla was a genius, but he was also very eccentric. He would often make wild claims that his inventions were being stolen by other inventors like Thomas Edison. But there may be another reason why some of his inventions were never finished. One reason is that Tesla was not very good at business.</p>
<p>He was not able to secure funding for his projects and many of his inventions were too expensive to build. Another reason is that Tesla was too ahead of his time. Some of his inventions were simply too advanced for the world to handle. For example, his wireless power transmitter was way ahead of its time. It was not until decades later that the technology to build such a device existed.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most important reason why Tesla&#x27;s inventions were suppressed is because they threatened the status quo. His free energy devices were seen as a threat to the powerful industrialists of the time like JP Morgan. They were worried that Tesla&#x27;s inventions would disrupt the balance of power and destroy their fortunes.</p>
