            <p>starting the route Juniper&#x27;s drone is equipped with a sophisticated magnetometer device that will scan the entire area sensing for any magnetic anomalies 100 or more feet underground so if there are tunnels or structures there we should get a good indication of te down we got the data back which revealed that at each area of interest there appear to be anomalous features or possibly structures below the range here is the magnetic data of the whole property Homestead 2 really there&#x27;s extreme magnetic field anomaly compared to the rest of the background right there this scientific data is telling us there has to be something below ground here&#x27;s the triangle what&#x27;s really interesting is how it looks like possibly two main objects with something running between them from the lore about some kind of Base under the ranch to James Keenan&#x27;s theory about a tunnel we really need Brandon&#x27;s blessing to explore deeper underground there</p>
