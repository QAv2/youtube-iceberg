            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald W sides founder and chair of the International Society unified science and president of trans Power Corporation a commercial custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company I work as a theoretical physicist and as AI systems and mechanical engineer today I&#x27;ll be discussing the reciprocal system macrocosmos database star clusters that&#x27;s the layout for star clusters but first I just might go back to galaxies the galaxies layout which I get last week and just show you if I click into the star clusters underneath the Milky Way here we can just scroll down and then you&#x27;ll see all of them here so this works perfectly I&#x27;m just going to scroll down and just show you let&#x27;s go to m3 which is the famous globular cluster click there and click the button and there we are m3 now look you can also get there directly go right here star clusters from the main menu don&#x27;t have any stars listed here under it but if there are if there are named stars within a globular cluster they will be found here alright so let&#x27;s go through the fields so we have a store cluster name of course in this case it&#x27;s m3 and by the way I have banana here 198 I&#x27;ll just just go to show off yeah 198 total star clusters alright so let&#x27;s come back up here star cluster name again this m3 the new galactic catalog numbers 52 something to the measure numbers 3 the formal numbers 1 if there were named stars they&#x27;d be here and you could actually jump up their location here this is the standard J 2000 point 0 the right ascension 13 42 11 point to the declination is plus 28 degrees 22 minutes and 32 seconds and then here you have the general videos and then for the events you would have anything I don&#x27;t think I have anything for here but these would be like specific happenings relevant to that particular object this jump to the first one up here and here&#x27;s a nice picture from Astronomy Picture of the Day sure it shows you the globular cluster m3 and so on so forth okay so then we just come back hit the button here star clusters and look back practic one two coordinates here this this time we do have this forty two point two zero seven etc I have to be REM anymore to coordinates seven eight point seven zero eight etc if there were never laying gas and dust clouds within the star cluster they would be named here this is a type globular cluster now there are lots of other ones you know there&#x27;s a Viking open cluster and there&#x27;s a constellation whereas tourism by the way you do realize that with constellation or asterism the stars are not actually necessarily physically nearby each other it just might be that they&#x27;re close together in the sky okay so the cluster there if they were an abbreviation it&#x27;d be here so if there&#x27;s like a well the sections just scroll down let&#x27;s just see just go back and just let&#x27;s just take a look yeah here&#x27;s like Scorpius now this this is a constellation and in that case we do have accountant which is score score PI they&#x27;d be the the abbreviation schoo and translation of scorpion okay but now I&#x27;m going to go back to him three so let&#x27;s just let&#x27;s go find let&#x27;s go find Titan m3 click off any field emeritus for back down so I just explained you these three fields which are only be used for constellations or asterisms if you if you know the oops I&#x27;m sorry that&#x27;s M 30 here it is M 3 when you do a fine just keep in mind it&#x27;s um it&#x27;ll it&#x27;ll give all the M 3 so not just M 3 by itself but maybe I&#x27;m 35 whatever okay here we have the total number of stars firing that hasn&#x27;t been spawned clusters so you can feel bad if you know the gas mass the gas within a cluster you put it there I mean I have a lot of these fields where we just started we don&#x27;t have the answer but I have them here just in case you do unless your field of interest our commitments for this it is 18 diameter and parsecs fifty five point two and five don&#x27;t have the access ratio but it&#x27;s probably close to 1 beta velocity again you know it&#x27;s really associated not too far away from the Milky Way so it really wouldn&#x27;t have to see distance 10.4 kiloparsecs which the master 3.39 times 7/4 light-years after notice be relative to the scene be are the team BR is costing to microwave background radiation now again the luminosity I probably don&#x27;t have many of these filled for this object but I have this table here for most of the Astrophysical objects so if you know that information to plug it in here and the mass in terms of mass of the Sun 4.5 percent of death and grams at b9e times 10 power see gravitational limits of the cluster 0.74 to kiloparsecs for the first gravitational limit and for the second gravitational limit again i kiloparsecs is 2751 0.9 total mass on them luminosity ratio because i don&#x27;t have if you if you&#x27;re missing a field you&#x27;ll get a question mark a big deal overall metallicity minus one point three four and there&#x27;s a important note here it says if the concentration of Fe to H is equal to minus one then iron has only one tenth of its solar pond so that&#x27;s what that means percent relative silence four point five seven okay parent object is the Milky Way so this means you can click here and you go back to the Milky Way so that&#x27;s fine you have to come back scroll back down to m3 jump back although you could just you could just hit this and I&#x27;ll jump back okay so either way alright so let&#x27;s just take a look at the note here see I think it&#x27;s worth going through I think this is okay so let&#x27;s read this note this is from the universe of motion which is due me Larsen&#x27;s magnificent Astrophysical work so M three contains two i-74 known variable stars so from page thirty points and some mega centauri slightly flattened and some indication of rotation is from found in the spectra examine three and then pages 40 to 45 the seam diagram of the globular cluster im3 is showing three two three let&#x27;s figure through the book in this diagram the points representing the magnitudes applicable to the individual stars fall mainly within the cross-hatched area identification of the locations marked a b and c has been added to the conventional diamond for purposes of the present discussion the mass density in central temperature of the globular cluster stars are related to the variables which seemed by them and although they are subject to modification by other factors so that they cannot be represented accurately in thus to component diagram they can be located approximately and adding them to the framework to the diagram for reference purposes facilitates understanding theoretical development accurate measurements of magnitudes in the area diagram occupied by the globular cluster stars are difficult to obtain SJ Inglis points out that quote there is no red giant whose mass we know with any degree of certainty but we can relate these magnitudes to the evolution bound stars and the surviving approximations of their values you know for instance at the line BC the main sequence is the location of gravitation the stars on this line are therefore approximately the same density Tennessee to C is actually greater than that B by a factor three or four because of the compression due to the larger stellar mass but since the equilibrium densities among the main sequence are more than a million times greater than those in the early portions of area the difference between B and C is negligible on this yellow diagram we may therefore draw lines parallel to BC and treat them as lines of equal density for analytical purposes similarly the line a B theoretically represents a condition of constant mass the theory further indicates that the central temperatures are determined by the stellar mass - parallel to a B you must be regarded as lines of Okuma central temperature on the basis of the explanation of the line AC that will be developed in the following pages this line represents the condition which condensation of a dust cloud the uniform density it&#x27;s proceeding at a rate determined by gravitational forces we may call it a line of constant growth 3/4 is reproduction the m3 diagram with lines representing these other variables adding these lines provide a good indication of the way in which the several variables are ladies of different regions of the diagram and reference to the pattern of the Association will be helpful in interpreting the CM diagrams that will be introduced plate the relations represented by the exhibiting lines figure for applied to the stars of the globular cluster type only as we will see later the corresponding relations the lines of equal mass for instance or all together different for other classes of stars this is the fact that is not heretofore been recognized another site that is responsible for many errors and the Orthodox interpretation interpretations of the same diagrams all the stars of the globular cluster condensed from the same dispersed a grid of primitive material but the conditions affecting the ratio of Kanaan condensation Garrett and the evolutionary stages of the stars therefore differ consequently the stars of a cluster such as empathy are spread out of room range of the stellar evolutionary pattern on the same diagram the earliest of the visible stars are the coolest but by reason of the immense area from which they are radiating hi he stars therefore occupy positions in the upper right of the diagram in the general area marked the remainder of the scepter will give a general description in the past that these stars followed when they leave the area further details will be added in chapter a a massive universe of motion after some additional garlic some lay the Stars the slobbering of clusters exist in two size ranges the great majority are small and the neighborhood of the solar mass are below another portion of the total consists of stars is substantially larger we can either the latter stars that had a fragment of pre-existing material as a nucleus with the condensation in the pre cellar dust and gas cloud the smaller stars are those that did not enjoy this advantage the fragments incorporated into the stars were usually small and explosions that scattered them into space or violent enough to read the greater party regional structure to dust gas and smog it&#x27;s the cellar structure follows essentially the same course whether or not it contains a small fragment as nucleus the important difference is that it takes a very long time to build a dust particle up to navigate a fragment size a pre-sell our aggregate that has a fragment to start with their friends a big head start over those that have to build all the way from dust particles and is able to establish gravitational control over larger volume of the proto cluster thus even though the stars of both these with these groups are nearly alike at the points wars in the area oh those are long group have a much later potential I think I&#x27;m going to stop here continues on again I I took the liberty of quoting extensively from Larson&#x27;s the universe of motion for the person&#x27;s of database just so you&#x27;d have handy when you&#x27;re looking when you&#x27;re working with clogged clusters or whatever it is you&#x27;re working with them in the database all right well that wraps it up for today please study the reciprocal system improve it for yourself for the simplest possible treatment please obtain my work and mysterious universe has all all the concepts many diagrams to facilitate your understanding now if you do want all the mathematics please obtain my magnum opus existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything seven air eleven pages in the PDF file answer me eleven slides in the PowerPoint file as thousands and thousands of equations figures tables diagrams everything that you need to have to understand the reciprocal system in great detail it&#x27;ll take you months ago through this work and once you are finished for that then you should get these two database modules let&#x27;s close out here let&#x27;s go back the macrocosmos database module includes the universe as a whole galaxy clusters and groups galaxies star clusters stars planets moons minor bodies gasps roids and comments nebula gas and dust and voids and you can hop over to the events which comes from the videos of pictures that you pretend free to object also includes a great graphing package the reciprocal system micro cosmos database has all the properties for matter solid matter properties like in atomic distance Dale and specific heat energy and entropy thermal expansion compressibility electrical magnetic properties isotopes inspector for the liquid vapor gas matter properties the program has wyman density specific heat energy and entropy viscosity and surface tension electrical and thermal conductivity and of course it covers cosmic elements and subatomic particles but material cosmic and of course it has photon properties and like the macrocosmic has a great graphing package but that&#x27;s not my mentor Joey B Larson was also a theoretical economist and I&#x27;ve made his economics work fully a computation vote fully computational as well the package is called optimal economists implementation or Sonia Khanna physics covers both Michael economics and macroeconomics completely supersedes Keynesian economics just as the reciprocal system completely supersedes most of my sir all of modern physics alright that&#x27;s it for today again please study the reciprocal assistant and prove it for yourself and thanks for your attention</p>
