            <p>the vector algebra War a historical perspective my name is Derek Abbott and I&#x27;ll be starting off this slideshow explaining our paper and then I&#x27;ll hand over to James Chapel the Gibs Vector system commonly utilized today was adopted over a hundred years ago since then the original formulism has required several extensions in order to be able to describe more modern scientific theories instead the Gibbs vector system is often supplemented by complex numbers used in describing electrical circuits quarians rigid bodies for for rigid body rotations minkowski four vectors for SpaceTime and complex vectors referred to as powerly Spinners and direct Spinners in quantum mechanics as shown such a wide range of notation required today in order order to describe vectorial type quantities has inspired many researchers to look for a more elegant and unified Vector formalism the concept of a vector is actually quite an ancient one going back to at least the time of Aristotelian science in the 4th Century BC it was in 1637 though that deart uh produced a more abstract and modern View of a vector stating just as arithmetic consists of only four or five operations namely addition subtraction multiplication division and the extraction of roots so in Geometry to find required lines it is merely necessary to add or subtract lines in the 19th century the field of complex numbers was established by Gus arand and vessel it was found that a complex number when represented on the arand plane naturally described a two-dimensional Vector this description of vectors allows for Vector division as well as other arithmetic operations and so in agreement with the original conceptualization by deart it was then natural to seek a system of vectors suitable for physical Space by simply generalizing the algebra of the complex numbers to three dimensions this was achieved by Hamilton in 1843 creating the quorans this achievement was hailed as a historic breakthrough and the correct algebraic description for threedimensional vectors this form of vectors also allows for Vector Division and other common arithmetic operations despite the initially high expectations it turned out that Quan were not suitable to describe cartisian vectors in three dimensions the clue to understanding why this is the case is found in the observations that both the complex numbers and the quorans actually describe the rotational algebra of these spaces of SO2 and su2 and so are not actually suitable to describe cartisian vectors Hamilton&#x27;s querian while initially accepted as the correct description of vectors in three dimensions indeed began to run into a series of difficulties this led Gibson heavyside to look for an look for an alternative system of notation to more easily describe cartisian vectors this then produced two parallel streams of vector development that of Gibson heavyside mainly developed by reworking Hamilton&#x27;s quorans and the alternative approach by Clifford based more on the work of Grassman Clifford succeeded in developing the Clifford algebra for three-dimensional space that we intend to show is a superior formalism so what exactly is wrong with querian why did Gibbs and heavyside feel the need need to completely rework uh the quaternionic system of Hamilton we can compare the three Vector three component vectors developed by Gibbs with the four component Quan of Hamilton heavyside stated regarding his rejection of the quaternionic vectors of Hamilton I came later to see that as far as the vector analysis I required was concerned the querian was not only not required but was a positive evil of no inconsiderable magnitude and that by its avoidance the establishment of vector analysis was made quite simple and is and its working also simplified and that it could be conveniently harmonized with ordinary cartisian work one of the problems heavyside refers to derives from the fact that the basis vectors i j k all squar to1 this has the consequence that squaring a vector will give the negative of the Pythagorean length this then means for example that the kinetic energy will be negative strange indeed the second difficulty is because all basis effectors anticommute in Hamilton&#x27;s system then all operations with cians in general being non-c communitive thirdly in place of a simple three component Gibbs Vector we&#x27;re required to add a fourth apparently unnecessary scaler component gibbson heavy side indeed provide a persuasive argument however if we are not satisfied with the many extensions required to the original Gibbs vect of notation and as quorans have shortcomings where should we look for an improved formalism we observed previously that the querian provide the rotational algebra for three dimensions this in fact explains why the basis vectors Square to minus one as well as the need for the extra scalar component added to the three Vector components hence the solution is logically to generalize the querian to conclude a Gibbs type cartisian Vector component while retaining the qu turnning as a subalgebra to be used for rotation operations Clifford&#x27;s description of vector begins with the three basis elements E1 E2 E3 Clifford defines a positive square for these so that they&#x27;re indeed suitable for Cartesian vectors Clifford&#x27;s main Innovation is is simply to allow these basis elements to be combined such as bi vectors E1 E2 E3 E1 and E2 E3 the by vectors now Square to minus one in fact and are isomorphic to the basis basic querian JK the tri Vector another composite quantity also squares to minus one and is also a commuting quantity and so it is a natural geometric replacement for the unit imaginary further we can combine all these components to form a general object called a multiv vector using bold symbols V and W to represent three component vectors we can produce a more compact form for the multiv vector as shown now as we required the subalgebra a +jw is actually isomorphic to the quorans U as stated V is a a Gibbs type Vector that&#x27;s now also included and both the B vectors and tri vectors Square to minus one and so can be used to represent the unit imaginary and hence complex numbers Clifford algebra thus unifies complex numbers pans and Gibbs vectors into a single unified real formalism using only Elementary algebra the multiv vector now also allows us to freely add multiply and divide vectors as daycard envisaged the eight components present in the multiv vector can be envisioned geometrically as points lines areas and volumes indeed Clifford&#x27;s system does more than simply provide an elegant system of vectors it also allows a description of orientated planes given by the three B vectors as well as an orientated volume given by the tri vector and a point is given by the scalar we can now see that the key reason that quorans can be mistaken for cartisian vectors is that in three dimensions we have exactly three rotational degrees of freedom as well as three translational freedoms this is Illustrated in Clifford&#x27;s system with three orthogonal lines and three orthogonal planes this simple overlooked fact appears to light the heart of the disagreement between the followers of Hamilton and Gibbs the Clifford multiv Vector though unifies these two descriptions thus reconciling the two sides and providing a unified and Powerful form formalism superseding both querian and Gibbs vectors this diagram also explains why Clifford algebra is eight dimensional note that we have one scal three vectors three bi Vector planes and one Tri Vector volume this totals eight elements the advantage of Clifford&#x27;s Vector formalism can be immediately seen in a simplification of Maxwell&#x27;s four equations shown here as shown in most uh educational textbooks using Clifford geometry algebra Maxwell&#x27;s equations are now reduced to a single equation that can be simply expressed as the gradient of the field F being equal to the sources present given by J we have defined the four gradient a single field variable F and a source term which combines charges and currents a further advantage of Clifford&#x27;s more General formalism is the ability to more appropriately represent physical quantities as shown in the table Clifford provides four categories for physical variables scalers polar vectors axial vectors and Sho scalers for example angular velocity and the magnetic field are actual vectors and are represented by B vectors as compared with polar vectors such as velocity and the electric field which are distinct po vectors extensive use of complex numbers is made in electrical engineering even though the unit imaginary is a completely abstract quantity without any real clear geometric or physical meaning and imaginary numbers first appeared as roots to quadratic equations which is indeed a fairly abstract setting G himself acknowledging that the true metaphysics of the square &lt; TK of minus1 is elusive using C geometric algebra interestingly we find that a b Vector squares to minus one and is a rotation operat for the plane analogous to the unit imaginary hence Clifford provides a clear geometrical meaning of the unit imaginary as a unit area as shown we have showed how complex numbers and Quan describe the rotational algebra for two and threedimensional space and cliford combines the Gibbs light vectors with this rotational algebra with un ified system that is the rotation operators are provided by the even subalgebras acting on vectors in two all three dimensions the rotation operators being isomorphic to the complex numbers and the querian now potential applications include Max equations electromagnetic waves RLC circuits and transmission lines and isotropic media and metam materials relativity equation for GPS satellites image and Signal processing computer vision and Robotics Quantum Computing and Quantum Game Theory and and many others a leading Clifford algebra exponent Christan has stated Clifford&#x27;s mathematical system should have gone on to dominate mathematical physics but due to a lack of recognition that Clifford&#x27;s system unifies the two formalisms the vector algebra War continues</p>
