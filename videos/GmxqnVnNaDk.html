            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I spent 20 years working in the US intelligence community. I&#x27;ve worked on highly classified UAP programs for the government as a senior scientist. &gt;&gt; We have been discovered by an intelligence from some other part of the universe. They are here. This is real.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s [music] happening. It&#x27;s happening now. If I were a species from somewhere else who saw how we were coming up this curve of, you know, atomic [music] energy and nuclear energy and then began to realize what it takes [music] to do their kind of technologies with warping time and warping space and so on. I could imagine that could be seen as a threat to another species because they would recognize that well [music] it&#x27;s only a matter of time and they&#x27;re going to be doing what we&#x27;re doing and then we&#x27;re going to have to deal with them. &gt;&gt; So it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that their highest priority would be to identify [music] what threats they might face and learn everything about them.</p>
<p>This pattern of activity seems to me utterly logical. [music] It seems to me to be an extension of the evolutionary process that governs life at large as we know it, which is self-preservation is [music] number one.</p>
