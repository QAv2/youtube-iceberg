            <p>her from the Hannibal tv.com and I just finished watching the full interview that everybody is talking about this week and last week with David grush who is a whistleblower for anyone that doesn&#x27;t know he&#x27;s an Air Force veteran from Pittsburgh who was part of a military dead military intelligence and the uh the unidentified aerial phenomenon task force he resigned on his own accord because he feels it&#x27;s more important to get this word out from the outside right now rather than inside but I&#x27;m going to review this this crazy interview that he did and and I believe him he&#x27;s he&#x27;s a legitimate Military Intelligence person coming out trying to get disclosure and he&#x27;s also made formal complaints that contain classified pictures and information from the government and he&#x27;s made these complaints to the Inspector General of the intelligence service who deemed them urgent and credible for everyone taking shots of him this guy is legitimate and this is this was quite an interview he was taking great personal and professional Risk by coming out he waited four years to file his complaint and he made this complaint based on the credentials of people that he worked with on the UAP task force the documents he&#x27;s read the pictures he&#x27;s seen former the foreign intelligence he&#x27;s aware of and specific details on how everything worked now I&#x27;m going to get into the details of this extended interview and as I said some of this stuff is really mind-blowing especially this is someone like me that&#x27;s been researching this subject for for over 10 years now actually I would say close to 13 or 14 years seriously so relay basically there he&#x27;s saying that the United States is in possession of aircraft that was basically built by non-human intelligence and why he says non-human intelligence rather than aliens is he himself is not actually sure where they come from they could be from somewhere on this Earth where we don&#x27;t know Antarctica underwater they could be from another dimension he&#x27;s not exactly sure they could be from another planet he&#x27;s just classifying them as non-human intelligence and he says we&#x27;re absolutely not alone he&#x27;s unequivocally saying we are not alone as an intelligence officer on the UAP task force he he&#x27;s very well aware that we are not alone and that there is also a disinformation campaign that has targeted the U.S populace for decades now he says we have intact craft as well as partially intact craft and there have been some bodies recovered he has documents and photos that would prove his claim that he has submitted to the Inspector General however he can&#x27;t just submit these to the public or he would face severe consequences he says there&#x27;s other secrets that he knows from the government that he&#x27;s not going to come forward with relate to other matters but he feels this is a highly important matter and as I said the Inspector General has actually publicly said he can say that the inspector General deemed his information urgent and credible so he says he doesn&#x27;t know if the craft travels through space as we know that they could be coming from a higher dimensional physical place that might be co-located here he&#x27;s not sure on that one he said the cover-up has existed for 90 years since the first craft recovery in 1933 in Italy in Magneta Italy they recovered a partially intact craft there where the government moved it to secure airspace in Italy for the duration of the fascist regime until around 1945 when Pope Pius XII back channeled that information that the Italians had that craft to the Americans who ended up obtaining that craft so the Vatican has been aware of the existence of non-human human Intelligence on the planet since at least around that time where when they were part of the arrangement to get the craft to the U.S apparently the uh Roswell incidents which he cannot talk about if he&#x27;s not legally allowed to talk about it through his uh he&#x27;s he&#x27;s been legally permitted to talk about certain things but not others uh he says that there was a craft that crashed in the desert near the town of Roswell the Air Force discovered the material and it was described as metallic and rubbery the government first called it a flying disc and other times it called it a weather balloon and spy balloon reminds me of I know we got at least one spy balloon this year but there was three other mysterious balloons shot down by missiles that we never actually saw the debris of uh the the officer says that the government added additional elements to the Roswell story over time to further decredit the the people of Roswell for some UFOs that have been recovered some have been landed and they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve obtained them somehow others have crashed as far as how can such advanced species crash vehicles the officer says there&#x27;s always a small percentage of a chance that something&#x27;s going to crash I mean you can&#x27;t always guarantee that something&#x27;s not going to crash but he&#x27;s not saying that they&#x27;re all crashed vehicles and this isn&#x27;t in this report but there there has been talk that the the government in the U.S alone uh could be in possession of as many as 12 crash vehicles he says the reason for secrecy is feudalistic dominance on who can have the technology first and it&#x27;s all related to war and the other interesting thing well I won&#x27;t I&#x27;ll bring this up after I&#x27;ll get back into it apparently in the 50s and 60s he says there were instances where uaps tampered with nuclear missiles at the monstrum Air Force Base in Montana there were craft appearing to be intelligently controlled hovering over nuclear silos and at least 10 nuclear missiles were shut down he says that whoever is monitoring us understands how far we&#x27;ve Advanced it might be innocent scientific Gathering that they&#x27;re doing could be deep hole probing that they&#x27;re doing he says the crash retrieval program still continues the people working with this technology have been putting themselves at risk some have been injured dealing with the material looking at some of the parts others have been injured and had biological issues and have suffered physically from working with it obviously we don&#x27;t know where this is coming from uh there there&#x27;s risks for the military people that that have worked on this he is stating from the documents he&#x27;ve seen some of these people have been physically harmed through their service uh regarding uh the 2015 footage that came out this footage he said he did study it uh with his role in the UAP task force and he said it&#x27;s definitely not a jet from his research possibly a natural phenomenon regarding the famous Tic Tac he also worked on that this was from 2004. he said this is a vehicle physically not from this world he said there&#x27;s other footage that has not been released of vehicles as long as football fields that are much more menacing and and shocking they have not come out yet regarding the uh the USS Omaha footage that came out recently he also says there&#x27;s no tangible explanation from this for this craft when they examined that footage and as far as the football along for by the way this is a middle eastern uh UFO that a U.S drone picked up that was recently officially released by the government as well and as far as these football field long one this is just a drawing of one of Amura Mora that Avi Loeb discovered um those ones could be scary I mean that&#x27;s a drawing one that&#x27;s not a that he&#x27;s saying the military hasn&#x27;t released any of the the footage of that and by the way regarding the Tic Tac and the the Nimitz footage there&#x27;s there&#x27;s longer videos apparently the videos are about 10 minutes long of those they only released a few seconds of it he also says there&#x27;s at least one private Aerospace company storing alien craft he&#x27;s not going to say where they all are they do apparently the government contacts these companies privately to do Secret analysis of these crafts he says some elected officials are not read in on this information so not necessarily all presidents know about this he says the Pentagon saying they have found no creditable evidence of uaap activity he does not know why they&#x27;re saying that he says in his opinion it&#x27;s misleading the U.S public and he&#x27;s been aware of lies that have been made related to this subject over the years he says what the intent of these things are he says we&#x27;ll never know or he will never know their intent but it appears to be negative based on what he is aware of as far as the nuclear site probings witness testimony and there have been injuries due to these craft he says there have been attempts to bring these craft down and they have developed this is interesting there&#x27;s been techniques developed to deal with some of these crafts so maybe they have found a way to take some of these crafts down he said he can&#x27;t get into the specifics uh of of the dangers towards humans related to this situation but he can confirm that some humans have been hurt and killed related to this the the reporter then says have some humans been murdered by by these visitors and he he&#x27;s basically agreeing to that without saying murder he says these beings have been around for centuries through Wars famine Etc they appeared neutral on humans what on What humans decide to do to each other he mentions that China and Russia have their own crash retrieval programs and there&#x27;s kind of a competition going on with with Russia and China related to this he did mention there&#x27;s actually a document that&#x27;ll put up a screenshot of related to a a deal a 1971 agreement that the United States has and this is a public document with Russia related that they will notify each other related to unidentified objects in other words if they UFOs could potentially cause a false flag operation for instance if there&#x27;s a football field long object in our airspace that we might think is Russian it may accidentally cause a war so supposedly there there&#x27;s agreements between various countries with each other to notify each other related to these objects however it&#x27;s sad that we&#x27;re it&#x27;s funny that people think well all these all of these entire other potential things out there whatever they are visitors might have the same intentions but us on Earth can&#x27;t even get along we&#x27;re more worried just supposedly about gathering information War related to fight each other than dealing with whatever this issue might be on a global scale and and yeah apparently this agreement is to notify each other uh and avoid false flag incidents due to UAP provocation um apparently he says people have been killed protecting this Secret he says the videos that have been released so far are just the tip of the iceberg of the evidence that the government is in possession of uh he says the reason why he feels the material he&#x27;s seen from these craft are are not of this Earth he says it&#x27;s a strange heavy Atomic metal arrangement that we don&#x27;t quite understand yet and the emerging properties are just a strange mix of uh elements uh very specifically engineered not by humans he says one of the reasons he&#x27;s coming out is he thinks it shouldn&#x27;t just be the military researching this he says there could be a this is like a worldwide problem and not just a military problem and he feels if the public is aware of this and more people can research it we could get a better solution to the problem and the technology could be shared and the whole world could benefit from it and he says he understands that there can be some dangers for sharing information about this stuff which is why the governments might be hesitant to share it but he also points out that nuclear energy is not a secret but the good but the U.S doesn&#x27;t like give out all their information on how they make nuclear weapons so he feels that this secret could be let out into the public for the greater good of humanity without specific details related to National Security being known so so there you go this is this is pretty pretty crazy stuff and as I said this guy is legitimate this is just like mind-blowing stuff and and people like to take shots at him they&#x27;re first of all there there could be a reason why he only gave two interviews because sometimes people agree to do exclusive interviews he did say he wasn&#x27;t paid for this and they&#x27;re just not going to do multiple interviews to come out public about stuff like this why are you going to come out and do every single interview on the planet hopefully other people will come out there have been some that have collaborated some of it and he has made a formal report no uh no David Rush does not have any connection to Steven Greer he actually said that he feels that the these things are negative I mean anything that plays with nuclear silos you cannot consider that positive and he and he even mentioned in this there&#x27;s been Wars going on since the beginning of time and and Dr Jacques valet and I already put this up the other week uh who is a prominent UFO researcher has also said there&#x27;s been Indica there&#x27;s been situations where nuclear war has almost occurred and these things have not stepped in okay well you can say mental health all you want but again he did make a formal complaint to the supervising body the Inspector General of the U.S intelligence service who said this was an urgent and critical complaint so I guess I guess it&#x27;s all crazy right no you&#x27;re not taking my word that his word is good you&#x27;re taking the word of his credentials and the research I&#x27;ve done on it you can do your own research I never say anyone to take my word 100 on anything I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;ve ever since this story first came out when I think I became aware of it on Thursday or Friday I&#x27;ve been non-stop researching it and from the research I&#x27;ve done I believe him you guys can do your you guys can do your own research would I do another robber Fuller interview yes yes we&#x27;re not alone it does it doesn&#x27;t appear so but this is this is like the most credible person that that&#x27;s come out Paul Heller who I&#x27;ve interviewed from from uh the former Canadian minister of defense I did his last extended interview that that has been picked up in documentaries and various TV series over the years uh he did not know all of this inside information he knew some but but not as much as this so I don&#x27;t know all I know is I&#x27;d like to know what&#x27;s inside of these things that are the size of American football fields I&#x27;m very interested in this NASA by the way yeah you know what Paul Hellyer said in my interview with him the NASA&#x27;s Dasha knows a lot more than they let on but NASA recently held a UFO hearing stuff is stuff is coming out now this this is why this is this is weird because stuff is coming out and if you actually research and look this stuff up there&#x27;s tons of evidence out there and I think disclosure is happening guys it&#x27;s happening uh I I found that interview highly interesting it&#x27;s a scary situation for sure you know what the only person that that I will believe as far as as David&#x27;s claims the only person that I will take as far as picking apart the claims are the people that he submitted the photos and classified documents too which which is the uh the Inspector General I was in the Army for two years in the reserves guys you can&#x27;t give classified information and not get thrown in jail he was given permission to give some of this information you can&#x27;t go in and put up classified photos and not get thrown in jail like I know I know I know the deal with the military even though I was only at the low level of the military it&#x27;s highly strict uh the court martials you can face are far worse than civilian Court martials anyways guys have a great night thank you for watching the Hannibal TV please like this video If you enjoyed
