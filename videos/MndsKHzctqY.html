            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right I hope you all do are doing well out there and welcome to my channel I do uh educational videos on uh a wide variety of topics although I&#x27;ve pretty much been focused in on one topic for the last year uh which is the reciprocal system of theory and today is video number 353 that we&#x27;ve done on dwey B Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory and uh Larson lived from 1898 until 1990 I was born in North Dakota moved out to the Portland area and did most of his work out there uh eventually uh he has kind of an organization out in Salt Lake City as well um and um Larson&#x27;s basic idea is that we live in a universe made out of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but is made out of motion and for Larson motion was the relationship between space and time this posits a reciprocal relationship between space and time hence the reciprocal system of theory and uh time and space do not have any independent existence they only exist together in motion mainly as a fraction motion is a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator but space and time uh can come in different uh kind of different gradations or measurements different powers and so there are a lot of different permutations of time and space and or space and time and uh they uh constitute all of our basic uh scientific units such as speed space over time energy time over space acceleration space over time to the second power matter time to the third power over space to the third power and so on and so forth and um basically uh universe is made out of motion motion is a relationship between space and time and space and time both have their coordinate aspects meaning that they can come in three dimensions they both have their clock aspects meaning that they both come in uh what Larson calls their scaler aspect uh when Larsson says the universe is made out of motion he&#x27;s referring specifically to a kind of motion that he calls scalar motion that is a motion that is recognized by Legacy science but not uh given any type of significance the way that you um would visualize uh scalar motion is using a balloon with dots on it when you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction uh you can really think of it as they&#x27;re moving in all directions uh that is the characteristic of the scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but has no spef specific Direction and uh is this kind of motion that this universe is constructed out of um now this was also observed uh by the astronomers in that uh all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and it can be observed in the inverse in gravity when you take that balloon and you suck it in and all of the dots begin to move toward each other this is analogous to gravity um and um the only way that you actually get a gravitational field or a direction is when you assign one of the dots as the reference point so the the direction is coming from the reference point not from the scalar motion once you assign a reference point once you say this particular dot is not moving then all of a sudden all of the directions become defined and uh you can say each particular dot is moving in a specific Direction um and it appears as if there&#x27;s a field between one dot and another dot or between the reference point and another dot uh it appears as if one is being drawn to the other but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s actually going on what&#x27;s actually going on is all of the points are being drawn toward all of the other points so uh you know this concept of a gravitational field as well as a magnetic field or electric field are are fit itions that are related to assign the assign assignment of a reference point now space and time also come in only discrete units meaning that they uh have there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time you have to have a full unit before you have anything and uh if you have one full unit of space in one full unit of time then you have the speed of light the speed of light is what Larson refers to as unit speed one over one equals 1 and this is basically the one place where space and time are equal to each other and uh so this is the midpoint of this universe or Larson calls it the null point or the um reference point the the natural reference system um the state of rest of this universe is moving outward at the speed of light in all directions and then from there uh we break into two separate sectors of the universe uh from that boundary so this unit speed is a boundary between two reciprocal sectors of the universe Larson calls these the material SE sector which is where the motion is slower than the speed of light and the cosmic sector where the motion is faster than the speed of light and these are reciprocals so if you can figure out what&#x27;s going on in the material sector which the Legacy scientists have mapped out um then you can also understand what&#x27;s going on in the cmic sector only you have to invert the roles of space and time so in the material sector you have um you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and clock time the time is always getting later and later and later and later it&#x27;s a scalar motion and time uh in the cosmic sector you have coordinate Spa a coordinate time three dimensions of time and you have clocks space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart scalar Motion in space uh so that kind of maps it out a little bit that&#x27;s basically uh uh outlining larsson&#x27;s First Fundamental postulate out of two and his second fundamental postulate is more or less that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian now one person who has come along and has kind of disagreed with that second postulate is Dr Bruce paret who uh is one of the principal revisers of the reciprocal system and has come up with what he calls rs2 reciprocal system 2 the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system that he arrived at along with Dr kbk neru and uh Dr pet uh would rephrase that second postulate to say that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary mathematics getting rid of the word commutative its magnitudes are absolute getting rid of primary magnitudes and its geometry is projective now projective geometry is a more encompassing geometry than ukian ukian geometry is a subset of projective geometry now what&#x27;s interesting about this and we went through this uh a couple weeks ago with one of pret&#x27;s papers is that when paret adjusts his second postulate in that way he obviates the need for um all of the metaphysical postulates that Larsson has to come up with he Larsson has four metaphysical postulates in addition to his two fundamental physical postulates and you know so this is uh he came up with the two physical postulates first but then when he attempted to delve into metaphysical matters matters beyond the physical uh such as life and Consciousness and ethics uh he found that his two postulates did not do the job his two postulates did not cover those areas and so he proposed four separate postulates for his um metaphysical study which is his final book called beyond space and time that actually came out after he died and U by adjusting the second postulate in the way that pet did he he no longer needs those four metaphysical postulates and he&#x27;s able to use just the two fundamental postulates of larsson&#x27;s amended um to cover the metaphysical sector as well um which uh is I think a great accomplishment now we are looking at another paper that Bruce pret wrote uh called uh dimensions and displacements and we started that paper yesterday um this is uh paper rs2 d106 uh he&#x27;s got uh nine separate little tutorial papers on the reciprocal system two the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system so this is number six we&#x27;ve gone through the first five um in earlier episodes and then we started this one in yesterday&#x27;s episode so if you want to get go to the top you want to uh check out at least the tail end of yesterday&#x27;s video okay so now today we&#x27;re starting with a section that is called number of dimensions and and uh just to point out before um you know before we got to this point in this paper uh he was talking about kind of the orientation of scalar motion so when you have uh you know uh motion being a relationship between space and time then you have like really three different scalar orientations even though he doesn&#x27;t use that word here um they can either be space and time can be equal to each other which is the uh natural reference system and the state of rest of the universe and it is the speed of light outward in all directions 1 over 1 equals 1 unit speed that&#x27;s where space and time are equal or space could be greater than time or time can be greater than space when uh time is greater than space you&#x27;re talking about material sector phenomena when space is greater than time you&#x27;re talking about Cosmic sector phenomena U and uh so now we&#x27;re going into and and as I mentioned there is a difference between dimensions of space and dimensions of motion of scalar motion it requires three dimensions of space to Define one dimension of scalar motion and we only can really view properly view one dimension of scalar motion at a time in the reference system there there are two other scalar Dimensions that uh we can only uh incompletely view or view uh a part of or um indirectly view I believe he&#x27;s going to get into that here so okay number of Dimensions now that we have this tristate dimension of motion you know greater than less than or equal to how many of these Dimensions can be linked together to form a single compound structure professor kbk neru in his paper some thoughts on spin addresses this question as a problem in geometric stability if you have orthogonal Dimensions how may how many can exist together in a stable form his answer is just probability of arrangement in a closed group of operators like uh one i j and k the three imaginary operators the result of the combination of any number of Basil elements is also a member of the same group the result of any such combination can be known only if all the possible binary combinations of the elements are first defined in terms of the basal elements i j and k themselves besides of course the identity operator one Let There Be n basal elements excluding the unit operator one in a group then the number of unique binary combinations of these elements in which no element occurs twice is n * the quantity n minus1 all over 2 we can readily see that a group becomes self-sufficient or finite only if the number of binary combinations of the Bas elements is equal to the number of those basal elements themselves that is n * quantity n -1 / 2 = N and that equation is only solved by the number three the only definite solution for n is three zero and infinity are other Solutions therefore if we regard space or time as a group of orthogonal rotations its dimensionality has to be three in order to make it self-sufficient dimensionally otherwise the number of Dimensions either has to shrink to zero or proliferate to Infinity now I can kind of understand that uh line of thinking but I don&#x27;t know that you H why do you have to regard space and time as a group of orthogonal rotations I don&#x27;t uh I don&#x27;t necessarily see that they have to be orthogonal means at a right angle to each other if we regard space and time as a group of orthagonal orthogonal rotations its dimensionality has to be three who says that you have to that they have to be orthogonal I I just continue to think of Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s tetrahedral coordinates and um you know there you have four coordinates they are not orthogonal but I believe that they are still in dependent I could be wrong um perhaps somebody knows that better than I do but it seems to me like the tetrahedral coordinates are self-sufficient um and that they create a um coherent structure without having to be orthogonal to each other what is the um magic about orthogonality okay nar&#x27;s analysis indicates the point of dimensional stability is three dimensions and all of the building blocks of the reciprocal system are based on three dimensions of motion three scalar Dimensions evenly distributed across the material and Cosmic sectors each Dimension has three states with the states of speed and energy consist uh constituting some kind of structure now remember speed is a material sector thing energy is a cosmic sector thing and then in between them is the speed of light um or I guess you would could also call it the energy of light so um these three states greater than less than or equal Al to or really greater than equal to or less than constituting some kind of structure lson refers to these uh offsets from the state of unity as units of motion where each dimension of motion has two units of motion um s over T and t/ S so you start from the State uh the natural reference system the speed of light 1 over one and in One Direction you go toward s over T and in the other direction you go toward T over s now this section is called dimensions of motion though there are six units of motion numbered 1 through six on the diagram that uh you can&#x27;t see you will never see Larson refer to more than three of these units when the fourth unit of motion is reached the net motion is no longer speed but now energy making the structure Cosmic in nature so the fourth unit of material motion looking at the table left to right is analogous to the third unit of cosmic motion looking at the table right to left so basically you know you have the boundary in between which is the speed of light on this side you have the first second and third dimensions of speed on the lower material sector half and over here you have the first second and third dimensions of energy if you&#x27;re going into that fourth dimension of speed you are actually in the third dimension of energy and vice versa so um let&#x27;s read that that paragraph that sentence again so the fourth unit of material motion looking at the table left or right is analogous to the the third unit of cosmic motion looking at the table right to left and the motion is no longer directly observable with our conventional instrumentation any aggregate will have its net Motion in one of these three units of motion which Larson refers to as speed ranges we&#x27;ve got the uh 1 - x uh rate uh region or range 1 - x that&#x27;s uh the speed of light minus X which is the low speed range first unit this is the realm of conventional science and what we observe as our spatial reality then we have the 2- X range that an X being uh you know less than x is a fraction so 2 minus a fraction a fraction less than one so basically it&#x27;s saying that the speed is between one and two units 2 - x whereas 1 - x is saying it&#x27;s between zero and one unit so the 2 - x range is intermediate speed the second unit these motions are observable but have inverse properties such as white dwarf stars um and inverse thermal motion super hot appearing cold now uh a white dwarf star is basically a star that has exploded like a supernova but the explosion has been so powerful that some of the star is blown past the speed of light and then when it goes past the speed of light it moves from this low speed range into the intermediate speed range and then you start dealing with these what you calls inverse properties so when something is blowing up in space you know it expands like this that&#x27;s a supernova but when it blows up in space uh when it blows up beyond the speed of light the uh explosion is no longer in space but it is in time and when it blows up in time we don&#x27;t see time we only see space and so the way that we see time is that we see the reciprocal aspect in space and so if something is blowing up uh in time that means it&#x27;s expanding in time uh but we don&#x27;t see time we only see space so we see it as imploding in space and that is a white dwarf star that is a star that extremely small and extremely dense because it is imploding it&#x27;s getting smaller and smaller the same amount of mass is being being confined to a smaller and smaller area of uh equivalent space that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called equivalent space it&#x27;s not in space it&#x27;s in equivalent space which is the inverse of being in time so the explosion goes into time okay and then the 3 minus X range is what L what Larson calls the ultra highspeed range the third unit also observable as an intermediate speed motion but with which is the 2- X range but with more pronounced effects such as the anti-gravity motion of pulsars due to the dimensional reduction at this speed range ultra high speed motion tends to be linear uh the dimensional reduction yes you only see things in one you only are able to actually see one of the three dimensions there so this is a an explo a stellar explosion that is occurring um that is going more than twice the speed of light when it gets into that third region then you see even more pronounced effects in addition to the white dwarfing that that&#x27;s going on you start to see uh what would be called the Pulsar U which is kind of a turning off and on of um of the star Larson goes over all this in his book Universe of motion and also his book quazars and pulsars uh we will eventually get around to looking at those I believe um but um now pet is kind of introducing this stuff kind of out of nowhere and so it&#x27;s difficult to follow I recognize but um that&#x27;s an important Concept in the reciprocal system is the three speed ranges now the only time you&#x27;re really dealing with these three speed ranges in Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system is when you&#x27;re dealing with stars and galaxies astronomical effects that&#x27;s really the only way that he&#x27;s documenting that you can blow uh past the speed of light is through a powerful explosion um now uh pet tends to use these speed ranges more broadly and he&#x27;ll probably get into that but I believe we&#x27;re going to stop right there uh in the middle of the section and uh start up again tomorrow oh well let me just read this last paragraph here of the section lson uses the um 1 to x 2 to X or 3 tox or 3 - x 1 - x 2 - x 3 - x format to indicate which unit of motion the speed is in for example 2 - x says that the motion is in the second unit of motion at some value less than the max maximum for the unit unit which is two units okay now the next section coming up is called the concept of the clock and so we&#x27;re going to be dealing with scaler his discussion on scaler motion um with the clock okay um if you feel like you&#x27;re lost don&#x27;t fret um you know that happens from time to time with the reciprocal system system it&#x27;s uh a lot of um mental gymnastics a lot of unfamiliar mental processes and a lot of unfamiliar uh territory that you have to cross into uh just let it wash over you don&#x27;t judge it just uh take it in and uh once you have a fuller picture then you can evaluate it uh for validity um but you can&#x27;t uh reject it just based on the current knowledge that you have because you&#x27;re not seeing the full picture and um you know it would be easy to to reject these Concepts u based on the prior knowledge that you already have but that is not really a valid way to look at it because you&#x27;re not um you&#x27;re using circular logic that way okay thanks for tuning in</p>
