            <p>this video is going to involve you redesigning what you think you know about everything the reciprocal systems theory or The Theory of Everything was invented by Dewey B Larson who is an engineer and an astrophysicist in the mid 1900s because you think there&#x27;s so many things that modern science cannot answer what is gravity what is inertial force The Big Bang Theory is kind of nonsense so he came to this Theory very open-minded but very structurally and scientifically sound too he studied the likes of Einstein Tesla and Schrodinger and he created a theoretical framework that explains everything from the largest to the smallest from galaxies and super clusters all the way down to the atom and cool enough it brings together both the physical and the metaphysical realm too explaining all the magic associated with human consciousness and spirituality this reciprocal systems theory blows all current dogmatic science out of the water the dogmatic science taught in the high bastions of our education system by education I mean indoctrination the owners of the planet wouldn&#x27;t own it if we knew was really going on but luckily like Larson we can unlearn relearn and take our power back now what&#x27;s cool about this theory is that it&#x27;s complex enough to explain most all observable science yet basic enough for us actually to comprehend the ideas of it reciprocal system is a scientific fancy way to describe yinyang or Duality Larson postulates that what makes up our physical Universe isn&#x27;t matter but its motion existing in three dimensions with two reciprocal aspects space and time space and time both have their receptive sectors which he calls the material and the cosmic sector the material sector is what we currently see that is space time or space over time this material sector has three dimensions of space and only one of time the motion occurs physically up down front back left to right but it&#x27;s the time that is fixed now the cosmic sector is time space or time over space this is the metaphysical reality with three dimensions of time and one of space you can see the yin-yang it here physical and metaphysical with motion making it all interesting how they never show pictures of our solar system in school with motion involved they got to hide the hints the fun part about this theory is that it logically explains gravity free energy faster than light travel telepathy dematerialization and a bunch of other Fringe Concepts hope you enjoyed the basics of this physical model that I tried to piece together and I believe larsson&#x27;s Theory or large parts of it will be standard learning for everyone in the near future</p>
