            <p>[Music] for decades cold fusion has remained in the fringes of scientific research but recently there&#x27;s been a huge flurry of new interest from the press and researchers into the topic so why is everyone so interested well if cold fusion is proven to work it really does have the potential to change the world Sam took a look at some of the promising Innovations in Cold Fusion research cold fusion it&#x27;s traditionally seen by mainstream science as The Preserve of loonies in tinfoil hats the promise of lowcost pollution-free nuclear reactors in every car home and City seems just a little bit too good to be true cold fusion gained attention in 1989 after two scientists Stanley pwns and Martin fman said it explained higher than normal energy output in some lab experiments but it was dismissed by the scientific Community because no one else could reliably reproduce the results and it eventually became a running joke but C fusions had a Rebrand with some claiming what&#x27;s now known as low energy nuclear reactions same science but now thought to be nothing to do with Fusion could actually be a viable power source for decades some Fringe scientists have claimed that a reaction between specially prepared nickel and hydrogen can generate copper and a lot more energy than is put in a few products have been touted as coming to the market but none have yet appeared partly due to the fact that for every successful test there&#x27;s another which simply refuses to work the proponent of one such product is Andrea Rossy and his ecat or energy catalyzer his experiments have been witnessed by several groups including journalists and the Swedish skeptic Society who left unconvinced well they are a skeptic Society but they didn&#x27;t dismiss the idea out of hand he also claims to have sold one power plant unit to a major Anonymous Us customer widely reported to be Dara the American equivalent of Q Branch another company De Kon claims to have held successful tests with a similar device and says that they were witnessed by a scientist with long-standing links to NASA meanwhile NASA itself has held demonstrations of such devices at the Glenn Research Center in September 2011 so crucially big organizations are now accepting the theory of a science that had been a laughing stock but don&#x27;t go and invest all your money in nickel just yet Steven CET is the editor of the new energy times and says despite the hype we&#x27;re still a long way from a proven technology the whole idea of looking at this and thinking about this in terms of devices or products very premature in general everybody who&#x27;s working in the field still is struggling to a understand what&#x27;s going on they are struggling to figure out how to make it work under their control so we&#x27;re still talking science there is no technology yet so Skeptics are still skeptical but Believers are becoming more confident that we could be on the cusp of something that would change the world overnight so what do you think is lenr in from the cold post your comments and video responses and as always like subscribe and share with your friends</p>
