            <p>and as we&#x27;ve pointed out the fee field is probably being used we also point out that you can use the a field the so-called vector magnetic potential field in a different manner from what is presently known in ordinary electromagnetics if you will check for example feynman&#x27;s three volumes of physics you will check in the second volume you will find that an experiment was done to see whether or not the a field was a mathematical uh figment or whether or not it was a real fundamental field of nature the experiment proved conclusively that the a field even when separated from the dale cross operator that yields b field or magnetic field is indeed a fundamental new field of nature in other words the present a field that&#x27;s in the theory is used totally always coupled with magnetic field we have not explored the use of the uncoupled a field whatsoever but every magnetic circuit for example that has a coil in it with the current going around through the coil has a swirling a field in it and we can if we wish disconnect that a field from the magnetic field in which case we have a new kind of field presently unknown and unutilized in western technology so the combination of the field technology and the a-field technology will yield the full extent of the tesla technology</p>
