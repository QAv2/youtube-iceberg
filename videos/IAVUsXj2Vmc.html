            <p>and that all of that is going on at sub subconscious level and being replayed for the conscious mind what I&#x27;d add to that that&#x27;s very good for the physiology but I would add to that uh it depends on which level of mind you&#x27;re talking about the conscious mind uh reaction of the conscious mind is totally one thing that&#x27;s a Serial processor reaction of the unconscious mind the conscious mind is what you think and walk around conscious normally in this you know and you say well I wonder what I atat for breakfast that&#x27;s all your conscious mind cereal cereal means like your regular computer over there at the instant you&#x27;re looking at the tip of your nose at that precise instant you do not see or perceive anything else but just so fast and you&#x27;re doing them the operations so fast you think you see a screen and it has a persistence like a a continuous recall for persistence just like the screen on your computer and so the conscious mind really is a Serial processor the unconscious is totally conscious but it&#x27;s massively parallel it&#x27;s got gillions of things in the slide projectors all at the same time when your conscious mind tries to look at that it just sees you know 10,000 things at once all slides in slide but it just sees black so the unconscious to communicate with the conscious has to form symbology scenarios dreams to a Master playright if the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist knows enough about you in your back ground he can interpret the meaning of the symbology and sometimes you can yourself it&#x27;s not a fix symbolically it varies varies with the individual Collective unconscious has a totally different kind of speed a disembodied conscious or unconscious what happens in this embodiment is basically if you&#x27;re still living and and just out of body that&#x27;s one kind you still retain a conscious you can retain the conscious impression but speed&#x27;s quite different than when it&#x27;s in the body of the reaction if you uh are dead and disembodied what happens is the conscious mind withdraws back into the unconscious and all that mess you put on in there in your life and repressed down in there that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking at it&#x27;s like being in the worst nightmare of dream you ever hand you can&#x27;t wake up and you can&#x27;t get rid of it so it depends on what level you&#x27;re talking about of the speed of thought the the thought exists we just mean mind structuring and mind operations that existed all those levels and each one is different uh certainly Tom gave you an extremely good rundown on the physiology of the Mind connecting to the body to give you response whether it comes from the autonomic nervous system and so forth in certain out of the training systems not just in martial arts but in some martial arts and um I ran into it in iido the training is devoted towards trying to achieve what&#x27;s called a no mind State this means when you&#x27;re cons ious mind quits interfering with the process and quits thinking and leaves it to your unconscious Which is far more rapid particularly in perception and forming the stuff which then it normally presents to the conscious and say hey you got a problem you know do something if you use that directly the speed is um 10 to 15 times faster than the normal physiological um process that Tom so adequately described what happens then is you uh will have a sense quite often of the slowing down you probably some of you have had the experience this probably in a near accident this will sometimes trigger from the adrenaline pump but all of a sudden everything is moving at a snail&#x27;s pace well in martial arts if you actually achieve the no mind State first of all you may be 15 ft outside your body as a point of Consciousness watching it happen and not in your body at all and watching it very calmly without thought by the way no thinking just perception and everything will be in absolute slow motion a blow a very Fierce kick delivered at you will move with just almost infinite slowness you got all the time in the world looking at it the other thing is the opponents will to you everything happens in slow motion the opponents will not know what part of their body you touched or how they were thrown and uh they will see you moving at blinding speed when you didn&#x27;t see it that way at all so it&#x27;s a very curious State uh I had experience with that several times but I never certainly never achieved that Third Day level you have not achieved that state at all but sometimes at the seventh Dan level you people do achieve that state and they can do what we would normally call miraculous things and their speed of thought has altered because they&#x27;re using thought on a different level the master of the school I&#x27;ll give you one example there is a videotape taking of this fall in70s against about a fourth or fifth degree black belt karate player making a very Speedy strike at him and the old Master does a formal bow in nine frames of a 64 frame per second slow motion shot does a full formal Japanese bow from the waist goes down all the way to his hands and knees on the floor makes a motion and his coming up on the other side and from the first frame the interval to the other frame was eight frames and that&#x27;s 1/8 of the second he did all of that in 1/8 of a second but if you&#x27;re standing on the side looking at it with your eyes you just see a blur of movement you don&#x27;t really see what happened you can&#x27;t your mind won&#x27;t register it that this individual move like that but he did and you know he put it on film and of course some of the more advanced students can also also do the same thing so thoughts are very funny thing you got to specify which thoughts you&#x27;re talking about isn&#x27;t just your conscious mind if you think you&#x27;re just your conscious mind you know you&#x27;re not you&#x27;re a lot bigger than that and you got a lot access to a lot more things than that so thought and mind are very deep subjects and the speed does vary depending on the level and the conditions that it operates in in the totally disembodied state it has no limit on the speed in in the embodied State it&#x27;s very slow very very very slow uh in a normal human being where you try to involve your conscious mind a quarter of a second&#x27;s about the best you can do even when you&#x27;re fast uh that&#x27;s why you got to train until you condition it to where the unconscious takes over and does it and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s called a reflex action and it&#x27;s called conditioned training in that case and until you get that no sports or no golfer or anybody else is really skilled until it has moved down to that level past the consciousness</p>
