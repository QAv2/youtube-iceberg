            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Beyond Belief. I&#x27;m George Nory and we&#x27;re going to talk some real science today with Dr. Paul Lavlet. He&#x27;s been the president of the Starburst Foundation since well 1984 where he has conducted research in physics, astronomy, geology, climatology, and so much more. And his book is called Secrets of Anti-gravity Propulsion.</p>
<p>Paul, welcome to Beyond Belief. &gt;&gt; Glad to be here, George. It&#x27;s been a long time since you and I have talked since the radio days. It&#x27;s good to see you. How was life? &gt;&gt; Doing okay.</p>
<p>Getting older. &gt;&gt; Well, the clock ticks for all of us, doesn&#x27;t it? &gt;&gt; What would you say, Paul, in your career? Because we&#x27;re going to talk a lot about science today. But what has been for you personally the highlight of what you&#x27;ve done? subquantum kinetics the physics theory that been developing came out of sort of an inspiration from beyond and developed over the years and I I think it&#x27;s now considered to be the leading theory to to replace physics in the future &gt;&gt; really &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s dramatic &gt;&gt; I I mean I don&#x27;t know of any other theory that&#x27;s made so many predictions and has so much interest among you know alternative people who are interested in alternative theories Explain to we non-physicists what subquantum connect &gt;&gt; well meaning below the quantum level it it postulates in ether which was is an ancient concept and they used to believe in it 100 years ago till they went to special relativity and claimed that there was no ether but so many experiments have proven that there is you know at least 10 of them I think I cite in my book and there&#x27;s one recent the grues IC experiment. What was that? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like the Michaelelsson Mley experiment where it used an intererometer to look for an ether wind. It was a a key experiment they did 100 years ago to look for the ether if there was an ether and they didn&#x27;t see any result.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s why they didn&#x27;t find. So they figured well there is no ether maybe. But then uh Grznik all he did it was rotate the interpherometer 90 degrees to the vertical and there he found the ether wind and it was coming down into the earth. &gt;&gt; What is the ether wind? &gt;&gt; Well uh according to subquantum kinetics it&#x27;s geons I call them geons going into the earth and that&#x27;s what creates the gravity field of the earth.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right &gt;&gt; because they are being consumed and transformed into other types of particle sub subquantum particles. They&#x27;re like, think of quarks. You&#x27;re below the quantum level. And u so it because there&#x27;s a deficit of geons, they are flowing into the earth and it creates a a gradient field sort of sloping down toward the earth. And that g gradient, that ether gradient is what creates a gravitational force.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;ve simulated this with computer simulations. The equations that subquantum kinetics is proposing. We&#x27;ve simulated in the computer and we&#x27;ve shown particle-like structures are affected by the field gradients and actual move. Just like we were saying, &gt;&gt; Paul, without gravity, &gt;&gt; if it didn&#x27;t exist, what would happen? Chaos. &gt;&gt; Well, you wouldn&#x27;t get the stars forming or planets forming, the things wouldn&#x27;t keep together.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We wouldn&#x27;t even be here. &gt;&gt; It&#x27; just be dust floating in the air without gravity. &gt;&gt; Well, the fact that it exists tells you what. Because the model of the universe seems to have so much order to it. Everything seems to fit like pieces of a puzzle.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; To me, that&#x27;s remarkable. You know, one would say, you know, there&#x27;s a creator behind this. &gt;&gt; How do you explain how all of it works? And it works so well. &gt;&gt; Well, I would uh differ on that that uh what they do is they ignore the difficulties where there&#x27;s contradictions. um and uh they they uh block any efforts to disprove the existing theories there.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very difficult to publish something that is new that shows that old theories are wrong. &gt;&gt; Sure does. &gt;&gt; So the uh physics it I mean there&#x27;s a whole lot of things I would throw out. Uh and and when I say throw it out, I mean I found the errors and I&#x27;m not just giving an opinion. I found the the flaws and it should be thrown out by black hole theory, uh, special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Would Einstein and Hawking go crazy? &gt;&gt; Probably. Yeah. [laughter] And so many other things, the wave particle dualism, uh, whole list of things. Uh, I would keep classical physics like Newton&#x27;s theories of electrostatics and gravitation, Maxwell&#x27;s theories. Um but the more advanced physics, modern physics is wrong.</p>
<p>And in my book, I explain the the the problems. In fact, Einstein and Brown, I believe, were working together uh black project during the war. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh called the Philadelphia experiment &gt;&gt; experiment. But there&#x27;s much more to that, isn&#x27;t there? &gt;&gt; Where they made a ship disappear.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Not only radar invisible, but actually optical invisible. it&#x27;s claimed and uh I I believe that Einstein knew about Brown&#x27;s work because this was he Brown had done his work on electrogidics already in the 20s he knew about this and after that we remember Einstein trying to find a unification between electricity and gravitation which Brown had already shown there was a unification that the electricity is affecting gravity and that&#x27;s what electrogravidics is is electricity affecting gravity. &gt;&gt; Where would you have put Tesla in the middle of this at the time? &gt;&gt; Tesla they say was part of the project also. I discussed the Philadelphia project in my book in secrets of anti-gravity propulsion. Some of the work of Tesla was applicable to this because they were using pulses I believe to create this effect.</p>
<p>Well, you bring up the Philadelphia experiment, Paul, and I had had guests on Coast to Coast over the years, uh, a fellow by the name of Al Beck Duncan Cameron who claimed that they were part of the experiment, and this is what they say, and I just want to get your reaction to it. They say that something went arry with trying to cloak the ship in the Philadelphia shipyard and that it literally made the soldiers and the Navy people on the ship disappear or in some cases half of their body was in our plane, the other half was gone. Do you think that&#x27;s true? Was that real? Yes, I believe because I can understand how that happened in the context of subquantum kinetics. In physics, it&#x27;s a total mystery. Nobody believes it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But in subquantum kinetics, if you can change the gravity potential by pulsing with electric uh pulses &gt;&gt; and raise the potential so it&#x27;s not a so we&#x27;re in a gravity well. If you can create a gravity hill, &gt;&gt; things will disappear optically because what will happen is the particle, a subatomic particle has a wave pattern around it. Okay? &gt;&gt; That stops light from going through. That&#x27;s why light doesn&#x27;t go through solid matter except maybe glass. Those waves would disappear first before the cores would disappear.</p>
<p>So the particles would still be there, but now light could actually go through and it would look like it&#x27;s invisible. And also people could blend with uh put your arm through. &gt;&gt; Uh but then you raise the you put the gravity potential back down to create normal gravity and everything will come back and if you had your arm in a wall you&#x27;re you&#x27;re stuck there. You can&#x27;t get it out. &gt;&gt; Whoa.</p>
<p>So this might have happened. &gt;&gt; I I believe it did. Uh and I believe because of that they kept it so secret. They even changed uh the Navy changed uh Brown&#x27;s date of departure from the Navy so it looked like he left before the Philadelphia experiment. They were trying to &gt;&gt; trying to mask him.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is project Winter Haven? &gt;&gt; That was a project that Brown proposed to the Navy to develop a discraft that would have a Mach 3 capabilities which was faster than anything they had back then. flying saucers &gt;&gt; 52. Yeah. Uh using his electrogravidics electrokinetics technology and uh in the in the report it it it&#x27;s an interesting thing in there that Brown is saying that he had been uh re uh prevented from discussing his work in publications.</p>
<p>So here&#x27;s Einstein publishing freely. &gt;&gt; Oh, like crazy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Brown isn&#x27;t allowed to publish. And in fact after 59 the whole field went dark.</p>
<p>They uh media was not well the aircraft industry was not allowed to speak to the media any longer about the research they were doing. &gt;&gt; Huh. &gt;&gt; And none of us knew about this. I mean it it was known back in the 50s early 50s that there was electrovidics research going on. And it wasn&#x27;t secret.</p>
<p>It was uh in magazines like Product Engineering, uh &gt;&gt; Popular Mechanics, &gt;&gt; things like that, &gt;&gt; stuff like that. &gt;&gt; And then people forgot about it because it wasn&#x27;t discussed anymore, &gt;&gt; right? Out of sight, out of mind, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Do you think those projects are continuing today? &gt;&gt; Definitely. For example, Brown&#x27;s technology, this disc proposal, the Winter Haven proposal, ended up turning into the B2 bomber. And I bet they&#x27;ve perfected it even more. &gt;&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised.</p>
<p>They probably I don&#x27;t know if they call it the B2 any longer. The perfected version might be named something else. They don&#x27;t talk about it. &gt;&gt; God, the technology that we possess, Paul, is beyond what anybody would imagine, isn&#x27;t it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Here we&#x27;re using it.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the B2, but the propulsion system is secret. and and and they even say that the secret thing is the radar invisibility, but the that&#x27;s to get you away from thinking about the propulsion system. It&#x27;s really the propulsion system that&#x27;s so highly classified. &gt;&gt; What do you think the propulsion system is? It was leaked by some black project scientists and published in aviation week and space technology back around 92 that a B2 charges the leading edge of its wing to high voltage and the opposite charge they dump in exhaust and so they&#x27;re creating this huge field gradient across the craft. So that was the main thing they leaked and based on that and knowing Brown&#x27;s patents that he published back in the 50s and he was proposing this that wasn&#x27;t suppressed at all.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It was exactly the idea charging the he showed charging leading edge of the craft and using flamejet generator that was the other thing that the f fellow mentioned that they generate the high voltage difference in the jet engine itself using flamejet generator. Townson Brown developed thating. He was the guy who developed that. &gt;&gt; How far ahead are we from the other countries, China, Russia, with this kind of technology? Or have they caught up with us? &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s China has bases in space just like we do and the Russians do and are are developing uh advanced propulsion. It&#x27;s just they they&#x27;re very good at keeping secrets &gt;&gt; better than we are, &gt;&gt; right? I mean, they have a law now that if they if anybody falsifies the scientific data, they have a death sentence for that person.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; God. And here, what would happen in the United States for that? Nothing. Probably a hand slap. &gt;&gt; Maybe embarrassed by a publication. That&#x27;s about it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Paul, when you talk about bases, where are where might they be? &gt;&gt; Well, I believe outside Earth orbit, there are bases. Um, we have uh &gt;&gt; like space stations or on something like that. bases on planets like uh Mars uh series. We sent a probe out to SERIS uh few years ago and they they were show shooting back pictures and you saw what looked like white areas that looked just like they could have been cities down there. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Reflected. and and I published about this on the internet and I show pictures that we&#x27;ve taken of cities from the air from satellites from the space station and compare with what they&#x27;re seeing there and very very close resemblance. Now, why is it that when they got very close, they didn&#x27;t send any more pictures? &gt;&gt; They stopped. Right. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>You know, we were hoping we get close enough to see something and then they didn&#x27;t send anything more. &gt;&gt; Possibilities of this then you think are very high. &gt;&gt; From what I know, a lot of things which we probably won&#x27;t have time to discuss. Uh I I&#x27;m very certain. &gt;&gt; What about continuing to send astronauts and flying them into space? We think that since we stopped the space shuttle program, we&#x27;ve stopped all of that.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not so sure we have. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, we we continue to to travel. I mean, there&#x27;s regular sightings uh near Area 51. Even out in the Los Angeles area, people have seen UFOs, secret bases.</p>
<p>I heard a story from a friend of mine that he was hangliding and or his friends were hang gliding. had to come down in a mountainous area between the shore and some mountains uh right right north of LA. It wasn&#x27;t way and nowhere. And there was a a landing strip they found because they were losing altitude. They had to land somewhere in the mountains and they found a landing strip.</p>
<p>They get down and suddenly they&#x27;re surrounded with people with guns and &gt;&gt; gez. at the end of the landing strip was a disc hovering inside a tent. And they were told they&#x27;re not supposed to say this to anyone. So it this is obviously one of ours. It&#x27;s not uh it seems to me uh &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s not ET.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean yeah I mean a chance encounter and they see a disc. I mean what&#x27;s the chance of that? You know &gt;&gt; what are the odds? They say it takes us up to six months to travel from Earth to Mars on any given time period. &gt;&gt; I think nine months &gt;&gt; or nine months as well. But through Townsen&#x27;s work, could we have gotten there quicker? &gt;&gt; Yes. In my book, I talk about going to Mars in five days.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Five days. &gt;&gt; We could go quicker. I didn&#x27;t want to make it sound too unbelievable. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Five days is kind of unbelievable. &gt;&gt; Counting Brown&#x27;s thrusters, his electrokinetic thrusters.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Whoa. uh his umbrella-like devices. It has a big a positive electrode and a small negative and he&#x27;s got a insulator in between like berium titanate. These have been shown he&#x27;s found that these produce 70,000 newtons per kilowatt. That&#x27;s um 5,000 times more thrust per energy input than a jet engine.</p>
<p>About 300,000 times more than a space shuttle main engine. So it means they&#x27;re getting let&#x27;s say 300,000 times more thrust for the amount of energy was chemical energy or electrical or whatever &gt;&gt; than we get with our commercial versions. Um, so with this and an array of thrusters, you can picture the ship about like the space shuttle, 100 ton craft &gt;&gt; with a series of these thrusters, like an array of thrusters stacked up, &gt;&gt; maybe five deep and 5x5. You could go up to what was I saying 20% G and get there in five days. You go half the way.</p>
<p>You accelerate to your top speed and then you decelerate. &gt;&gt; I mean, because we&#x27;re going uh they&#x27;re talking about ion thrusters plucking away like a horse and buggy speed, you know. So, &gt;&gt; is this all part of the secret space program what you&#x27;re talking about now? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know if they use exactly this particular technology. I mean, they could they have probably have things better, but I&#x27;m just giving an example from what we know and that I&#x27;ve reverse engineered my book. &gt;&gt; This is possible.</p>
<p>Give me 15 million and I&#x27;ll build you this. Maybe probably cost a little more, but I&#x27;m confident we could make this. &gt;&gt; This is amazing technology to be able to get to Mars in 5 days or less. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What would the craft have to look like? It it would look like the space shuttle with some ga gadget to hold all these prop propelling system devices behind and it could be powered on an array of solar cells.</p>
<p>So you&#x27;d be going away from the sun. You&#x27;d have your solar cell array maybe uh five by five meters. You only need was it uh a few kilowatts of power 3 kilowatts or something. &gt;&gt; Could you use that to launch as well? &gt;&gt; No, you you this is for a craft that&#x27;s already assembled in space. Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; To get up there, you need to get get it up there. Probably you use different craft to get up there than what you go to Mars. So, &gt;&gt; well, we wouldn&#x27;t need a Saturn 5 rocket. &gt;&gt; No, you wouldn&#x27;t use rockets. Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You use these thrusters. &gt;&gt; Uh because you can get over a G of thrust. Sure. Very easily. &gt;&gt; Is it silent or does it make noise? &gt;&gt; It would have a hum to it because you&#x27;re pulsing at DC pulses.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And the way this works, if you I could explain very easily. There&#x27;s two possible explanation. One is this is a bigger electrode on the top and smaller on the bottom. So the charge is very concentrated on the bottom electrode.</p>
<p>They both have the same charge but it&#x27;s more concentrated on the bottom. And this is giving off uh so the positive charge up here and negative down here. And the negative ions go away from the craft and they exert a force on the negative pole &gt;&gt; which pushes you up. &gt;&gt; But because it&#x27;s so concentrated it&#x27;s going to get a lot of force. Whereas up here, the positive charges are exerting.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very spread out. So, it&#x27;s a very weak field, a total field. So, it&#x27;s an unbalanced force and it lifts. And Brown has shown he&#x27;s able to lift the whole weight of the saucer with 10% extra weight. He was able to get these things to go up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Do you think if we&#x27;re being visited, Paul, by extraterrestrials, they&#x27;re using propulsion like this to get here, or have they learned how to bend space and time? First of all, I wouldn&#x27;t say space and time bending. That&#x27;s Einsteinian concept. Yes, there&#x27;s better concepts now, but you have to accept the ether. We&#x27;re talking about ether gradients, not warping of space to create forces. They probably have a lot of various technologies.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a lot of ways to skin the cat in this field. The problem is that all of them are not believed by physicists because physics is a primitive science. &gt;&gt; Sure. It doesn&#x27;t explain this stuff. &gt;&gt; Subquantum kinetics does.</p>
<p>This is the one science that&#x27;s able to explain free energy machines and these advanced propulsion technologies that physics can&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; So I believe that the first place subquantum kinetics will be used is in aerospace because &gt;&gt; I I agree with that. &gt;&gt; You need a theory to be able to know what&#x27;s happening to interpret experiments and design something that works. You know, with physics, you&#x27;re at a loss. you&#x27;re blindfolded.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Will it ever you you had mentioned wormholes and that you had a change in thought about that? I &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t believe in Yeah, subclim kinetics doesn&#x27;t allow wormholes. &gt;&gt; So they don&#x27;t exist in your world. &gt;&gt; They don&#x27;t exist in your world, &gt;&gt; right? Don&#x27;t exist. &gt;&gt; What What is Hawking talking about? &gt;&gt; Blowing hot air. [laughter] Now originally, if you remember, Hawking was saying no light escapes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No light escapes. Then he changed his story. Just a few years ago said, &quot;Well, maybe some light can get out. So, it&#x27;s not a black hole.&quot; Well, I&#x27;ve been saying for years that those stars, they&#x27;re stars. They&#x27;re not black holes, right? &gt;&gt; The reason is they can&#x27;t collapse.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Physicists thinks they collapse because the fuel burns out in the star and nothing to support it. So, it collapses. &gt;&gt; The truth is that there&#x27;s what&#x27;s called genic energy. Every star has is generating energy in its inter interior and it&#x27;s not due to nuclear energy. It&#x27;s free energy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Free energy. And what do you mean by free energy? &gt;&gt; Free energy. Okay. &gt;&gt; To me, free energy means we don&#x27;t have to pay for it. But &gt;&gt; okay, first of all, subquantum kinetics.</p>
<p>In subquantum kinetics, the universe is not a closed system. A closed system is like everything is in a box. And that&#x27;s the way physicists view it. Everything&#x27;s in the box. So energy has to be perfectly conserved.</p>
<p>needs. You can&#x27;t increase or decrease the amount of energy. In an open system, you can actually create a whole universe without any needing to just by itself because it&#x27;s open system. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s getting the energy it needs from beyond so to speak from another dimension. You can think of it &gt;&gt; in this case from the ether.</p>
<p>the ether I believe our sense of time the flow of time comes from the fact the ether is continually transmuting uh it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re in a river etheric river and it&#x27;s the same idea of the ancient idea I have written about this in be in my book uh genesis of the cosmos &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; that uh the ancients had this science thousands of years ago and they encoded it in certain creation myths symbolically And the idea of the theqi, that&#x27;s an ether that transmutes. Um the idea of yin and yang, these are very close to these concepts. Uh so they had I&#x27;m very sure they had this science in the past. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s pretty dramatic the things that had happened and we just seem to have stopped it. But you think they&#x27;re still ongoing, don&#x27;t you? Tesla&#x27;s work, all this other stuff.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. this uh black project scientist who talked about the B2. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; I had a conversation with him. I got his phone number through the magazine.</p>
<p>He said that uh the classified work in black projects uh they rely heavily on Tesla&#x27;s work and Brown&#x27;s &gt;&gt; both of them. &gt;&gt; Brown must have been a genius at his time. &gt;&gt; Yes. Brown would have been the the big physics genius if he had been allowed to publish his work and if they talked about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they were pushing Einstein and not him.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, they wanted to push Einstein because with Einstein&#x27;s theory, it put you you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you think that all of this is impossible because it&#x27;s not possible. He&#x27;s not able to bend gravity with electricity. Only Brown could create gravitational force with electricity. But his theory claimed warping space can&#x27;t do it with electricity. &gt;&gt; If you had a chance to talk to Towns and Brown, had he been here still, what would you have asked him? I suppose more details on his work.</p>
<p>uh you know like there was one photocopy of a paper from when he was working later on in the &#x27; 50s at a company uh that we that got a lot of interesting information about his experiments lifting uh devices off the ground and it you know there&#x27;s must be so much more that they don&#x27;t allow to go out that Brown did but you know I would have asked him more about his work &gt;&gt; could these applications of propulsion Paul be used for airlines lines. I mean, can can we one day be flying from Los Angeles to New York in 30 minutes, &gt;&gt; right? You could uh not only does the would the B2 bomber propulsion system similar to the B2 bomber uh create a a driving force that could go many times the speed of sound, but it reduces the air drag because the in the front you&#x27;re charging the leading edge of the wing, so it repels the air from the craft. So the air sort of slides around it and it sort of slips through the air with very little resistance. &gt;&gt; Well, that would be dramatic. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What a great flight. &gt;&gt; I mean, and you could cut dramatically fuel bills. I mean, let&#x27;s say you ran it on on gasoline. You could probably do it on 10% of what you use now. &gt;&gt; What you&#x27;re using now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s a big cost in air travel. &gt;&gt; How about cars? &gt;&gt; Uh yeah, you could add this. I know one guy he&#x27;s thinking of entering a race. Put it on a car. &gt;&gt; That would be exciting.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You could go really break the records &gt;&gt; instantly. [laughter] The salt flats would look like nothing. Paul, tell us about Eugene Pod Kletnoff. He investigated gravity. Uh yeah, he had a sort of like a laser, but it would he&#x27;d send a pulse down through a superconducting uh piece of cylinder and it would create a wave, electric charge wave that would go down and hit an electrode, an anode.</p>
<p>And then he found that even though the electron stopped, a gravity wave continued. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And it was columnated just like a laser uh because he had magnetic confinement so it sort of confined it and this would uh could he actually would knock over books at 2 miles away with this. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that was his low power unit.</p>
<p>Then he developed a higher power unit which is now in a secure facility in Moscow. &gt;&gt; And with that they put a 4-in hole through a concrete block and was able to dentable a 1- in thick steel plate. dented. &gt;&gt; Dented. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Gosh.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And in my book, I talk about that with this technology, you could go super luminal speeds to let&#x27;s say alpha century if you had thrusters, pock thrusters pushing you and you you could go to 200C, but you wouldn&#x27;t feel any inertial effects. &gt;&gt; You wouldn&#x27;t have any G effects on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because it&#x27;s gravity waves are your effects. &gt;&gt; Could we get up to the speed of light with this? You could go uh I I was suggesting for the first few months you go up to 80% of the speed of light with Brown&#x27;s thrusters which uh are very efficient.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Then you turn on your pock enough thrusters to go light speed so to speak that use some terms from science fiction. You would end up going up to 200 C 200 times speed of light when you&#x27;re halfway there. Then you turn your craft around and you start decelerating back to nor normal speed. So the whole thing could be done in a couple months. Uh I discussed this in my other book decoding the message of the pulsars that we are being sent messages right now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But we&#x27;re not decoding them, are we? &gt;&gt; SEIT hasn&#x27;t done anything because they&#x27;ve been looking for frequencies regular radio stations and these aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re pulses coming from &gt;&gt; Have you talked to STI? I know Seth Shastac would do they listen to you? &gt;&gt; I spoke with Shottac. Uh, I had written my book. I was willing to send him a free copy and he didn&#x27;t want to see it. &gt;&gt; Gosh.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And he he knows better than that. &gt;&gt; He required me to publish first before he would even look. That&#x27;s I consider that extremely arrogant. I I did publish finally. I figured well two years ago I did publish on this on a technical journal.</p>
<p>So, okay, it&#x27;s now published. I haven&#x27;t been contacted by SETI. It&#x27;s very possible that if they started listening to you, we could be communicating with an ET race. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s very important because they&#x27;re informing us about a a wave of particles that are coming towards us this very minute. And they can and we&#x27;re overdue for the arrival.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s called the super wave. &gt;&gt; Now, what happens when that hits? &gt;&gt; Uh biblical apocalypse, basically. Yes. &gt;&gt; Paul, are you telling me that we&#x27;re on the verge of an apocalypse? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not certain. because these uh waves can have different intensities like I believe there was one 700 years ago that may have lasted a day and they see it in the icecore record uh and things for example it have affected the weather crops but if it&#x27;s a very intense one they can last thousand years &gt;&gt; oh my god &gt;&gt; uh continual being bombarded by the earth and particles coming into our magnetic field reducing the magnetic field of the earth because when you get particles in the radiation belts they exert a magnetic field opposed to the earth.</p>
<p>So the field is going to decrease and it could reverse just like what happened during the Neanderthal extinction. &gt;&gt; Is anybody listening to you when you talk about these incredible things? And I don&#x27;t mean on our program like this or coast to coast, but I mean are scientists listening to you? Anybody in the &gt;&gt; you know you get very little feedback. Um but I am continually contacted by by investigators and but I don&#x27;t know about you&#x27;re talking about the traditional ones in the universities. &gt;&gt; Yeah. who would say, &quot;This guy&#x27;s on to something.&quot; &gt;&gt; Some of them.</p>
<p>Yeah. In fact, in the military, there&#x27;s people that are very excited about subquantum kinetics and uh my book, Secrets of Antiggravity Propulsion. I hope this will lead to something. And uh universities, I&#x27;ve been in contact with a few here and there. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re afraid, I think, to uh investigate anything that deals with ether.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, they don&#x27;t want to rock the Apple Card either. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They&#x27;re afraid it might lose their status. &gt;&gt; Their status university or their whatever. Well, what you do talk about is pretty dramatic.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I I&#x27;ve sort of cut my ties with the standard theories and I&#x27;ve continued and I&#x27;m in a different reality. I &gt;&gt; I view the world differently and it&#x27;s very beautiful. I mean, I I would like other people to learn subquantum kinetics. At least read be beyond the big bang was the first title of the book and then changed to Genesis of Cosmos in the second printing.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s so beautiful and it&#x27;s going to change the world. We&#x27;re going to have free energy &gt;&gt; overnight. &gt;&gt; Yes. This should be taught in every school and the concepts are not hard. They&#x27;re much simpler than physics.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What would the first thing be if you had an opportunity to have that audience who could create change? What would you tell them &gt;&gt; if if it&#x27;s possible they wave a wand uh have subquantum kinetics taught in every university and general system theory because it it&#x27;s an application of general systems theory to physics. I was the first to do that. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s the next evolution too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Systems theory had been applied to business for example completely changed business organization theory for the better.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s been applied to sociology, psychiatry, you name it. uh and nobody had tried micro physics and I just happened to be the the one to do that and the result is subquantum kinetics when you do that &gt;&gt; would these engines for airplanes for example would they would they last would we have to worry about a mechanical failure or anything like that &gt;&gt; I think they would be safer than uh regular because um you&#x27;re not dealing with jet birds flying into your engines &gt;&gt; right [laughter] that happened to me yesterday by the way really &gt;&gt; from Los Angeles. The flight was delayed because the incoming plane got hit by a bird. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And there was a crash recently.</p>
<p>They got hit by two birds in each engine and they they had to land. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s scary. &gt;&gt; Well, that would be dramatic. That kind of technology right now of developing these. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We could do it. Make physically make the engines. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is old technology. This was developed in the 50s ago. &gt;&gt; Why aren&#x27;t we using it? &gt;&gt; Because they they they&#x27;re afraid to holding us back.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It It&#x27;s the military view. Technology should be licensed just like they license drivers license so on. &gt;&gt; And we can meet uh we can defend our borders to such aerospace. You know, we&#x27;ve got radar if there&#x27;s any airplane coming in, you know. Um it could be controlled if they they&#x27;re a little afraid of being misused.</p>
<p>Uh but heck, and we should use it. &gt;&gt; I think so, too. This is dramatic. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s also exciting.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And real. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I know other fell, he&#x27;s reverse engineered uh Shawberger&#x27;s turban. Incredible.</p>
<p>And the patent office sitting on this patent. They won&#x27;t issue the patent. The patent office, according to law, it&#x27;s supposed to issue a patent if it&#x27;s a new idea if nobody else has done it and it works. &gt;&gt; And they&#x27;re coming up with a new law which Congress did not pass. Says it must obey the laws of physics otherwise we don&#x27;t give you the patent.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not in the law. Who &gt;&gt; made them God? &gt;&gt; The laws of physics are wrong. &gt;&gt; What they&#x27;re doing is they&#x27;re taking a corrupt &gt;&gt; theory paradigm and they&#x27;re restricting the entire civilization with it. They&#x27;re it&#x27;s like something around our neck. It&#x27;s like we&#x27;re going to drown with physics in the end.</p>
<p>I mean, we got big problems in this world. We&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve got to go to newer technology. If Trump wanted to do something to improve the US ambition, he wouldn&#x27;t put up trade barriers, he would get us on free energy. I mean, we could be smelting iron for onetenth the cost. They do it in China.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Using free energy. Of course, China would start doing it too later. They catch on. &gt;&gt; Everybody would be doing it.</p>
<p>Yeah. But so what? Right. &gt;&gt; I mean, I know people that uh like in metal recycling that are actually looking into this. They would like to do this. &gt;&gt; We could colonize Mars with this kind of technology.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And Mars has water. &gt;&gt; How long would it take to get to the moon from here instead of three days? &gt;&gt; Oh, we&#x27;re talking about a few hours. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Few hours. Gosh, I love the application for travel if it&#x27;s it would make the Concord look like a uh old bicycle or something. &gt;&gt; Paul, if you could wave that wand again one more time, what would you what would you change right now? I would really come down hard on the patent office.</p>
<p>Get them to issue these patents. I would make it top priority because it should be. I mean, the patent is for energy purpose. It&#x27;s supposed to be given an accelerated track through the patent office. Instead, they stop it entirely.</p>
<p>So, they should be fair and allow free energy machines to be patented if they work. If they&#x27;re not sure, well, have a demonstration. See it. &gt;&gt; Are there companies doing these things now that we just don&#x27;t know about? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>This fellow has backing that I know about. And uh there&#x27;s other companies. There&#x27;s a guy developed a car that runs on water. Patnoff sat on his is sitting currently on his application. &gt;&gt; I had heard about that runs on water and they&#x27;ve suppressed it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Not Stanley Myers, but Stanley Myers did that and they killed him as you know. &gt;&gt; Right. I&#x27;m concerned about this apocalyptic event that may or may not occur, but if it does, &gt;&gt; when would it be? Well, you know, based on the Fatima prophecy and stuff like this, uh, if you take those as hints, uh, you can sort of predict from what was been said said, maybe in the next few years there might be a miracle or something we should expect. I think the ETSs play into this because they are here to shepherd us through this event.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You&#x27;re a believer in that? A physicist who&#x27;s a believer in that? &gt;&gt; Yes. They know we we can&#x27;t handle a super wave and they&#x27;re going to be here for recovery operations if it gets too bad. Could they could they shield us? &gt;&gt; I think they think of it more as something that we have to go through because &gt;&gt; everybody else has &gt;&gt; what it does. It reduces tremendously the population and it sort of resets civilization. So it will allow all these new things to come out at that point.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But what a horrible moment for that, &gt;&gt; right? It doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be really bad. It could be one of these small super waves hopefully. But if it&#x27;s something like uh the one that happened 401,000 years ago, it it killed off a whole race of human beings. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The Neanderthalss.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s in our myths. They talk about the hopy or the uh the &gt;&gt; It is in the myths. &gt;&gt; They talk about the race of the of the wooden men and the stone men or something. There various races that got killed off by catastrophes and a new civilization emerged and then that was killed off. So they may have been referring for example to the Neanderthalss.</p>
<p>Do you know the Neanderthal extinction is marked in the Egyptian calendar. They sound found the Egyptian king list of kings Turin of Turin. &gt;&gt; It goes back 41 thou to 41,000 &gt;&gt; know this stuff &gt;&gt; before the present. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s when this occurred. It was the biggest super wave event in the ice age period since the last 100,000 years.</p>
<p>Well, last 60,000 at least. And they consider it so important. Well, heck, a whole race of human beings, I would consider them human in a way. They&#x27;re a little different from us, but disappeared. That&#x27;s important to mark down.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Paul, thanks for being on Beyond Belief. What amazing technology. The ability to have a propulsion system that could get us to Mars in 5 days, that could get us from Los Angeles to New York in a few moments. I like it. And maybe one day it&#x27;ll happen.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m George Nory and thanks for watching Beyond Belief.</p>
