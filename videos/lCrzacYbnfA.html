            <p>don&#x27;t want to get all bent out of shape I&#x27;ll make this to the ten stereotype scientific kind of talk that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m going to tell you about at all what we&#x27;re going to tell you about is how science has feet of clay it always has that the scientists themselves will tell you this and I want to mention some of the feet of clay that are preventing us from already having the science of the next within and if we can get rid of a little bit of the play we will have a very startling science over the next thousand years and we&#x27;ll have it very quickly so I want to indicate to you are trying to indicate what the nature of this science is already here they just will not let it yet to be born that could be born tomorrow morning and if we can change the scientific community let me characterize a scientific community for you first of all it&#x27;s difficult to learn to be a working scientist really is you got to work hard you got to learn an awful lot of things and usually in a fairly narrow specialty this is very important because the kind of scientists we produce our whole bunch of very narrow specialists there are no more broad scientists who know everything it long ago became impossible for a one that day is contrary so what we have is we have all kinds of walls and artificial borders between the different aspects even of the various visit in one discipline and people work very vigorously and they keep extending their parts and they all saying is the way you get ahead isn&#x27;t science is you become interested in a very narrow area you work real hard for five years you become a real expert in this narrative area and that point is only about 14 people in the United States really understand the rest of them getting various degrees of it but there&#x27;s only about fourteen real specialists where you are now if you will do that you&#x27;ll get all your papers published you&#x27;ll achieve stature you can get funding for your graduate students and you will have a very successful career and ladies and gentlemen you won&#x27;t do anything to give us the science of the next millennium you&#x27;ll move that decimal point one more position already and your lifetime but you won&#x27;t give us a head of science Einstein told us what we had to do to get a new science nobody pays any attention to it everything we talk about in science scientists they laws of nature don&#x27;t you ever get and hearing they&#x27;re stuck to that term there is no law of nature there are very general rules behavior given certain assumptions about the way things are in this area and as long as those assumptions hold then this particular quote law or this rule will hold the moment you violate one of these assumptions the law goes out the window you can violate any kind of law you wish to in physics that&#x27;s called broken symmetry and we wouldn&#x27;t have anything happen in the world that Oliver didn&#x27;t break symmetry because that makes something happen to become if it doesn&#x27;t break the beautiful symmetry you can&#x27;t even see it there&#x27;s no thermal so when you look through all the jargon and you take it and you wring it out and you get rid of all of this edifice that&#x27;s been built up around it we have some very hardworking people who are caught up in a whole bunch of very narrow specialists specialties and who are have built up from Menace tall edifices and the very foundations they started from way back down there or very seriously flawed how seriously fun there is no physicists in the world who knows what time is who knows what charges or who knows what mass is now if you haven&#x27;t done any reading in the foundations of physics that may go right by you and you&#x27;re say surely they know what all these things are if they do not and I&#x27;m going over this finally if you think you&#x27;re gonna find out what energy is a good definition for it forget it you&#x27;re not it isn&#x27;t in that phone and so what we have if we want to have a new science we have to go down to where these assumptions were made in some cases 1864 which is when Maxwell stuff was put together what would we expect to find if we did this let&#x27;s use Maxwell&#x27;s theory as an example because the lights work television set work the greatest thing since sliced bread right it&#x27;s a piece of junk it&#x27;s the best it can be done at the time and then they frozen then they made it a dummy then they defend it to the death then they destroy any scientist who wants to change it it turns into a dogmatic type of thing not science what was the time when max will put together theory the atom had not been discovered the electron had not been discovered electricity was thought to be a thin material electric fluid without any divisions in it whatsoever no structure flowing through the wire much like water for the piping Faraday for example thought that he&#x27;s the man who put together what we call the electrical force and magnetic force based on experiments that have been done by other people but fairly started together it varied it was a great experiment this whole book I think got one out to break equation is there something like that it&#x27;s not a mathematician at all a wonderful experiment ferdi had resurrected over all an old idea from the 12 hundreds about lines of force now farad II didn&#x27;t think the lines of force in those terms he thought of them as physical strings pipe string without anything putting attention off and so what today we would say is the e/m field in space was really a whole series for real tight strings under tension and when you had a disturbance what today we would call an electromagnetic wave you Twain the string just like you playing guitar strands now max was said and I hope pretty closely I will read no other electrodynamics until I capture what ferdi has mathematical get the drill he accepted these transverse waves and foot Springs and all that stuff with no agent producing the tension and wires and he captured that in a mathematical theory in a matter of fact he wrote a bottle of this material either years of policemen will you listen you can&#x27;t believe the stuff everybody thought that mass was everywhere there was a thin material fluid filling the entire universe there was no place in the universe for mass with entity that we see in the classroom so in electrodynamics to this day that material ether which was destroyed 152 10 years ago by the michelson-morley experiment was proved there is no matter out there like that that is still closed no the textbook they say that at every point in the vacuum in space there is a unit point Coulomb of charge mess there&#x27;s a unit point North Pole of magnetically charged mass and there&#x27;s a unit kilogram of mass sitting at will important every point of space has got this humungous all he sets the mass in it according to your standard electromagnetic textbooks talk in every university there is nothing in all of electrodynamics anywhere which has anything to say about what form the stuff exists in in space devoid of mass surely Tom you you&#x27;re joking what it is a joke it&#x27;s a big joke Tesla called it the most inexplicable aberration of a scientific mind that&#x27;s ever been recorded in all of history in tests it was right by the way it&#x27;s very fashionable for PhDs in our universities particularly in ATM departments and electrical engineering departments to talk about our prude Old Testament laws let me tell you something one of the greatest electrodynamic cysts in this country and in the world today is terrybear if you will read Terry Barrett&#x27;s analysis of Tesla&#x27;s actual patented circuits in quaternions not in tensors and vectors which are much lower topology algebra but in the way old Tesla thought you will discover to your astonishment he did things in those circuits that&#x27;s in the US Patent Office that none of our PhDs and none of our universities that they can do but if you analyze it in quaternions there it is Tesla had the last life I hope you&#x27;re beginning to get the picture when I say science has speed but shifting sand is more likely i&#x27;m stein pointed this out and said we we have all these concepts we absorbed with our mother&#x27;s milk so to speak nobody goes back and checksum and we ought to recursively check these in Travis in the things that are not accurate or they shield us from a lot of things we could get and he was right but nobody does them by the way this kind of work is called foundations work the most thankless job in the entire scientific community you can&#x27;t even speak in the scientific community is to try to do Foundation&#x27;s work what you do is you do applications move the decimal point one more space and call it Foundation&#x27;s but you never try to say what is time what is the charge or give a definition for charge or far as that is even for mass mass is attempt to find the term to force you come around say what fourth let us define the terms of mass is a little circular definition run around like an augmentation this table never gets anywhere much of physics is that what it is so bad that today it&#x27;s very fashionable for physicists to say it is not the business of science to ask what anything is it is the business of science to ask for things to if you&#x27;ll excuse my blood freeze but French damn the last thing time I knew something the phrase what things do contain both things and doing if you don&#x27;t know what the cotton-pickin things are you don&#x27;t know much about what&#x27;s doing anything anyway I can criticize the scientists because I&#x27;m not a working scientist there&#x27;s no way you can keep a job if you do the kind of criticism I&#x27;m talking about and actually do it in straight language where you can understand what I&#x27;m saying now if I would say well it&#x27;s a problem in defining the electric field in the back and the way we define it I can feel it is we say the field is still present but force has gone to zero if you&#x27;ll check elementary algebra you will find out you eliminated the field and enforcement to zero so we used the term field for two exactly contradictory things mass is part force mechanics made an error 400 years ago there&#x27;s no such thing as a force acting on a sectors body my god we&#x27;ve known that now for decades but every textbook still uses that way because the vector algebra and the tensor algebra that was set up way the hell back there to model this stuff set it up that way and nobody&#x27;s ever gone back and questioned it or changed so I have one chart for 32 major arrows and electrodynamics alone I didn&#x27;t get all of them I just got tired writing and their major flaws we corrected some of them I picked some corrections and some other folks have done on some of the others the amazing thing going this is what I want to share with you when you correct these errors some very astounding things emerge by the way there are experiments out there now which show the various elements of what I&#x27;m talking about just now beginning to be integrated just now ready to be brought into the scientific enemy the thing we&#x27;ve done in the last two years and I&#x27;m quite confident and saying this because saw cold fusion flat cold fusion burns time for energy for fuel time turns out to be energy compressed by the factor C squared at least C spread it can be more but always at least C spray if you convert just a little of that in the ordinary energy transduce it you can get all the energy you want anywhere in the universe you wish for example let me give you an example yes I also have invention disclosures sitting in the US Patent Office with how to enhance an accent and do this stuff and the actual mechanisms involved in if you were to take one microsecond per second of your time in your area in this little device where you&#x27;re working with and converted that into energy ordinary energy convert time energy into ordinary electrical energy you would have 9 times 10 to the 16th joules per second excuse me microsecond 9 to 10 to the 10th I&#x27;ve got to take six off you would have 9 times 10 to the 10 joules per second if you call all of that turned it into watch where you actually would power loads and stuff you would have Madi 1000 mega Joule power plants mega watt power plants and you&#x27;ve aged just a little bit slower while you&#x27;re running the gadget wouldn&#x27;t be nice so time is the greatest energy source we have at least the energy density of mass there&#x27;s not that big a problem it turns out in transducing it there&#x27;s a big problem in finding out what the transduction mechanism is took me two years to do that we have it we have an independent office as a proxy we have we&#x27;re learning to file a formal patent application on about 25,000 dollars it takes to pay the patent attorneys antennas are very expensive but anyway the kind of science we&#x27;re moving in let me give some background now that supports all of this I just threw something out here to catch your attention now I&#x27;m going to give you some support for an awfully long time in quantum field theory what Lex believe in theory of the day is one way of saying that quantum field theory there are four polarisations of photons what the hell do I mean by polarization okay like the king said it going to move along pretty rapid blackboard it&#x27;s coming will be along at the speed of light okay everybody&#x27;s got that but it&#x27;s just a moving off the jump and there&#x27;s some energy in this free space here moving along at this speed life now this energy can vibrate sideways this way can vibrate sideways this away if you freeze both of those ways that&#x27;s a transverse way those two polarizations are polarization me which way that&#x27;s all it means which direction if it value freeze both of these they can&#x27;t shake sideways that can still do like an accordion as discordant and so I have a way by now act like the wave a little smaller and it&#x27;s doing this is this treble that is a longitudinal electromagnetic weight fact it&#x27;s a simple it&#x27;s a lot better longitudinal wave than death but if you would check the Los Alamos National Laboratory website you will find yourself up here under 2 million waves now suddenly they have discovered not they&#x27;ve been away for 20 years I&#x27;ve been an idiot talking about longitude away not everybody works with them and shows you that such a wave can travel if it were pure had no imperfections who have infinite energy and traveled at infinite velocity and that&#x27;s Los Alamos that&#x27;s not time period since we can&#x27;t make a pure one we always make an imperfect one you can move very very fast or it can move very very slow it can move faster than the speed of light or slower than the speed life and ladies and gentlemen it&#x27;s just here today this is not something that we&#x27;re going to do in the year 3000 this is here today and you can go over and do a translation in the sound you can prove these with some experiments it works so the solutions are there now for Maxwell&#x27;s equations for waves to travel faster and speed lighting anywhere from C up to almost infinite and for waves which travel slower than speed light they call those electromagnetic particles this is lost almost this is a standard literature foundation to finish physical review our leading journalist is not Tom beard so we&#x27;re in an age already or to speed of light limitation has already finished that is an enormous change in all the science you know for years the theory of general relativity it&#x27;s a funny thing you kind of assume remember Einstein has a postulate in relativity that means I assume it we&#x27;re gonna shoot him like gentlemen you&#x27;re not going to argue that gravity moves it like speed it doesn&#x27;t and we have now proven it doesn&#x27;t the leaf speed that gravity can be moving at is two times ten to the tenth times the speed of light and that&#x27;s public and published in Physical Review 8 and astronomy has proven it with several different kinds of experience to quote my friend Tom Van Flandern very finest farmer and nice also not Tom says it very nicely he&#x27;s a perfect gentleman he&#x27;s a good sense of humor but he can say things that are very critical but he can say I&#x27;m so smoothly you don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;ve been criticized I can&#x27;t do that so I&#x27;m gonna have to say them very plainly if I do the statement of what he says very smoothly you need damn food with a computer and an orbital calculation program can&#x27;t prove gravity boots far far greater than the speed of light because otherwise all the orbits of the planets and everything would collapse all you&#x27;ve got to do the club demography and then put in the speed of light and everything blows up now we&#x27;ve been teaching at and our universities or those machines in an appropriate blow up for decades we have taken these students in and put their heads and a cheese pressed and told them stuff which is flat not true anybody for the computer and an orbital program then Tom went on to show you what all the measurements are from astronomy to fix the speed of light and what they&#x27;ve done is fix the Lord and that is the Lord 2 times 10 to the tenth times the speed of light ladies and gentlemen that is a enormous change to all the physics to everything we&#x27;ve ever heard of down the road in the next few years the Orthodox scientific establishment chewing on lunches tubing waves and chewing on nearly infinite speed gravity are going to change all science anyway they&#x27;re going to do it very rapidly a decade from now you won&#x27;t recognize the scientists because they&#x27;re chewing it up it&#x27;s spitting out the papers now and lost our most sign foundations of physics Physical Review a it&#x27;s a very exciting time it haven&#x27;t even made it to the public much yet but the physicists are excited they&#x27;ve got a new world all of a sudden new worlds to conquer ok I got you through the side shaking that was two oscillations X&amp;Y two polarizations I got to do the longitudinal which would think of that as the accordion wave ok and that alone was startling enough that changes all the physics by the way every physics University now is tearing into longitudinally in ways but there&#x27;s one more suppose clever devil that you are you went out there you hung up the accordion where the accordion can&#x27;t do this energy frozen but you still gotta wait what&#x27;s left to wait time that extra dimension high compressed spring the T squared compression energy spring now and oscillating very dense very powerful oscillations very powerful current user you&#x27;re now engineer you to the relativity as strong as anything that occurs in of neutron stars and in those black holes and all that you can do it on a lab bench I have a paper an invention disclosure sitting in a patent office of how to do that it turns out to be damn simple I&#x27;m going to tell you how to do it for we leave us this room you have to realize another major the world is made of what we call angular momentum energy times time you can make two or three other variation but let&#x27;s hang without them that&#x27;s pretty good could we understand energy but we&#x27;re also interested in time energy I need to make you aware that of what a fundamental unit is it turns out into most people&#x27;s absolute astonishment there no such thing as an absolutely series of units there are for grabs you can build physics out of any kind of fundamental units you wish to include one you don&#x27;t have to have those things we use in the textbook the physicists themselves will tell you this they change those units when they need to and another problem another series of different kinds of problems they changed the fundamental units and some clown one day just for a lark did it in time where time was the only variable well the functions are a nightmare but it&#x27;s perfectly good physics you can&#x27;t visualize it in your head because it&#x27;s so complicated two functions you know so many powers and all of it but it works and it gives you the right answer no problem I want to get a grant an idea though and I want you to now say I&#x27;m gonna build everything out of energy a lot of folks in this room anyway not build it out of energy right well that means time becomes nothing but a pure function of energy think about that that is rivers that&#x27;s not Tom Bearden that&#x27;s physics so when I say time is energy compressed for the C squared all I did was look at what the functions were it&#x27;s known that it can be expressed as energy they said they didn&#x27;t work out to function with us some of your guy did it that I&#x27;ve never read so when I say you can burn time for fuel I only talked about a special kind of locked up energy there&#x27;s no difference in that mass about same energy density so if you can burn some mass stuff cold and all fulfilled even certainly burn time for fuel well it&#x27;s not burning in the normal sense you don&#x27;t have anything physical in your hands but you can transduce it change it into another form which gives you work when you do that so these are the things in the elements of science right now today that are just fixing to explode the entire scientific paradigm again explosion already started it just hasn&#x27;t laid the old literature yet now there are some folks in the world that weaponize the hell out of parts of these I&#x27;m not here tonight to talk about whips so I&#x27;m not going to will then other people chase that right now we&#x27;re going to chase energy systems we&#x27;re gonna chase a little bit of cold fusion what tell you how that works then I&#x27;m gonna tell you how the mind works because the real thing is coming down the pipe and almost upon us is the direct engineering of mine I&#x27;m gonna start with that first but this group is more interested in that product than they are the other so let&#x27;s start with the mind stuff first quantum field theory I take this other polarization where it&#x27;s trying that&#x27;s being isolated now I want you to say right where you use right where you said I want you to suddenly realize that is your physical body moves in 3-space your mind moves in time the time to laugh they just say all I want you to know right now is policy you use up some time in changing and speaking changing space without changing in time the basic element is space-time not space perception and observation are partial respect to T of time differentiation so you rip the time off throw it away we can show you where the full time interaction does that when I was in grad school I discovered the mechanism that generates flow of time nobody was interested absolutely nobody the time is not an external River on which mass floats along like a boat on a river just welcome down the stream it&#x27;s made on each individual piece of mass by the sum total of all the filtering interactions both virtual and observer the photon carries not only energy but times piece of angular momentum and they completely ignore the time component still absorb a photon is to charge the mass with energy and excited that way and also the target with time now if I use the one where I don&#x27;t let the energy bury I charged the mess with time only and that is marvelous that&#x27;s already paranormal phenomena if we really want to in generate all UFO phenomena the part that&#x27;s not man-made can you say that again if you charge it with this special way where time is what&#x27;s oscillating the energy in 3-space is not moving you don&#x27;t have an accordion you have a slug but time is oscillating the rate of flow of time in the local area is changing it can you explain it it&#x27;s time must like needs you going back and forth in time no it means the rate of flow of time at which each part is processing speeds up slows down its time that&#x27;s doing the according to it now so you nonce the special energy we just shift it over to what it is that&#x27;s doing the coordinate how do you find speed at over time how do you work well it&#x27;s a third time per user every time the external observer is always external look the phenomena you&#x27;re describing remember everything in physics there&#x27;s nothing in physics describes reality it describes what the external observer see of course there&#x27;s no such thing as physics of reality there&#x27;s physics of what an observer would see by the way we don&#x27;t let him be but one observer at a time because if we put two or three in there we get many universes yeah we get we get things where the wavefunction don&#x27;t collapse the physics goes insane perfect fit but nobody likes it misprinted him I think physical review average papers one of the leading journals so when you&#x27;re talking about impressing expanding time and and maybe some of these folks are thinking about like after recent arrest or whatever can&#x27;t really think of going back or at forty times but you have to think of I didn&#x27;t say you couldn&#x27;t think of going back for the forwards in time we&#x27;re gonna get to that but aren&#x27;t you also talking about aren&#x27;t you maybe presupposing to that there central plane at the same time and we&#x27;re just no where&#x27;s the Astana you&#x27;re talking about remember I said very carefully time their rate of flow through time occurs right on the object itself by the photon interactions on it it&#x27;s an engineering process like an engineer you&#x27;re blue now when people talk about time reversing something unfortunately everybody immediately thinks it&#x27;s like time travel in science fiction is not let me explain what time travel would be suppose I wanted to travel back in time to where we first came in the door some minutes ago I would if I wanted to travel in time but I didn&#x27;t want you to I&#x27;d have to keep the whole rest of the world everything in the world and back it up to what it all was a few minutes ago but I would stay in the presence and I wouldn&#x27;t get time to reverse but I would time reverse you and you and you and you had a whole continent in universe nobody says we can do that we&#x27;re not even interested in that what I want to do is take this book and make it be something that was a while ago I can do that yes I don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s the context I&#x27;m not saying this wrong I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s a conjecture there&#x27;s no proof of that when I say proof I don&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s something - absolutely I mean there&#x27;s experimental support for it you&#x27;ve got to be clear what I&#x27;m talking about I&#x27;m not preaching absolutism I&#x27;m really talking about margin so that&#x27;s all physics is it&#x27;s a mark there&#x27;s nothing absolutely physics you can do anything in physics you&#x27;re clever enough to discover how to do it&#x27;s a model if you can change the model and get a new way that are working out there in a physical world you&#x27;re free to do it but you got to have some experiments behind it it doesn&#x27;t become an acceptable model until something supports him okay so what we got is I want to engineer the mind well the mind already oscillates in time every function that the mind occurs all the memory all the pops the emotions and everything uses time oscillations is full time time time time hold on slow times are a time polarized late I did an airbag document search I didn&#x27;t do an exhaustive look purty Google I came up with 16 references to photons that are time polarized they&#x27;re called scalar photons I didn&#x27;t come up with a single reference in the entire Western literature that they scanned for me on time polarized in ways because nobody has ever known how to make money now I&#x27;m going to tell you how to make all this stuff no one will tell you how to transduce it from one end to the other if I take an ordinary transverse wave and I realized it cares time as well as images made of angular momentum it&#x27;s not made just of energy like they teaching all the textbooks there&#x27;s a piece of time to every piece of energy in that way so this made of photons and photons of energy times time they&#x27;ll be delta T last time although if you look at that and you look at impulse amount of time in the imaginary go man and what you will find is if you add the phase conjugate replica - that way - that transverse wave you make you freeze X&amp;Y because the impulses become opposite and if they can&#x27;t get an impulse to move anything in one direction with laterally so you frozen the lateral vibrations and it will then turn into a longitudinal wave however that wave is not made of photons you have to go down to the photon in a wave any any photon that made up the phase conjugate wave replica and you have those paired also together and move those pairs are spin - and they&#x27;re called graviton you have just unified electrodynamics and general relativity with an engineer whole fashion and you&#x27;ve structured the gravity because you&#x27;ve structured grad of x ok but I made from transverse wave I have a process which can become in the laboratory which will generate longitudinal waves and ladies and gentlemen I&#x27;m telling you something we&#x27;ve done in the laboratory I&#x27;m going to talk about it but I&#x27;ve been on a separate venture with the French part France I couldn&#x27;t get anybody to do the damn experiments here and we have made longitudinal layers they work fine yeah so now we got one to do in a ways but they&#x27;re different from what Los Alamos has carried on their sites because they&#x27;re using a longitudinal spin one photon and I&#x27;m using spin to gravitons the structures inside I have a much more advanced way than what they&#x27;re using and I&#x27;m telling you this way works in the lab code we&#x27;ve done yeah I suppose I want to get to this time wave how do I do that well I got a process called phase conjugation replica edition company if I do this again I&#x27;ll stop the imports on the accordion now the three space energy came vibrate so it has to vibrate in time and that&#x27;s all you do to make it time polarize the emwave but it&#x27;s now made of those longitudinal graviton sand and the graviton so it&#x27;s a spin for super graviton structure and each graviton the structure I got super general relativity well I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to go back the other way but in cold fusion I could identify that it&#x27;s happening and the answer turned out to be very simple interferometer for goodness sake if you take the time polarized waves out here two of them makes longitudinal waves take two of them and if you&#x27;ll make friends birthplace simple as that now we can do this if you don&#x27;t get anything else in your scientist or an engineer get this if I want to go from transverse wave it&#x27;s a longitudinal waves with a special kind that are also involve gravity to the super gravitational kind of the time polarized waves I do that with phase conjugation that&#x27;s all I have to do if I want to go the other way I do it within the furniture now when I made the time for us waves I have now entered not only the material domain but the domain of the mind if I now structure and I measure in that domain what the mind is doing you can measure thoughts emotions images pictures and everything the people ahead of that of the whole world in that there&#x27;s a KGB weapon scientists in Russia they do have everything I&#x27;m talking about unfortunately I wish to God I could say they didn&#x27;t but they do now you can engineer mind at any level my mind functions are totally electromagnetic functions but there are special kinds the kinds I&#x27;m talking about they are not in your textbook they&#x27;re not the transverse but stuff we study they&#x27;re the kind of talking about tonight they&#x27;re already engineering the human mind to some extent certainly the Russians office KGB full time let me give you an example I will make one exception to the weapons in 1997 there was the reason for this test I&#x27;m not going into that a young pilot verifying individual name tent and button took off in his Etienne in Arizona headed for the test range suddenly button turned off at an angle and for over an hour fool around ignored people on the phone did a certainly one one property dropping this ordinance they&#x27;re probably still thinking to go with range at that point blew on all everything&#x27;s happy and go-lucky as far as he&#x27;s concerned everything&#x27;s normal ran out of gas crashed and exploded he was instantly thrust in a hypnagogic state and we give you a background for the weapons for the development seating patents in the u.s. from the Russians to show you how to do some of that in the seventies go to the Simpson in the 60s will show you that they were doing it then so he was instantly in a hypnagogic state that&#x27;s a waking dream state so here I am on Captain button and suddenly I&#x27;m like I&#x27;m in a waking dream know almost everybody in this room knows what a waking dream state is so I&#x27;m not going in try to take the next 10 minutes to explain it to but you know what it is and you can do like your dream walking dream talking or whatever and your perception is controlled what do you think about your perception your thoughts of control and you&#x27;re going along in you flying your ATN and everything all of a sudden you&#x27;re flying on direction if I under 10 degrees off so you correct and you&#x27;re going and you&#x27;re going and you fly your over the range so you go and you do your circle you drop the ordinance and you tickle and you&#x27;re going home but you&#x27;re going over and run out of fuel and crashing about that&#x27;s what happened to catch me but as I say there&#x27;s a reason for why that test was done two months later right at two months the most experienced a10 polity in this country was kept in Spota a lady pilot from the same way but Kevin button came from she taught the other pilots my flying in the a-10 over the range Roberto is pulling out from weapons release superb pilot if there&#x27;s one pilot and a hold down Air Force the knows better look over her shoulder and get target fixation or water bombs did it was fun but she taught everybody else not to do that being hypnagogic state bang oh it&#x27;s down the down is up to flip your sense that up and down so Bota instantly perceived she&#x27;s climbing on a diving correction to climb that run into the ground explodes there was a reason for the test I&#x27;m not going into the weapons past that point what I&#x27;m telling you is there are actual tests there are many others involving the use of the kind of waves and stuff I&#x27;m talking about to directly engineer the human mind at a distance and the guys way ahead of the whole pack unfortunately mr. KGB and I made the killers with it it was like not happy that was in 97 both impressions were 97 okay yes their weapon systems did that I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s a very good reason for that which I&#x27;m not going into here with the proper people in the proper place I have already been very deeply into the reasons for that test but this is not the proper place and this is not the proper organization you have to understand that I just planted can&#x27;t say any more about that it is open source because I really don&#x27;t from source you see before anybody believe it okay but what I&#x27;m looking at is the next millennium technology can be used either for good or for bad now let&#x27;s let the damn fools out they&#x27;re worried about using it for the bad they&#x27;re gonna do that they always do that and nothing I can do about that what can we do to use it for good good boy if we ought to develop that now it takes some time it will happen two weeks would it be nice if every kid in the world could have the equivalent by five phd&#x27;s you can load the education into his head just like you load your computer that&#x27;s fun now we don&#x27;t want you to load and change its personality and it&#x27;s free will that&#x27;s coming too and they&#x27;re going to change everybody with it we don&#x27;t want that to happen well we do wanted to be used to help you because if kids had the training and the knowledge there wouldn&#x27;t be a bunch of kids that can&#x27;t work and don&#x27;t have the skills and can&#x27;t get a job there wouldn&#x27;t be industries looking for people that didn&#x27;t know trained people available they would like to hire some more everybody could be trained we will have for the first time freedom of Education get into our fundamental freedoms the other thing you can do you could address psychological problems I&#x27;m talking about the the ones that totally disabled people in destroy lives I&#x27;m not talking about those it works as we all have I&#x27;m talking about the thing that really ruined and killed and hurt people very bad the first time we now have a to enrich into simply changes we don&#x27;t have to go through 20 years or 10 years of psychotherapy when this gets developed down the road a bit we can go in so oh yeah picture this clan and we fix the software there is no more stress in the individual and there is no more psychological problem we have nothing out there now like that ok in France if you can pump in the time domain and to do that you&#x27;ve got to get to the longitudinal wave the sails and the parts of make the other face time to get automatically all you got to do is get to London from the waves when you charge those up you time reversing and fire salem every part of it back to a previous state what did that say what about amazed patient the problem is the immune system in the body which doesn&#x27;t heal anything that&#x27;s the killers in all don&#x27;t need you anything the immune system attacks the AIDS the HIV virus invaders with great ferocity and it gets about 99% of the first shot but it doesn&#x27;t get all them and the ones that are left are the more Hardy strains and as they reproduce some more it attacks again and again and it continued is continually selecting more strains that are Hardy or an argument pretty soon its own cells are being infected and pretty soon it loses the battle and then the body is open to any you don&#x27;t diabetes nobody dies of AIDS you don&#x27;t have opportunistic infections when your body can no longer resist anything you know pneumonia flu whatever it can kill you just wipe you right out of there would it be nice if you could irradiate the whole body with non ionizing radiation I&#x27;m charge the whole body and reverse all those sales back was not a saint cause you reverse the genetics and Albin this is proven in France in the 60s in the early seventies beautiful results in the literature and they suppress that program like it had never been the French government spent over but it&#x27;s been several million dollars like even the scientists work on it the results were revolutionary well we can&#x27;t have a common life now so they destroyed that I will have a book if I can never get it finished on the exact mechanism by which that priori mechanism and little scientific results actually were obtained in live animals in the laboratory and rigorous experiments but basically the human regenerative system that for which Becker was nominated for a Nobel Prize which is the system that cures damage sails the immune system cures nothing so we don&#x27;t study the regenerative system we study the killers and what he wants to kill something what you do is you just take the cells and their genes and you simply reverse them back to the form they were months and months before eating years before and there was no disease that&#x27;s the way to cure age by the way they have cured cancer terminal tumors in the lab our horrible ever records gonna be 30 in 30 days 100% certain take 30 rats separate them into groups 15 here you can say in case of the same food same environment here with 9 3 15 yo 15 don&#x27;t get it 15 get treated on them only 15 don&#x27;t get treated off that do somebody&#x27;s that one difference if I could drop the blood out of the healthy rabbit recovered make another rack with that same terminal tumor and check one drop of blood in you get well we planed that to that&#x27;s a little bit more complicated that tonight but coming from the use of the new kinds of ways new kind of physics is trying to be born is a totally revolutionary type of heating they cured terminal tumors take care of arteriosclerosis they cure infectious diseases and they incurred they also restored suppress immune systems into the lab animals beautiful results so we will have if it ever gets born again a totally new and revolutionary system of medicine coming out of this load you might get into the education building the software the energy I made that apparent we will bill devices like cold fusion let&#x27;s explain to you how cold fusion works a time forward process is a process where for a particle 1 particle sitting here these guys I&#x27;m gonna use waves I prefer waves to the particle you you can use each one he&#x27;s got more forward time waves rather than face conjugate ways interacting with him then a space countries so he mode he appears to move forward on all the time reversal is is when you reverse the kind of way that&#x27;s interacting with it if he&#x27;s got more face time to gets interacting with me backing up all the time you got any photons pushing him backwards instead of forwards in time predominantly when you load the Palladium lattices with positive charges they by definition or time reverse their charge conjugated if you check that star reversal also what you have done is surround the loaded lattice you create little zones begin to appear sporadically indicate where suddenly there&#x27;s more more phase conjugate waves present then there are time forward waves now it is something that wonderful those I&#x27;m going to tell you something marvelous if you&#x27;re right write this down because you profit only talk to you half of the law of attraction and repulsion of charged particles he taught you what always happens in forward time interactions did he come in his sweet swinging so-and-so ever tell you what happens when the time is running backwards he&#x27;ll know that occasion says what happens is like charges attract and like charges repel you know the way we do time reversal in physics we take a photo like a videotape of it we&#x27;ll run the tape backwards you can visualize time reversal just take what you normally see run to take backwards and that&#x27;s what time reversal is so if I see two particles repelling one another apart in forward time and I&#x27;m going negative time what are they doing they&#x27;re trying low and behold when two protons by the way that there&#x27;s a very famous rule in physics a Pauli exclusion principle that prevents a single proton proton can be time reverse but you can do it in pairs Fermi on individually can&#x27;t be time reverse button two four six eight ten likewise I both firms so what happens is these two protons find themselves suddenly in this time reversal zone and say oh boy we love each other there is no Coulomb barrier the law changed you see a law flipped average q1 Barry bingo so the two protons go BOOM couple more go boom and all get together in the nice social hug and they become quasi nucleo called proton clustering and it but one thing that measured accurately in confucian sort of clusters in shoulders us guys no approach based on that and by the way these clusters are tighter than any businesses can do and climbing beans and that interesting I didn&#x27;t have to add the energy and now change the law the law edit the energy and the closer they got to stronger they&#x27;re attractive when they reach the strong force region and just enter that and get some strong force now their cause you forget to charge it stops about there you enter the strong force region you know the positive nuclei okay let&#x27;s take two protons and now flying together and then a little bit in strong force region and held together as clusters of two protons now that&#x27;s a perfectly viable nuclear state in a time reversal zone it&#x27;s very excited if the timer is on the case which it does it&#x27;s a temporary thing when a ways most of the way start to become normal way just think sunny in an excited state if you&#x27;re writing here&#x27;s another one to write down goes this your professor never told you this this is just normally try to beat their way in the Sun and what they do get a bigger hammer and then batter against the Coulomb barrier boom if you can&#x27;t get in there get more energy and hit that sucker harder it&#x27;s like having a car if you can&#x27;t get in there 60 miles an hour ago 300 really high energy basically once the Q non barrier when I don&#x27;t even have to have a hammer they already get together but when that D caves it&#x27;s in a time reversal zone remember everything&#x27;s backwards the changes don&#x27;t start from outside and try to work their way inside they start at every point inside the nucleus inside the quarks at each point in space-time inside the nucleus and they start out what&#x27;s the first thing you hit the course so what do you do you change course you can engineer the quarks inside a proton or neutron far easier then you move the damn proton or the neutron where this stuff it&#x27;s hard to translate the proton definitely easier to flip the quartz well what happens is excited state decays first things start changing is of course one of the broke two flips into a nucleus I mean to another nuclei called a neutron neutron proton that&#x27;s deuterium that&#x27;s where the extra deuterium is coming from if you load up then in one each time reversal zone a little deuterium ion was just one pasta charge I get a hydrogen I am they get together and then make a quasi new fish when they come back out on another proton flips to give me a stable state and then time forwards home a bingo that&#x27;s the tritium that&#x27;s where everybody gets treated where they have it getting out the party dress I suppose I get two of those deuterium nuclei just together you know time reversal zone when they come out they&#x27;re already stable we call that he the importance of this and that&#x27;s one Apple part - were they getting all the extra alpha part now I won&#x27;t go into the instrumental anomalies that are occurring and they do facilities over a tunnel a when you use longitudinal waves you have to look at the past time history and in time charges only individual instruments their history is significant to an integral instruments where time is not involved now are not identical they can be made in the same day or the same factory line if they had a different history they differ in their instrumental results we were able to explain all of those instrumental nominees and that&#x27;s very rigorous work we were able to explain all the cold fusion interactive physics them and of course clever devil that i am i found the invention disclosure on that i think they&#x27;ll be worth the money one day i might even get a salary one day who knows presently what i&#x27;m telling you has cost me 30 years a little over ten thousand dollars i have about four hundred thousand dollars on the back of my pocket invested in the work that i&#x27;m just giving you a real quick schedule tonight anyway I&#x27;m gonna hand this up real quick I don&#x27;t want to keep you too long we are going to have a science a totally new science for the next millennium it has already started being born it just hasn&#x27;t made the kind of development I&#x27;ve been giving it here in the spin on it I&#x27;ve given it here tonight but it&#x27;s started the explosion in science has already begun you&#x27;re going to have direct engineering ISM by the way that includes the entire human species and any other species on earth and if you wish Gaia is available also we&#x27;re gonna have to beat the Russians because the KGB intends to engineer the collective human unconscious Jung&#x27;s collective unconscious mind and convert us all to something like an ant society where do you leave running it of course outside of the society we&#x27;ve got to be better that&#x27;s the fate of the human species before the end of the next millennium so we&#x27;re in the kind of a race but if we use it for the good and get by the best stuff we can have a marvelous science we&#x27;ve never dream but by the way anti-gravity comes out of this life Tom Briggs no problem if you can engineer all the general relativity and using a strong medium force for your agent of courage of course you can do any gravity no problem so we have a marvelous science looking at us we have to do my ever one thing this is a little bit more akin to many of the motives of people in this audience years and years ago I looked at the human condition and the human problem I look at everything I have to look at it in tried every kind of ISM there were kind of law regulation sweet reason religions Dogma is important it&#x27;s like Lincoln says and some of them work for some of the people some of the time but there&#x27;s nothing out there we&#x27;ve ever run into it works for everybody all the time and I&#x27;m gonna tell you how to fix that because if we make it to that we will survive if we don&#x27;t we&#x27;re going to destroy ourselves in the next millennium this Young&#x27;s piece Jews will explode it&#x27;s easy to show that theoretical when my own dear struggle for example this is an example is not universal don&#x27;t press it too far over whatever females territory whatever they fight stylized and they struggle fiercely in one wins one strong in the other than one of the prevalence but when the other one finally weakens and starts to flee the other male deer does not pursuing and kill him he&#x27;s perfectly capable of doing that and it hasn&#x27;t got a damn thing to do with morality he doesn&#x27;t think about morality he has a switch in which throws and says you stop and you prance around to show the females what a fine lad you are and how lucky they are to have you and that&#x27;s it all the anger takes off their egos and transcends innovative to be an intelligent species we tore out all these stops and balances so we&#x27;d have more software we tore out the firmware to have more software we got to put one piece of firmware back to you nothing else we don&#x27;t want to have society but I need a thing in the collective human unconscious which reacts instantly and this is a noble it&#x27;s a long time lot of money but it&#x27;s cool so that if I raise an axe with intent to sink it in your head the switch throws the intent goes would it be nice I didn&#x27;t say we stopped competition we stopped it when I start to kill somebody or hurt somebody or blow up children or exploded atomic bomb on somebody we just said he&#x27;s going to do something else if we succeed in putting that switch in during this next millennium before the Russians put in the end society switch we really will come into the Golden Age if your biblical fine interpret it any way you wish to we will have the thousand years the beauty if we don&#x27;t do it we will be consumed by the lake of fire now what I&#x27;m trying to say is if enough people get aware of this and the scientists get aware of it less opt for the science of the beautiful millennia thank you very much [Applause] someone working with the same experience working with say I have trouble with that if we can&#x27;t produce any evidence of it and it will not show up on time o&#x27;clock then I can&#x27;t go for it if there&#x27;s no evidence say I&#x27;m based on that something that&#x27;s got some experimental metal I don&#x27;t say you&#x27;re wrong you know my family doctor but it&#x27;s certainly possible to transduce time god help us we don&#x27;t want to transduce all of it that would be a start at your time you can do that theoretically if you balance exactly the phase conjugate I don&#x27;t I get to you in just a moment now if you balance exactly the phase conjugate interactions with the normal wave interactions on a particle that particle would stop in time that is absolutely true but to do it for the whole earth it would be ain&#x27;t be an incredible massive operation is lady no just me Emily it&#x27;s not radioactivity at all no it&#x27;s only as it was used in France and what we&#x27;ve been working on and what we&#x27;ve got the first leg we&#x27;ve got the ankle up on the saddle we end up on the horse you understand we just got an ankle go myself but we haven&#x27;t got an ankle on the staff what we&#x27;re using is the longitudinal wave radiation like pre or dead now I&#x27;ve already filed with the bathhouses to dramatic extensions to that let me think a moment about something about whether to say this or not please and I apologize for that but sometimes it&#x27;s necessary I believe I can get away with saying this okay and yeah I can get away with it I got it printed okay there&#x27;s a lot of folks in the world and I won&#x27;t go into that to plate my own man mind control the Soviets are doing it the Russians the KGB are doing it with precision control and the kind of technology I was talking about like a surgeon&#x27;s scalpel we&#x27;re doing that some guys are somewhere in some kind of problems I&#x27;m not interested in falling never looking at it with brute force I came up with a way from the nature of the dialectic there&#x27;s a beautiful mechanism that&#x27;s almost entirely escaped the attention of physics that I found in a couple of papers that means I can short-circuit that whole painful process of building up these waves and I can use if this works and now this is not proven yet okay let me accent this but if this works and everything that I&#x27;m capable of checking it will work but still gotta be crewing before experimentally before we can say it works within my capability everything I can check it will work let me put it that way then we can jump start all the way by all of that painful transduction the ways I can use ordinary ways in a very special fashion nobody is thought of and I can force every particle in that match whether it&#x27;s living or dead to charge in the time domain on them now if I&#x27;m gonna do that I can do in 30 seconds but it took three already several hours to do with longitudinal age because they have a small interaction cross-section there are there special wave forms has been in the OL editor now for decades if you wanna stop the heart with this special form on there and it caused your heart to go into fibrillation and you&#x27;ll die if you stayed in fibrillation they hold it on you one minute you&#x27;re likely it&#x27;s not going to expire so there&#x27;s several versions of that haven&#x27;t been struck with that damn thing I&#x27;m quite familiar without you I won&#x27;t give you the details about that but I have a witness living witness but they have several versions oh did you know along the ones in the short ones they have some fairly small as a pack a pocketbook can be carried you&#x27;ve got a pretty good size of pocketing the code you can carry it in there that&#x27;s the one I got hit with I wouldn&#x27;t be here to talk today so but that&#x27;s been well known that&#x27;s well known stuff has been well known for decades you can do other things that mess up all your red blood cells really give you a number in your in your blood and you can do some other things with the other particularly the disturbed the corpus callosum where you&#x27;re coordinating the two servo hemispheres your brain going to seizures all kind of stuff that is a well-known set of stuff so can you build death rays out of it of course you can use high-power microwave and just blast you&#x27;ll burn me right where you said of course laser beams if they&#x27;re powerful not the same thing but I&#x27;m not talking about any of that stuff at all I&#x27;m talking about something totally different from that see the most insidious one is the one that doesn&#x27;t have to come in and hit all the barriers to get in there it starts and then works its way out that&#x27;s the most insidious yes oh here&#x27;s a question that every I don&#x27;t know a lost track of him years and years ago about you ever know or you don&#x27;t about every so many worlds or the everything was here there was a young lad named never here I lost time 15 years ago I believe you there&#x27;s a third the only two areas I ever knew of those - I didn&#x27;t know you everything he did that&#x27;s one of the many universities you know it is this fella sweet was that around oh no he was in the Greater Los Angeles area some things I&#x27;ve never what okay there&#x27;s somebody if you were with for sweetening he didn&#x27;t impress you with what he had didn&#x27;t go back look again you might depend with the wrong if it works [Music] oh it&#x27;s [ __ ] interest you see an open system far from equilibrium we have a whole thermodynamics of that for the last 20-some years pretty teen got a Nobel Prize in 77 for his contributions to the field and chemistry such a system if it&#x27;s open free to receive an energy from outside and producing broken symmetry in that inflow that system is allowed to do this you know in this equilibrium it&#x27;s allowed to sell oscillate self-organized put out more energy than you yourself put in a simply taking excess from this external what you&#x27;re getting energy out of that&#x27;s right it is self-organizing see this is already in the textbooks I got a beautiful text for example by what appears to be a new type author or Russian one he&#x27;s working in Israel whatever nationality as he has a lane he could be either Jewish toward Russian I think he&#x27;s rushing to but I have a beautiful book on that whole system this available right now on that whole area of those kinds of systems see we were always shot down in overunity by other people that do hit us with classical thermodynamics if the system is in equilibrium with its external environment I assure you it will never go over unit second law of thermo one male you ever time and all you can produce a growing interval you can the best you can do is ever break even you can&#x27;t beat entropy and you cannot beat the second halt a thermal if the system stays in equilibrium with an external environment now that&#x27;s interesting because Maxwell&#x27;s equations before the rents got a hold of the Heaviside Maxwell&#x27;s equations before Lorentz changed to further did include and does include systems which are both the kind of systems hopefully forever than therefore Bayes the normal thermodynamics for the second law it also includes systems which are not in equilibrium which do not obey that second law and which do obey the other kind of thermodynamics now the ridge taught you to throw all those systems away that don&#x27;t obey so he taught you to throw all the overunity systems or whatever there&#x27;s a little clever trick he talked to did that rig aging the equations senator any fool knows today in physics symmetry leans on observable you don&#x27;t bid they won&#x27;t show any instance annual showing the power meter broken symmetry means of thurible you&#x27;re going to get it on the instruments it&#x27;s going to show you can measure so if you force the system and the symmetrical read aging you have forced it into a system he do to estimate for occasions to do that and carefully selected only the ones whose forces for equal to the opposite he put the system into additional stress here engaged changed its energy twice and he says before you have any electrical system to go through we&#x27;re going to magic demon in here of the rich demon which is going to do this operation on that&#x27;s the only kind of sister to look at and I say nonsense I want the other system it does the other thing I don&#x27;t want you guys to do it I want those it he threw away and I usually call Jackson second edition up around page 220 to show you they symmetrical region that Lorentz told everybody to do and since then everybody just like both parents have been doing that because it makes a variable separable makes equations easy to solve it&#x27;s very convenient and they didn&#x27;t think the potentials had into reality anyway they didn&#x27;t do this as diabolical it&#x27;s not that both they did it as a mathematical convenience to turn the equations into a form it was easy to solve nobody asked what they were doing but if I knew the potential for just a mathematical people well we know today they&#x27;re not the primary reality if you believe one can I&#x27;m sorry to cut short but I can&#x27;t there&#x27;s some things in this life I can work on I&#x27;ve gotten more than I&#x27;m gonna ever get accomplished to the rest of my life right now four books behind approaching a feeling yeah if I live to do that that is the rest of my life&#x27;s work the things that I&#x27;m going to get in trouble with if I around and somebody else&#x27;s turf I&#x27;m not going to mess with and as long as they would let me work on energy and medical applications they can do whatever the hell they the rest of this stuff if I just help gift or help get started a new kind of medicine and clean free energy systems that&#x27;s worth my life work I don&#x27;t want to throw my life away yes let&#x27;s do it on a hardtail show the last week see it&#x27;s so not that hard to develop the mind coupling mind the body coming and there&#x27;s a reverse coupling of the body back to the mind fairly simple you can take it right out of general relativity if you if you look at it once you accept that the mind is doing time operations but every time there&#x27;s a time change it actually makes a curvature of move notation of excuse me the Lorentz transforms or rotations in 4-dimensional space and so if you&#x27;re operating in the time domain you make a change if it&#x27;s a mental change of thought and emotion whatever filing is something in your memory it makes a little vision that&#x27;s a tiny projection in a virtual state over in your real three-dimensional what we call the mass state of your body if you do a series of those for harami that&#x27;s what we called intent in the old unresolved philosophical problem and if they&#x27;re cold if they&#x27;re coherent they integrate into observable form you get a broken symmetry you get an actual physical input a three-dimensional energy down in the free space that&#x27;s general relativity it&#x27;s not talking here now as the body starts to make a move in accordance with that do a servomechanism theory or anybody you can get the amplification you can get to use for the input signal once you get it to do the behavior the functions but every time the body starts to move a piece of man every piece of Massenet is doing a rotation also which is a little protection back into the time domain and it&#x27;s coherent because the body is doing a coherent move and so when it integrates back over there to give you an observable change in the time then what you have is you have the coming back to the of the body to the mind and the mind simply sits there and looks at what it was sending it out and what is getting here in comparison to and adjusted behaviors we just saw for youth a humongous problem with intent is called other philosophers and we this is why physicists haven&#x27;t gone into minds they haven&#x27;t considered the mind had any reality they&#x27;ve been they teach and physics basically most physicists believe we&#x27;re making computers and they stay with the energy they don&#x27;t stay with the time we&#x27;re beginning to see this change the time polarized photon is in quantum field theory the wave is not but if you&#x27;ve got time for right photons you darn sure got time for rough waves and I think my contribution has been how you can make one of them once the physicists get on to that you can forget Tom beard and they&#x27;ll take you to the next level my works done by the way a foundations guys work is this he&#x27;s a stick of dynamite my time to blow a hole in the brick wall it&#x27;s not to make a nice door in other words I&#x27;m to blow the hole once the hole is done these guys can make a better door than I could ever dream of having a capability and they will but first we gotta have the hole so that&#x27;s my function that&#x27;s trying to blow the whole you usually hit the wall a lot of times before you ever get a hole like 30 first question it&#x27;s interesting that Bob Lazar talked to it work at area 51 that he talks about he talked about one of the things they were trying to do was engineer the strong nuclear my provisions you can do it you can get into the edge of it if you time reverse the zone because then the natural attraction of two like charges will bring you into the strong for three times they will not get you in all the way so we shouldn&#x27;t use the term nucleus as long as we have the time reversal zone going we should use the term quasi nucleus but it does have strong force under those clusters are being held the physicists working with how Fox and I&#x27;ve suddenly gone blank I forgot the number is something like a thousand or ten thousand times and strongly held together as the cladding theme experiments can Ram them together so we know something revolutionary is going on here there&#x27;s no question about that shear this repertoire the question is how on earth can you get them to do that but I put all this energy and beans on and that&#x27;s it the time energy here you&#x27;re actually using energy and you&#x27;re doing high energy experiments but when you do the time domain you&#x27;ve got a compaction you&#x27;re working with a C squared amplifying factor you&#x27;re working with C squared times as much energy you got put in so you&#x27;ve got this big amplifier working for you when you&#x27;re let time good work sound background sound being separated the regulars down low mercury estates dives at this shopping mall here just like walking through a wall no I haven&#x27;t looked at that kind of phenomena at all I just haven&#x27;t looked at it I&#x27;m not familiar with I don&#x27;t like to come in on something I hadn&#x27;t liked a lot of people asked me what about this fellow&#x27;s energy device and if I had done even work on there just say you know you don&#x27;t have to have scheme I have no I haven&#x27;t worked I haven&#x27;t looked at yeah if there&#x27;s a lot of s sometimes any databases we&#x27;re always in the Photon Belt but is it something that would affect the consciousness it would affect us in a lot or affect energy or about our lives well actually that&#x27;s a very big question and somebody clue me on a time are we behind forward to answer that question I need to tell you something else around the earth the earth is got a magnetic field it&#x27;s also got a very powerful electric field from the surface of the earth to the electro sphere and if you look at the pointing energy flow and you do cross vectors and those people that do this by the way have something to it wrong through the backwards but if you get it right there is a vast pointing energy flow circulating earth all the time due to the earth all in generatrix pointing energy generation from west to east that&#x27;s right now to the equator now every part of your body is continually being bathed with this at all times and there is some interaction with ten to the minus thirteen three action cross-section and so we really do the LM in a quote natural pointing energy flow environment and that&#x27;s the great flow around the earth there&#x27;s even several great flows if you want to get the persnickety and do all the human residence you know just take the main residence and say okay we got this boat you have the DC background flow which I spread and for all the Schumann resonances you&#x27;ve got some AC flow it&#x27;s a very complicated but just for simple safe take the DC flow now your buddy gets adjusted to that and it&#x27;s all everything develops and lives in this from the time it&#x27;s born all these hands now on the other hand when thunderclouds form and start to come over the bottom of the thundercloud is charged in the opposite direction usually generally only most of the time by the way from the electric security ionosphere there&#x27;s another charge the other way so there&#x27;s another thing a little energy flow going around over there but anyway when this thermos round starts coming in this energy flow that we&#x27;re in starts to slow down the DC does and stops and that is hellaciously uncomfortable if you&#x27;ve got arthritis as I do every bone in your body begins to hollering and every joint in every place you&#x27;ve ever damaged the bone specifically raises hell and you think you&#x27;re in a mausoleum of aching joints and when this thing comes on over there and you&#x27;re caught in reversal remember now the the flow is reversing going back the other way you&#x27;re very uncomfortable and then when it goes on off and the flow reverses again you feel so beautifully refreshed you want to be you just didn&#x27;t rubber Rooter come big old plumbers friends everything in your body they&#x27;re putting down all the sludge it&#x27;s a way of cleaning is that wonder storm sparks part of another mechanism their partner but this natural flow you see anything which influences this environment gets into everything either by the way every single charged particle in everybody in every worm germ Paramecium virus human-being animal bird crocodile fish whatever pours out his own ears into that and everything every thought every emotion every physical action everything in the world sitting right there in Gaia all the time everything that&#x27;s ever been because once you form potentials they decay they never quite reach zero they approach the roads closer you won&#x27;t get your own this finite and so everything that&#x27;s ever been resolved sitting here in inside and buried up inside comprising that huge energy flow and one day good lord willing and the creek don&#x27;t rise we learn to put that on video screens and watch the dinosaur thrive questions are not important that right now they&#x27;re torture field theory can do part of that I will point this out to you in case you&#x27;re dealing with forceful field here beware and also rejoice because of torch and field theory that gave you three quarters nothing but if you will notice very carefully they didn&#x27;t give you the time for the right part that&#x27;s the part they want to withhold free but they&#x27;re going to capture almost all the scientific community the torsion field stuff because it&#x27;s real but it&#x27;s only three-quarters of it and they&#x27;re deliberately withholding from you the most powerful one quarter part you tell about what&#x27;s coming out of the papers now all those papers every damn paper they publish has been reviewed and approved by the KGB and it&#x27;s not giving away the big jewels but they&#x27;re just like chess players they&#x27;re sacrificing poems to get the whole entire US community scientific community headed down that road but leaving out the main part since I am the main part that puts them in the driver&#x27;s seat so both rejoice into physics and also beware there&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a hidden treasure it&#x27;s also some great physics you can look at and actually work and you know you can see through the ocean with it you can see through the earth you can take pictures of the inside the earth and pictures of the bottom of the ocean you can do that one more question I got boy I was gonna say we&#x27;re not going to be run out of here but let&#x27;s let everybody else go then wants to go would anybody wants to stay I&#x27;ll stay here about 15 20 minutes more that sounds great I do have a question for ya how do alternative medicine play in I&#x27;ve seen things happen as a matter of fact man that Christian Way was the story of this person and what happened to her which is passing how does that it is this all part of the same thing but the body changes the way that it works completely look at a computer I got software programs hand I got this you know about the quarters every piece of mass in the body is the dish it records not signals what well space-time curvature into the general relativity appropriate space-time effects mass works on it mass or condensed energy the fiction first place time the two interact together the actual space-time is active it&#x27;s not a passive thing at all and so everything that&#x27;s happening around the mass is making a little curtain tiers of space-time this makes all the forces and so the mass and recording all this stuff is recording a little by commended based on curvatures and so you&#x27;ve got the body is continually recording all of this now some of the alternative medicines they&#x27;re not medicines like health supplements there are certain chemical reactions that your normal computer program function when your body would do what if you&#x27;re missing some things and needs for the program you&#x27;ve got a corrupted program so it&#x27;s producing bad results or every once in a while a bad result and so what happens is sometimes the health supplements contain missing or can hit the body make the things that&#x27;s missing and then it&#x27;s able to recorrect or repurchase the program it&#x27;s like cleaning a virus out of your system so it&#x27;s basically that&#x27;s a real prove it a nice all homeopathy debris after pure space-time mazes you structure and you know it&#x27;s structuring the fluid by hydrogen bond instruction structured in the fluid has been in the literature now for 3035 years so what do I have to prove that I&#x27;ve seen it work what I do yeah and how did you when you put mass in here a chemical what happens is the hydrogen bonding structures adapt to the exactly the compound you have in the compound and the hydrogen structure or interaction I throw base times it&#x27;s a big potential they know the potentials will change - it&#x27;s the curvature of space-time all potentials or general relativistic so and that&#x27;s not talking beer that&#x27;s physics so when I put a compound in there I make a whole set of the vacuum engines and TD we pointed out we&#x27;ve never tried to use the vacuum engines and he urged physicists to do it no but a Nobel Prize winner legal in his book but nobody bothers but homeopathy what you do you put it in a shaker feel good so oh if you would gets exposed to it and all it really makes these little structures and these are those space-time curvature engines so they&#x27;re actively uh structures I mean if you can get the mass part out you still got to vacuum into this based on curves you&#x27;re into it actually mass that&#x27;s by by general relativity an axon max now that doesn&#x27;t appear in chemistry but it darn well appears over here in general relativity so you can prove it by general relativity but not the chemistry whatever was arguing at chemicals chemical is not using some relative if you go to general relativity&#x27;s piece of cake fruit so you know it&#x27;s real and there&#x27;s no place to occur to your engines and that&#x27;s the kind of house well we shouldn&#x27;t do drugs anybody but it takes right now 500 billion dollars that&#x27;s the latest estimate I&#x27;ve got a written document on this to make one of these modern drugs now go through the FDA approved process this excludes everything that we&#x27;re talking about only very powerful companies with huge financial resources to me before death let me tell you you&#x27;ve got five hundred billion dollar investment one drug you&#x27;re gonna get your money back and I&#x27;ll tell you something else power corrupts baby power corrupts Bigley absolute power corrupts absolutely and their big power babe and when big power gets threatened it&#x27;s very corrupt and they&#x27;re good people in any way again well if you took the necessary drugs you&#x27;re not sick I have to take drugs I have to take one medication for pain for a private joints I take about 1/10 of what the recommended doses and I only take it when I absolutely have to because you know Naprosyn will damage you liver if you take it enough years so what I do is I try to take it the least I can do that music but I take all these supplements but to put it down to where I can use very little of it so I can&#x27;t do away with it and I will use the drug if I have no other alternative but I know what I&#x27;m using the drug I&#x27;m not treating the illness or something but I&#x27;m using the supplements I&#x27;m getting partial treatment of the illnesses so you have to balance to change you can&#x27;t eliminate it entirely but you have to have a happy balance just don&#x27;t go for the drugs totally the worst thing in the world would be on 20 different drugs in the whole system torn apart and they can&#x27;t figure out which way to go and unfortunately they do that to a lot of aging people yes okay no problem [Music] ya know the best way I can say it is if I have some data recorded on my disk I have data plus the disk if I take the day data and pull off the recording off the desk and put it somewhere else out there like in the old universe I still have the data on different have the disk anymore I don&#x27;t have what we call a function on this per day order and the human body is the same way the mind is coupled to the body but to mine is in the time domain all our physics observer the observer remember time is not observable to fittest it strips away the time and there would you mind so it&#x27;s left with this physical results of observation from the company and nothing else it can&#x27;t tell you what gave you the company because it threw away the mechanism when it threw aways of mine time like functions of the mind so the mind is forever mighty was mine in the very general sense both personal conscious personal unconscious collective unconscious of the human species selection allows for the whole all of species which is Gaia and go as far as you wish to if you get to the bottom you can get to God in my in my view I&#x27;m not anybody else this is a month but in this model I can generate what happens to you after death I&#x27;ve been close enough to that two times that I&#x27;m perfectly happy with what the model says because that&#x27;s exactly what I experienced very okay well I assure you this personal death but it&#x27;s also very warning to you because if you really think you can beat your fellow man your fellow human being get away with it and I&#x27;ll tell you what you&#x27;re in when you&#x27;re done in case you&#x27;re wondering do you know when you go to sleep at night how your conscious mind really sort of the draw it&#x27;s like being on a submarine you pull in the periscope right at night you leave things around so the sudden noise comes on you can put the periscope up again well when you die you&#x27;re put into periscope you can&#x27;t put it up again you&#x27;re eating your own unconscious what do you got in there whatever you put in there well there is a time domain here but it may be a different time from the time we are we are talking about on earth here at time has some definite eternity was the pay&#x27;s eternity - the time is it between you well it&#x27;s a little different than that but what you&#x27;re really in is whatever you have created inside your own unconscious if you beat the hell out of everybody cheated come on guess what you&#x27;re gonna be in a waking nightmare from which you can outwit and I was call that hell but I&#x27;ve been there and it&#x27;s hell now if you want to go into that area let me give you one little piece of advice the hardest thing to do when you really die is to realize you&#x27;re dead you&#x27;re in exactly the same state that you&#x27;re in on a deep dream or all this stuff you can&#x27;t control coming at you every which away from the unresolved conflict in you on Connor come on that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re in so if you want to have a heavy time after though then be sure you&#x27;re at peace with your fellow human being if you&#x27;ve got somebody you&#x27;ve done vertical apologize to put your arm around the shoulder and beg their forgiveness I&#x27;m quite serious I&#x27;m talking about practicality are you gonna pay for it through the nose when you meet it in a waking nightmare you can&#x27;t away from all of you are dealing with is these time operations going on around you and you can put them in there you could make so yes sir you do reap what you sow exactly and precisely and that&#x27;s physics time physics but physics they will be here anytime we can get by the Sun to God&#x27;s just gonna ask me what you think the timeline is the beginning for you I hold two years two years that kills several researchers I stopped several programs that several people disappeared they&#x27;re no longer with us I don&#x27;t know except if we all if we spread the word that&#x27;s the sound a lot of those people were doing exactly that I can only give you my approach to almost thirty years ago right about thirty years ago when I started in this energy boy I didn&#x27;t know what I was getting into I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d ever had the guts to tackle him but I took a different view you know I want to explain to you why I took the view idea that why it was so hard and why nobody wanted to take that view I looked at electrodynamics I&#x27;d had enough in nuclear engineering and I minored in electronic engineering that way back there in old days before they even have transistor ISM and they had the tubes and I said the electron dynamics that leads to all the electrodynamics I ever had absolutely prohibits on overunity device but I have seen an over unity device working measured it now I can&#x27;t argue with experimental results so now I&#x27;ve got a problem it means that the model we&#x27;re using an electrodynamics is imperfect the real thing to do is not to block your wave my arms and say hey baby it references reference only well we&#x27;ve had a LCD residence in Christ was a corporal they&#x27;ve never added a single walk to the bar so we have done to find out what went wrong with electromagnetics that we&#x27;re taught in our foods even better I gotta say out told me for my senses I didn&#x27;t know how to measure the sine wave was in a sine wave the instruments was all wacky and everything was sitting there power and v my clothes thing I couldn&#x27;t do that because it didn&#x27;t do that it did that for years so I had a problem so what I said was the real problem then is to find out what went wrong with electrodynamics and all of my cohorts was just laughing at me like you know in same time don&#x27;t worry with that we just go around here to find one of these things we&#x27;re gonna produce you like sausages well this sausage works different from anything they ever taught you you&#x27;ll run into a machine and a work in Huntsville and it won&#x27;t work they don&#x27;t work and women even find you take it out the sea and then blow itself up or you know work on a Monday and it won&#x27;t work on Friday there are different kinds of variables here than anything we&#x27;ve ever study I mean we want it to work all the time we&#x27;re going to either gonna have to be real lucky like some of the inventors were oh we&#x27;re going to have to find out what those variables are and learn to control oh so that&#x27;s the tough job so I said well nobody else is doing this job I don&#x27;t have really the super qualifications that ought to be brought to bear but within my limitations it&#x27;s going to do what I can well I have developed the world&#x27;s first legitimate theory of overunity electrodynamic devices and it&#x27;s rigorous and it will hold water and I can move it now all over in the open systems far from equilibrium so I&#x27;ve gotten a whole body of science that will accept those results I had to show however how we got it out of classical thermo and I had to find out what happened that and I find out what Lorentz did to us and that&#x27;s what happened to it they threw out those kinds of systems so now we have what I&#x27;m trying to do is build a bridge back to the orc Orthodox scientist the guy who&#x27;s really good and I can show him now you see look here is what was done in the standard electrodynamics there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that except you must realize that now has systems in equilibrium if I take the systems out of equilibrium which I can&#x27;t do you did to disequilibrium shifts and carefully selected them to get one in equilibrium in the first I&#x27;m just going to use one and we&#x27;ll keep it out of equilibrium now I move over into this other thermodynamics which is already accepted by the citizens I have a viable argument I believe this argument can be sold because they&#x27;ve hold water if all I was going to do was tell you all you got to do to make LC residence and you can get it down to residence statistics they&#x27;re gonna look at me and say you crazy we do that all the time doesn&#x27;t do over you but they had one other question to answer where is the energy coming from in a circus it ain&#x27;t coming out of better than me battery doesn&#x27;t furnish any energy to the low burn either doesn&#x27;t generate much more power company does not furnish any energy at all to any light in my house or to any of the systems in my house what dimensional power company charges me for is to pump a lot of spin electrons when the free energy flows all down the line and pump the electrons forward they pump all the spin electron back to the generator kill the sort of dipole and they got to keep burning some more fuel the rotates a chef a little more to form the magnetic field again to force the charges back apart to get the energy for T and I&#x27;m standing there steadily killing them and standing a forcing them back apart and I&#x27;m paying these foods they have a sumo wrestling match [Applause] [Music] it&#x27;s this sound like to make a donation we have a bowl [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] at least three of us yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] soon [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]</p>
