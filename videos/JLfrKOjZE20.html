            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Good day and welcome to the best time of the week, reality check Q&amp;A, where you guys get to ask me the hard questions. And here to apply the blowtorrch, my colleague in crime, Megan Medic. Good day, Megan. How are you? &gt;&gt; Hey, Ross. How you doing today? &gt;&gt; Good day.</p>
<p>Welcome. &gt;&gt; Okay, let&#x27;s get started. I&#x27;d love to start with a new sound from Rep. Eric Berles, he went on in the podcast called ALN and he made some comments about a possible UAP crash site. &gt;&gt; There is reportedly an object that is not in this country that is so large it cannot be moved uh that they&#x27;ve built an entire building around it.</p>
<p>And I think that I think uh either Greer or another individual has actually mentioned this site, but I&#x27;m not going to mention it because it is a classified location. But there is a a really apparent there&#x27;s reported a really large object and and that&#x27;s one of the locations that I&#x27; I&#x27;m requesting to to get to. It&#x27;s going to be very it&#x27;s going to involve a lot to get to make that happen, but that may be the uh final destination. &gt;&gt; Ah, yes. So this is a reference to, interestingly enough, by Representative Eric Berles to the story I&#x27;ve been talking about for quite some time, probably two or three years.</p>
<p>The allegations that there is a craft that is too big to move. So when the UFO the craft was discovered, it was nonhuman technology in a foreign country from the United States. and that when this craft was discovered, the decision was made to build a building over it. And it&#x27;s interesting because I&#x27;ve cocked the blowtorrch from some people online for quite some time. Some are skeptical that such a thing exists, as of course there always will be and should be.</p>
<p>And then to hear representative Eric Berles say what he said today is quite extraordinary. The representative said there is reportedly an object that is not in this country that is so large that it cannot be moved that they&#x27;ve built an entire building around it. Grier, that&#x27;s I think a reference to Dr. Steven Grier or another individual. I think I plead guilty there has actually mentioned this site, but I&#x27;m not going to mention it because it is a classified location.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m requesting to get to it. It&#x27;s going to involve a lot to make that happen, but that may be the final destination. Now, what I can tell you is Representative Eric Berles does know the location of the object I&#x27;m talking about, and for good reasons that people often get frustrated about. I have said many many times here that we will not be revealing the location of the object, the country in which it is located because it serves a very important national security purpose and quite frankly it might put the lives of very good men and women in danger, United States men and women in danger uh if the location was to be revealed. But it&#x27;s good to hear from Eric Berles that he is willing to investigate.</p>
<p>Now, I don&#x27;t take what he&#x27;s saying as a complete endorsement of the idea that he&#x27;s accepting that it&#x27;s a real object. He&#x27;s used the word reportedly there. But what I do note is he asserts that the location or the fact of the existence of the object is very highly classified and that he&#x27;s seeking access to it. I take heart from that because it implies to me that he&#x27;s working on other knowledge and I&#x27;ve got a pretty good idea of where he would have got that knowledge from. There are people who have come forward independently to the oversight committee of the Congress and indeed to the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee with full details on this object.</p>
<p>In variations from another clip, uh, Representative Berles also said, &quot;There is reportedly an object found in a country that is so large it cannot be moved. They&#x27;ve built around it. It&#x27;s a location, but there is a reported really large object, and I&#x27;m requesting to get to those locations. I think he means location. Now, he explicitly avoided naming the specific site.</p>
<p>Um, I know Dr. Steven Greer has named a site in South Korea. I can&#x27;t comment on that. I&#x27;m not playing a guessing game with anybody about the location because I&#x27;ll be honest, I think it&#x27;s irresponsible to reveal the location. And as a journalist, I am legally ethically obliged to ensure that I don&#x27;t do anything to compromise the safety of our men and women who are serving their country.</p>
<p>And neither would I want to. But it&#x27;s very, very interesting to hear representative Berles making a statement that he is investigating. And I sincerely hope he gets to go and have a look cuz he&#x27;s going to have a very interesting surprise. I just hope he doesn&#x27;t just go to the facility that&#x27;s sitting on top of the object and he asks to go below. That&#x27;s the key issue.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, we have another question also about Rep. Berles. This is from Interstellar on X. Rep. Eric Berles recently said in an interview, &quot;There will be a major new whistleblower coming forward with firstirthand knowledge, possibly from the legacy program, and he could be the most credible to date.</p>
<p>Does Ross know anything about this new whistleblower? &gt;&gt; Look, I&#x27;m not sure specifically which whistleblower Eric Berles is talking about because I&#x27;m actually aware of several. Um, yes, I know it&#x27;s a frustrating time right now. I know there is not a lot happening publicly on the UAP issue that it seems like Congress has rolled over and let the Pentagon tickle their tummy like supine little puppies. But the reality is behind the scenes there are good people in Congress who are asking hard questions and there are whistleblowers coming forward. I&#x27;ve been responsible for referring a few of them on.</p>
<p>So I&#x27;m not 100% sure which person Eric Berles is talking about. But in a December 2025 interview with our friend and colleague Matt Lazlo, who runs the superb site Ask a Poll where he doors stops politicians in and around the Congress. Berles stated, quote, &quot;There is one person who is a new whistleblower that they have a lead on. I think he&#x27;s talking about the oversight committee there who might go public.&quot; And my understanding, he described this evidence as building this whistleblower&#x27;s evidence as building on evidence that had come from David Grush. And he emphasized that it was important to get witnesses comfortable for skiff briefings that um briefings entire inside a secure closed facility or potential hearings, maybe even potential public testimony.</p>
<p>And um we don&#x27;t know any more than that. the only other person who&#x27;s really talked publicly about a potential new whistleblower. My understanding is that Dr. Steven Greer, the longtime disclosure act advocate and a chap who&#x27;s basically headed the disclosure project that goes back 20, 25, 30 years, he has talked about a lieutenant colonel or a left tenant colonel as we call it in the weird part of the world from Edwards Air Force Base who allegedly worked with ARVs, alien reproduction vehicles. Now, that person hasn&#x27;t come forward yet.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope this is true, and maybe that&#x27;s the person that Eric Berles is talking about. But aside from that, um I look, I am aware that there are individuals coming forward. Frankly, I&#x27;ll be honest with you, I don&#x27;t know what the hell the Senate Armed Services Committee or the Senate Intelligence Committee are doing with the witness lists they&#x27;ve been given, but they don&#x27;t seem to be doing a lot. Are they being paralyzed by the committee chair chairperson leadership? I fear they are. &gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s a hot topic right now.</p>
<p>This is coming from Gio on X. There seems to be a connection between Epstein and the UAP topic. What has Ross heard both past and present about this? &gt;&gt; I think the claims that there is a connection between Epstein and the UFO topic is frankly a very long bow. There is a document in the recently released 3 million plus pages of archives material. A document that is apparently from Dr.</p>
<p>Jack Safarti. And it&#x27;s a mailing list. I think even I&#x27;m on it because Jack Safarti is notorious in the community of UAP research for putting anybody and everybody onto a circulation list. And there&#x27;s a frequency on this list of people like myself asking to be taken off it. Notwithstanding the fact that these requests are made, Jack keeps on putting his back on it.</p>
<p>So yes, um even my friend George Knap actually recently observed that he was also on the list of people who were in receipt of the document that was referred to. What it showed was that Epstein and Safarati were clearly engaging. Safati, by the way, is quite a prominent physicist. He tells a hilarious story about being a child and having a phone call from an alien spaceship AI, artificial intelligence, that told him he would be serving a very useful purpose on this issue of disclosure in the imminent future. And um Jack uh has made this claim consistently throughout the rest of his life and it hasn&#x27;t yet of course been put to the test, but I sincerely hope it proves to be right.</p>
<p>But the real point that comes out of what Jack circulated to Epstein is that Epstein was clearly interested in alternative propulsion systems. Now, it may be because Epstein was spying for the Israelis. That seems pretty clear. Galileain Maxwell&#x27;s father uh was in fact an operative of Mosad. And the reason I know this is because I spent a lot of time investigating the terribly sad story of Morai Venunu, the guy who leaked the story of the Deona uh nuclear facility where Israel built the bomb.</p>
<p>Incredibly, this is actually a really good story and it it basically highlights the fact that there are people like Robert Maxwell who was the editor of one of the major tabloid British newspapers. Actually, he was the owner. Um, it turned out he was a stoogge for MSAD. And so, Morai Venunu had tried to fogg the photographs of the Deona nuclear facility, which included evidence that they were creating weapons uranium. And he tried to flog the story to the Sydney Morning Herald when I was working there.</p>
<p>And I can remember one of my colleagues talking about this particular investigation and being very dismissive of this weird guy called Oscar Guerrero who turned up with Morai Venunu&#x27;s pictures. And it&#x27;s one of the reasons why as a journalist I&#x27;ve learned to always take sources that sound a bit wacky very seriously. Because what had happened was Morai Venunu had literally been working inside the most sensitive nuclear facility in the world at the time where Israel was building nuclear weapons. And he&#x27;d come to Sydney disillusioned about that job. and he had photographs that he&#x27;d covertly obtained showing proof that the Israelis were building centrifuges that could create nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>And if the Sydney Morning Herald person responsible for seeing these photographs had just taken one bit of advice from an expert, he would have realized he was sitting on the biggest scoop of his life. Unfortunately, the guy that brought him the photographs was this Oscar Guerrero character. Um the person in the Sydney Morning Herald who I will not name um basically laughed him out of the office. So Oscar gave the photographs back to Morai Venunu. Venounu went to London, flogged the stories to Maxwell&#x27;s newspaper after initially approaching the London Sunday Times.</p>
<p>The Times was investigating the story and they eventually broke the story which was a massive scoop. But in the interim, Morai Venunu was kidnapped by MSAD because Robert Maxwell, Galain&#x27;s father, tipped off the Israelis. And it&#x27;s been a tragedy ever since that Morai Venudu has been under first prison arrest and then house arrest for the rest of his life. Now, why is that story relevant? Because it shows very, very clearly that the um Israelis build relationships like they did with Epstein. Now, I&#x27;m not saying Epstein was necessarily an Israeli asset.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s a pretty good conclusion he was and I have no doubt at all that the Israelis are interested in UAPs. They&#x27;re already working with the Americans. Um Heim Ised, the former head of the space program in Israel, has made no secret of the fact that the Israelis are aware of the American legacy retrieval and reverse engineering program. And I&#x27;m told the Israelis are probably more informed than most, particularly more well-informed than my country, Australia, about what America is really up to with UAP high technology. That was a very long answer, but I&#x27;ve always wanted to tell that Oscar Guerrero Morai Venunu story.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s a question from cigarette smoking Nikico Wraith in UAP Gerb&#x27;s latest video posted just a few days ago. The man is prolific. He names names. This is definitely his boldest, bravest naming of names thus far. Is Ross able to corroborate any of them.</p>
<p>Given the risk involved, any strength and numbers would be heartwarming. &gt;&gt; Now, I really strongly recommend UAP Gerb. The guy is a machine. He does the most methodical analyses of the legacy retrieval reverse engineering program I&#x27;ve seen to date anywhere. He did a great story with my friend Jesse Michaels on American Alchemy very recently and on his own show UAP Gerb on YouTube and the guy is an acronym machine.</p>
<p>I I I have trouble remembering AROW, the all domain anomaly resolution office, but I was looking I actually did a print out of all of the acronyms. And you&#x27;ve got one page, two page, three page, four pages, five pages of acronyms that UAP GERB in the course of the analysis that he did detailing all of the United States agencies that are secretly and covertly involved or linked in some way to the legacy retrieval reverse engineering program. But as this question asks, there are a number of people that he has named uh and let&#x27;s go through them. David Grush, of course, the former US intelligence officer uh who was the NRO liaison, the national reconnaissance office liaison to the uh UAP task force in the Pentagon from 2019 to 2021. And he&#x27;s the whistleblower of course who swore congressional testimony.</p>
<p>Chris Melon, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence and security. Hal Putoff, physicist, longtime UAP researcher. Eric Davis. I wouldn&#x27;t say these people are part of the legacy program. So, let&#x27;s get to the people who are part of the legacy program.</p>
<p>And the one I&#x27;m very happy to name, of course, is Terry Phillips, the former US Air Force officer and Air Force Office of Special Investigations Special Agent, who was the executive director of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, PJ, and Air Force Space Force SAP Security Director. Uh he became an SCES in August 2020, served as a sec senior security executive at Leos and vice president for security at Northrip Grumman. Note that Northre Grumman. Very interesting. Northrep Grman.</p>
<p>Did I say Northre Grumman? [sighs and gasps] Um he is a key gatekeeper figure and frankly not a very nice person. Lee Russ, Air Force Office of Special Investigations Special Agent. Are you seeing a pattern here? A FOSI? You mean the people that go around intimidating and threatening and bullying people to shut up about the UAP program? Oh, those guys. He served as a successor to Terry Phillips as the executive director of a FOCPJ and Air Force SAP security director. And I agree with UAP Gerb about those names.</p>
<p>He names another guy, Russell Wiler, the Defense Intelligence SCES. Um, he&#x27;s proposing him as an Air Force SCES2 gatekeeper. I&#x27;m not so sure. I don&#x27;t know about Russell Wheeler. William McClure.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s involved. Um, he&#x27;s uh SCES in the um SAF Az programs oversight and information protection. Don&#x27;t know about him. Randall Walden. Yes, I have heard that name.</p>
<p>He worked at Edwards Air Force Base, Nellis and Pax River. I&#x27;m sure he knows about the legacy program. Donna Shipton, former US Air Force lift tenant general, lieutenant general, military deputy. Um, US Air Force through and through, serving from department uh I think I think she&#x27;s been there for many years. Henry Wang, Air Force scientist and engineer, head of special studies at Wright Air Force Base.</p>
<p>Um, he&#x27;s allegedly linked by witnesses, says UAP Gerb, to the Kingman 1953 UFO crash and the Aztec 1948 crash cases. He died in 1960. [sighs and gasps] Arthur Stansel Jr., an engineer and witness in the Kingman case. They I think there was a um a pseudonym they used for him Fritz Fritz Fritz Werna uh in the Kingman UFO case. Um Sean Kirkpatrick.</p>
<p>Who could forget Shan Kirkpatrick? It was the show that brought you the story that after he uh had his shameful operation as the head of Arrow, Shan Kirkpatrick took a job that they tried to hide at the um Oak Ridge National Laboratories. And I have no doubt at all Sean Kirkpatrick is up and over beyond his neck in the legacy program. It&#x27;s absurd that he was going to the Oakidge National Laboratory which is one of the key facilities for the operation of the legacy program. Uh they tried to hide it as we revealed here on reality check that he was taking a job. The Pentagon denied that he was the Shaun Kirkpatrick referred to in the staff lists.</p>
<p>I was given a tip from inside Oakidge that that was the same Sha Kirk Sha Kirkpatrick and while he was still serving as the ARO boss, he inadvertently got posted into the staff registry as a member of the Oakidge National Laboratories. That was because an overzealous HR person basically put his name on the list before it became official. They tried to bury the fact of Shan Kirk Patrick&#x27;s involvement. But the hilarious thing, this is how untrustworthy the Pentagon is on this whole issue. The very man who was responsible for supposedly investigating UAPs for the Pentagon is up to his neck inside the legacy program.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s how deceitful and lying and menacious the Pentagon are becoming with this whole subject matter. They think they can  users and it&#x27;s not going to work. The other one that um is named of course is Ron Moltry, the under secretary of defense for intelligence and security from 2021 to 2023 who was involved in the establishment of Arrow. Um UAP Gerb suggests that he&#x27;s probably a potential gatekeeper or somebody with knowledge of the legacy program. And I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>And the final one he named from memory is Don Dunlop, a US Air Force major general, commander of the Edwards 412 test wing and director of the special access program central office. The only other names I would add to that, and we know this because of the leaked Wikileaks documents, is General Neil Mccasland and General Michael Kerry, who are the two Air Force generals who were delegated to brief Tom Dong, believe it or not, the Blink 182 Rockstar about the um knowledge of UAPs by the US government. And it was clearly an attempt at some kind of controlled disclosure using Tom as a safe person to get the story out through his audience. That all blew up in their face, of course, when Hillary Clinton didn&#x27;t win the election as they expected and when Donald Trump became president. And that&#x27;s why for pretty much the last 12 years, the whole thing&#x27;s been up in the air while we wait to see what Donald Trump will do.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s my answer to UAP Gerb&#x27;s list of acronyms. I cannot beat UAP Gerb on his astonishing capacity for acronyms, but I can confirm that a lot of the names that he identifies are indeed people who are directly associated and knowledgeable and heavily involved in the legacy UAP retrieval program. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s getting utterly absurd, frankly, that we maintain the lie that the US government has no knowledge of extraterrestrial engagement with this planet. Whether it be ET or NHI, I don&#x27;t think the American public are going to buy the deceit and they will feel egregiously misled if and when the president does eventually stand up at a podium and admit that they&#x27;ve been lying to the public all these years. Clearly, one can only hope that the military and the intelligence community of the United States concern themselves with their reputations.</p>
<p>what they can do to attempt to retrieve their tattered reputations is start telling the truth. &gt;&gt; Okay, we will move to our next question from Pete on X. Hi, Megan. Can you ask Ross why Bob Lazar hasn&#x27;t testified at a UAP hearing? Rep. Berles keeps saying we need genuine firsthand witnesses now, not more claims.</p>
<p>Peter. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, part of the problem is that Bob Lazar&#x27;s credibility is pretty shot. I&#x27;m not saying he&#x27;s a liar, but there are aspects of his story that frankly don&#x27;t make sense. He has claimed to have two M&#x27;s degrees from recollection, and there is no evidence that he ever had those master degrees.</p>
<p>And of course, um there&#x27;s also the fact that he&#x27;s easily discreditable because for a while he apparently ran a brothel. But did he work at Area 51 S4? I think he did. And I say this in my book, In Plain Sight. I do think uh he worked at Area 51 and um I actually spoke while he was alive to a guy called Dave Fruhof who worked at Area 51 not when Bob Lazar was there. Dave sadly has now passed away.</p>
<p>But as I ta as I say in my book, Dave Fuhof confirmed from people that he was speaking to that uh indeed there was a Bob Lazar who worked at Area 51 and he also independently confirmed that there was an S4. I heard that from the horse&#x27;s mouth from Dave himself. But nobody is telling me that they have direct firsthand knowledge that Bob Lazar worked at S4. And of course that would be very hard because anybody with direct firsthand knowledge of S4 would be under their security oaths and it would be incredibly restraining on them to stop them from ever speaking about it. And this may be the reason, but there is another reason.</p>
<p>Not only is there some question marks over Bob&#x27;s credibility, although I suspect very strongly he did work at Area 51. [gasps] The other issue is he&#x27;s made it pretty clear he doesn&#x27;t want to testify. In interviews, including a 2024 clip, he said, quote, &quot;I fought the fight for 30 years, and I&#x27;m kind of happy the way it is now. The last thing I want to do is stir the pot again.&quot; Uh, he has affirmed that if he was put under oath, he would tell the truth and say that what he was saying was the truth. and he has repeatedly declined opportunities to testify publicly, viewing further involvement as unnecessary or risky after decades of scrutiny and threats and personal allout.</p>
<p>And who can blame him? Knowing as I do what happens to people inside the program, including allegedly some people being murdered and at the very least certainly threatened and having their careers and lives destroyed. Why would anybody put themselves up to that kind of scrutiny when Congress is wimping it on the whistleblower disclosure laws to protect people, particularly contractors? Yes, people who work in the defense department and the intelligence community are protected as government employees under the current whistleblower laws. But the reason why the new UAP Disclosure Act whistleblower laws were so important and these were blocked by the chairpeople of certain committees in the Congress repeatedly throughout last year. The reason why these laws matter is that because they would have provided protection to people like Bob Lazar who were working as contractors. I think Bob was working for then EG and G.</p>
<p>he wouldn&#x27;t have the whistleblower protections that exist currently. And this is why it&#x27;s a load of steaming that we are in fact providing protection for whistleblowers in the Congress at the moment. And it&#x27;s why if I was a whistleblower, I would be extremely cautious if I was just a contractor. Pretty much most of my sources inside the legacy program are contractors. They think you have a right to know about the legacy UFO UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program.</p>
<p>And they think it&#x27;s absolutely outrageous that this information is being withheld. But right now, the Pentagon holds the whip hand over any release of that information because contractors don&#x27;t have protection. It&#x27;s as simple as that. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you, Ross.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go to Proctor Hopkins on X. Do you think the upcoming moon mission could potentially be used as part of soft disclosure, a renewed focus on the cosmos? &gt;&gt; Um, well, uh, you can watch the [snorts] latest reality check episodes on so-called lunar anomalies presented by Dr. Manelli Durkshani and we&#x27;ve presented already the first of those and hopefully by the time this Q&amp;A is out we might present the second and I think Manili Durkshani who is a very wellrespected physicist and has worked with organizations like cityi and the scientific coalition for the study of UAPs I think he has presented a very cogent case to at least suspect that NASA is deliberately redacting blurring um hiding images on the moon to try and reduce their resolution so we can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s there. He believes that there is evidence of potential artificial structures on the moon. And I don&#x27;t think that uh America&#x27;s premier space organization NASA is being open and discerningly transparent in what it&#x27;s providing the public.</p>
<p>I do think that uh what Manali Manali reveals in his most recent episode, the second of our lunar anomalies, it raises very serious questions about claims made to my friend who&#x27;s pseudonmously called the spaceman who was a close personal friend of Edgar Mitchell. Edgar Mitchell told my friend, and I relate this story in my book, that all Apollo missions to and from the moon were followed by craft and that he actually photographed blue lights. And indeed, these blue lights are visible in photographs, official NASA photographs. And Manally Derek Shani takes us through some of those images in the report that he does. But do I think that these moon missions will be a recipe for soft disclosure? No, I don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>I think at the moment uh there is no intention by anyone. I think contrary to the assertions being made by a British filmmaker um I don&#x27;t think that there is any move at the moment. I am getting assurances from inside somebody at National Security Council level that they&#x27;re not aware of any movement at all. So if there is a decision being made by President Trump, as is being asserted by Mark Christopher Lee that there&#x27;s going to be some kind of a disclosure in July around the time of Roswell, my sources don&#x27;t know about it in the National Security Council. And they should because if there was a strategy document being proposed for some kind of controlled disclosure, you&#x27;d think that the president&#x27;s premier National Security Advisory Group, the NSC, would know about it.</p>
<p>I do think people should be aggressively asking both the president and Marco Rubio, acting national security adviser and secretary of state, whether there&#x27;s any truth to these claims because we are going to start seeing things on lunar missions. If, for example, Elon Musk does do a manned voyage at least in orbit around the moon, it&#x27;s inevitable that highresolution sensors are going to see the far side of the moon and hopefully be able to obtain highresolution imagery of some of these things that people like Dr. Many Derek Shani have shown us in recent reality checks. I think the public&#x27;s got a right to know. I think there should be some kind of controlled disclosure and I think it&#x27;s completely untenable for this continued cover up to continue.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Say goodbye. Okay, Ross, that was the last one for today. Thank you for your time. &gt;&gt; All the best. Thank you so much for joining me.</p>
