            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald abuse ads founder and chair the International Society of unified science and president of trans power corporation a commercial and custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company I work as a theoretical physicist and as a systems and mechanical engineer today is with most of my screencast I&#x27;ll be discussing the surgical system physical theory you can see on the screen on the Left panel you see the main menu the microcosmos database and on the right panel the macrocosmos database I&#x27;ve over I&#x27;ve already covered all the topics here the way outs here in the macrocosmos database and I&#x27;m in the midst of cutting the topics here the micro cosmos database we&#x27;ve covered this all these solid matter properties and now we&#x27;re going to talk about energy and entropy for liquid vapor and gas metal properties so let&#x27;s click here and the lay out comes a lot of stuff here I have us divided up into a liquid section here a vapor section here and a real our ideal gas here okay the top layer right here same as all the other layouts and fluid set of properties we have the element compound or mix h2o this is our sample that we&#x27;re working with it&#x27;s ice water and steam of course form number one connect molecular weight is here not in temperatures here this is the observed temperature vapor gas symbols the same in this case but it could be different from for some other substances and Tom Tomic molecular weight is here there&#x27;s no Delta V factor here but it might be non zero for others calculate the mounting time mr. K here you can see it&#x27;s the same exact the heat of fusion is calculated here Joule per mole and here let&#x27;s see what this is the heat of fusion equal to the enthalpy of the liquid at the melting point enthalpy of the solid at the northern point and this is the calculation in division takes into account that only read this only a fraction the molecules at the only point in the solid state image therefore need to be heated to change to liquid the remaining fraction of the molecules are already in the good state okay that&#x27;s the difference and so here&#x27;s the observed ie it&#x27;s pretty close pretty close all right these are the structural parameters this whole list here I&#x27;m gonna go I&#x27;ve gone through this before another screencast which is essential that you understand that these are not fudge factors and regression coefficients these are actual structural constants or the substance under consideration in this case the liquid water so here we have none of elements is - number of atoms obviously 3 well ns1 ns2 an initial an internal these are the liquor thermo groups here 1.5 structure gives 1.5 number of volumetric units when we throw had number temperature units - number of pressure units nine that means nine molecules act together to act against external pressure and this is the PCP average and cal per mole k3r and there we have the external pressure this is an important in film once you have all this in you&#x27;re basically just gonna put in the external pressure once and then you have the temperature here that you want to deal with for the liquor or the temperature here for the vapor the temperature gas here now you can choose absolute or relative dyes and then I explain this remember always make use of the tooltips you hover the mouse over there relative and thousand for liquids and neighbors is based on zero at the melting temperature may decide I&#x27;m gonna get through this okay so well John taught me for gases based on zero at the critical temperature chandi note other authors have different definitions relative relative entropy for liquids and neighbors based on zero of the melting point relative entropy for gases is based on zero @tg attempts of gases the two-dimensional limit and we&#x27;re tiel&#x27;s okay all right so here&#x27;s the temperature when producing okay now for comparison to the theory I do supply with the yas regression coefficients Carl Yas is about chemical properties Hamburg is very important to have on hand to compare the theoretical calculations because you have to have some way of comparing the theory to the experiments and you don&#x27;t want look at just a list of data points and of course these have been injured in from other other screens these are side values anyway if you want to set TK to the mean of sinking the source should be the claim that if it&#x27;s option you can also use the vapor pressures external pressure to know this put it here all right so now we calculate enthalpy internal energy entropy complement k temperature well this is this is another section as heat sink heat source in the gelatin but let me just go through these so enthalpy and count from all Joule per mole Calla per gram and then out and copy from yours so you see you can compare different values here internal energy job from all job from all Cal program and then again from the AWS and the entropy Cal from okay Cal well that&#x27;s what that really is okay so these are really for that for the energy right this is a strictly Cal from UK or to promote a counter green cane and then entropy okay all right and then we have the usual stuff here with heat sink and heat source so this is the you know that&#x27;s - that that&#x27;s the knotting time - oh really okay so we&#x27;re using relative die so naturally naturally these are the zeros here so they have a heat source calculations and they&#x27;re through the whole thing the rest of it here okay so anyway once you work out what these values are here and they&#x27;re just directly copied over from the previous layout that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s this wiener tool tip is not you&#x27;re not changing the dice in previous one so for example if I go back let&#x27;s just click here from in fact Azusa bikinis yeah this is where you mention them so I&#x27;m just gonna read these off again just just so that it&#x27;s clear this is a number of elements obviously agent on this case number of atoms three numbers close actives per molecule knows in the solid state number plus patch put its primal accumulated state and this is a little bit strange here with these factions it&#x27;s unusual but that&#x27;s because of hydrogen bond then we have the number of initial units extrapolated back to zero okay for specifically the liquid and then we have the number of structural groups having internal motion so like vibration per molecule number of liquid thermo goods from all actual number of look at structural groups per molecule number of liquid volume metric units number liquid temperature units number of units and Jamarcus resisting external pressure okay so then if I go back to energy and entropy they&#x27;re already home there okay so that takes care that liquid say what sort of vapor state again you put in the temperature here you know by the way this is a pretty high temperature but it&#x27;s a pretty high pressure that&#x27;s why you can look at some look but suppose you&#x27;re dealing with a vapor temperature for tenant and here we have the vapor pressure calculations answer in this case it&#x27;s two point oh six two and we get enthalpy is this line here and internal energy is just lying here and then entropy its alpha multi-role front ok chopper down okay she upper here it&#x27;s the same thing but it&#x27;s Erica&#x27;s there&#x27;s no nothing but here that I have stated clearly and that vaporization and I compare this with with yours okay sure this right here yeah my energy come from all unavailable energy kinda efficient through that little treacherous anyway I guess that takes care of all of these all right so this is the vapor section here tending clarification so that was some cutting we&#x27;ll use the awesome yeah yeah for this particular number who&#x27;s in the same thing as Yas for the ovulation because we don&#x27;t have that in a reciprocal system I can&#x27;t explain started so now have this string of knives here and this is the same really as on the other skin so let&#x27;s go back to specific key back I just think it&#x27;s important the initial level in terms of natural temperature means for 2d and 3d gas station only this would be two nights if not enter ingest more so it&#x27;s normally two nights therefore i underscore t then we have the numbers thermo groups and gas at the 2d gas initial point point three number of thermal groups and gas just before going to zero through the gas initial point okay this temperature the liquid at the very beginning the transition to gas and this TG to the 0 K this is the time sugar at 2d gas at initial point K when internal motion leaves the stain as soon as the status of a 2d gas then there&#x27;s the program calculates these things but I just want to make sure you understand that at all this has to be calculated in order for us to calculate all the other parameters of the specific heat and on the other layout the energon entropy TJ 2.5 d0 okay this is the temperature intermediate between 2d and 3d gas temperature of 3d gasset initial point k trial motion which is the 3d state okay present calculate soldiers and then here&#x27;s the calculation master method facility very different different methods okay all right well anyway let&#x27;s go back to Energon entropy and here are all the numbers here so I&#x27;m just telling these parameters here all come from the specific heat layer and you don&#x27;t put the temperature K for the real gas 1000 and the pressure and hemisphere is here okay in this case the same 500 we have the AWS regression coefficients for the gas here Deanna comes in from the other screen and then we dark and then we have the calculations cow for milk a jewel from okay cow programs empty internal entropy internal energy excuse me entropy out from all K etcetera here and then these are the corresponding Y values the from the empirical regression equation so they should be pretty close and if you look they are which verifies the theory because we use actual structural parameters to do the calculations non-empirical regression coefficients are cactuses I just want to make that very clear quantum mechanics has no theory of the liquid vapor or gas state and has a hard enough time doing anything with the solid state as well and of course you have the heat sink and heat source just like we do for liquid state up here so then we can actually end out the NWR energy and entropy and you can compare the two so you can see they&#x27;re very very close very nice and on the Delta the change okay and this is if you wanted to set the t can&#x27;t you mean it better sinking the source well let&#x27;s just take the time so that&#x27;s 850 and of course then changes some I changes this up here at 8:50 if you want looking for me I think I&#x27;m gonna read this note here I think it&#x27;s important the real gas volume at the critical temperature and pressure is two-thirds of the ideal gas will have those same conditions it&#x27;s a two details okay to D versus 3d two-thirds also not that in the reciprocal system the liquids was medians constant whereas it is not for the austro-prussian equation estimated saturation climb using an empirical critic in its twenty twenty seven point me to cadence extreme 7.13 kgg regulations interestingly is simple they provide concrete by the reciprocal system for water at the critical temperature and pressures equal to the saturated formed but this is not the case of other vapors and superior theoretical calculation cannot be given presently the Osler desecration does not go to infinity as assured at the freezing point syphilis is in viscosity varies in kitchen viscosity another screencast all right just before leaving us I just want to emphasize this again this is the liquid section here the vapor section here and then the real ideal gas section here so again these are structural parameters for the liquids and these are structural parameters for the gas and let&#x27;s see I think we&#x27;ve covered masteries I know hey I&#x27;m gonna close that now I should point out you know what I&#x27;d like to do now I&#x27;d like to go let&#x27;s just take a look let&#x27;s minimize this well actually that&#x27;s let&#x27;s go to existence interactions computational treatise of reciprocal system to theory of everything let&#x27;s go let&#x27;s go to I just want to show you the paper to next see if I can find this paper as part of the work quickly all right yeah if you really want to understand if you really want to understand this database you need to read this paper in existence and interactions of computational treatise of this cyclical system the two theory of everything I&#x27;m going to just page down just kind of like skim through this paper just to give you an idea of what&#x27;s involved let me just look at the calculations I have graphs of course discuss I mean it&#x27;s just page after page of equations here&#x27;s like the water liquid absolute entropy and that compares with the honest equation it&#x27;s pretty close all right I think that&#x27;s enough for that I just wanted to show you this paper that you know all the calculations are explained in detail in this paper so let&#x27;s get out of this and go back to the database well that wraps it up for today please study the reciprocal system entry good for yourself the simplest possible treatment of the theory is in my very first work in mysterious universe as all the concepts many diagrams it&#x27;s mostly text very little in the way of math but if you do want all the mathematics Springs obtain my work interesting interactions computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything thousands and thousands of equations some 11 pages for the PDFs and so here 11 slides in the PowerPoint file numerous diagrams tables figures everything taking months to go through it then after that then you can get these two database modulus this is the micro cosmos database module this is the macro cosmos a basin project micro cosmos database module covers solid matter properties including atomic distance valence reciprocate and there&#x27;s an entropy thermal expansion compressibility electrical magnetic properties isotopes and Tom expect a good day for gas matter properties covers volume and density specific aid in energy industry which covered today viscosity surface tension next week electrical and thermal conductivity and it also includes cosmic government subatomic particles including material cosmic subatomic particles and of course photon properties over here on this side we have the macrocosmos database which i&#x27;ve covered in screencasts before the universe has a whole galaxy clusters and groups galaxies star clusters stars planets moons minor bodies nebula gas and dust events and voids as a good graphics program so does this microphones most database covers star graphs and general progression gravitation graphs okay now my theoretical physics chimera Dubiel arsenal is also a theoretical economist and i&#x27;ve made its work and economics also fully computational just as i&#x27;ve made us work in physical science for the computational my software program optimal economist and implementation of our sony Nakano physics covers the micro economics of individuals businesses and business sectors and the macro economics of entire regions and countries completely superseded schemes in economics it&#x27;s way way better than the konami she learns not non-college it&#x27;s fully computational doing some screencasts on that probably in the summer sometime so it&#x27;s coming up all right well again please study the reciprocal system and prove it through yourself and as usual thanks for your attention</p>
