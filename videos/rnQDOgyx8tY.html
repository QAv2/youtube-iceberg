            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel this is a channel that is dedicated to educating the public on um new and exciting and old uh and ancient theories of everything um tour to force Magnum opuses um you know uh theories and philosophies that have taken uh Generations that took generations to develop that may be lost to history or losing to history and uh anything else that um could enrich your life if you knew about them if you knew about it and um they could enrich your life in um ma manifold ways um you know because they are uh holistic and all-encompassing theories and today is our 391st video that we have done on the reciprocal system of theory from a man named Dewey B Larson and Mr Larson was born in 1898 in North Dakota and uh became an engineer um moved out to Portland and around 1930 he had some epiphanies about the nature of the universe um while he was working on uh much more mundane uh problems and he um didn&#x27;t quit his day job but at night he uh kept pursuing these more Universal problems uh until 1959 when he put out his two fundamental postulates about how the universe operates um you know the basic uh Constitution and nature of the universe and then um over the course of the last 30 years of his life [Music] he took these two postulates and through a process cess of deduction he um developed a theoretical universe so this was larsson&#x27;s own Universe of how everything um operated and including um you know compiling theoretical data um about all kinds of different empirical qualities that the Universe would have uh such as all of the different uh elements and compounds out there and their basic properties such as their melting points or their boiling points or their compressibility um you know their valences um also the astronom IAL bodies um you know what were their um how far away are they um what are their periods you know um if they are you know something like a pulsar um or if they&#x27;re a planet you know well what are what are their rotation times all of these different um qualities of the universe that have been measured and uh observed and measured and compiled by uh the armies of scientists from years past Larson recreated in his theoretical universe so while uh the scientists were spending um billions and trillions of dollars and um hundreds and thousands of manh hours um putting all of this stuff together over decades and centuries Larson uh did it all himself in his own head with a slide rule on his um armchair or his couch uh you know during the evenings uh while he was uh relaxing or while he was supposed to be relaxing and uh so that is uh interesting and I think should be followed up uh how did how was Mr Larson able to do this well you would think that it must be related to those fundamental postulates he must he must be on to something with those fundamental postulates to be able to deduce the Universe um strictly from Theory and um then you know he wrote books on those on those subjects so uh Larson has written um 12 to 15 books on um mostly The Sciences but he has a couple books on economics and he has one book on metaphysics um and then you know mostly on the uh physics and chemistry and astronomy and um I believe that uh those books are a treasure Trove of um potential investigation that if we understood where Larson was coming from not to say that he got everything right I believe that his theory is correct uh whether he was able to uh plug his theory in correctly in all situations um he admitted that that was a different question and that he may have made some mistakes along the way but he also uh believed that those mistakes would be corrected eventually by other people um who were also up to date on his theory and they would recognize various inconsistencies and the um you know when you have a when you have a generalized Theory when you have a complete holistic theory about things then the mistakes will eventually become apparent and um I think that&#x27;s happened Larson died in 1990 and uh since his death of and even even toward the end of his life a few of his um you know a few of his conclusions have been altered uh particularly uh having to do with a photon having to do with electric and magnetic charges having to do with the geometry of the universe and um you know some other things uh symbolism and I believe that uh you know Larson would have embraced uh these findings had they been presented to him um in a manner that was convincing he wasn&#x27;t uh clinging to his uh you know his interpretation he recognized that he was one person and that he was um you know doing the job of an army of scientists and therefore wasn&#x27;t going to be able to complete the job and so I think he would have welcomed uh any type of uh people that were as long as they understood the theory you know as long as they understood the theory and understood how to apply it then I think he would have embraced those changes is now I guess uh from here we just want to go uh over the uh two fundamental postulates and see where we&#x27;re starting from um the vast majority of the work is done with the first postulate the second postulate is just uh outlining the math and geometry of the universe second postulate is uh just that uh the universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian um a number of uh Larson&#x27;s followers have uh taken a issue with that second postulate um particular the ukian G geometry part and the commutative mathematics part and the primary magn uh magnitudes part um and so um you know that&#x27;s uh something that I think is is going going to be you know hashed out over the years but that uh uh Dr Bruce pet I think has convinced me that uh Larson&#x27;s ukian geometry is only part of the story and uh paret proposes uh what he calls projective geometry or not just it&#x27;s not just he that calls it U that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called by uh the people that have discovered it and so on it goes back goes back way way back um even to ancient times uh but especially to the uh 16th and 17th centuries uh Gerard desar and um a number of uh other mathematicians since him in the uh 16th century but especially in the uh 19th and 20th Century a projective geometry evolved and um pet pointed at this uh Cascade geometrical Cascade uh where we move from projective geometry to aine Geometry to metric geometry and then finally to ukian Geometry so ukian geometry is a subset of projective geometry so Larson wasn&#x27;t necessarily wrong but just not inclusive enough in his understanding of the geometry of the universe uh according to pret and in my opinion but I&#x27;m no expert I&#x27;m just kind of trying to weigh it out I could change my mind uh wouldn&#x27;t take that much evidence to do it and um but now if we look at the first postulate the universe is composed of one component is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so that&#x27;s why he calls it the reciprocal system because the universe is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time which sets up a a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time and so um you know that&#x27;s kind of what we&#x27;re looking at now um when Mo when Larson is talking about motion what he&#x27;s really referring to is what he calls a scaler motion this is not uh when you you know talk to a scientist or whatever this wouldn&#x27;t be the uh understanding that they would glean from the term motion normally motion is thought of as a vectorial motion a motion that has a magnitude but it also has a direction you know the car is moving 15 miles south by Southeast 15 miles per hour south by Southeast and uh a scalar motion is a motion that has that magnitude ude but it has no specific Direction and um you can Envision the scalar motion using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction every dot is moving away from every other Dot and in fact even the locations between the dots are also moving away from each other every location on the surface of that balloon is moving away from every other location but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction the only way that you&#x27;re going to get specific directions out of it is if you arbitrarily decide that one of these points one of these dots is going to be the reference point and once you make one of them the reference point and say that this particular dot we will we will assume that this dot is motionless once you once you kind of stop the universe that way by saying okay we&#x27;re stopping right here this one&#x27;s not moving um then you can determine the directions for all of the other dots um so that is uh basically meaning that the directions are not um an aspect of the motion but they are an aspect of the reference point so it&#x27;s you&#x27;re making the reference point that is creating the directional uh aspect of the motion otherwise we have a scalar motion everything is moving away from everything else that is the motion upon which Larson builds his his universe so the universe is made out of scalar motion and uh motion the which is the relationship between space and time and uh so motion is basically a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator all of our scientific entities are motions such as speed speed is space over time the bicycle&#x27;s moving 15 miles hour 15 miles of space and 1 hour of time um but also energy energy is time over space it took me 3 hours to move that thing a half a mile 3 hours of time half an hour of space or half a mile of space um and then we have all of our other scientific quantities including matter and force and acceleration and electric charge and magnetic flux and cap electrical capacitance and viscosity and fluidity and power and temperature and pressure all are relationships between space and time time and space as reciprocals um just like any other reciprocals they uh have identical qualities but they are um in reverse order um time and space Also do not exist independently they only exist together in motion and um they both have a a three-dimensional aspect to them uh which is somewhat of a fiction uh that Larson calls coordinate time and coordinate space [Music] um uh kind of when you are in a a gravitational system then uh time and space appear to be three-dimensional and stationary just like we observe space um as Xyz coordinates or volume um in a um situation where time is always getting later and later and later time is getting later and later and later in no specific direction that is a scalar motion um but the space um is coordinate uh it&#x27;s a still frame and um because of the reciprocal postulate we can also extrapolate and say that time has the same qualities um and space has the same quality so that time also is got a three-dimensional aspect coordinate time and that space is also uh progressing meaning it is get in not getting later and later and later but getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no specific Direction dire and then also that space and time uh come in only discrete units you have to have a full unit of space or time before you have anything um space and time are quantized there is a Quantum of space and time and motion and if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have your Quantum of motion you have the speed of light the speed of light is what Larson refers to as unit speed 1 over 1 equal one and unit speed is the background of this reciprocal uh system universe that Larson has originated um that this is the background the null point the neutral point the zero point the origin The Ether the the reference point of this universe so if you have a an entirely Universe of nothing uh in L you have nothing in in larsson&#x27;s reciprocal Universe you still have the outward motion at the speed of light in all directions so that is the background uh omnipresent all always existing um motion of the universe and uh so that is your reciprocal one uh one is always in a reciprocal system it&#x27;s at the center and then it&#x27;s balanced out on either side so one is at the center and then in the positive direction you go 2 3 4 5 in the negative Direction you go 1/2 1/3 1/4th 1/ 15th so um in the same way the unit speed is the center and half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light Larson refers to these as the cosmic sector and the material sector respectively and you can see that they&#x27;re reciprocals because in the material sector the sector that we&#x27;re accustomed to um we have coordinate space and clock time three dimensions of space uh appearing to be be stationary uh and um time is always getting later and later and later but if we cross that boundary and move into the cosmic sector then we have three dimensions of time uh stationary and we have clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart so the uh relations are identical except that space and time um uh take on um the opposite roles you switch the roles of space and time whether you&#x27;re in the cosmic sector or the material sector okay now uh today we&#x27;re going to finish up this article that is uh called science without apologies that Larson gave a talk as a talk in 1979 and he first went over the article in the first part of the the article he talks about how science uh has not fulfilled its Mission even though it&#x27;s got some great successes um it does not have a generalized Theory it&#x27;s a hodg Podge a patchwork of all kinds of different theories depending on what subject you&#x27;re talking about that don&#x27;t fit together very well and uh he shows how his theory is a generalized Theory and is really the answer to their their dreams to be able to have a holistic Theory to be able to see the whole picture and uh but unfortunately it requires the scientists to make so many adjustments um that they&#x27;re not comfortable with that and so they&#x27;re going to be they end up rejecting larsson&#x27;s theory if they ever hear it in the first place um but he goes over some of the highlights of his reciprocal system and shows that it is um a science without apologies that the science that Larsson proposes does not have to you do not have to apologize for it not being complete you don&#x27;t have to apologize for you not understanding all the various aspects it is um fully you know um complete in and of itself and it just needs to be fleshed out okay so we&#x27;re going to start here uh he had just gotten done U kind of identifying the nature of matter and uh how that there are going to be 117 different elements seven um sub atoms and um then they&#x27;re also going to be the reciprocal aspects of those in the cosmic sector identification of the inverse unit is facilitated by recognition of the fact that the properties of the units are also inverse for example if one of the normal double units has mass m the reciprocal unit has mass 1 over M for reasons which are not quite so obvious the life of those inverse or reciprocal units is very short in an environment in which the normal units predominate with the benefits of this information we are now able to identify the different basic forms of matter all of which are rotating combinations of motions the 17 double units of the normal type are the atoms of the chemical elements the seven single units are the subatomic particles the 117 inverse w units are the transient particles known by such names as msons the seven inverse single units are what is known as antiparticles of course these conclusions are in direct conflict with current ideas as to the structure of atoms of matter but it should be realized that all justification for the concept of an atom composed of smaller particles of matter was eliminated by the discovery that matter can be transformed into non-matter and vice versa this observed fact shows conclusively as Heisenberg and others have recognized that the simplest unit of matter is composed of some other entity an entity we have now identified as motion it then follows that there is no longer any justification ation for inventing particles of matter from which to construct an atom or what amounts to the same thing inventing hypothetical properties for existing particles to enable them to meet the requirements since there are no observable units of matter from which atoms can be constructed without giving them a new ad hoc set of properties The Logical conclusion from the empirical evidence is the same as that which we derive from the reciprocal system of theory that is the atoms the subatomic particles and the transient particles are all basic units of matter composed not of smaller particles of matter but of units of motion the scope of a general theory of the universe of the physical universe is so immense that it is not possible to cover more than a very small portion of the whole in a short overview such as this but I have shown how the reciprocal system of theory overcomes two of the shortcomings of conventional physical science for which apologies are currently being made the reciprocal system is a general physical Theory and it does provide simple and logical explanations for the basic physical phenomena that have here to for been so difficult to understand all right that is the end of that article and um you know there were some difficult Parts in there um especially in yesterday&#x27;s episode um so you may benefit from uh going over that article a couple times um but otherwise you know just let it roll off you um don&#x27;t get discouraged by some of the abstract uh complexity and um I would also recommend that you not reject anything that he says uh because it flies in the face of some other uh fact that you&#x27;ve heard I would just suspend disbelief let him have his hearing let him uh air out what he&#x27;s trying to say and then uh later you can reject it if it doesn&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny but um don&#x27;t reject Larson out of hand uh as so many other people that I&#x27;ve uh spoken with have done um you have to take him seriously he&#x27;s a serious person he was a serious person and a serious scientist and he&#x27;s being um I believe um you know honest when he&#x27;s proposing this Theory he&#x27;s not a charlatan I don&#x27;t believe and so uh he deserves a hearing and uh then you can once you are able to kind of see the whole picture because uh that&#x27;s the thing with Larson sometimes it seems like he&#x27;s uh just pulling stuff out of nowhere and you&#x27;re wondering where this oh oh he just came up with that because it it um you know solves this problem that he&#x27;s talking about but then you read another one of his books and he&#x27;s using the same uh you know the same way to solve the problem in a different in an entirely different field he is very consistent with his approach and um you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of hard to believe that he can use the same approach with um Adam&#x27;s as he does with galaxies as he does with um you know some type of uh you know memory or or or thinking um if he&#x27;s not on to something so that&#x27;s just what I would say is you know keep track of larsson&#x27;s whole Theory and then uh later on you can evaluate it um once you&#x27;ve given him a chance to speak his uh his case okay tomorrow I think we&#x27;re going to get go back into a new article uh this one I believe we&#x27;re going to try to do this one that&#x27;s called the fundamentals of Science in the 21st century and this is a talk that Larson gave way back in 1978 so he&#x27;s predicting how things are going to be in uh I guess the time period that we&#x27;re in now so uh maybe this will be interesting so so come back tomorrow and check it out uh thanks for tuning in today and have</p>
