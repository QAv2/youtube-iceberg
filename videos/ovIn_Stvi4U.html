            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel this channel is for educational purposes and on this channel we take a look at uh different great theories of everything uh all-encompassing theories uh things that you can um you know build your Paradigm around uh help you with your holistic worldview and your Awakening to 5D Consciousness uh today&#x27;s our 487th video on the reciprocal system of theory from dwey B Larsson and if you&#x27;d like to get a more thorough rundown about the reciprocal system uh before you watch this video you can go and watch any of my first 474 videos that I did on this topic um where I go into a a little bit of depth about the reciprocal system but uh today we&#x27;re just going to start right up um kind of assuming that you understand a little bit about the reciprocal system because um otherwise I don&#x27;t really uh get the too much of the reading done uh we&#x27;re reading uh directly from one of larsson&#x27;s books um today we&#x27;re reading from his 1987 book basic properties of matter basically what Larson did is in 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how the universe operated then through a process of deduction he elaborated his postulates into a theoretical Universe what his Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then he Compares his theoretical Universe with the measured universe of the uh so-called scientists uh Legacy scientists out there and uh you know that they have uh you know put together in their laboratory experiments and compiled in their scientific tables and he does that uh with the field of chemistry with the um book basic properties of matter we&#x27;re uh in chapter 12 now on scalar motion which is a fundamental um Larson is uh um you know one of the few scientists to propose a universe based on motion a universe made out of motion not matter not energy but motion and in particular when Larson refers to motion he&#x27;s referring to scalar motion that is the substance of the universe the source of everything else and uh so in this chapter chapter 12 he goes over um you know the qualities and the uh evidence of the scal of scaler motion we started this chapter yesterday and so you might want to go back and watch the first part of this um but we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll get into the second part here uh momentarily um yeah so um I think you know maybe we have uh summed it up enough just uh if you want to get into kind of the more the ins and outs of the reciprocal system um just watch one of those first 474 videos I&#x27;ll just say here first of all that we&#x27;re looking here at uh larsson&#x27;s book on chemistry but Larson&#x27;s is a general theory it plugs into every subject so if you understand how it operates in the field of chemistry that gives you a leg up on understanding how it operates in astronomy or in economics or in uh metaphysics um he uh attempts to apply his theory to all subjects and uh he ran out of time because he died at the age of 92 in in 1990 and um so maybe he uh wasn&#x27;t able to apply to every subject but some of his followers have applied it into F further Fields meteorology geology um crypto history um and uh uh we&#x27;ll see what other people come up with but Larson&#x27;s theory is a generalized Theory so you know just what uh the fact that we&#x27;re talking about chemistry you know don&#x27;t think oh well I don&#x27;t really care about chemistry uh no think about it in terms of analogies and that okay uh this is kind of a baseline about how you how you work with the reciprocal system uh which gives me guidelines to how I can use it in whatever subject I want to apply it to okay okay taking over here in chapter 12 um about halfway through the present day field like an electric field or gravitational field or magnetic field the present day field is just as intangible as in Einstein&#x27;s space there there&#x27;s no physical evidence of its existence all that we know is that if a test object of an appropriate type is placed within a certain region it experiences a force whose magnitude can be correlated with the distance to the location of the originating object what existed before the test object was introduced is wholly speculative Faraday&#x27;s hypothesis was that the field is a condition of stress in The Ether present day physicists have transferred the stress to space in order to be able to discard The Ether a change that has little identifiable meaning as RH dick puts it quote one suspects that with empty space having so many properties all that has been accomplished all that had been accomplished in destroying The Ether was a semantic trick The Ether had been renamed the vacuum end quote uh PW Bridgeman who reviewed this situation in considerable detail arrived at a similar conclusion the results of analysis he says quote suggest that the role played by the field concept is added of an intellectual dummy which cancels out of the final results the theory of the universe of motion gives us a totally different view of this situation in this universe the reality is motion space and time have a real existence only where um and to uh the extent wait let&#x27;s see space and time have a real existence only where and to the extent that they actually exist as components of motion on this basis extension space the space that is represented by the conventional reference system is no more than a frame of reference for the spatial magnitudes and directions of the entity motion that actually exists it follows that extension space cannot have any physical properties it cannot be curved or modified in any other way by physical means of course the reference system being nothing but a human contrivance could be altered conceptually but such a change would have no physical significance the status of extension space as a purely mental concept devised for the for reference purposes right rather than a physical entity likewise means that this space is not a container or background for the physical activity of the universe as assumed by conventional science in that conventional view everything physically real is contained within the space and time of the spacial temporal reference system when it it becomes necessary to postulate something outside these limits in order to meet the demands of theory construction it is assumed that such phenomena are in some way unreal as verer Heisenberg puts it they do not exist objectively in the same sense as stones or trees exist end quote the development of the theory of the Universe of motion now shows that the conventional spacio temporal system of reference does not contain everything that is physically real on the contrary it is an incomplete system that is not capable of representing the full range of motions which exist in the physical Universe it cannot represent Motion in more than one scalar Dimension it cannot represent a scalar system in which all elements are moving nor can it correctly represent the position of an individual object that is moving in all directions simultaneously that is an object whose motion is scalar and therefore has no specific Direction many of the other shortcomings of this reference system will not become apparent until we examine the effects of very highspeed motion in volume three U but that&#x27;s his that&#x27;s his book on astronomy Universe of motion but those that have been mentioned have a significant impact on the phenomena that we are now examining the inability to represent more than one dimension of scalar motion is a particularly serious deficiency in as much as the postulated three-dimensionality of the universe of motion necessarily permits the existence of three dimensions of motion only one dimension of motion only one dimension of vectorial motion is possible because all three dimensions of space are required in order to represent the directions of this onedimensional motion but scalar motion has magnitude only and a three-dimensional Universe can accom accommodate scalar Motion in all three of its Dimensions since the conventional reference system cannot represent all of the distributed scal motions and present day science does not recognize the existence of any motion that cannot be represented in that system it has been necessary for the theorists to make some arbitrary assumptions as a means of compensating for the Distortion of the physical picture due to this deficiency of the reference system one of the principal steps taken in this direction is the introduction of the concept of fundamental forces autonomous entities that exist in their own right and not as properties of something more basic the present tendency is to regard these so-called fundamental forces as the sources of all physical activity and the currently popular goal of the theoretical physicist the formulation of a grand unified theory is limited to finding a common denominator of these forces gravitation is in a way an exception as the currently popular hypothesis as to the nature of the gravitational force a as gravitation is in a way an exception as the currently popular hypothesis as to the nature of the gravitational force Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity does attempt an explanation of its origin according to this Theory the gravitational force is due to a distortion of space resulting from the presence of matter so far as can be determined from the scientific literature no one has the slightest idea as to how such a distortion of space could be accomplished Arthur Edington expressed the casual attitude of the scientific Community toward this issue in the following statement quote we do not ask how Mass gets a grip on SpaceTime and causes the curvature which our Theory postulates end quote but unless the question is asked the answer is not forthcoming in Newton&#x27;s Theory the gravitational force originates from Mass in a totally unexplained manner in Einstein&#x27;s theory it is a result of a distortion or a curvature of space that is produced by mass in a totally unexplained manner thus whatever its other merits may be the correct Theory uh sorry the current theory general relativity accomplishes no more toward accounting for the origin of the gravitational force than its predecessor in order to arrive at such an explanation we need to recognize that force is not an autonomous entity it is a property of motion the motion of an individual mass unit is measured in terms of speed or velocity the total amount of motion in a material aggregate is then the product of the speed and the number of mass units a quantity formerly called quantity of motion but now known as momentum the rate of change of the motion of the individual unit is acceleration that of the total quantity of motion is force the force is thus the total quantity of acceleration the significance of this in the present connection is that force not only produces an acceleration when applied to a mass a fact that is currently recognized it is an acceleration prior to that application a fact that is currently overlooked or disregarded in other words the acceleration is simply transferred for example when when a rocket is fired the total quantity of acceleration available for application to the rocket the force is the sum of the quantities of acceleration of the individual particles of the gas produced from the propellant the division of this total quantity among the mass units of the rocket determines the acceleration of each individual unit and therefore of the rocket as a whole since force is a property of motion rather than an autonomous entity it follows that whenever there is a force there must also be a motion of which the force is a property this leads to the conclusion that a gravitational force field is a region of space in which gravitational motions exist in the context of conventional physical thought this conclusion is unacceptable since there are no moving entities in an occupied field the information about the nature of scalar motion developed in the earlier Pages clarifies this situation A material aggregate is moving gravitationally in all directions but the conventional spatial reference system is unable to represent a system of motions of this nature in its true character as previously indicated where the scalar motion AB of object a the massive object now under consideration toward object B the test Mass cannot be represented in the reference system because of the limitations of that system the this motion AB is shown as a motion ba that is a motion of the test Mass B toward the massive object a constituting an addition to the actual motion of that test Mass because of the spherical distribution of the scalar motions of the atoms of mass a the magnitude of the motion imputed to mass B depends on its distance from a and is inversely proportional to the square of that distance thus each point in the region surrounding a corresponds to a specific fraction of the motion of a representing the amount of motion that would be imputed to a unit Mass if that mass actually is actually placed at this particular point Point here then is the explanation of the gravitational field and by extension all other fields of the same nature the field is not something physically real in the space quote for the modern physicist as real as the chair on which he sits end quote as asserted by Einstein nor is it as Faraday surmised a stress in The Ether neither is it some kind of change in the properties of space as envisioned by present day theorists it is simply the pattern of the magnitudes of the Motions of one mass that have to be imputed to other masses because of the inability of the reference system to represent scalar motion as it actually exists no doubt this assertion that what appears to be a motion of one object is actually in large part a motion of a different object is somewhat confusing to those who are accustomed to Conventional ideas about motion but once it is realized that scalar motion exists and because it has no inherent Direction it may be distributed over all directions it is evident that the reference system can not represent this Motion in its true character in the proceeding analysis we have determined just how the reference system does represent this motion that it cannot represent correctly this may appear to be a return to the action at a distance that is so distasteful to most scientists but in fact the apparent motion distant objects is an illusion created by the introduction of the concept of autonomous forces to compensate for the shortcomings of the reference system if the reference system were capable of representing all of the scalar motions in their true character there would be no problem each Mass would then be seen to be pursuing its own course moving inward in space independently of other objects in this case accepted scientific theory has gone wrong because Prejudice supported by abstract theory has been allowed to override the results of physical observations The Observers keep calling attention to the absence of evidence of the finite propagation time that current theory ascribes to the gravitational effect as in this extract from a news report of a conference at which the subject was discussed quote when it the distance is astronomical the difficulty arises that the intermediaries need a measurable time to cross while the forces in fact seem to appear instantaneously end quote but it is assumed that we must accept either a finite propagation time or action at a distance which as brid Bridgeman once said quote is a concept to which many physicists have a violent allergy Einstein&#x27;s theory which supports the prop uh propagation hypothesis has therefore been accorded a status superior to the observations the following statement from a physicist brings this point out explicitly quote nowadays we are able sorry nowadays we are also convinced that gravitation progresses with the speed of light this conviction however does not stem from a new experiment or a new observation it is a result solely of the theory of relativity end quote this is another example of a practice that has been subject the subject of crucial comment critical comment in several different Connections in the preceding pages of this and the earlier volume overconfidence in the existing body of scientific knowledge has led the investigators to assume that all Alternatives in a given situation have been considered is then concluded that an obviously flawed hypothesis must be accepted in spite of its shortcomings because there is no other way time it again in the earlier Pages development of the theory of the universe of motion has shown that there is another way one that is free from objectionable features so it is in this case it is not necessary either to cont contradict observation by assuming a finite speed of propagation or to accept action at a distance some of the most significant consequences of the existance of scalar motion are related to its Dimensions this term is used in several different senses uh two of which are utilized extensively in this work when physical quantities are resolved into component quantities of a fundamental nature these component quantities are called Dimensions identification of the dimensions in this sense of the basic physical quantities has been an important feature of the development of theory in the preceding pages in a different sense of the term it is generally recognized that space is threedimensional conventional physics recognizes Motion in threedimensional space and represents motions of this Nature by lines in a three-dimensional spatial coordinate system but these motions which exist in three dimensions of space are only onedimensional motions each individual motion of this kind can be characterized by a vector and the resultant of any number of these vectors is a onedimensional motion defined by the vector sum all three dimensions of the spatial reference system are required for the representation of onedimensional motion and there is no way by which this system can indicate a change of position in any other dimension however the postulate that the Universe of motion is three-dimensional carries with it the existence of three dimensions of motion thus there are two dimensions of motion in the physical universe that cannot be represented in the conventional spatial reference system in common usage the word Dimension is taken to mean spatial dimensions and reference to these dimensions is ordinarily interpreted geometrically it should be realized however that the geometric pattern is merely a graphical representation of the relevant physical magnitudes and directions from the mathematical standpoint an n-dimensional quantity is one that requires n independent magnitudes for a complete definition thus a scale Motion in three dimensions the maximum in a three-dimensional universe is defined in terms of three independent magnitudes one of these magnitudes that is the magnitude of one of the dimensions of scalar motion can be further divided dimensionally by the introduction of directions relative to a spatial reference system this expedient resolves the one diim di menion scalar magnitude into three orthogonally related subm magnitudes which together with the directions constitute vectors but no more than one of the three scalar magnitudes that Define a three dimensional scalar motion can be subdivided vectorially in this manner here is a place where recognition of the existence of scalar motion changes the physical picture radically as long as motion is viewed entirely in vectorial terms that is as a change of position relative to the spatial reference system there can be no motion other than that represented in that system but since scalar motion has magnitude only there can be motion of this character in all three of the existing dimensions of the physical universe it should be emphasized that these dimensions of scalar motion are mathematical Dimensions they can be represented geometrically only in part because of the limitations of the geometrical representation in order to distinguish these mathematical dimensions of motion from the geometric dimensions of space in which one dimension of the the motion takes place we are using the term scalar dimension in a manner analogous to the use of the term scalar Direction in the earlier pages of this and the preceding volume okay that seems a little abrupt but that is the end of the chapter uh chapter 12 on scalar motion and if you really want to uh learn the reciprocal system system I&#x27;d say that that is a crucial chapter uh to uh ground your understanding in that as Larsson is when he talks about a universe of motion he is talking about a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude that has no Direction no specific Direction just like uh if you took a balloon and you put dots on it blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from one another but they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction every dot is moving away from every other Dot and so too if you suck in the balloon and contract it they will all be moving toward each other that outward motion of the balloon is what Larsson calls the progression and the inward motion of the balloon is analogous to gravitation and manifestation in in the universe is to take that source that empty Universe the omnipresent and um Eternal force of the progression that is always there at all times in all places and roll it back roll back that uh outward motion harness it roll it back until it becomes gravitation uh which is matter okay uh so and then which can become Aggregates of matter and Galaxy planets and galaxies and so on so that is you know the fundamental thing that you got to get started with the reciprocal system you start with the scalar motion it&#x27;s the progression uh calls it the progression of the natural reference system the natural reference system U implying that this goes beyond the spatial reference system and beyond a temporal reference system and you roll that back to manifest so um and then the other key thing to keep in mind with the reciprocal system is that motion is the relationship between space and time space and time have no other significance other than um their relationship in motion and that is a reciprocal relationship um motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator but they come in one two or three dimensions all right have</p>
