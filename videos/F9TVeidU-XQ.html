            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>a couple weeks ago I showed how to decompose a 3D PGA B Vector into simple commuting bi vectors but what about the inverse problem decomposing a 3D PGA rotor into simple commuting rotors each 3D PGA rotor can be written as the product of two simple commuting factors R1 and R2 where R1 is a rotation and R2 is a translation to find R1 and R2 we can use the idea from last week&#x27;s short writing R1 and R2 in terms of generalized cosiness and SS notice that if we take the bi Vector part of R and divide by the scalar part of R the result is the sum of the generalized tangents of B1 and B2 let&#x27;s call this B Vector T because T is a bi Vector we can use the decomposition formula from a couple weeks ago to find the generalized tangent of B2 this expression actually simplifies a bit as well because T of B2 squares to zero adding one to it already makes it normalized so this is R2 and then R1 is just R / R2</p>
