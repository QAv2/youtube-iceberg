            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this channel is for educational purposes and um today is our 345th video on the reciprocal system of theory which was originally devised by dwey B Larsson uh and he did a lot of uh talks a lot of papers a lot of books um while he was alive he died back in 1990 and uh since then the mantle has passed to um some of his followers uh we&#x27;re going to look at one of those followers today Dr Bruce paret uh who also recently passed away but um he did some great work in um kind of staying within the spirit of dwey Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system but also um kind of modernizing it and uh just um you know just kind of debugging it uh making it uh work a little bit better and um we&#x27;re looking at his paper here that is called um the re-evaluation Dr Bruce pet and Dr kbk neru um have gone in together on what call rs2 the reciprocal system 2 the re-evaluation of dwey larsson&#x27;s reciprocal system and so um you know uh we are going to look at some of the major uh you know what he what he describes as how how he re-evaluated the reciprocal system and what he&#x27;s putting it putting into it now now uh the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe of motion and um other people have come up with that before such as dayart and Hobs Edington and others but uh I think Larson distinguished himself by defining his motion as the relationship between space and time he also uh okay so that basically um makes time and space reciprocals of one another uh time and space do not exist separately they only exist together in motion you can think of motion as a fraction uh with space or time as the numerator time or space as the denominator such as speed speed is our most basic idea of motion and speed is space divided by time the bicycle is moving 15 miles an hour 15 miles of space in one hour of time space over time speed and uh another thing about speed is that it is a scaler um meaning that it does not have any um any units of uh any direction involved so um that&#x27;s what Larson calls a scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but no specific Direction and um even though scalar motion is known in science it is not appreciated for being a not only a different but a different Motion in kind and also more fundamental motion uh that precedes our vectorial motion you can see that in a balloon that you put dots on with a magic marker or something if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other and um but they are not moving in any specific Direction so you just have all of the dots are moving away from all of the other dots and in fact even the uh even the places on the balloon where are there are not dots those are also moving away from all of the other uh points or non-points on the surface of that balloon the balloon itself is uh expanding so all of the points on the balloon are expanding away from all the other ones and all the locations on the balloon are expanding from all the other ones uh but there&#x27;s no specific motion I mean no specific Direction uh that&#x27;s involved in this now you get the specific direction as soon as you define a reference point as soon as you determine that one of these dots is stationary we&#x27;re going to say this one is stationary arbitrarily uh then you can start determining the directions you could say okay well this dot uh compared to the stationary dot we have this dot is moving North and this dot is moving uh you know West by Southwest or what whatever and um so it&#x27;s not the uh motion itself that has a direction it is the coupling of the motion with a reference system that has the direction so the reference system adheres to the direction adheres to the reference system not to the motion itself uh lson actually calls this clock time and clock space the clock is another form of scalar motion it&#x27;s a uh the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but in no specific Direction and uh so that would be clock time clock space is that everything is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and um this was also uh seen by the Hubble telescope all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and so as long as we uh don&#x27;t uh succumb to the thinking that our galaxy is at the center and it&#x27;s motionless um our galaxy is also participating in this Galactic recession that&#x27;s a scalar motion so um now again I was saying that time and space both have the same general qualities um so they both both have this clock aspect they also both have what Larson calls coordinate aspect coordinate time coordinate space coordinate space we&#x27;re comfortable with that idea that space has three or maybe four dimensions uh XYZ coordinates or WXYZ coordinates um if you&#x27;re using tetrahedral coordinates um and um you know we&#x27;re comfortable with that idea but then there is also coordinate time three dimensions of time which is um a foreign concept to Legacy scientists that they reject and uh in addition to the coordinate space and coordinate time we also have um the quantum uh space and time are both quantum ized meaning that they have a minimum unit there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have anything you have to have a full unit before you have anything if you have one full unit of space in one full unit of time space over time then you have the speed of light the speed of light is 1 over one equals 1 Al Larson refers to this as unit speed and unit speed is really the center of this universe of motion which makes sense it&#x27;s a universe of motion so motion is there before everything else is there motion is at the center of a universe of motion the speed of light outward in all directions that&#x27;s what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system and so he makes his measurements from that um you know are you going faster than the speed of light or slower than the speed of light outward if you&#x27;re going faster than the speed of light he calls that the cosmic sector and if you&#x27;re going slower he calls it the material sector and so this material sector is the only one of the two sectors that Legacy science understands uh because of Einstein Einstein&#x27;s dictum that speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe so he is uh eliminating the entire Cosmic sector from his consideration by saying that and um but he we&#x27;re not losing out too much because whatever is going on in the cosmic sector is exactly the same as what&#x27;s going on in the material sector except that they are reciprocals of one another and so you have to invert the roles of space and time so in the material sector you have coordinate space and clock time in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and clock space okay so um that is somewhat how the reciprocal system works Larson that that&#x27;s basically going through larsson&#x27;s first postulate and uh he has two fundamental postulates that he came out with uh in the late 1950s um his second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its um primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian we will see how Dr pet takes uh handles these two fundamental postulates in this paper but um what Larson did is is that he took those two fundamental postulates and he went through a process of deduction of okay if these postulates are true then what else can we say is true what follows from these postulates and he uh basically went through 165 steps what he calls the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system uh and I did about 15 videos on this um many many months ago uh about 10 months ago so if you um want to go into the archives you can watch those as well um but so he eventually arrived at a theoretical Universe of okay if the Pates are correct what kind of a universe specifically what kind of a universe does that does that create and then he eventually compared his Universe with the universe that the that the Legacy scientists had already observed and measured and um you know claim exists and uh those are some interesting studies most of the time uh they arrived at identical universes but uh in kind of the relativistic areas the areas that uh Newton kind of got wrong um not wrong but just not uh not precis enough um that Einstein you know so-called corrected from Newton those were the same areas that Larson um diverged from Newton as well but Larson would usually uh have a better uh explanation and especially conceptually than Einstein would Einstein was using kind of borrowed mathematics and he didn&#x27;t have uh the detailed Concepts um conceptual understanding of what was going on um so uh we have seen that in some of the other um other um studies here on the reciprocal system that we&#x27;ve done and we will see more of that but let&#x27;s get right into um this article from Bo pet uh RS RS 2103 the re-evaluation now we&#x27;ve gone through the first half of this in the last video so you might want to go back and check out the first half um and uh we&#x27;re at this stage uh Larson was uh or paret was basically uh explaining what he was using to kind of update the reciprocal system and a lot of it was kind of new technology that Lars didn&#x27;t know about when he was writing his stuff up you know 60 years ago uh which includes uh the com concepts of uh quitan and um complex mathematics those things existed but they&#x27;ve been refined since then but also projective geometry which is really kind of um something that has a long history goes back all the way to you know be DC times or at least to papis and but uh and was refined a lot during the uh you know early modern period by a lot of French guys um but uh it&#x27;s now being used a lot for computer Imaging and uh how you know they use pre projective geometry to create very lifelike uh computer images strictly from um bits so um pet attempts to kind of apply these ideas to uh the reciprocal system so this section is called one giant leap for Larson kind it is obvious that the biological realm documented in larsson&#x27;s book beyond space and time is composed of the same stuff everything else is made of so why did Larson need to define metaphysical postulates now I didn&#x27;t mention Larson has four metaphysical postulates that he had to add on for his final book beyond space and time uh the two fundamental postulates worked for uh the inanimate universe but when he started applying it to kind of Life uh phenomena and mental phenomena uh they didn&#x27;t work and he had to Define four new postulates and so um that uh for pet is somewhat of a red flag and he goes after it here okay so studies in the biological Realm by Nick Thomas show that the geometrical geometric relations are not ukan in nature as you find in the inanimate realm but a fine um that&#x27;s a type of geometry aine AF i n aine geometry they appear as a scalar recursion some of the geometric assumptions made by uid do not hold true in living forms this is because the type of motion is different Larson&#x27;s postulates Define the inanimate realm where you have Motion in either space or time when it comes to the animate the living realm a new kind of motion is introduced a motion that is between space and time which Larson calls a life unit for Larson the life unit was a combination of a material and Cosmic uh Cosmic units um now normally normally when material and Cosmic units are you know they interfere with each other they annihilate each other um Cosmic atoms are also known as antimatter um so a matter antimatter Collision usually causes annihilation of both but when they combine at the proper angle and in the proper proportions then that explosion turns into an explosion of life and the life unit is formed so this is how Larson deals with uh life phenomena and so paret is saying here that okay when we&#x27;re in the inanimate realm you know we&#x27;re in either space or time either the cosmic sector or the material sector but when we&#x27;re using life units then we&#x27;re talking about both of them at the same time and so he&#x27;s saying that there&#x27;s a different kind of of geometry that&#x27;s needed for that by using the tool of projective geometry we can now clearly identify that the level one inanimate realm of larsson&#x27;s postulates is in the ukian geometric stratum the level two biologic realm life is in the affine geometric stratum and larsson&#x27;s scalar motion or SpaceTime sits clearly in or cleanly in the projective stratum now there&#x27;s a basic a geometrical Cascade here that he doesn&#x27;t really mention um and it goes from uh its most generalized projective geometry to aine Geometry to metric geometry to ukian Geometry ometry and Metric geometry is the basically the geometry that you would get if you closed one eye if you close one eye and you&#x27;re only seeing with one eye then you&#x27;re in this metric world where um you can you can uh you cannot tell size um you can see one thing is bigger than another thing but you can&#x27;t Det determine the general scale of something uh because you&#x27;re not using any type of stereoscopic vision um that&#x27;s probably not a very good explanation but um but that&#x27;s basically you know I&#x27;m not fully clear on both metric geometry and defined geometry or projective for that matter I&#x27;ve dabbled in these things okay uh sits cleanly in the projective stratum prior to geometric assumptions so once you start making more and more assumptions you start moving further down the stratum um into aine then metric and then um ukian there may be other geometries that are also in this um in these in this stratum uh in this Cascade um but he doesn&#x27;t identify fibos all that is required to make Larson&#x27;s original postulates function in the biological realm is to acknowledge the different strata of geometry each having applicability to a particular level of existence as Larsson calls them in beyond space and time his book his final book larsson&#x27;s level three ethical realm uh becomes a consequence of the stratification of geometry defined by projective geometry now Larson&#x27;s ethical realm goes even Beyond life so once you have life life is basically a control um o over the material and then uh there&#x27;s another level of control uh that you get from life that comes out of life uh which is you know uh the control of life um Larsson refers to this as the ethical realm so this is uh you know once you&#x27;re beyond thinking and memory um and you&#x27;re beginning to control your memory and your thinking um and being able to make decisions that are based on um maybe something beyond beyond your um body okay so ethical realm becomes a consequence of the stratification of geometry defined by projective geometry techniques in Virtual models it actually defines seven possible levels of which beyond space and time documents the first three um so that&#x27;s uh inanimate biologic and ethical in a different work paret basically divides ethical up into sever several different strata like five more or four more by removing these limitations larsson&#x27;s postulates work for the biological and ethical Realms no additional postulates are needed this is what rs2 has done in the reeval valuation so rs2 fundamental postulates he got two fundamental postulates in the rs2 these are pet and nus postulates the universe is composed of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time second postulate the universe conforms to the relations of ordinary mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is projective so those are two large those are Pet&#x27;s two postulates that basically uh refine larence to fundamental postulates and they also eliminate the need for larence for metaphysical postulates so pet says what did we change No More Physical the postulates Now function for the non-physical or metaphysical universe as well ukian geometry was changed to projective geometry to allow for the stratification into the levels of existance and commutative uh of commutative mathematics commutative was dropped as it is inapplicable to motion that occurs in more than one dimension such as the polar geometry of the life or ethical unit uh when you&#x27;re using the life life unit you you&#x27;re basically using complex numbers you&#x27;re combining um a real number and a complex number now that we are using a m micrometer calber and computer instead of a yard stick and slide rule a larger and more encompassing model can be developed from larsson&#x27;s original work while retaining the best of what Larson had already accomplished and that is the end of that article Bruce pet from November 2013 10 years ago and um I wish you would uh elaborate a little bit more there um but if you get into the rest of his writings you will eventually kind of um see where he&#x27;s getting to he&#x27;s got a little footnote here that kind of goes over a lot of the history of um of projective geometry I talks about some of the luminaries that were involved which include papis of Alexandria uh this guy Bruno Lei uh Kepler Gerard desz or however you pronounce that and um he was one of the original kind of major people in projected geometry lived from 1591 to 1661 and then um also Pascal and Gaspard m and uh Jean Victor Pon uh in the 19th century early 19th century and then Nick Thomas the English mathematician from the 20th century and I believe he&#x27;s still alive or he was uh as of 2013 okay so that is and then there is a website here that kind of uh shows how to dig further into to the projective geometry so um anyway that is uh more or less the end of um this paper and the end of this presentation uh we will move on tomorrow where we&#x27;re going to be covering RS 2104 um article from Dr Bruce pet and this article is on scaler motion uh again this is that motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction we&#x27;ll get into that tomorrow but uh for today thanks for tuning in and have a great day</p>
