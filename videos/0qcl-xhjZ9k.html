            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald abuse ATS founder and chair the International Society unified science and president trans power corporation a commercial and custom software manufacturing a certified systems engineering company I work as a systems and mechanical engineer and theoretical physicist so today I&#x27;m going to go over my review of Stephen Hawking&#x27;s a brief history of time this was uh I wrote this way back around 1991 and then uploaded it to Amazon as a review of Stephen Hawking&#x27;s work so this will be a reciprocal system critique of hockey here we go and of course as always I will annotate this with some additional comments this review will critique the conventional physical theory espoused by Stephen Hawking after deviated 2sh in his best-selling book brief history of time from the perspective of the reciprocal system hereafter related to RS the book is full of errors on practically every page still I urge students and faculty to read it SH does a good job presenting the quote establishments viewpoint and it&#x27;s worth pondering his thinking the books dust-jacket proclaims sh to be the most rant theoretical physicist einstein yet he begins his conclusion on page 171 but the words quote we find ourselves in a bewildering world this is a far cry from my work my first book the unmistakable air editions of this work are very similar and so the comments here need not be empty continue I say just confused as to whether the universe was creative or not he states that in quote imaginary time the universe has no beginning or end no singularities or boundaries it simply is but in quote real time the universe does have a beginning and an end at singularities that form a boundary to space-time and at which the laws of science break down that&#x27;s on page 139 the beginning singularities of course call it the quote Big Bang when the universe was quote infinitesimally small and infinitely dense page a and infinitely hot page 117 the space-time had difficulty curve ature time and by implication space-time had no meaning prior to the beginning page a SH defines an event page 23 has quote something that happens at a particular point in space and at a particular time so what can specify it by four numbers or coordinates this is a conventional four-dimensional space-time three spatial coordinates in one temporal coordinate which is quite different from the three dimensional space-time of the RS where each dimension is a dimension of motion on the spacer time individually in the RS that&#x27;s the reciprocal system space-time has an inbuilt expansion and hence there is no need for a big bang or dark energy for that matter to explain the recession of the distant galaxies SH states page 33 that quote space and time are now dynamic quantities when a body moves were force acts it affects the curvature of space and time and in turn the structure of space-time affects the way in which bodies move and forces act and certainly there is no physical evidence for the Spear space-time is non-physical since it cannot be changed into something else it is simply a reference system for motion SH does not specify a mechanism for producing this alleged working of space-time by the quote distribution of mass and energy in it page 29 SH Street space and time is both purely relative not absolute that&#x27;s one pages 21 and he says that quote each observer must have his own measure of time as recorded by a clock carried with them and identical clocks Kay by different observers would not necessarily agree of course the subjectivist belief leads to numerous logical contradictions and is wrong space-time is the fundamental component of the universe and must thus be absolutely there&#x27;s nothing for it to be relative to since it is itself to reference an electromagnetic field fills the space-time of sh there can be page 19 well wave-like disturbances in the combined electromagnetic field page 38 visible light consists of fluctuations or waves in the electromagnetic field but on page 54 he says or the lady&#x27;s made up of waves Planck&#x27;s quantum hypothesis tells us that in some ways behaves as if it were composed of particles it can be emitted or absorbed only in packets or quanta this is the old wave particle duality compare this with the definition of photon in the RS a linear vibration within a single space-time unit which itself progresses perpendicularly a combination thus generating a wave motion as I stayed speech 31 that light rays to must follow geodesics in space-time and page 28 nothing can travel faster than light in the RS on the other hand spatial motions under the speeds lower than that of light but temporal speeds are higher the speed of light is the midpoint of the speed range of the universe not the upper limit according to SH page 117 one second after the Big Bang the temperature would fall into about 10,000 million degrees it&#x27;s ten billion degrees at this time the universe would have contained mostly photons of electrons and neutrinos and their anti particles together with some protons and neutrons SH does not provide a fundamental definition of electrons for neutrinos the quark hypothesis does not include them warps are the undefined elementary particles of matter in conventional thought he stays page 65 that a proton contains two up quarks and one down quark a neutron contains two down and one up page 73 1 can I have a single quark on its own confinement prevents one from observing an isolated quark or gluon which carries the strong nuclear force page 75 the uncertainty principle means that the energy of the quarks inside the proton cannot be fixed exactly the proton would then decay page 73 another possibility is a pair consisting of a quark and an antiquark such combinations make up the particles known as maisons which are unstable because the quark and antiquark can nilly ate each other producing electrons and other particles and each sub atom has a spin but on page 66 he says fun mechanics tells us that the particles do not have any well-defined axes and page 67 particles have spending one-half make up the matter in the universal particles spin 0 1 and to give rise to forces between the matter particles k 69 he continues electric repulsive force between two electrons is due to the exchange of virtual photons which has been won and on page 70 he says the forces or the force between two matter particles as pictured is being carried by a particle spin to called a graviton this is all in contrast with the RS image each sub atom is a set of quantized spins of a photon with definite axes and these urns are actually cosmic Adam sends in persons in the process of converting to the prevailing structures of our Sun the apparent force interactions are not due to exchange of particles virtual or otherwise but rather representing interaction between the particles and the omnipresent space-time progression SH continues page 117 about 100 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature would have fallen to 1000 million degrees the temperature inside the hottest stars at this temperature protons and neutrons will no longer have sufficient energy to escape the attraction the strong nuclear force which by the way is totally an ad hoc and will start to combine together to produce the nuclei of atoms of deuterium the deuterium nuclei danwon of combined with more protons and neutrons to make the helium nuclei and also smell small amounts of couple of a couple with heavier elements lithium and beryllium but then only a few hours of the Big Bang the production of helium and other elements would have stopped as ice doesn&#x27;t question the validity of the nuclear theory of the atom no mention is made of the instability of the neutron atom be stable one of its main components is known to be unstable also why don&#x27;t the alleged protons in the nucleus repel each other to explain the quote strong nuclear force this due to the exchange of unobserved gluons is mystical also the alleged orbiting electrons are thought not to combine the protons to neutralize the charges whereas other pairs of obsolete charged particles must certainly do finally why should the production of new elements cease it seems more likely that only the course of thousands or millions or billions of years that atoms would continue to combine to form heavier atoms and these were joined to form ever more complex molecules as I states page 60 that well since the structure of molecules and their reactions with each other underlie all of chemistry and biology quantum mechanics allows us in principle to predict nearly everything we see around us within the limits set by the uncertainty principle in practice however the calculations of current resistance containing more than a few electrons are so complicated that we cannot do them so well what good is a theory if we can only use it in principle for that with my reciprocal system micro cosmos database message continues page 117 the universe as a whole would have continued expanding and cooling but in regions that were slightly denser than average the expansion would have been slowed down by the extra gravitational attraction this would eventually stop expansion in some regions and cause them to start to wreak elapsed in this way discs like rotating galaxies were born as a chooses the uncertainty principle to explain the non-uniform density he says page 140 that there must have been some uncertainties of more fluctuations in the positions or velocities of the particles using the no boundary condition we find that the universe must have discerned off with just the amount possible non-uniformity law in mind in certain principle and as usual the RS explanation is much much better the two main forces of the universal of the space-time progression and gravitation gravitation and stronger galaxies and stars are formed where the progression is stronger the galaxies move away from each other also the latest evidence is that the formation of galaxies is not but one time occurrence observations indicate that galaxy buildings going on right now just as the RS predicts an average galaxy has a hundred billion stars SH States page 82 that a star formed when a large month gas mostly hydrogen starts to collapse in on itself due to gravitational attraction as it contracts the atoms of the gas collide with each other more and more frequently and at greater greater speeds the gas heats up eventually the gas would be so hot when hydrogen atoms collide they no longer bounce off each other but instead coalesce to form helium any releasing this reaction was like a controlled hydrogen bomb explosion that&#x27;s what makes the stars shine this additional heat it also increases the pressure of the gas and it wasn&#x27;t sufficient to balance the gravitational attraction and the gas stops contract stars will remain stable like this for a long time eventually however the star will run out of its hydrogen other fuels paradoxically the more fuel star starts off with the sooner and runs out this is paradoxical indeed the larger stars should be the oldest and the smaller stars the youngest in fact the observed evidence indicates that the astronomers have the evolutionary sequence precisely upside down as the RS contends SH continuous pages 83 84 and 87 when a star runs out of fuel a starts to cool off in search of contract if a star&#x27;s mass is less than the Sun during a sucker limit it can eventually stop contracting and settle down to a possible final state as white dwarf but the radius of a few thousand miles an intensity of hundreds of tons for Cuba games the stars mass is greater than in stronger secretary limit the starter will vention claps to coal Mitch neither life nor anything else can escape again in contrast the reciprocal system says stars slowly late mass rather than losing mass and there&#x27;s no end in the black hole rather at the mass limit a supernova type 1 explosion occurs and a red giant right to earth Paris for planetary satellite system both stars eventually return to the main sequence it&#x27;s interesting that SH proposes a radical theoretical change in black hole concert he says that actually about whole wood in that particles and radiation and on page 115 the black hole along with any singularity inside it wouldn&#x27;t that right away and eventually disappear this is kind of amusing one we&#x27;ve been told for decades that nothing can escape a black hole as H continues page 46 the present evidence therefore suggests that the universe will probably expand forever but all we can really be sure I&#x27;m saying even if the universe is going to be collapse and won&#x27;t do so for at least number 10,000 million years since it has already been expanding for at least that long compare this with the reciprocal system there are two sectors the material sector and the cosmic sector onward spatial expansion of the material sectors terminated with a galactic explosion which sends the matter whatever to the cosmic order inverse sector where our temporal expansion the inverse of spatial expansion occurs this expansion in turn is terminated with a cosmic logic explosion which sends the matter back to the material sector thus the main process in the universe is cyclic rather than a singular one time expansion also the net total displacement in the universe is zero because the number of cosmic displacement in this balances the number of material displacement units whereas SH States on page 129 the total energy of the universe is exactly zero this negative gravitational energy exactly cancels the positive energy represented by the matter so the conclusion here I mean carefully studied this book I think the supporters of the RS have nothing to fear if this is the best popular rendition of conventional theoretical physics the future looks bright for the spread of the RS which is a unified general theoretical system it&#x27;s a theory of everything contrast the RS with the current so-called grand unified theories which these when pieces do not very satisfactory because they do not include the force of gravity because they contain a number of quantities like the relative masses of different particles that cannot be predicted common theory but have to be chosen to fit observations further details of the RS reputation the ideas expressed by SH can even do levy Larson&#x27;s books really the university of emotion so I suggest that all of you read to me be Larson&#x27;s books and also take a look it at my work simplest explanation of reciprocal system is an mysterious universe the most advanced treatment is existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the tree theory of everything and for those who want to apply the theory and practice I have the reciprocal system microcosms database and macrocosmos database so we don&#x27;t have solutions in principle we have solutions in fact with reciprocal system the study the reciprocal system improve it for yourself thanks for your attention</p>
