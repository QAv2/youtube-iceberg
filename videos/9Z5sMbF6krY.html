            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is for educational purposes and we generally focus on theories of everything aspects of those theories uh today is a video number 248 on the reciprocal system of theory this is a system of theory which means that once you understand how the system works you can plug the system into any subject and generate uh relevant answers to your questions the reciprocal system of theory was devised by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century all the way from his first inklings into the reciprocal system back way back in about 1930 up until his death in 1990 about halfway through he had the theory worked out to the point where he came up with his two fundamental postulates and uh then from there he took those postulates and through a process of deduction he generated an entire theoretical Universe about how things would work if his uh postulates were correct and uh he wrote some books on physics and chemistry and astronomy metaphysics economics and other subjects and some of his followers have extended the theory into um many many other subjects uh but it is a very obscure Theory they&#x27;re very very few he had very few followers and none of them have been published widely um today we are actually looking at one of his um followers revisers I don&#x27;t believe that Dr peret ever met Dewey Larson but he certainly read up on all of his books or at least almost all of his books and um did some great work in um spreading out spreading it out into new Fields applying it to other areas applying it making parallels between other theories and Larson&#x27;s Theory uh up until Dr peret&#x27;s Death in 2020. and um we are looking at his article that is called um it&#x27;s part three of his anthropology series um we&#x27;ve gone through the first two articles in about the 20 videos before this and uh we&#x27;re part three out of four uh of his anthropology series on hidden origins of homo sapiens this article is called Homo sapiens ethicus Life Death reincarnation and Ascension and uh before we start reading from this article let me just give you a little bit uh more on the reciprocal system the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that the universe is made out of motion not matter not energy but motion motion is uh matter and energy in fact are just two different kinds of motion along with really every other scientific quantity that you can think of is also a form of motion and for Larson motion is the relationship between space and time so all of these scientific quantities that are also motions are expressible uh exclusively in terms of space and time they are basically fractions where space and time space or time is the numerator and time or space is the denominator but there are a few caveats that make that a little bit more complicated mainly that space and time are coordinate meaning that they have three or more Dimensions both of them so you can have space to the third power over time to the third power or you can have space to the second power over time to the third power and all the various permutations of that um and uh that&#x27;s what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time three dimensions of space and three dimensions of time then space and time also have their scalar aspects which Larson calls clock space and clock time you can Envision a scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no direction or no specific direction or all directions you can Envision this using a balloon and a magic marker you put a bunch of dots on the balloon with the magic marker you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other that is a scalar motion there&#x27;s no particular direction that they&#x27;re moving but there is a magnitude with how fast they&#x27;re moving away from each other the further away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other this is the uh a model for the progression of uh time and the progression of space time is always getting later and later and later space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart these are outward outward scalar motions now space Also can go inward you can get closer and closer and closer together um if you sucked in the balloon now space and time also uh have their quantized aspect or their discrete units there is no continuity of time and space they come in chunks they&#x27;re quantized there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space and there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time one unit of space in one unit of time that speed space over time the car is moving 20 miles per hour 20 miles of space in one hour of time but if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light one over one equals one so Larson calls the speed of light unit speed and uh unit speed turns out to be the boundary between two separate universes in Larson&#x27;s world uh what he calls the material sector and the cosmic sector and the material sector is everything moving slower than the speed of light the cosmic sector unknown to science basically is the uh sector that is moving faster than the speed of light but then within the material sector you have what Larson calls the time region because in the material sector if you have less than one unit of space you don&#x27;t have space because you have to have at least one unit that&#x27;s the discrete unit postulate and so if you have less than one unit of space you don&#x27;t have space you only have time everything&#x27;s got to either be time or space or both and so if you don&#x27;t have space then you only have time Larson calls that the time region that&#x27;s the region inside a unit of space that&#x27;s basically the realm of the um microscopic the realm of the atom and the molecule uh one unit of space in Larson&#x27;s system is of 4.56 times 10 to the minus 8 meters so um it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s very small but not really very large compared to the size of an atom though and then uh in the cosmic sector the sector that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light you have what Larson calls this the time the space region the space region is the region inside a unit of time because if you if you have less than one unit of time then you no longer have time and so you only have excuse me you only have space so that kind of shows you uh that the universe is really divided up into four different sectors and um or at four different regions is I guess the term that he would use and uh you know he he go he takes those two passages that&#x27;s the first postulate the second postulate is basically the universe conforms to the um ordinary commutative mathematics it&#x27;s magnitudes are absolute and it&#x27;s geometry is euclidean there&#x27;s been a lot of dispute about that second postulate and Dr peret actually uh you know contends that the universe is not the geometry of the universe is not euclidean it is projective geometry and uh euclidean geometry is really a subset of projective geometry uh it&#x27;s a specific kind of projective geometry or a specific setting of projective geometry um but the first postulate is far more important in my my view and um so we&#x27;re gonna uh get into Dr peret&#x27;s uh discussion here um this section is called yin yang equals time space so he&#x27;s he&#x27;s been doing a lot of comparing of uh the concept of time and space that Larson has of those two components of motion as being analogous to Yin and Yang time being Yin space being young and um you know that is uh taoism Chinese taoism and uh he also used the concept of the Dan Tien as a bio uh storage of bioenergy in the body um that is also from uh dollar Taoism okay another concept that is used from Chinese is that of Yin Yan the concept of inseparable opposites that Larson calls motion Yin is the involutive concept female polar curved full or cold whereas Yang is the evolution evolutive concept masculine linear straight empty or hot within the material sector context of the reciprocal system used in this analysis time is Yin and space is Young yin yang also represents a way to represent the concept of simple harmonic motion where a Yin inside is simple harmonic motion is a vibration and a young outside simple harmonic motion is an oscillation vibration when applied to a rotation such as an atomic system creates the concept of charge a rotational vibration in the reciprocal system that is the source of Electric magnetic and gravitational charges and again yesterday we went over this concept of the four different kinds of motion in Larson&#x27;s system you have a translational motion you have a vibrational motion you have a rotational motion and you have a rotational vibration those can come in multiple Dimensions but the rotational vibration is what he&#x27;s talking about here and that is a charge charges energy and charge on an electron is expressed as Force the motion the charge causes on Atomic systems charges are easily acquired but not required meaning that a particle including an electron does not have to be charged so in Larson&#x27;s system there is such a thing as the uncharged electron um and that is what Legacy scientists refer to as electric currents so electric current in Larson system is uncharged and the electric current is basically a rotating unit of space okay particles and atoms can exist in either a charged or uncharged State a concept not recognized by conventional physics because the field effects of an uncharged particle do not vary with respect to time or space they are not readily detected the most common example of an uncharged structure is that of the uncharged electron which is observed as a whole a positive charge of electric current um like he&#x27;s using that in quotation meaning that the Legacy scientists would call it a positive charge but it is really uncharged the charged electron is the conventional electron as acting as static electricity so the charged electron is static electricity the uncharged electron is electric current all the forms of bioenergy like their inanimate counterparts have both a polarity I mean poles and can exist in a charged or uncharged state each type of bioenergy can exist in four different states uncharged Ian charged in uncharged young and chargedy on resulting in what appears to be 12 different forms of bioenergy four types of gin four types of Jing four types of chi and four types of shen uh Jin Chi and Shen we we covered that yesterday those are the basic uh forms of bioenergy corresponding to the three Don tiens or battery centers within the body uh Jing being the low speed energy Qi being the intermediate speed energy and Shen being the high speed okay this section is called death and dying the final concept that needs clarification right up front is that of death the term death can be viewed as both a condition and a process in this paper the word death will be used to represent the terminal condition and dying to represent the process dying is the process initiated after the biological organism cannot retain viability death is the condition where the organism gets demoted or returned to inanimate status the process of dying is initiated either naturally of via old age or involuntarily due to disease or injury or unnaturally due to murder or accidents the bioenergetic condition is different for each process for natural death the bioenergy of Jing has been depleted Chi and Shen are unaffected for involuntary death uh are I guess involuntary dying stress depletes Jing by converting it to Chi to operate the immune response until Jing is expended fighting the disease and regenerating tissue will expend Chi and then for unnatural dying remaining Jing is converted to chi in large quantities which may cause the etheric double to obtain sufficient cohesion to take on a life of its own but without a viable spatial body to contain it the etheric double becomes a ghost okay uh just looking at um the footnotes here it says ghost will be used as the Shadow the word ghost will be used as the shadow of the cosmic aspect of life units not Spirit which is a common translation for the Animus so the cosmic aspect of life units is uh ghosts the shadow of the cosmic aspect of life units okay uh this next section is called origins of the afterlife choices the majority of Western Concepts concerning the afterlife can be traced back to a single Source Plato&#x27;s myth of error ER which goes like this with many other Souls as his companions Heir had come across an awesome place with four openings two into and out of the sky and two into and out of the earth judges sat between these openings and ordered the souls uh witch path to follow the good were guided into the path in the sky the immoral were directed below but when er approached the judges he was told to remain listening and observing in order to report his experience to mankind meanwhile from the other opening in the sky clean Souls floated down recounting beautiful sights and wondrous feelings others returning from the earth appeared dirty Haggard and tired crying in despair when recounting their awful experience as each was required to pay a tenfold penalty for all the wicked Deeds committed went alive there were some however that could not be released from the underground murderers tyrants and other non-political criminals were doomed to remain by the exit of the underground unable to escape after seven days in the meadow the souls and Ur were required to travel further after four days they reached a place where they could see a rainbow shaft of light brighter than any that they had ever seen before after another day&#x27;s travel they reached it this was the spindle of necessity several women including lady necessity her daughters and the sirens were present the souls were then uh organized into rows and were each given a lottery token apart from ER then of their Lottery tokens they were required to come forward in order and choose their next life ER recalled the first to choose a new life a man who had not known the Terrors of the underground what had been rewarded in the sky hastily chose a powerful dictatorship upon further inspection he realized that among other atrocities he was destined to eat his own children ER observed that this was often the case of those who had been through the path in the sky whereas those who had been punished often chose a better life many preferred a life different from their previous experience animals chose human lives while humans often chose the Apparently easier lives of animals after this each Soul was assigned a guardian Spirit to help them through their life they passed under the Throne of Lady necessity then traveled to the plain of Oblivion Where the River of forgetfulness flowed each Soul was required to drink some of the water in varying quantities apart from ER as they drank each Soul forgot everything as they lay down at night to sleep each saw was lifted up into the night in various directions for rebirth completing their Journey ER remembered nothing of the journey back to his body he opened his eyes to find himself lying on the funeral pyre early in the morning and able to recall his journey through the afterlife as you can see for yourself all the classic elements are here the path in the sky became Heaven the path in the earth became hell uh this is that&#x27;s the end of The Plato uh the part of for Plato this is back to Dr peret here as you can see for yourself all the classic elements are here the path in the sky became Heaven the path in the earth became hell the idea of reincarnation and the veil of forgetting even those cast out of Heaven through that second door to take on lives of atrocities if we make use of the Anunnaki context that is presented in this series what we have here is the classic dichotomy of the battle between unlil the sky God and enki the Earth God and the promises made to their slave population humanity and Lil and his father on lived in the heavens and would come down to the surface world as rulers are of the land Anki with his undersea abzu and handling mining operations across the planet lived beneath the surface and would come up to the surface World bring the treasures From Below to placate the sky dwellers with the onset of hostilities between them these domains of control became the classic Heaven um and Lil as Yahweh or Jehovah and Underworld enki the adversary the role of human souls in this Anunnaki scenario will be expounded upon later after some foundational Concepts have been reviewed okay so that section that was taken from Plato&#x27;s Republic and then it was applied to the Sumerian literature in particular uh discussing um the Anunnaki and in particular the um enki and enlil the two um the two brothers who were basically in charge of operation planet Earth where they had come here to obtain gold to save their own atmosphere but they found that the uh the mining of the gold was too hard and so they ended up uh using a test tube to take some of the uh uh Apes that were already here on this planet and transform them into Homo sapiens to do the work for them and uh so this kind of now enki was the brother who basically did the work of creating us and Lil was the brother who was pretty much opposed to it the whole time and really did not like the humans whatsoever Anki became attached to his creation and so uh we have something backwards in this myth because enki is being portrayed as the adversary um but he is actually he is actually the one who uh was always looking out for us uh once he got done creating us he&#x27;s the one that told Noah uh about the flood and things like that whereas adlil just wanted the human beings to be wiped out in the flood and he was you know he&#x27;s the one and he but he&#x27;s the one who&#x27;s portrayed in the Bible as Jehovah or Yahweh okay we will uh the next uh section here is called options while dying and um we will start that up uh next time in the meantime have a great day thanks for tuning in</p>
