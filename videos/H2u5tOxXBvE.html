            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>if the money thought time and energy now  being poured uselessly into the development   of rocket propulsion were invested in a basic  study of gravity it&#x27;s likely we could have an   effective and economical space travel  at a small fraction of the cost within   a decade this was written by townin Brown  in 1955 30 years after he invented antira   so if this is true and there is any gravity where </p>
<p>are all the flying cars where are the propulsion   Vehicles well many suspect they&#x27;re here except  they&#x27;re not Cars they&#x27;re the unidentified aerial   phenomena being recorded at military bases and  they&#x27;re the evolution of towns and&#x27;s work being   developed in secrecy by the government for decades  today we&#x27;re going to learn about the life of   Thomas Townsen brown with our guest Paul shatkin  he&#x27;s the author of the man who mastered gravity   now let&#x27;s hear from Paul okay let&#x27;s [Music] go </p>
<p>the journey that I have been on and we&#x27;re going to   talk about the second half of it but the journey  started with things that I learned about pho   Farnsworth in the 1970s so we can talk about that  progression and then talk about brown but it&#x27;s   interesting how one thing led to another and I do  think that in some ways they are tied together but   then then then we&#x27;re going out into the future  yeah and I I love the story because the ionic   Air Breeze purifier might be the most mundane </p>
<p>boring invention that Sharper Image has ever made   somehow it relates to UFOs quantum mechanics and  government conspiracy to control gravity yeah that   makes me think uh what else are we overlooking at  this Sharper Image you know maybe the Temperpedic   pillow has a gateway to another dimension well  it does because arguably when we go to sleep and   start dreaming uh we go our our dreams come from  somewhere unknown to us and maybe that&#x27;s some   interconnected place in the quantum Realm uh yeah </p>
<p>I just did an interview uh about Tesla uh about a   month ago and he really seemed to believe that he  thought that these ideas were out there and chose   the right person uh interesting yeah I I I think  that there I think that that that is arguable I   I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t dispute that contention um there  there are what what did Shakespeare say there are   more things in our philosophy or more things  in Heaven and Earth uh than are known in our   philosophy Horatio something like that I might be </p>
<p>getting my Shakespeare&#x27;s mixed up there but yeah   so take us back how did you get into writing to  begin with because are you in did you go to school   for this no not at all I haven&#x27;t gone to school  for any of this um maybe that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re good at   it that&#x27;s what I like to think that you know one  of my favorite um one of my favorite lines that I   picked up in this whole journey is is a quotation  from from Cliff Gardner who was the glass blower   who fabricated the very first television camera </p>
<p>tubes in the 1920s and in 1930 he showed somebody   how he made that camera tube and the person he  was showing it to was very impressed with the   techniques and said well this is very interesting  because my people told me this could not be done   and and Cliff Gardner said well we didn&#x27;t know  it couldn&#x27;t be done so we just went ahead and did it yeah so so not knowing what can&#x27;t  be done kind of leaves the field open   to exploring possibilities that we </p>
<p>might not otherwise be cognizant   of it&#x27;s like a ignorance is bliss  right well let&#x27;s not go that far well so but but to your point there is there  is a point at which Orthodoxy becomes a very   constraining mechanism and invariably historically  advances are made by things that live outside the   Orthodoxy progress always comes in from The  Fringe and is usually as schopenhauer put it   this is one of the quotations in the fars book </p>
<p>The Truth always goes through three three phases   first it is ridiculed then it is opposed and  often violently and then in the third stage   it&#x27;s recognized as having been self-evident all  along so somewhere in there is the voice of the   Orthodoxy resisting the change that&#x27;s always  coming in from the periphery what point in your   life were you at when you decided I&#x27;m going to  write about this by farnworth well when it became   a um a writing kind of obsession was in the mid </p>
<p>1970s and the motivation there was when I told a   colleague I was working in Hollywood uh working  on TV shows at the time uh in in the tech Field   behind the scenes and said to somebody that F Pho  T farnworth was the father of television and he   had never heard that name and when I began  to tell him what little I knew of the story   he said well that would make a great movie for  television and I at the time had aspirations of   moving to a different point in a career and being </p>
<p>a producer of of Television material and so that   was kind of the point of of initiation where  we track began to track down the material now   I first learned of Pho Farnsworth that summer of  1973 as I was graduating from college I read this   publication it&#x27;s called radical song software and  when I was going to school in the early 70s I&#x27;m   much older than I look um but when I was going  to school in the early 70s I was part of what   we called the Gorilla video movement which was </p>
<p>kind of the the early stages of um personal use   of of electronic media uh we we used the very  first you know the people in this Movement we   were kind of carryovers from the ideal ISM  of the 1960s and thought that we could use   the very first portable video technology with  cable TV as a community organizing media and   the the the publication that organized a lot of  that effort was this publication called radical   software and they published an issue from San </p>
<p>Francisco in the spring and summer of 1973 called   the video City Edition because as I learned  in its pages San Francisco was I&#x27;m sorry it   was published from San Francisco rather than New  York LIF that detail out but it was called the   video City Edition from San Francisco because  San Francisco is where video was invented in   the 1920s and as I&#x27;m going through the pages of  this magazine um I saw where are they now [Music] here we go pictures of what I would call the </p>
<p>prehistory of Television that I had never seen   before and that&#x27;s where I heard the name of Pho  T Farnsworth which was a name that I had never   heard of before and he turns out to be indeed the  the single individual who not only had the concept   of how to convert light into electricity but went  through the whole process from the late 1920s into   the mid 1930s of developing all the technology  that became television in the 1940s and 50s and   it gets more involved because he was also asked to </p>
<p>participate in the Manhattan experiment right yeah   project yeah as the story evolves so we&#x27;re talk  what to to me one of the things that we Overlook   in in our commonplace acceptance of video which is  now the most the single most ubiquitous Appliance   on the planet but what we we kind of Overlook  is that in the same way the atomic bomb comes   from the cosmology that Albert Einstein and his  Brethren introduced at the beginning of the 20th   century video is a product of that same cosmology </p>
<p>um if I were to ask you do you know what Einstein   was awarded the Nobel Prize for give it to me I&#x27;ve  read this though okay so interview do you think it   do you think it was the theory of relativity or  E equals MC squ pick one I know it was neither   it was neither it was it was the photo electric  effect the very first paper that he wrote in 1905   uh and it had this long name that I can&#x27;t  rattle off the top of my head now but it was the   articulation of the process by which light becomes </p>
<p>electricity when it is focused on certain metals   and electric electrons are thrown off of the metal  metallic surface that is where we introduced the   concept of light being both a wave and a particle  it becomes the the Cornerstone of all the quantum   mechanics that come at after it of which uh um the  process to the atomic bomb is a is ultimately a   result but he goes from the photoelectric effect  to his other theories and lands on E equals MC s   all over the course of 1905 but it began with the </p>
<p>photoelectric effect so Farnsworth at a very early   age began to understand what all that cosmology  was about that&#x27;s what he applies to the problem of   converting light into electricity for the purposes  of transmitting moving pictures through the air   and in the course of developing the technology  which becomes television he gained more firsthand   experience with the quantum forces that people  like Einstein and then later Oppenheimer and the   people who gathered at Los Alamos Pho Farnsworth </p>
<p>knew more about how those Quantum forces work   than just about anybody living during that era  and so as you say in indeed in the n in 1940 uh   or early in in in World War II he was approached  by somebody and asked to participate in a secret   project in Chicago which would have been fy&#x27;s  pile the very first nuclear reactor which was   part of the Manhattan Project and he said to his  wife Pam I think they&#x27;re building an atomic bomb   and I want no part of it so he stayed isolated </p>
<p>on a farm in Maine throughout World War II the   irony of this is he didn&#x27;t want to have anything  to do with the atomic bomb because obviously kills   people but he did Create TV which destroys mindes  so pick your poison well okay I I appreciate the   iry in the statement but by the same token  you and I are having this conversation right   and and and being able to share ideas so there  while there is clearly a downside there is an   upside as well and and I would then argue as we </p>
<p>get farther into the Farnsworth story that he   represents the ultimate upside to the processes  and and and forces that they were dealing with   at the in the Manhattan Project which we have  yet to fully realize and that&#x27;s the back half   of the Farnsworth story where he was developing  a controlled nuclear fusion process and this will   all tie together at the end because I know you  do have a theory on you know whether or not this   was used and it&#x27;s definitely interesting well </p>
<p>I have I have a theory of how it could be used   um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m somewhat more reluctant to say that  it&#x27;s already being used is because then we&#x27;re   off into you know really questioning the nature  of our reality it&#x27;s all simulation anyway so it   probably happened the story that we&#x27;re talking  about here this this was my introduction to all   this I became obsessed with the farmsworth story  when I learned in the summer of 1975 somebody who   knew the farnworth family told me I knew only </p>
<p>that he had been involved in the very earliest   stages of Television but I met somebody in the  summer of 1975 who knew the farnworth family   and uh told me was no I&#x27;m sorry it was the summer  of 73 because I met the family in 75 but in the   summer of 73 right after i&#x27; read this magazine  this person that knew the forworth family told me   what nuclear fusion is what it represents for the  future of mankind and that forworth had developed   something that seemed to show some promise uh </p>
<p>for that technology and that was the thing that   has always hooked me and kept me interested in  that story then a couple of years later when the   said let&#x27;s make a movie for television about  it we track down the farnworth family long   story short I&#x27;ve known the family since 75 we did  try to get a movie for television going uh about   the story never were able to do that I deferred  to Mrs farnworth uh after I met her worked with   her on the book that she was developing she sold </p>
<p>me the movie rights before she had ever finished   the book and um I I never thought about writing a  book until many years later after she had finished   her book and that internet business that I was  telling you about had had been sold and I was no   longer involved in it I was wondering what to do  next and then the opportunity to write my book on   that subject came up and when I finished that book  I figured okay I&#x27;ve now found my new career as a   biographer of obscure 20th century scientists what </p>
<p>will I do next and and like I sent it out into the   universe and the Universe came back and said how  about this guy and this guy was T towns and brown   and now one of the really crazy things is this  is that you received an anonymous email about him   and I almost wanted to say that town and brown is  almost like an illness because once you catch it   and start doing your research yeah it just affects  you because now I have all these cons cons iracy   Theory beliefs yeah and how did it get started for </p>
<p>you so so tell us about this Anonymous email well   yeah I I I appreciate your use of the word illness  I prefer to use the word Affliction or Obsession   and and I I think in in some quarters the kind  you know the idea of being OCD is acceptable   so rather than saying I&#x27;m sick well just say that  I&#x27;m OCD and this has been my obsession but as you   say I in the summer of 2002 as I was putting the  finishing touches on the biography of Pho forworth   which was called the boy who invented television </p>
<p>I really was wondering at that point I was kind   of at Loose Ends because I had sold the internet  business um I had spent some time working on that   book and I was wondering what I was going to  do next and as I finished that book and enjoyed   very much the process of doing that I did come up  with this kind of brand idea that I&#x27;m going to be   a biographer of obscure 20th century scientists  so I needed another 20th century scientists to   to research and write about and then literally I </p>
<p>think it was in July June or July of the summer of   2002 as I&#x27;m kind of putting the finishing touches  on the gals of the farmsworth bio I literally get   what I can only describe as an anonymous email  it had a name on it I have no idea who the name   was never been able to trace the individual down  but says um uh for unknown inventors I think was   the subject and it simply said another unknown  inventor whose work has gone on recognized was T   towns and brown it said that um science said that </p>
<p>what he proposed was impossible but the government   classified it you can see the results of his  work in a bluish Haze flying over the desert   in Nevada and you can also and The Sharper Image  also employed his technology in the Ionic Breeze   Air Purifier yeah and that yeah so so I I did we  go Google this was 2002 Google was just coming   online so I I Googled the subject and I found a  website and the website talked about how Thomas   Townsen Brown had pioneered in the science of what </p>
<p>he called electrogravitics which popular culture   calls anti-gravity I think is more correctly  called gravity control or inducing artificial   gravity but finding a means of inducing gravity  and and because of the nature of his work it had   been associated with the study and curiosity  about unidentified flying objects and it was   at that point in my reading and research that  uh I was inclined to get very skeptical because   while I don&#x27;t discount the existence of </p>
<p>unidentified flying objects it that has   never been a particular Obsession of mine on  a on a basic philosophical level I don&#x27;t think   we&#x27;re alone in the universe but that is I I&#x27;ve  never been one of these people who is absolutely   obsessed with that particular thing but this  story became sufficiently intriguing and I   needed something to do so I went down the rabbit  hole and ever since I heard about this story even   down to the email you received it feels like a </p>
<p>game of Clue because I can&#x27;t help but associate   one of the people that you interviewed for your  book must be one of the people that sent the email the these are the ideas that are all within  the realm of possibility and I have to confess up   front that um well I ran away from the story  for a long time because I was not comfortable   with my inability to to verify or validate the  information that was coming over the transom   and I&#x27;ve always said of this story or I&#x27;ve said </p>
<p>in in its latest iteration that this is a story   that lives in the realm you imagine a VIN diagram  and you got three circles interlocking and one of   them is science and the other is science fiction  and the third is pseudoscience and this story   lives where those those three circles overlap  in the VIN diagram and and so I had to rely on   sources the the veracity of which I was unable  to verify and so the book is written in a way   of this is what the sources told me and and in </p>
<p>that context yes it&#x27;s possible that because of   my interest that the people associate with towns  and brown thought I might be a good candidate   to look into his life and write a book on it that  is a like I said more of the universe choosing the   right vessel to send the message well if you&#x27;ve  read the book then you know that the the log   line the the epigraph that begins the book the  very first thing you read is a quotation that   I found very early on uh in the research phase in </p>
<p>the early a when I was just diving into this you   may be familiar with the physicist mishuk Kaku  he&#x27;s a popular he&#x27;s a popularizer of physics as   as Neil degrass Tyson is and they&#x27;re on kind of  the same level Neil is more of an astrophysicist   uh mukaku is more of a theoretical physicist but  he has a documentary that was on PBS back around   2002 2004 somewhere in that period it&#x27;s called  um Isaac Newton and me and it began with this   quotation the universe is filled with magical </p>
<p>things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper that I had to research because he  didn&#x27;t cite the source of the quotation in   the documentary but I sourced it to an early  science fiction writer uh who worked primarily   between about the 1920s and 1940s named Eden  Phil Poots and that&#x27;s the quotation that starts   the book and that has been the beacon that I have  kept my eye on through the process of telling all   these stories that indeed the universe is filled </p>
<p>with magical [Music] things but this particular   species has reached a point where we have per  perhaps um reached our limit to what we&#x27;re mature   enough to know yeah but uh it does seem like the  information is finding its way by who knows what   force but it is getting out there because we&#x27;re  having this conversation so that brings me to   something that I noticed that was a connection  between Pho and between towns and brown and that   was Einstein&#x27;s influence on both of them now yeah </p>
<p>what was Einstein&#x27;s part as it relates to town and   Brown&#x27;s work early on Einstein himself was looking  for what he called the unified field and I think   this is the better answer to your question so we  know uh over the course of the 19th century it was   determined that electricity and magnetism were  the opposite sides of the same force and become   they are known as one of the four fundamental  forces the one force is called electromagnetism   Einstein in a a similar way was looking for a </p>
<p>connection between all of the known forces at   the time which until we began to get deeper into  quantum mechanics and discover radioactivity in   the strong nuclear force were simply electricity  and gravity Einstein was trying to find equations   that would unify electricity and gravity and that  is what towns and brown thought he had done apart   from the theoretical considerations with the  devices that he was building in the 1920s and   30s that he called gravitator he thought he was </p>
<p>demonstrating a connection between electricity   and gravity so he found that link between gravity  and electricity yeah that had been Elusive and it   was by accident that he found that right um it  was yeah that that you 200 years from now when   we look back on all this and accept um when when  towns and Browns work has gone through the shopow   gauntlet and gone from from ridicule to opposed  to recognizes uh um um the truth all along then   they&#x27;ll go back and look at the way towns and </p>
<p>brown made his discoveries early on as one of   those accidents of science Brown is in a classroom  in in MIT and they&#x27;re doing something with what&#x27;s   called a coolage tube which is an x-ray tube and  and it&#x27;s a tube that uses a very high voltage and   what brown notices when the current is applied  to the tube he notices that the cable applying   the current to the tube the cable itself seems to  Twitch a little bit when the current is applied   that&#x27;s what got his attention and then later </p>
<p>he suspended a coolage tube and some kind of   harness so that when the volt was applied  he could see that it was generating some   kind of thrust and that became the Genesis of his  further studies looking for um some means of not   necessarily producing a gravitational effect but  a propellent less form of thrust and if you turn   it vertically then it&#x27;s sort of Defying Gravity  without any known visible means of of propulsion   and then once he found this how did he go about </p>
<p>showing this to the world what was step number   two um Step number two would take us to he he  did not do well at MIT he was constrained by   the Orthodoxy there he went through the ridicule  phase of his ideas and so he uh he had the means   to move around a bit because his family was quite  affluent wealthy and he went back to Ohio where   he was originally raised had attended a prep  school there that was the prep school for a   place called um Dennison University and uh there </p>
<p>he he went back to to Dennis the um the director   of The Observatory there there was a very uh high  quality academic uh astronomical Observatory there   called The sey Observatory and the director  of that was a man named Paul Alfred beld who   according to Legend was at the Zurich Institute at  the same time as Einstein I guess that would be in   about the 1890s or thereabouts so they Al Biel&#x27;s  name is sometimes associated with with Einstein   but um beld held a common interest in the Quest </p>
<p>for the unified field and was interested in the   potential link between electricity and gravity as  brown was and so the story is that when that brown   posed the question if if there is a link between  electricity and gravity um what instrument might   it resemble and then beld is reputed to have  answered that it would look like a capacitor   which is a device that stores an electric charge  and now this is birth of the Byfield Brown effect   right yeah I I believe it yeah I I think we have </p>
<p>three or four different pronunciations now I call   it the beld brown effect I was sitting in on a  conference over the weekend where they called it   the B the beeld brown effect so it&#x27;s either beld  or Byfield or beeld or I I&#x27;m going to call it the   Bell Brown effect I like the way that sounds  better but yes it&#x27;s the Bell Brown effect and   it Bears both names in part because it was it was  mostly Brown&#x27;s ideas and discoveries but he began   to get traction for it when he discussed it with </p>
<p>his professor at Dennis University Dr Paul Alfred   bill or billed and now this is very important  because this is the basis of his let&#x27;s say let&#x27;s   just use the term anti-gravity so he puts out a  publication electrographic how I control gravity   right and this was basically explaining the bfield  brown effect right right and he describes it at he   called his devices gravits or gravitator so it&#x27;s  it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a a mashup of gravity and capacitor   and and they are built on stacks of capacitors </p>
<p>that that that then when are all stacked together   have this electrically induced uh propellant or  or motion effect and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s described in other   circles as an asymmetric capacitor what we&#x27;re  we&#x27;re observing is that in in the capacitor which   is two elect electrodes electrically electrical  plates that are spaced apart by another substance   called a dialectric and I just happened to have  here before me uh two plates from somebody who   built a sample of a gravitator back in the late </p>
<p>o these These are discs of a a ceramic material   called barium titanate and that&#x27;s the kind  of material that would separate the electron   in one of these gravitator devices and uh the idea  was it was an asymmetric capacitor so you see one   of the plates is much thicker than the other plate  hence the asymmetry and the what the the the basis   of Brown&#x27;s observation was that the negative pole  negatively charged Pole would move toward the   positively charged B but the positively charged </p>
<p>would move away so rather than them being pulled   together in that context at those voltages it had  this thrust effect that&#x27;s the beld Brown effect   once we have this Byfield Brown effect the next  phase in his life I mean nothing really happens   huge with this information he ends up going to the  Navy to continue his work more right he joins the   Navy in 1930 he goes through the basic training  and whether or not this was his intent he finds   his way to the Naval Research Labs which at the </p>
<p>time was the the the the government the militaries   primary scientific physics and Military research  facility and it&#x27;s interesting to note as a sidebar   that what becomes the Manhattan Project as  we get into the 19 late 1930s early 1940s   that project actually had its roots in the Naval  Research labs and one of the people who um is is   portrayed in the movie Oppenheimer and forgetting  the actor&#x27;s name who plays him but his his the   character&#x27;s name is vavar Bush and he was a very </p>
<p>prominent individual in the the top ranks of the   scientific Community during this period and the  Scientific Advisor to a series of presidents but   it was Bush who was instrumental in taking the the  Navy&#x27;s incipient Research into nuclear science and   moving it into the army where it then becomes  the Manhattan Project but Brown goes to work   for the Navy during this period and and and there  there are records of the things that he was doing   using the bifel brown effect and and I I won&#x27;t go </p>
<p>into the the Weeds on it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in the books   but there is one aspect of it which Bears a market  resemblance to the the technology which is at the   heart of the story of The Hunt for Red October  what they call the Magneto hydrodynamic Drive is   the kind of thing that he was developing using not  solid dial electrics but fluid dial electrics like   air and water so this is where the brown Story  begins to get very mysterious to me when I look at   it it seems that this is when he became one of the </p>
<p>Men in Black yeah yeah because much of his work is   hidden behind the secrecy act and he seems to have  all these interactions with u you know the uh in   in military industrial complex some of these  larger private corporations because the Navy   does invest into his work early on right yeah  yeah yeah so they own it from the beginning   were you were you I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the extent  of your interest in Popular Science Fiction but   were you a fan of the HBO series Westworld oh yeah </p>
<p>okay so you do do you remember the the critical   question that Bernard who who granted turns out  to be an Android himself later in the series but   he&#x27;s always asking Dolores this one question  that it will be sort of the determining factor   in whether or not the Androids are a achieving  sensient do you remember what the question was   it was something about um how she feels no it was  do you ever question the nature of your reality   wow yeah so if the Androids had the question </p>
<p>to had the ability to question the nature of   their reality then they were on the edge of the  technology inducing sension in the circuits as   we supposedly have we supposedly have sension in  our neurons in this case we&#x27;re talking about senss   in the circuit and when we begin to talk about  the Men in Black and his towns in brown is his   story a window into the world behind the curtain  then the first question you have to ask yourself   is to what extent are you willing to question </p>
<p>your reality and accept the possibility that   the things that we&#x27;re talking about are able to  be conducted in a way that is completely opaque   to the rest of humanity and it would seem that  this is just the way that the government does business well there there is precedent for it  that&#x27;s called The Manhattan Project nobody knew   that an atomic bomb was being developed until  Harry Truman announced it in August of 1945   and then there&#x27;s also DARPA all the things that </p>
<p>are going on there which I think are and I do   make connections between brown and DARPA but I&#x27;ll  get to that in a second but before before you do   let me let me just back up and add a little bit to  to why we are invited to look behind this curtain   and I I&#x27;ll for the sake of our our our viewers  and listeners I&#x27;ll share the story of trying   to get any information out of the Naval Research  Labs about Browns time there now the expression   that I learned from my covert sources who were </p>
<p>sort of leading me through the um the M shafts   of this Rabbit Hole was that his records had been  sheep dipped which was the The Spook way of saying   that the records had been purged and cleaned now  when I met Linda Brown in 2003 she brought me a   couple of rubbermade tubs that had all of the  the Brown family archives in them and in those   archives I found correspondence between towns and  brown and the Naval Research Labs some of it&#x27;s on   some of it&#x27;s on towns and brown letterhead some </p>
<p>of it&#x27;s on Naval Research Labs letterhead so I   have this documentation so I filed a Freedom of  Information Act request with the Naval Research   labs and simply asked for any or all information  that you can provide provide me about towns and   brown service for the Naval Research labs in  the 1930s in the period from 1933 to 1942 and   the first answer I got back was never heard of  the guy we are unable to find any reference to   towns and brown anywhere in Naval Research records </p>
<p>and at the end of this first response it says you   may appeal this request uh the time limit on the  appeal you must provide the documentation so I   made the photo copies of all the documentation and  I sent it to the address where I could submit the   appeal and a couple of months later I basically  I&#x27;m paraphrasing here I got the reply back that   said never heard of the guy don&#x27;t ask again  that&#x27;s the answer everything you&#x27;re thinking   the answer is yes all right yeah so so um the </p>
<p>extent to which we can peer behind the curtain   and see any glimmers that there&#x27;s truth to the  things that we&#x27;re talking about extends in no   small part to the extent to which you&#x27;re willing  to question the nature of your reality and how   much of these Advanced Technologies already exist  somewhere on Earth is that what we&#x27;re seeing in   all the reported sightings is some unknown force  in control of it and trying to bring mankind to   a point where we can use it and then it just </p>
<p>raises a lot of metaphysical questions that   that challenge the imagination to put it mildly  well I like to look at the observable facts so if   we go back and look at Town&#x27;s experience in the  Navy and what happened after the Navy because he   was asked to go investigate what were they called  the Foo Fighters at the time yeah the alien um or   UFOs anomalies uh that they saw in World War II  and can you explain how that went down because   it&#x27;s almost unbelievable that in untrained you </p>
<p>know basically a nerd at a desk is going to   be doing the things that he was doing so can you  explain what happened we come to the period at the   in the closing months of World War II we&#x27;re into  the the of 1944 and um the Allied Forces are are   sweeping across Western Europe toward Germany and  uh in the fall of 44 some of the the bomber Crews   begin to observe this unexplainable phenomena in  the now I don&#x27;t think the expression UFOs existed   yet that comes a little later but um they observe </p>
<p>these balls of light that seem to be under some   kind of intelligent control that have the ability  to come toward the aircraft the bombers that are   flying over Germany uh fly along with them to some  extent fly around them fly away from them fly back   they seem to be under they don&#x27;t seem to be random  and they are um observed on many occasions I don&#x27;t   know what the actual number is I don&#x27;t know if  anybody knows a a lot of the response to that   was you didn&#x27;t see that but it is a commonly </p>
<p>accepted phenomenon that was observed and for   whatever reason was given again I speculate  in the book The numerous reasons why it was   given the name Foo Fighters and yes if you&#x27;re  wondering the band Foo Fighters gets its name   from that aerial phenomenon that was observed near  the end of World War II so there is all kinds of   Legend and War around um what Nazi Germany was  experimenting with in the way of advanced Aviation   and propulsion we certainly know they were light </p>
<p>years ahead of anybody with with simple propellant   rocketry and that&#x27;s one of one of the stories  is they were determined to get to rer Von Braun   before the Russians did and you probably know he  was instrumental in the development of the Saturn   rockets that took men to the Moon uh and and then  there is speculation that they were involved in   other more far more esoteric Technologies than  simply rocketry um so the story is that uh Brown   um where was he located he he&#x27;s in California uh </p>
<p>and working still at the Vega aircraft plant in   Burbank and when Franklin Roosevelt dies I can  never remember I think it was April 12th 1945   there is a vacuum in the halls of power and and  numerous forces that rush in to fill that vacuum   and in that vacuum towns and brown was asked or  assigned depending on who you ask to make the trip   to Germany for on the surface to investigate the  Foo Fighter phenomenon to see what he could find   out about that and he was also engaged in some </p>
<p>of the other clandestine operations which were   at work at the time one of them was the alsos  program where uh uh American operatives were   actively trying to find out uh where the Germans  were in their atomic research and their atomic   bomb development that was the alsos project um in  um um I&#x27;m spacing on his name and it&#x27;ll come back   to me I&#x27;m sorry but the character the okay in  one case I remember the character&#x27;s name in the   other case I remember the actor the character </p>
<p>that Casey Affleck plays in in Oppenheimer um   he was actually in Char that that that General  was in charge of the alos project and then came   back in in the to America but um so there are a  number of research projects scouring the the the   French and German Countryside looking for German  Technologies and the story is that sometime in   April of 1945 Brown parachuted Behind Enemy Lines  in Germany and became attached to one of these   clandestine research teams and part of the teams </p>
<p>that were searching for German technology in terms   of advanced Aviation science and also advanced  intelligence and signals intelligence technology   and so this is where the story becomes a little  unbelievable where you have to read between the   lines because he was never trained to be a a  sky jumper he wasn&#x27;t airborne and he was out of   the Navy right he did have some military training  because he had gone through basic training to be   in the Navy but he was he was not what you would </p>
<p>what would you would consider he was by no means   a special forces operative right so here he that  might have been the one and only time he jumped   out of an airplane this is where we have to kind  of use our own judgment and say all right was he   really out of the military maybe this is um like  the movie True Lies he had another position that   we don&#x27;t know about he didn&#x27;t just jump out with  no training yeah and and from a low altitude which   makes it all the more perilous and they didn&#x27;t </p>
<p>just choose him to send him to his death they knew   he could get it done yeah yeah so you look at that  and then after this he starts becoming the person   that they go to to inspect other UFO sightings and  crashes yeah there&#x27;s another famous one where he   has first access to view the materials to which  materials uh there&#x27;s another famous crash around   that time where that&#x27;s a story that that that that  did not there there are stories about Brown having   access to materials of Unknown Origin and I I </p>
<p>didn&#x27;t really only have direct access to those   stories but I I see references to them from time  to time so I&#x27;m not able to speak directly to those   particular cases and there I think we&#x27;re getting  more into the 1950s than the 1940s and and there   are no detailed records of what his activity  was for as long as he was in Europe in in 19   in 1945 after this he now is in fact ated with  UFOs right he starts studying them he even coins   the term aial phenomena yeah that&#x27;s that actually </p>
<p>yeah it&#x27;s interesting to me that we now come back   to the expression aerial phenomena because Brown  used that phrase in the 1950s when he formed or   was instrumental in the formation of one of the  first citizen aerial phenomena research committees   now now we&#x27;re talking about something that forms  around 1955 called naikap it&#x27;s that&#x27;s the national   investigations committee on aerial phenomena  now I can&#x27;t tell you with any certainty when   the the the term UFO first entered the vernacular </p>
<p>that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about to me it&#x27;s I find   it curious for inexplicable reasons that after  years and years of talking about UFOs is say   no let&#x27;s call them aerial phenomena but that&#x27;s  the expression that brown used to describe them   and and the inference that we&#x27;re circling here is  that to whatever extent he became aware of these   aerial phenomena he wanted to try to identify what  technology propelled them and to see what he could   maybe fathom that he might be able to like reverse </p>
<p>engineer from and whether it was associated with   any of the technologies that he himself had  explored in in the course of his research   into the field that he called electrogravitics  this now shapes his work because he comes with   a a theory of how these machines surf the wave can  you explain how he said that worked well um there   there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a couple of moving Parts there  um and it has to do again I spoke earlier about   the the distinction between the fluid dialectric </p>
<p>versus the solid dialectric so he was he was   interested he he never liked to use the Expression  um anti-gravity he was always curious about what   he called stress in dielectrics that was the  phrase that he used so he was interested in how   the phenomena manifest in these dialectric devices  and there are two kinds of dial electrics there&#x27;s   a fluid dialect electric which is something like  air or water and then there&#x27;s the solid dialectric   when we started our conversation talking about </p>
<p>the Ionic Breeze Air Purifier which uses the beld   brown effect to move air without any moving Parts  it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the the difference between the the size   and shape of the capacitors that&#x27;s moving the air  but the air is the fluid dialectric in that case   um so when you&#x27;re talking about surfing the wave  we&#x27;re talking I think about the fluid dialectric   concept and where it has been speculated to  be in use today is in the B2 bomber and and   so there is a fair amount of conjecture and lore </p>
<p>on the internet that in and and it&#x27;s a big part   of some of uh uh Nick Brown Nick Cook&#x27;s book on  the subject that they did in fact use the bifel   brown effect in the B2 bomber and so what we&#x27;re  suggesting is that remember the the basic premise   was that in the Bill Brown effect the negative  pole chases the positive pole the front wing of   the bomber is charged positively and a negative  cloud is generated in the exhaust and there&#x27;s an   apparatus that brown invented that helped with </p>
<p>that process as well so you have a negative   Cloud behind chasing the positively charged and it  creates the difference between the negative charge   and the positive charge creates this electrostatic  wave and and and the B2 bomber is effectively   standing on that wave the way a surfboard stands  on a wave of water and the speculation is that the   B2 bomber can fly much more efficiently at very  high altitudes where there&#x27;s much less air to bite   on the air the the curved surface of the air frame </p>
<p>because it has this other effect helping keep it   a loft and I think one thing to mention about  that B2 bomber that&#x27;s interesting as well is that   it was developed by DARPA with northr Grumman  and yeah did northrope have any connection to   towns and brown um okay I&#x27;m I you know it&#x27;s  all part of the same what Eisenhower called   the military-industrial complex and um the the  answer to your question is a qualified yes because   northp Grumman was was primarily instrumental in </p>
<p>the development of the B2 bomber I&#x27;m not sure how   we get from towns and Brown&#x27;s demonstration for  the Rand Corporation in the mid 1960s to that   technology being handed off to northr Grumman but  that&#x27;s where the connection is I thought I read   that Northrup bought Brown&#x27;s company so everyone&#x27;s  got to really read your book to get the details on   all this I be the first to admit that I tried to  bring I&#x27;m not a train journalist but I understand   because I&#x27;ve Seen All the President&#x27;s Men so I </p>
<p>understand the basic precepts of investigative   journalism that you have to have two sources  before you can run with a story and I tried   to verify the stories that were being given to  me by the covert sources that were helping me   unearth all this stuff but this is not verifiable  Material the material has all been sheep dipped   you go to the you go to the National Archives and  there&#x27;s no records of any of this stuff you file   a fo request with the the Naval Research </p>
<p>labs when you have the documentation of   the relationship and they say never heard of the  guy don&#x27;t ask again and and so I&#x27;d be the first to   admit I reached my limit and I&#x27;d been working on  the story for six years in 2009 and had written a   500 odd page first draft just dumping everything  I could into it um and then when I went to begin   to try to carve out a second draft I couldn&#x27;t make  sense any of the material and I ran screaming with   my hair on fire out of the room for 13 years </p>
<p>that&#x27;s why I want to you had all your hair at   the time you should say that well yeah yeah you  now you look like Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld   combined I don&#x27;t know how that happened okay but  here&#x27;s now what I want to ask have all their money   here&#x27;s what I want to ask because you bring up  the secrecy about him um I even looked into this   they said said in just in the year 2010 alone  there were over 5,000 inventions that were held   back because of the invention secrecy act meaning </p>
<p>that they were held by the government because they   thought they had military application um which  was obviously applied to Brown&#x27;s work do you feel   that he was part of the reason for the secrecy  and he was working for the government working   for these private um defense contractors and  he&#x27;s part of the reason why we have the secrecy   act okay again you&#x27;re your your the the um the  premise to your question the prologue to your   question is how far do you want to cross that line </p>
<p>where we question the nature of our reality and   when when I Venture far enough across that line  to offer an answer to your question then the   answer that I come up with is my speculation that  Townsen Brown was the Oppenheimer of the entire   realm of black Government research projects  Oppenheimer was focused on the one thing to   develop the atomic bomb and you have kind of  the model there for how a government can create   a project and can and keep it a relative secret </p>
<p>within the realm of public knowledge and I I would   offer the supposition the hypothesis that brown  brown was the individual working at that level   on a much broader scope of secret government  projects and when you say there are thousands   of projects that are withheld because of their  potential military or national security applic   I I would I would I would entertain the hypothesis  that there is somebody who governs that whole   process and for some time I think that could </p>
<p>have been towns and brown yes right because it   started in 1951 he was working with them in  1951 maybe he knew the power of what he had   was so immense that it had to be controlled  and had to keep under reps and I think to Ty   this all up I like that you mentioned how today  we call it aial phenomena again because maybe   what we&#x27;re looking at is really just some of the  evolution of towns and Brown&#x27;s work and that&#x27;s   why they&#x27;re around military bases and that&#x27;s where </p>
<p>they go no these aren&#x27;t UFOs yeah these are real   phenomena these are ours okay so so so when we  get to this part of the conversation I I I offer   three explanations for these phenomena they are  either visitations from elsewhere in the cosmos   or they are our own technologies that are somehow  getting out from under wraps or there&#x27;s somebody   coming from other period they are ourselves from  other places in time take your pick now let&#x27;s   tie this all back to your theory that involves Pho </p>
<p>farnworth okay because to rip a hole or to be able   to control time through gravity you would need  really immense power yeah well so you you kind   of made the jump there from controlling gravity to  controlling time and that&#x27;s the other connection   between um general relativity and um and what  brown was working on because when we spoke   earlier about uh gravity being the effect of the  curvature in space caused by the presence of large   objects like planets and stars I misspoke because </p>
<p>the way Einstein put it in general relativity we   are talking about the the interwoven fabric  of the cosmos called space time so so we&#x27;re   not talking about simply a curvature in space but  we&#x27;re talking about the curvature in the SpaceTime   Continuum and so now we&#x27;re we&#x27;re into an even  farther reaching um realm of speculation where   if you have the ability to control gravity you&#x27;re  in theory inducing some kind of AR artificial   curvature and so if you if you can curve space you </p>
<p>can also curve time so we&#x27;ll come back to that if   necessary later that&#x27;s where the that&#x27;s where the  the Curiosity about the potential for time travel   comes in all this conversation but what you&#x27;re  referring to where I made the connection decided   I had to run with this because I had the knowledge  of these two lost Technologies and we only talked   a little bit about the start about the thing that  intrigued me the most when I first learned about   pho Farnsworth yeah I was into television and I </p>
<p>was experimenting with alternate forms of video   production but when I heard about the nuclear  fusion work that was what got my attention and   and um I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t have illustrations  I can show you but they&#x27;re all over the web   he he was experimenting with a very for lack of a  better desktop nuclear fusion he was talking about   a a a reactor not much larger than a soccer ball  that in his imagination would be able to produce   megawatts of electricity there is a nuclear fusion </p>
<p>the prospect of something called direct conversion   we&#x27;re dealing with charged particles here and  if you get enough of those charged particles   and we&#x27;re talking about billions or trillions of  them they come off as electricity so this is not   the kind of nuclear reactor where you&#x27;re using  the power of the atom the same way we use the   power of coal where you&#x27;re simply using it  as a source of heat to boil water to create   steam to spin a turbine to spin a generator </p>
<p>to generate electricity a fusion reactor has   the ability to Simply produce electricity so  My ultimate speculation is the towns and that   Pho Farnsworth imagined his device that he called  the fuser producing megawatts of electricity and   then I make the connection between that and uh  towns and Browns gravity control devices because   they require extraordinarily high voltages at  extremely low amperages and so my speculation   is that what brown was looking for when he was </p>
<p>curious about aerial phenomena was he wanted to   know what propelled them and I am offering the  hypothesis that whether those craft are being   developed in secrecy by people here on Earth or  somebody somewhere else in the cosmos has figured   this out that we are talking about Technologies  based on the High voltages produced by nuclear   fusion to produce an artificial gravity effect  in something like Brown&#x27;s gravitator so cool   that&#x27;s the connection between these two stories </p>
<p>that is the gift from the universe of magical   things that&#x27;s still waiting for human wits to  get sharper before we&#x27;re really going to give   access to it um if it&#x27;s out there we don&#x27;t know  well the universe has been around for 14 billion   years somebody humans have walked the Earth for  oh a 100,000 or so but it&#x27;s only in the last   300 years that we have identified any of these  magical forces starting with electricity in the   in the N late 18th early 19th centuries that led </p>
<p>to the discovery of the weak and strong nuclear   forces and I would argue that those Explorations  kind of reached the limit of um I the higher   power&#x27;s willingness to share its information with  us on August 6 1945 because I just saw what we did   in Hiroshima and said okay if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re  gonna do with it that&#x27;s enough you know there&#x27;s   there&#x27;s a great L one of my favorite if if you saw  the presentation that I did which I think I can   release here in the next couple of weeks but the </p>
<p>presentation that I did for the cosmic sub my I   keep coming back to Oppenheimer because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s  really the most recent broadly popular exploration   of what we&#x27;re talking about here that force that  binds all that binds the universe together and   Mankind&#x27;s uh um Native ability to begin to get a  handle that there&#x27;s a marvelous scene this time   I remember uh both of the characters and actors  names where it&#x27;s the scene where Oppenheimer is   wearing his uniform at Los Alamos because Leslie </p>
<p>Groves wants him to wear uniforms and be part of   the military and he talking to the actor&#x27;s name is  I think David Crum Holtz and he&#x27;s playing Isidor   Robbie who was another theoretical physicist from  this period and Oppenheimer is recruiting Robbie   to come to Los Alamos and Robbie is saying that  Oppenheimer is spread too thin and Oppenheimer   draws on the chalkboard there&#x27;s there&#x27;s one thing  here and one thing here and here&#x27;s this and then   there&#x27;s theoretical here and that&#x27;s when Robbie </p>
<p>says you&#x27;re spread too thin and Oppenheimer turns   to Robbie and says can you take theoretical  and Robbie takes a long pause he takes a seat   and he turns and he looks at Oppenheimer and  he says very dramatically I&#x27;m not coming here   Robert Oppenheimer pauses and says why not and he  says when you drop a bomb that lands on the just   as well as the unjust I don&#x27;t want the culmin  of 300 years of physics to be a weapon of mass destruction I&#x27;m offering a different culmination </p>
<p>of 300 years of physics and speculating that this   species these Apes with nukes have got to get  past what&#x27;s holding us back before the higher   intelligence governing our presence in the  universe is going to let that out from under   wraps what a great message and I think that&#x27;s  the best place to end it on thank you so much   for sharing like I said I love this story both  the stories are great I&#x27;m going to go back and   read the pho book now but everybody should go get </p>
<p>the um the uh the the man who controlled gravity   man who mastered gravity well we&#x27;ll start with  the boy who invented at television and then the   man who mastered gravity and and I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll  wrap up by saying that that what is compelling   about these stories is that there are dimensions  of them that regardless of my inability to verify   the sources these are real people who did real  things and some of their work remains with us   the most obvious manifestation of which is </p>
<p>the fact that you and I are talking to each   other right now through a video screen and  everything that we&#x27;re talking about started   with the technology and the cosmology that gave  us video yeah that&#x27;s undeniable whatever else   you want to say about all this off-the-wall  speculative stuff the video is real and it   started in the same place yeah it&#x27;s all magic  yeah it is a universe of magical things thank   you yeah well thank you so much uh Paul really </p>
<p>appreciated that it&#x27;s been great talking to you</p>
