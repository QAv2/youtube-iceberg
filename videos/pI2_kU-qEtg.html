            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel where we discuss different mostly theories of everything uh theories of everything that you probably have never heard of cosmologies systems of theory and all-encompassing theories that attempt to describe some type of unified um reality and today is video number 178 on the reciprocal system of theory and this theory was first proffered by Dewey B Larson in the 20th century he died back in 1990 but not before he wrote many books and a lot of articles on the reciprocal system the basic idea on the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe of motion not a universe of matter not a universe of energy but a universe of motion and other people have come up with that before that idea Thomas Hobbes Arthur Eddington Renee Descartes and others have posited the idea of a universe of motion but Larson distinguished himself by defining motion or redefining motion as the relationship between space and time now if we just use our common sense and go into what we do know about motion that at least holds true in the first instance what we do know is uh there&#x27;s speed speed is a kind of motion it&#x27;s a way to measure motion and speed is in fact a relationship between space and time the car is moving 30 miles per hour 30 miles of space in one hour of time space over time speed is space over time um and so that is true for what we know now uh what Larson is also saying is that every scientific kind of phenomena that we know of is also a relationship between space and time but you can&#x27;t tell because it&#x27;s a little bit more complicated than that because time and space both have their coordinate aspects we know space is multi-dimensional three or more Dimensions we use XYZ coordinates uh euclidean coordinates to graph out space or time or space but we also uh uh time also has its coordinate aspects so time is also three or more Dimensions so when you are looking at your basic quantities well speed is time over space but there are other um permutations of relationships between space or time because time can come in one two three or more dimensions and so for example Larson eventually derived the idea that matter is timed to the third power over space to the third power other quantities are similar electrical capacitance was discovered by the Bruce Perrette Dr Bruce Perrette one of his followers I wouldn&#x27;t say followers but you know one of the people who worked on the reciprocal system um as uh space to the third power over time acceleration we know to be space over time to the second power I dropped the ball at 9.8 meters per second squared that is acceleration uh the converse of that or conjugate of that is force force is time over space to the second power and we&#x27;ve got energy energy is simply time over space magnetic flux is timed to the second power over space to the second power and so on and on and on so every scientific quantity that we know of is a relationship between space and time space and time both have their coordinate aspects they can be in one two or three dimensions they also have their clock aspects and this brings in the concept of scalar motion a scalar motion is like speed it&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but has no particular direction that&#x27;s really the difference between speed and velocity speed is a scalar motion because it&#x27;s the car is moving 30 miles per hour to convert speed to Velocity you have to add the direction now the velocity would be the car is moving 30 miles per hour due east or something like that that would turn the speed into velocity but a scalar motion really can be envisioned using a balloon and a magic marker put some dots on the balloon with a magic marker and you blow up the balloon and you eventually um recognize that all of the dots are moving away from each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any particular direction it&#x27;s really all directions that&#x27;s a scalar motion and um if you suck in the balloon then they are moving inward toward each other that is also a scalar motion what you would call an inward scalar motion so the only direction that scalar motion has is in or out now also space and time both have their discrete aspects meaning that they only come in chunks there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space they&#x27;re not continuous and when you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light so the speed of light is one in Larson&#x27;s system um in uh so that basically means Larson system is more like a reciprocal meaning that it&#x27;s multiplicative uh when you have the reciprocal of two-thirds that is three halves when you take the two reciprocals and you multiply them together you get one that is so one is really the uh origin of the other two it uh the other two come out of that one and so this one that is the speed of light is really the origin of that of this universe of motion and then there&#x27;s half of the universe that is above that and half of the universe that is below that Einstein observed that second half that that uh because Einstein said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe that is true of the lower half the half that is slower than the speed of light Larson calls that the material sector but then there is the cosmic sector where the speed of light is actually the minimum speed of the universe Larson calls that the cosmic sector Einstein knew nothing about that and uh uh Legacy science knows nothing about it either even to this date and um but the speed of light is the midpoint of that so that&#x27;s kind of how things get constructed now we&#x27;re looking at his um 1979 book called Nothing But motion and this is primarily a book on physics uh Atomic physics and we are looking at his chapter 10 called atoms and he&#x27;s kind of was going over the periodic table basically you get atoms out of a combination of different kinds of motion there are really four kinds of motion there is your translational motion there is your vibrational motion there is your rotational motion and then there is your rotational vibration and berries can come in one two or three dimensions and you combine them to get um all the atoms so the atoms are really first for an atom you need to have photons the photon for Larson is a combination of a translational Motion in one uh One Direction and a vibrational Motion in a perpendicular Direction when you combine the two you get a sine wave now other people have followed Larson and disagreed with that analysis and they say that kvk neru in particular and Bruce paret have said that that a sine wave is actually the product of a bi-rotating motion to counter rotations when they are combined that also creates a sine wave which is the Epsilon function of Leonard Euler and um so I&#x27;m inclined to believe that by rotating Photon but um but for now we&#x27;re going to go with this Photon that Larson has come up with now when you have these photons then when you start rotating them you rotate this in a perpendicular Direction and then you get a disc and you rotate the disc and then you have a sphere so there are two two primary two magnetic rotations which are two dimensional rotations that comprise the atom and then there is an optional electric rotation which is basically a spinning of that entire sphere that uh also creates the kind of the gaps in the periodic table and Larson has a chart here a table that he uh he lists all of the elements and their three number components we went over this a little bit so for example um oxygen is element number eight on the periodic table but in Larson&#x27;s nomenclature it is two uh two-dimensional primary magnetic rotations to secondary magnetic rotations and one uh I&#x27;m sorry two negative electric rotations and he builds up the whole periodic table in this manner uh so uh if you&#x27;d like to see that you have to download this book and you&#x27;d be able to look at his whole chart here in chapter 10. we&#x27;re just going to go over the text here uh and maybe indicate a few different things about the table um the final two groups of elements in table table three contain two times four squared or 32 members each the heaviest elements of the last group have not yet been observed as they are highly radioactive and consequently unstable in the terrestrial environment in fact uranium element number 92 is the heaviest that exists naturally on Earth in any substantial quantities as we will see later however there are other conditions under which the elements all the way up to uh 117 are stable this has to do with what Larson calls the uh ionization level and he&#x27;ll get into that a little bit later okay for convenience in the subsequent discussion these groups of elements will be identified by the magnetic n value with the first and second groups in each pair being designated A and B respectively thus the sodium Group which is the second of the eight element groups n equals two will be called group 2B at this point it will be appropriate to refer back to the statement that was made in chapter nine the mathematical development will begin with nothing more than the series of cardinal numbers and the geometry of three dimensions by subjecting these two simple mathematical processes the applicability of which to the physical Universe of motion is specified in the fundamental postulates the combinations of rotational motions that can exist in the theoretical universe will be ascertained and it will be shown that these rotational combinations that theoretically can exist can be individually identified with the atoms of the chemical elements and subatomic particles that are observed to exist in the physical Universe a unique group of numbers representing the different rotational components will be derived for each of these combinations a review of the manner in which the figures presented in tables one to three were derived will show that this commitment so far as it implies applies to the elements has been carried out in full this is a very significant accomplishment both the existence of a series of theoretical elements identical with the observed series of chemical elements and the numerical values which theoretically characterize each individual element have been derived from the general properties of mathematics and geometry without making any supplementary of assumptions or introducing any numerical values specifically applicable to matter the possibility that the agreement between the series of elements thus derived and the known chemical elements could be accidental is negligible and this derivation is in itself conclusive proof that the the atoms of matter are combinations of motions as asserted by the reciprocal system of theory but this is only the beginning of a vast process of mathematical development the numerical values at which we have arrived the atomic numbers and the three displacement values for each element now provide us with the basis from which we can derive the quantitative relations in the areas we will examine that&#x27;s very important so the fact that Larson can derive the entire periodic table from Theory strictly from Theory is for you know according to him is conclusive proof that that&#x27;s how it is derived comes out of theory and now when Larson says that we&#x27;re looking uh of the vast process of mathematical development and that this is all um properties of mathematics and geometry unlike Legacy science when they say stuff like that when they&#x27;re talking about mathematics and geometry they&#x27;re talking about differential equations and third third level differential equations and all this complicated math Larson is pretty much talking about counting a simple addition and multiplication and subtraction and occasionally maybe getting into a little algebra and possibly a tiny bit of calculus well he&#x27;s talking about simple math that most people can follow when he&#x27;s talking about math and geometry as well euclidean geometry pretty much it&#x27;s complex it&#x27;s difficult it&#x27;s difficult to follow Larson with his visualizations that you do to kind of imagine how these things are are you know happen but it is doable and it&#x27;s not very difficult whereas when the scientists you know go to the math and geometry they&#x27;re really kind of just doing it to exclude you oh you know this will leave everybody in the dust because nobody knows this kind of math and so you can&#x27;t check our work and so we can make stuff up um okay we&#x27;ll continue here with Larson the behavior characteristics or properties of the elements are functions of their respective displacements some are related to the total net effective displacement equal to the atomic number in the combinations thus far discussed some are related to the electric displacement others to the magnetic displacement while still others follow a more complex pattern for instance valence or chemical combining power is determined by either the electric displacement or one of the magnetic displacements while the inter-atomic distance is affected by both the electric and magnetic displacement but in different ways the manner in which the magnitudes of these properties for specific elements and compounds can be calculated from the displacement values has been determined for many properties and for many classes of substances these subjects will be considered individually in the chapters that follow and in addition uh this is the first volume of a three volume set here called the structure of the physical Universe Edition two and uh the second volume of the set is actually called basic properties of matter and he goes over all of the major basic properties of matter and he derives uh their their properties of by Theory strictly from Theory and so his first chapter is called compressibility in that in that book and so um actually yeah I believe that&#x27;s the first chapter uh he he goes over every element and he derives what their compressibility and in another chapter he goes over say the melting point of each one of these atoms and he derives strictly from Theory what the melting point is of these various elements uh and he&#x27;s uh you know 95 percent within the experimental um you know error value of the actual melting point of these various uh elements and compounds and then he has another chapter where he you know goes over the specific heat or um you know like you said the valence other properties of matter the inter-atomic distance he derives all of these various uh empirical qualities of atoms and compounds strictly from Theory and they agree with the actual values so that is um you know that is an accomplishment that has not been made by anybody okay uh we&#x27;re gonna go one more paragraph here one of the most significant advances toward an understanding of the relations between the structures of the different chemical elements and their properties was the development of the periodic table by Mendeleev in 1869. in this diagram the elements are arranged horizontally in periods and vertically in groups in order uh the order within the period being that of the atomic number approximately defined in the original work by the atomic weights when the elements are correctly assigned in the periods those in the vertical groups are quite similar in their properties on comparing the periodic table with the rotational characteristics of the elements as tabulated in this chapter it is evident that the horizontal periods reflect the magnetic rotational displacement while the vertical groups represent the electric rotational displacement in revising the table to take advantage of the additional information derived from the reciprocal system of theory we may therefore replace the usual group and period numbering by the more meaningful displacement values okay we&#x27;re gonna leave it there take over tomorrow I appreciate you tuning in have a great day</p>
