            <p>Folks, if you are watching this on YouTube, thank you so much. And don&#x27;t forget to like, subscribe, and comment if you are enjoying the content. It means the world of difference to me. It makes a massive difference to the channel and the algorithm. So, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Let me put you back to the show now. Hi everyone and welcome back to That UFO podcast. As always, my name is Andy and this is your news update for the middle of December 2025. I planned on having a couple of more shows out this month, but I&#x27;ve had a bit of an illness that&#x27;s going around in the UK. I see Ross Coloular on NewsNation is struggling with a bit of a lurgy at the moment as well.</p>
<p>So, it certainly hit me in the last week or so. So, I&#x27;ve got a bit of a thumping headache at the moment, but there was so much news to discuss. I didn&#x27;t want to leave this too much later, to be honest. So, lots to get through and and anyone waiting on the Joe McMongle interview. It will still be happening right before the interview.</p>
<p>Joe had a medical incident and he is currently recovering in hospital. So, all the best to Joe. Thoughts and prayers with him. He He&#x27;s okay, but he will be coming back on. and he&#x27;s still in touch with me and I look forward to catching up with Joe McMongle real real soon.</p>
<p>But listen, onto the news update folks and it&#x27;s looking like a really busy December for UFO news and drops across across various fronts. Even at the start of this week, USA Today ran a front page uh real serious piece on the society for UAP studies and Michael Sony uh I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of seeing Michael speak and maybe some of this is the impact from the age of disclosure documentary starting to turn mainstream heads. Maybe they&#x27;re starting to look further a field into the UFO topic and going look who else is studying this? Maybe USA Today, as far as I&#x27;m aware, is a pretty serious mainstream mainstream news outlet. They&#x27;re looking at this topic and wondering, okay, we&#x27;ve got all these major governmental figures coming through, but where are the academics? Who can we find out? And the UAP Studies Society has been picked up. So, fantastic work and great to see that they&#x27;re getting some acknowledgement from that.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s get into the news, folks, because a lot to cover in a short space of time here. Um, first off, you you may have seen Ross Kular a couple of days ago um had Luis Alzando on for a rare interview. Uh, Luis Alzando doesn&#x27;t do too many of those interviews these days, but he does pop up now and again on a couple of selected outlets, including with Ross Kulart on NewsNation. Now, Luis Alzando wrote a memo to President Trump in January. It&#x27;s dated 2024, January 2024, but apparently was written for this year.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s already a pain because for those who pour over details and mistakes and issues and little little inaccuracies, the date&#x27;s already framing some of this discussion and people are pouring over it and it&#x27;s Why is it coming up now, etc., etc. Um, but let me go through I&#x27;m going to go through the summary of what the memo has in it and then some of the discussion that that Ross and Lou had because there&#x27;s some nice back and forward and some answers worth picking up on. So for those who don&#x27;t know, Luis Alzando is a former counter intelligence officer. His book Eminent was a New York Times bestseller. He ran the US government&#x27;s ATIP program which followed on from OAP back in uh 2017.</p>
<p>He left the New York Times article came out and the rest as they say is history. So um the memo itself focuses on one central idea and that is the United States is falling behind on emerging all domain technologies or EAT for the love of Christ another acronym I could do without I&#x27;m sure many of you are thinking the same thing but emerging all domain technologies and it needs a whole of government plan to catch up around EAD um it&#x27;s an umbrella term covering drones humanmade and otherwise UAP and other advanced systems operating through air, space, sea, and more. According to Alzando, these technologies are evolving fast. They&#x27;re showing up in places they shouldn&#x27;t, and they&#x27;re putting American national security at risk. And as we know, these are now occurring around Europe and no doubt other places as well.</p>
<p>Um, I&#x27;ve got no issue with the the UE umbrella and term being used or EADT because I do think a lot of this phenomenon that people are reporting or misidentifying or misreporting or sensationalizing unfortunately for a lot of it is is drones or misidentifications. And even um on the Discord for this podcast, which you get access to if you&#x27;re a paid member, um some of the guys in there were discussing the fact that there are some really cool balloons. And I think the problem, and people mention balloons at all with the UFO topic, is you think party balloons, you think Batman balloons and all that argument from a few years ago, there are some incredibly advanced balloon technologies, believe it or not, that are, I think, are being misidentified or even used for spying and all that kind of stuff as well, folks. But let&#x27;s go into it because again, some of this is anomalous, genuinely anomalous. And let me stress that, especially to you, the camera watching me.</p>
<p>Some of this is genuinely anomalous. Um, Alzando breaks it into two parts. He says, &quot;First, drones.&quot; He points to conflicts like Ukraine where advanced drones have been completely reshaping modern warfare. I see a lot of videos, especially on Facebook and my algorithm for some reason of drones attacking uh Russian and Ukrainian targets and stuff like that. And these are incredibly advanced now.</p>
<p>You see some of them flying inside like empty small rooms and going around locations. And then obviously they have explosive devices attached and and different things. Um rogue actors, criminals, and even foreign governments are using these systems to bypass traditional defenses. I&#x27;ve had conversations with folks who will talk about how drug cartels are spending millions and millions of dollars on advanced drones to ship uh drugs across borders to try and not be caught, especially at the weakened areas of border control. Inside the US, drones are routinely violating restricted airspace.</p>
<p>And now we know across Europe, Belgium&#x27;s had a lot of issues recently, including military and nuclear facilities. Nuclear facilities are a really sensitive one. And the response from federal, state, and local agencies is inconsistent and often ineffective. Personally, again, as a bit of a layman, I don&#x27;t think a lot of the authorities are are prepared or capable of dealing with even the most basic of drone incursions, regardless of there being hobbyists or something more sinister. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>I just I would say that&#x27;s the case. Um, the second thing he breaks down from drones are UAP, genuine UAP, and he says these are even more concerning. They demonstrate capabilities that don&#x27;t match anything the US currently understands. Meanwhile, America&#x27;s adversaries are aggressively studying them and trying to exploit the technology. I I can&#x27;t imagine the US aren&#x27;t doing the same thing.</p>
<p>You know, you know, he argues that US efforts, including the Pentagon&#x27;s Arrow Office, are bogged down by bureaucracy, and a culture of secrecy that&#x27;s eroding public trust. The end result is what he calls failures, steep price, unfocused research, weaker technology compared to adversaries, poor transparency, and the public is increasingly suspicious of government&#x27;s handling of this issue. Need I say more than going back to when the the Biden administration was being really quiet on the whole drone flap, Trump&#x27;s administration as they were finishing their campaign to, you know, when we get in, if we get in, we&#x27;re going to tell you what this stuff is. And they didn&#x27;t. You know, Biden didn&#x27;t, Trump didn&#x27;t, so you know, what&#x27;s the difference? Um, they came out and said it was a FAA approved.</p>
<p>The FAA came out and said that was nonsense. So, again, transparency is severely lacking. Alzando says essentially folks and throughout the interview with with Kulartar I&#x27;ll go over some of the highlights that the solution to this is an EAD ZAR and that is CZ A basically leader or or role at the head of government part of that a major uh structural change appoint a senior adviser to the president with that title EATZAR something like that the adviser would coordinate the entire government&#x27;s response to drones UAP and related technologies they would develop national policy and a long-term strategy and serve as the president&#x27;s lead communicator on this issue to Congress, the media, and the public. He argues that giving this job to an existing Pentagon or in intelligence official wouldn&#x27;t work. They&#x27;re already overloaded and they may not have the authority or access needed to take charge.</p>
<p>Some folks may be um looking at this or hearing this and thinking, well, isn&#x27;t this Lazando suggesting a job or role for himself? Perhaps it&#x27;s it&#x27;s been muted before. Would he take that role? I imagine he would. It sounds like a little bit like a a pre-in or or kind of pitching the job. Um would he be qualified to do it? I can&#x27;t say that he wouldn&#x27;t given his history, his involvement uh and his continued media presence and and media training now. Um but I&#x27;m sure there would be other folks who would be less happy with Lou getting that position, taking over that position.</p>
<p>But I think that would be the case for anyone. Um a lot of folks, I imagine, would say David Grush should be in charge. Other folks would say it should be someone completely new, completely neutral. We had that kind of with Arrow and Sean Kirkpatre which turned out to not be so neutral. Um it&#x27;s a real difficult one.</p>
<p>Is the position relevant? I think so. How it&#x27;s carried out, I don&#x27;t know. But um some of the things AAR would would do essentially giving what Lazando says in the memo and in the interview is unifying federal, state, local, and tribal reporting and response systems. So bringing all that in under one umbrella and into one house which makes sense. Integrating intelligence capabilities and streamlining data sharing.</p>
<p>Leading discussions inside the National Security Council. Guiding a national intelligence estimate on UAP and other emerging technologies. Providing assessments on how EADT affect national security, economics and foreign policy. Accessing all classified UAP information and advising on what should be classified. strengthen strengthening laws to protect the homeland from EADT threats.</p>
<p>I hate that I hate that acronym Christ. And accelerating research in advanced propulsion and related technologies with help from academia and private industry. So in short, this role would pull together all those scattered and broken fragmented pieces that the US and government and other aspects of the government are involved in and treat it like a solid solid god I&#x27;m going to say thing. What a terrible way to put that. But you know uh treat it properly.</p>
<p>give it a role, give it a place. And I think having a real figurehead to look at for this would be really beneficial. I don&#x27;t know how folks, for example, in the Air Force, the legacy program, the gatekeepers would see that, but I think it&#x27;s one that we maybe just have to find out. And the kind of final message there in that memo is he ends it by saying, &quot;The situation is rapidly evolving. Challenges are inevitable and the US has to be proactive.&quot; He argues the moment is right politically and strategically to take action and to communicate more honestly with the American public.</p>
<p>He offers his own help and says that many in Congress and the national security would see this as a once in a-lifetime chance to finally make progress. So I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll say for the first time in this in this update folks I&#x27;d be interested to know your thoughts on on that and would you want Luzando as the UAPs are? Would you want someone else and why? Is the position relevant? Is it not? I&#x27;d love to know your take on that, folks. Really would. Oh, and I suppose a good place to drop in. I&#x27;m doing an end of year AMA.</p>
<p>Ask me anything. Any and all questions from this year, next year, whatever it might be, send them over. Use thatodcast.com/cont. Oops, I&#x27;ve got my notification on the PC. Or you can email ufouapamgmail.com.</p>
<p>All those links are in the descriptions below. Let get in touch with me. Send over a question. If you have and I&#x27;ve not been in touch yet, sorry, please resend it. that would be great.</p>
<p>Um, but if you&#x27;ve sent over something, I&#x27;ve got quite a few already. Look forward to hearing from you. So, some of the highlights from Ross Kulart&#x27;s News Nation piece. Ross asks Lou if President Trump had received this memo directly. Lou can&#x27;t answer whether or not he has had time to read it or even if then he means Trump or even if Trump&#x27;s staff have had time to read it, but he hopes someone has.</p>
<p>Ross asks why he combined UP and human drones in the memo. And I said, folks, personally, I think that&#x27;s fair and it doesn&#x27;t show a bias or assumption. I think we need that approach, especially in the public, especially in the mainstream, we have to appear open to different possibilities. The folks who go too far left or too far right in any conversation, whatever way you want to take it, like I say, if I look at this topic and think of this the skeptics being on the far left, the debunkers, the real hardcore debunkers, everything&#x27;s and the far right everything&#x27;s UAP. You need to be more central.</p>
<p>I would say I&#x27;m I&#x27;m right of central on that argument. I want stuff to be UAP UFO, but I know not everything is less than less than 10% is going to be truly anomalous. But I don&#x27;t give a  that 90% isn&#x27;t. I care about the stuff that is anomalous. That&#x27;s the interesting stuff.</p>
<p>The real meat and bones, nuts and bolts, woo, whatever it is, that&#x27;s the interesting stuff in this topic and that&#x27;s what drives it forward. Ross asks uh oh so yeah um Ross asks why Lou combined UAP and drones. Um Lou says that EADT is a large umbrella and with so many emerging technologies it&#x27;s important to understand what&#x27;s in our skies. Ross asks him if the president was poorly advised when the administration said back in late January 2025 that the drones were FAA authorized and we know that is part at least. Lou talks about this being down to too many branches of government not communicating.</p>
<p>He gets again at the US government needing that UAP ZAR um ahead to go to on this topic. He does reference and Alzando references multiple times in this interview in our skies, but nothing about the water. I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s deliberate or not. You know, space, air, water, all equally important, especially the water discussion. I can see that really getting more traction in the mainstream, especially as 2026 goes on.</p>
<p>Um again folks I&#x27;ll say I think there are something akin to a base at least in one part of the ocean um that is that is providing some of these things. Drones perhaps non-human drones definitely I&#x27;m not talking about China or Russia launching drones from under the water. Um so Lewis says he is heartened by efforts going on behind closed doors but he can&#x27;t go into details. I am speaking to Jeff Nusatelli um who is one of the witnesses from the last hearing. Um I met Jeff at the Saul Foundation.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had Jeff on the podcast before. He was the security officer for the Vandenberg UFO incident and interviewed the witnesses. Really looking forward to speaking to Jeff. He is now involved with those whistleblowers going forward and working on stuff behind the scenes. I&#x27;m looking forward to that interview.</p>
<p>This show is going to come out really similar time to that interview. So, if you haven&#x27;t listened to that yet, go and check it out, please, because it&#x27;ll be a good conversation. I&#x27;ve got some great stuff to ask Jeff and meeting Jeff personally, one of the only people I have in this whole topic now. in the five and a half years doing this podcast. Um really nice guy.</p>
<p>He was so nice and spent a lot of time with me. Really good to talk to him. Um Ross talks about the the drone flap and are these drones or something else? Because authorities say they can&#x27;t track or find the origin of these objects. And that&#x27;s quite a common argument I think for a lot of folks who want to say, &quot;Oh, they&#x27;re UAP. That means they&#x27;re UFOs.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re aliens.&quot; But is that what the truth is? Or are they just telling us that? Are the authorities just telling us, &quot;We can&#x27;t track these. We don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re coming from. we don&#x27;t know their origin, but if it was Russia or China, would the US come out and tell you, &quot;Yeah, we know they&#x27;re Russian. We know they&#x27;re Chinese.&quot; That opens up a can of worms. And there are potential times those would be classed as acts of war.</p>
<p>So, are they going to say anything? Cuz let&#x27;s be honest, are the US doing the same thing in those countries? Probably. So, um I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t pay too much attention to this whole we can&#x27;t track these objects. We don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re going to or coming from  Of course they do. Of course they do. And I would say that includes whether these objects are going to container ships off the coast of the US being launched by Iran, China, Russia, or if they&#x27;re happening on shore, or if they&#x27;re perhaps something that are coming from, you know, up there or down there by something else.</p>
<p>Kular asks Lou if he thinks President Trump is contemplating disclosure. Lou gives an answer, which is very much a maybe, maybe not. He says it&#x27;s a risk as there could be a foreign adversarial element to risk. Not unfair, bit of a nothing answer. Kulart says that President Trump was given a limited briefing by a mutual friend.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to presume David Grush, but I don&#x27;t know, and is aware of the US&#x27;s knowledge on this. Ross asks Lou his thoughts on Secretary Rubio and would he now be read into any crash retrieval programs. Really interesting. Lew says he hopes so, but understands why now, given his position and future aspirations, he would hold his card cards close to his chest. um he won&#x27;t want to break ranks from what the administration&#x27;s direction is now on this.</p>
<p>This also brings up, I think, Marco Rubio walking back statements he made in the age of disclosure documentary. A lot of folks really honed in on those. At the time he was a senator, Senator Rubio. Yeah, Congressman Rubio, senator. Sorry, I&#x27;ve took a blank on that folks.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll blame the illness. Um but now he&#x27;s he&#x27;s moved up to a much higher level. He is constantly beside Donald Trump. And I would I would hasten to think that perhaps is there a a Vance Rubio ticket for the future for presidency? Is Rubio himself thinking down the line of running for presidency? So right now, does he want to commit to some major statements? And he&#x27;s kind of basically said that for walking it back that he wasn&#x27;t seeing all that stuff himself from a place of knowledge, but more quoting what others highranking still had told him. Um Lou brings up again that if we ignore this then it&#x27;s a matter of time before we have a 911 level event that a state or non-state actor will will use reverse engineered UAP technology against us.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s quite the statement because for me um and again this is why I would love to have Lou back on in the near future if if he could do it you know just to dig into that and it would be such a difficult thing for him to go into detail on frustratingly I know for many folks but on some level Lou will be guarded with his NDAs his oath he&#x27;s taken he&#x27;s very patriotic he doesn&#x27;t want to overstep the line but then he goes in to say that you know we&#x27;re essentially heading towards another 911 event where they&#x27;re going to use reverse engineered alien technology against does that&#x27;s that&#x27;s quite a big claim that comes from a place of presumption assumption or assumed knowledge or actual knowledge. Um yeah interesting statement. They also have a discussion around Louis saying the people the American people can handle the truth of this but then there&#x27;s a continuation where they bring up Jim Seivan&#x27;s comments that the truth is so indigestible um that people may not want to hear it. Lou likens it to a doctor telling you bad news or finding out your partner&#x27;s cheating news you might not want to know at the end of the day. Um so yeah, go back and check it out folks.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s around an hour. Ross Koular always does good interviews with with Luzandondo and others. Um yeah, definitely check it out and and appreciate Ross battling through illness to to get out the other end of that one. To follow that up, uh Luzando did also appear alongside James Fox uh for a kind of impromptu appearance. Uh, it was an interview at Lu Lzando&#x27;s bar, Bombshells it&#x27;s called, in Wyoming, and James Fox managed to grab about 13 minutes and record it with Lzando asking him a couple of questions.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not going to go over it again word for word, folks. This is someone else&#x27;s content, but I&#x27;d love to comment on it. Um, basically, James asks Lou four or five questions around the topic. Uh, James asked Lou if he would consider himself a first or secondhand witness. Lou said firsthand, but he then cleared up by saying he saw material of a known origin and also that knowing how long the US government has studied this, he would consider that him being a firsthand witness.</p>
<p>James asked Lou if he told him everything he knows, would Lou go to jail? Lou said, &quot;Yep, or worse.&quot; And with each of these answers, he goes into more detail, but go and check that out, folks, if you can on James&#x27; socials. James asks him, uh, what would you like to say to people who criticize him for everything he has done or doing? Alzando basically says it doesn&#x27;t bother him. They discuss the online UFO community, UFO cults, battles of differing sides, stuff that doesn&#x27;t particularly interest me either way. All that gossipy  Um, but I agree with what he says around people&#x27;s family should always be left out of this stuff at the end of the day. There is no need, whether you like or dislike someone or hate someone or disagree with their message or think they&#x27;re a disinfo agent, to be posting up stuff to do with our family.</p>
<p>Totally uncalled for, unnecessary. We&#x27;re all big kids at the end of the day. We&#x27;re all adults. I say big kids. We&#x27;re all adults.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a lot of big kids out there. Uh, and we should be able to deal with this in the appropriate way. But I&#x27;m also aware it&#x27;s 2025, 2026. And yeah, the world&#x27;s up, isn&#x27;t it? And James asks Lou, if you had 30 seconds to talk to the world about UAP on a podium, what would you say? Really disappointing, but Lou says gives a non-answer and says it deserves a great answer, but doesn&#x27;t answer. He&#x27;ll need to think about it.</p>
<p>So, there you go. Um, yeah. So, that was a couple of Louisando news drops. Um, I&#x27;ll reach out to Louis, see if the podcast. I I I was hoping to have him on back earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Never quite worked out. Um, but I know with commitments and everything else that Lou doesn&#x27;t do anywhere near as much media as he used to. Um, but uh he doesn&#x27;t owe people like myself anything. So, if I can get him on, fantastic. If you&#x27;re watching this, you might notice after that cut, my eyes are a bit watery.</p>
<p>Little bit of a coughing fit there, folks. Apologies. Um, UAP Disclosure Foundation has uh or the UAP Disclosure Foundation has announced some shakeups as they have made this announcement. Let me just read directly from their website. The Disclosure Foundation today announced the appointment of Harold Putoff, Halputoff, a physicist and research leader and Carlos, it&#x27;s EI R E, so I&#x27;m going to say or ER, a distinguished scholar and history uh of history and religion to its advisory board.</p>
<p>Their addition strengthened the foundation&#x27;s multiddisciplinary leadership at the intersection of national security, science, and public understanding. Dr. put off brings more than five decades of research and advisory experience across government, academia, and the private sector. He currently serves as the president and CEO of EarthTech International and the director of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin. His career includes research positions at an NSA, Stanford University, and SRRI International along with recognized contributions in electronamics, quantum vacuum physics, and advanced energy and propulsion concepts.</p>
<p>Dr. is the T. Lawrenson Riggs, professor of history and religious studies at Yale University and a national book award-winning author. I wrote a book once, folks. I just let you know that.</p>
<p>A leading scholar of the early modern world, comparative religion and the cultural history of belief, Dr. er brings deep expertise on how societies interpret anomalous experiences, government uncertainty, and negotiate the boundaries between scientific and humanistic inquiry. Uh Chris Melon made a comment to say, &quot;We are honored to welcome Dr. Putov and Dr. air to our advisory board.</p>
<p>Their combined scientific historical perspectives will help guide the foundation&#x27;s efforts to promote transparency and strengthen public understanding. Uh so yeah, really good uh appointments there. It looks like if you want to know more about the UP disclosure fund and what they&#x27;re doing, sorry, disclosure fund, disclosure foundation, it has changed names. um on that if you want to check out more information. Jordan Flowers who is one of the directors there um he uh was just on with me recently discussing that name change from funded foundation and what they&#x27;re doing.</p>
<p>And of course I&#x27;ve spoken to Lester Nari who&#x27;s involved with the UP disclosure foundation and Yuan Fun all in the last year or so. So go and check out those interviews. Uh and the link for the website will be in the description as well. Couple more things just to pick up on folks. Uh Steven Spielberg has his new movie um out in 12th of June 2026.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s been announced for. So he is returning to the world of UFOs and ET mystery with a brand new film set for release next summer. The project is still shrouded in secrecy, you know, ironically, but it&#x27;s already generating huge buzz, so there&#x27;s no official confirmed title yet, though several production reports suggest the working title might be disclosure with other internal names, including IMDb, have it listed as the dish. Um, and non view popping up throughout filming. So, there&#x27;s a few different names around.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called yet, but the cryptic marketing has appeared. billboards in the in New York yesterday has the phrase all will be disclosed uh which only has added to the speculation about the film&#x27;s direction and themes. We do know that Spielberg&#x27;s got a big cast. Emily Blunt leads the film joined by Colin Fth, Joshua Connor, Eusen, Coleman Domingo, and Wyatt Russell. The screenplay is written by David Co-op.</p>
<p>uh based on a story by Spielberg. Um and they worked together on Jurassic Park, One of the Worlds. And of course, legendary John Williams is back to compose the score, making uh yet another return for one of cinema&#x27;s most iconic director composer partnerships. John Williams has done some of the classics over the years, folks. I&#x27;m not even going to tell you what he&#x27;s done if you don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Just type in John Williams to your Spotify and enjoy some huge scores that will take you back to your childhood. and uh beyond for for the cinema releases. Huge cinema fan myself as you may know. Uh plot details are so minimal, almost non-existent. We literally know this is a UFO type movie.</p>
<p>No synopsis, no synopsis released and the studio has not commented anyone. I can&#x27;t find any spoilers online. Early reporting suggests it&#x27;s a direct UFO movie. Um his first since Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Obviously ET huge movie as well.</p>
<p>fans can expect um the first trailer in the 19th of December attached to Avatar Fire and Ash. Here&#x27;s a little sidebar, folks. Avatar movies I think are crap. Not a fan at all. Um don&#x27;t see that.</p>
<p>I went to see the first one. Uh not for me, but appreciate other folks will like them. Same with Lord of the Rings. Just boring for me. Uh yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, uh so many of you probably just turned off there. Apologies. Uh love Avatar. Uh, for now the mystery continues. Spielberg making a UFO film is again enough to get everyone watching the skies.</p>
<p>If you look at the picture for the billboards with that slogan, it&#x27;s got like a a face. You can kind of see I&#x27;ll put the picture up on YouTube if you&#x27;re watching this now, but otherwise I&#x27;ll just have to describe it for those on audio, but you can see a kind of eye and an eyebrow and it looks like someone&#x27;s tilting their head up and looking back. You see half their face, but it&#x27;s shrouded around a silhouette of a blue J bird. And if you look in the reflection of the person&#x27;s eye, it looks like there&#x27;s small lights. Some folks saying it could be like an abduction and they&#x27;re looking up and seeing the object.</p>
<p>But I&#x27;m really excited for that movie. Really excited for a big UFO movie in the cinema. Look, when these things happen, sometimes they end up massive letdowns. But it&#x27;s Spielberg. It&#x27;s UFOs.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a lot of romanticism there. John Williams doing the score will be incredible. I&#x27;m excited for this one and I hope you are too. And I really look forward to seeing that. Um, I really look forward to seeing that uh trailer dropping in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Um, and also on that folks, reminder, James Fox&#x27;s Moment of Contact, uh, New Revelation of Alien. I&#x27;ve totally up the thing. Uh, the name of it. Where did I put it? Where did I put it? Where did I put it? Uh, Fox. Fox.</p>
<p>Fox. I might cut this bit out, folks. I might not. Um, I did have the details in there. Uh, oh, yeah.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s a moment of contact. New Revelations of Alien Encounters is released digitally uh on the 22nd of December, just before Christmas. Uh I can&#x27;t see any details yet of how to purchase. I imagine it&#x27;s going to be like Hulu, Apple TV, Amazon Prime potentially. As soon as those details are out, I&#x27;ll let you know.</p>
<p>But yeah, go support James. That&#x27;ll be a wonderful documentary. Lots of new content in it. And I look forward to seeing it myself. I&#x27;ve been very fortunate to get a screener sent over to me.</p>
<p>I have not watched it just yet because I am ill and I want to enjoy said screener. But James will be joining me uh towards the middle of J December to discuss the new documentary. And finally folks just a reminder I spoke to Steven Basset last week and uh he announced that the state of the world forum is returning from the 14th to the 17th of December. That is a global virtual gathering bringing together thinkers, leaders, indigenous voices, technologists, and creators to ask some of the biggest questions facing humanity today. The theme for this year is four intelligences, one future.</p>
<p>Exploring how human, natural, artificial, and even cosmic intelligence shape the world we&#x27;re stepping into. Across four days, the forum will tackle everything from ecological regeneration and ethical AI to geopolitical instability, cultural restoration, and the future of space and consciousness. So you can expect high level conversation, practical action frameworks and perspectives from a a global mix of speakers which is always nice. Always nice. Um all online local watch parties are happening around the world.</p>
<p>Digital passes are available for anyone who wants to dig deeper. If you&#x27;re interested, go check it out on the website. Um Steven did give me a code PRG95. PRG95. You can enter that at checkout and you get a discount off of the online price.</p>

<p>You never know what you might see. It wasn&#x27;t a tic tac and not quite a saucer. More like a hub designed by Chelter. A little baroque and quite steampunk like Alice was playing bass for the Parliament effect. The little  hovered right inside of my window and when I shoved out the screen, he made it an issue.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think you expected me to see his anxious, but I&#x27;d have some champagne and smoke.</p>
