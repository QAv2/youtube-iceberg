            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas and I do educational stuff here on this channel we are uh I think the 91st video on the reciprocal system of theory which is a relatively obscure uh theory of everything that was proposed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 we are uh right now we&#x27;re looking at his final book it&#x27;s called beyond space and time and this is his um attempt to get into metaphysics all of his earlier books are just about um are on physics and chemistry and astronomy but uh this book actually was published after he died and so there are some question as to whether he actually wanted this published or not but either way this is his attempt at going into metaphysics into the religious into the philosophical and the psychological as opposed to those hard Sciences from the earlier years now the the basic uh essence of Larson&#x27;s theory is in his first fundamental postulate that he came out with uh in the 50s sometime and uh it is basically paraphrasing the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy uh you know denying Newton uh the Greeks and Einstein um the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between time and space and time are reciprocals of each other um you know in the same way that two-thirds and three halves are reciprocals of each other you invert one to get the other and um they both as a result have the same qualities they both have uh three or more Dimensions as a space we can see that space does time also then has three or more dimensions and um time is progressing always getting later and later and later and therefore Space 2 is also progressing and that was seen in bet way back in the 1920s by the Hubble telescope uh observing the recession of the distant galaxies uh time and space are also quantized meaning they come in discrete units only you don&#x27;t have half a unit or a quarter of a unit or it&#x27;s not a Continuum there are abrupt uh jumps one two three four five uh they&#x27;re in integers and um they are very small so they look it looks very smooth but they are actually not smooth and uh both time and space possess that uh that quality one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light the speed of light is somewhat the origin of uh these this uh reciprocal relation between time and space and uh the speed of light is not the maximum speed of the universe as Einstein would have you believe but it is the midpoint or the null point in a universe of motion there is always motion and that always motion is the speed of light uh really the speed of light in all directions uh which is what you call scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no direction or it has all directions you can think of it as a um balloon that you put a bunch of dots on with a magic marker and then you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other this is very similar to the recession of the distant galaxies each one of those dots would be a Galaxy the further apart they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other and uh that is really you know the progression that&#x27;s just uh the progression of time or the flow of time and the flow of space are both scalar motions whereas the three-dimensional uh aspect is a vectorial motion a motion that has a Direction uh you know that&#x27;s the difference between speed and velocity speed is a scalar motion and velocity is a directed motion uh regardless uh in the uh reciprocal system uh the speed of light is the neutral point or the null point or the origin of the universe and there is half of the universe that&#x27;s actually moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls that the Cosmic sector or sector two uh and the sector we&#x27;re familiar with is slower than the speed of light sector he calls sector one the material sector the material sector Grows by aggregation bonding uh up until its most complex level which is the DNA molecule which contains uh multiple billions of atoms and at that point the level one or the sector one uh DNA molecule has becomes eligible to be controlled overall by a sector two component um if it&#x27;s in the right Ratio or the right configuration the two of them will join together and the sector two will control sector one and the two of them together Larson calls the life unit life is a combination of material and Cosmic uh sector units and then the life unit starts from a single-celled organism and becomes more and more complex until it gets to its uh level highest level which is or at least more most complex level which Larson says is the intelligent human being and at that point the intelligent human being becomes eligible to be controlled Again by a sector three uh entity which uh I would argue is really from the speed of light or from the origin uh Larson says the speed of uh that the uh sector 3 unit is beyond space and time or independent of space and time and uh the sector 3 unit communicates with sector with the life unit uh through various means uh such as ESP intuition religious Revelation [Music] um scientific Insight uh and probably others and um that uh kind of competes with the life with the sector 2 control which is uh intent upon survival so at some points survival and this uh sector three which is targeted toward good behavior or ethical behavior is uh in conflict and that&#x27;s where the human being comes in and has to make a choice that&#x27;s free will choosing between the survival and the good behavior when they are in uh competition or when they&#x27;re conflicting okay now uh Larson this final book is called beyond space and time so as you might have guessed it&#x27;s mostly about the sector three entity and what uh what it&#x27;s all about and how to use it how to uh understand it the sector three entity is always correct it&#x27;s Communications with us are always correct but our ability to translate them correctly is limited and so a lot of times it steers us uh it seems to steer Us in the wrong direction but it&#x27;s really our inability to properly translate those messages now we&#x27;re uh wrapping up chapter 22 right now which is on humanism uh you know humanism is kind of a secular idea that uh a lot of people would say that it&#x27;s opposed to religion Larson&#x27;s really saying that you know humanism can actually clean up religion that the religion the religious part is really necessary but there&#x27;s a lot of accoutrements to the religious uh doctrines that are nonsensical uh just uh their sector two they&#x27;re not sector three and uh humanism could do it uh a service to religion by getting rid of all that extraneous material um and we&#x27;re right here at the end of the chapter so he&#x27;s going to sum it up here and then we&#x27;ll move into the next chapter it is true that in many instances of this nature the religious organizations do not understand the real points at issue and are acting on the basis of emotion without realizing the full implications of what they are doing but this does not excuse the actions it merely emphasizes the point that active participation by religious organizations in non-religious controversies is not conducive to Equitable settlement of the issues unfortunately religious organizations are by their very nature incapable of the kind of an approach to the subject matter that is required in these secular areas because religion deals with moral issues in which there is a definite separation between right and wrong the religious authorities are predisposed to view other issues in the same light to see them as either black or white so to speak but secular issues do not usually come in black and white they come in various Shades of Gray and an uncompromising attitude which insists on branding all opposition as evil and immoral can do nothing but impede or prevent progress toward a just resolution of the points at issue there is a definite place in the secular field for humanism and for organizations with humanistic objectives but mixing secular and religious objectives is detrimental to both and the churches that are now devoting practically their entire effort to the objective of humanism should recognize that they are no longer religious institutions it is time that they Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars okay now um just one thing to add uh when he&#x27;s talking about Free Will talking about making choices when you have a choice he calls it an economic decision a sector two choice you know should I have an apple or should I have an orange you know should I get a green shirt or should I get a red shirt or should I get a blue shirt or should I get a white shirt these are decisions that are non-moral uh they are decisions and they&#x27;re based on what you may what you desire but they are not moral decisions I mean unless you break it down further and say okay well the white shirt comes from sweatshot Sweatshop labor and um you know the green shirt was made by uh in person by this person that&#x27;s sitting right in front of me maybe that would turn it into a moral question but uh in general those kind of questions Larson calls economic decisions and they have a wide range of decisions you can have an apple an orange a cherry uh you know a watermelon or a banana you know you have many many many choices but when you have a true Free Will decision between sector 3 and sector 2 uh you know where you have the ethical behavior and then you have the survival or animal behavior then he calls that uh Free Will decision that is a choice between only two options the two options are basically Good and Evil so uh that that kind of uh clears up some of the I hope it clears up some of the uh you know a misunderstanding about you know making choices okay now we&#x27;re now going to chapter 23 and we&#x27;ll start this up here uh chapter 23 is called the religion re-examined when we consider what religion is for mankind and what science is it is no exaggeration to say this is a quote from Alfred North Whitehead um when we consider what religion is for mankind and what science is is no exaggeration to say that the future course of history depends upon the decision of this generation as to the relations between them uh here we go with Larson as Whitehead goes on to say these two influences the force of religious intuitions and the force of our impulse to accurate observation and logical deduction are prone to conflict they seem to be set against one another this conflict between science and religion is the most serious result of the fact that the that there has hitherto been no scientific metaphysics science has been unable to penetrate the region beyond space and time and it has looked to scans at those who claim to have acquired metaphysical knowledge by other means in the words of Herbert Dingle the chief error of scientists has been to condemn all illusory as illusory all experience which is not useful for their own restricted purposes findings of the preceding chapters which have brought the metaphysical realm within the domain of science have now provided a basis from which we can carry out a reassessment of the relationship between these two very important sectors of human activity inasmuch as this is a scientific rather than a religious work the discussion that follows will be directed to an examination of the effect of the new findings on the world Outlook of the scientists a typical scientist let us say but the conclusions that are reached apply with equal force to all those who are concerned with the place of religion in a rational universe as brought out into the introductory chapter the scientifically trained individual in modern society is faced with a very awkward dilemma since much of that which he believes or wishes to believe with respect to the most important issues in his life the assertions of religion is incompatible with the implications of that which he knows from observation or reasoning by himself or his colleagues the assertions of science in the absence of any satisfactory way of reconciling the two conflicting viewpoints most scientists have tried to keep them separated so far as possible and to avoid thinking scientifically about religious matters those who cannot see their way clear to evade the issue in this manner are likely to Echo uh these Sentiments of shapley Harlow shapley should we not look deeply and sympathetically for religious beliefs that are founded on science and that grow with science yes or those perhaps of George R Harrison there is great need in the world today for an integration of religious belief which will fill all the innate longings of man for Spiritual Solace without doing too much violence to his intelligence but the inability of science to deal with metaphysical questions has caused this search for a scientific religion to bog down in a sterile materialism in the meantime strenuous efforts have been made by some segments of the religious community to reconcile the religious and scientific viewpoints speaking of what he calls the liberal Church Reinhold niebuhr has this to say in its energy for some decades it has been devoted has been devoted to the task of proving religion and science compatible a purpose which it has sought to fulfill by disavowing the more incredible portions of its religious Heritage and clothing is a remainder in terms acceptable to the modern mind okay back to Larson if there were a definite conflict between religion in general and scientific knowledge than any such reconciliation would obviously be impossible but even though many scientists believe this to be true it is actually not scientific knowledge but certain implications of the scientific knowledge heretofore available that are incompatible with the fundamental religious assertions as I pointed out in Chapter 2 an item of scientific knowledge once established is valid for all time but the implications of that knowledge the things that it suggests about related matters inside or outside the particular field involved our subject subject to change whenever additional relevant items are added to the previously existing store of knowledge prior to the development of the reciprocal system of theory scientists had assumed that all of the knowledge of the universe thus far accumulated was compatible with the traditional concept of space and time as the setting in which all else exists on this basis there can be no existence outside that is independent of space and time the implication of this previously existing scientific knowledge therefore was that metaphysical existence of any kind is impossible an implication that is in direct conflict with the basic assertions of most religions the findings of this present work did not and could not affect the established body of scientific knowledge in any way but they demonstrated that the previous concept of nature of the nature of space and time a pure assumption is erroneous since the conclusion as to the impossibility of metaphysical existence was based on that previous concept and not on established scientific knowledge that conclusion is automatically invalidated by our findings these findings not only overturn the reasoning on which the negative conclusion was based thus re-establishing the possibility of a metaphysical existence existence but go a step further and show that such an existence is physically certain the principal obstacle to a rapprochement between science and religion is thus completely demolished okay um that will be the a good start for this chapter and we&#x27;ll go on and go on to the rest of the chapter starting tomorrow just wanted to say one thing that I really love about Dewey B Larsen is that he&#x27;s very inspiring because all of his major works this work here plus uh his three volume structure of the physical Universe uh he did after he was 80 years old or more so there&#x27;s still hope for all of us okay have a great day see you later</p>
