            <p>option y on mac or alt-line windows if you have any questions for bill alec and once we work through those then we have wayne o&#x27;shaw coming up i hope i didn&#x27;t shock everyone no no there&#x27;s there&#x27;s michael boyd sir ah michael now he&#x27;s gone oh there i am there you are okay yeah that was pretty cool um i really like the part where you showed the the how the equation changed with and without mass is kind of impressive to me um i&#x27;m well i was stunned myself when i saw that i&#x27;m going there it is that&#x27;s the scalar wave component that&#x27;s in you know the quantum field theory it&#x27;s there but they don&#x27;t recognize it as such okay they don&#x27;t see it as a scalar wave function well my question is could you have a scalar wave of the opposite polarity from basically the absence of mass yes well one station&#x27;s transmitting a positive going wave and the other one it&#x27;s electromagnetic okay and the other stations transmitting a negative going electromagnetic wave and when you do the math you sum up the math the interferometry creates a region of strong electromagnetic field energy and that&#x27;s what tom spoke about is that the two waves combine okay in that only in that region they mix thanks i appreciate your answer okay yes gravity too let me go to mark so-called now mark uh yes bill i&#x27;m i&#x27;m just wondering what do you consider to be a scalar field because uh on one hand we&#x27;re talking about particles which are you know tiny little spheres that can have a potential that goes out in all directions and on the other hand you have this transformer which i don&#x27;t see any way that it could possibly have a scalar field because there&#x27;s always going to be a vector to it well the um you see what tom spoke about is this opposing field action you have to have that and it&#x27;s set up it&#x27;s set up in the flux of the material is that you set up your your currents and voltages in the two coils such that it&#x27;s setting up this opposing flux action tesla same thing but that&#x27;s not scalar that&#x27;s just opposing those are two vector fields they&#x27;re like two dipoles like a regular dipole antenna that you have would have two dipoles going out from each side it would be positive in the center negative on the outside and then negative the center of positive and the outside that&#x27;s a dipole antenna what you just described a true scalar field is a sphere that has potential from the inside of the spirit of the outside of the sphere and then out to the universe so it can&#x27;t be connected to anything metallic or that would become a dipole or near anything metallic because then it would be difficult to to what&#x27;s near it okay so um i i don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re using the correct definitions of the terms okay what this is this is what i understand from tom in his lectures okay and his meg device that he set up this opposing action you know in his meg and then i see it in other uh devices as well you know tesla used it use this opposing field action magnetic fields you know in his transformers uh stanley myers and his transformers set it up as well and then i see it as a trace okay that blue trace is a sum of the input current plus the reactive component from the transformer which is your sine squared term that&#x27;s your opposing field action okay the sine squared term is what you&#x27;re looking for and that&#x27;s the scalar component the scalar wave and the two add electromagnetically and you get that complex wavy pattern that complex waving pattern is is a regular ac field that&#x27;s been uh screwed around with uh if if you have a true a true scalar field will be measured by the distance to the object in all directions um and if it was a an ac scalar field that would be alternating but it&#x27;ll be alternating the same in all directions scalar means that it&#x27;s going in old like the planet earth is we are living in a scalar field right now gravity is a scalar field the uh the ionosphere is a scalar field right it&#x27;s also a scalar capacitor because it&#x27;s all the way in a circle um there&#x27;s actually a guy on the youtube channel right now daniel foster who actually built an ac scalar field generator by putting the transformer inside of the sphere with the battery so the conductor was surrounding the the uh the transformer with the power supply in it that will create a true scalar field what you&#x27;re creating is just dipole uh moments um also are you are you still claiming that the uh transformer was over unity uh no okay no i&#x27;m just saying that it&#x27;s a higher efficiency than a normal transformer would be okay i i would encourage you to try a true watt test with a light bulb okay well i&#x27;m using a resistor just a resistor network um are you measuring the heat then uh to get your watt measurement oh yeah yeah yeah the temperature yes yes it does get quite hot so you&#x27;re measuring the coulombs coming out in order to uh convert that into watts or you&#x27;re using a watt meter um just mainly with watts just looking at the wattage calculations right because the wattage calculations won&#x27;t be accurate for something like that especially with it with an ac field that&#x27;s not a true sign um it won&#x27;t be accurate anymore and if you hook that up to uh to your power line it could confuse the of the power meter from the utility as well oh well you definitely don&#x27;t want to connect it to the grid you know that this sort of technology no it&#x27;ll it&#x27;ll screw up with electronics in your home probably your neighbor&#x27;s home as well and you might get a citation from the uh from the power company i see you&#x27;re smiling yes and and the reason for that is that it can screw around with uh i find it to be a great research project but that is interesting um okay trying to set up a spherical type of arrangement yes uh like a um ball lightning is an example of a scalar field it&#x27;s in all directions regular lightning that&#x27;s dipole you&#x27;ve got positive negative or vice versa uh with a with sphere with ball lightning it&#x27;s all punched in there in one spot an electron scalar field that&#x27;s literally what it is right agreed okay so um so let&#x27;s do option y on mac or alt y on windows for questions for bill and and we are just at the top of the hour so if if we don&#x27;t have any we&#x27;ll give it another minute here then we can go to uh we can go to mr wayne ojala who who has been with us okay well so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do that then okay so let me put this thing back on gallery everybody please give bill another applause guys thank you so much thank you so much again it feels like we&#x27;re getting our we&#x27;re getting our energy back here let me go to let me go to wayne uh if i can spell his name right oh fail forward research okay i&#x27;m going to go ask to unmute so with wayne o&#x27;shaw he is saying that</p>
