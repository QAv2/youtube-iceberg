            <p>[Music] it&#x27;s a team up we&#x27;ve all been waiting for including me even though I&#x27;m more of a skeptic than many of the people watching at home UAP whistleblower David grush sat down with Joe Rogan for three hours to talk about his experience testifying on Capitol Hill and of course Rogan asked some of the questions we&#x27;ve all been wanting to ask ourselves so when it comes to these I&#x27;m going to bring it back to these these actual entities yeah do we know or we have an understanding of how many of them we&#x27;re talking about and the variety of them well yeah there is a variety and we have a certain number of of different things um but the like total numbers of like what&#x27;s interacting with us on Earth I mean nobody knows that and I mean well there&#x27;s an understanding of some that they do believe are interacting with us and there&#x27;s a variety in terms of there&#x27;s there&#x27;s variables yeah I I talk to people who are familiar with uh the biological analysis and everything so we have some idea not a complete picture because it&#x27;s like you know you know you&#x27;re looking at it it&#x27;s like well I don&#x27;t even understand the phys physiology at all it&#x27;s like what the heck it&#x27;s like way different right so um we have at least description of this physiology yeah no I was in I was in the room when uh can&#x27;t be careful I don&#x27;t want to uh I was in Washington with a very uh number of senior people that work for members of Congress put it that way here&#x27;s the rest of gush&#x27;s answer I brought the people who worked on that stuff to the hill I mean this is why the members were so confident to put out the Schumer Amendment and stuff and and I was like please explain and um they went into all those details and stuff and I remember you know some some of the professional staff members were like whoa like like they were like in Glock right cuz I mean it like a total World bubble um got burst right there for a lot of people and so we we have some idea it&#x27;s not a complete picture I mean it&#x27;s just like but you&#x27;re not even bringing in the right the right people like I think about my friend and colleague uh Dr Gary Nolan which I started the um Soul Foundation nonprofit with I mean he&#x27;s like you know Nobel level biologist for ologist like he&#x27;s the guy that you would want on it but he&#x27;s not on it so I think we can make a lot of progress in our understanding once again if if this is more broadly studied um in an open environment so my frustration whenever we hear from anyone involved in the in on the the UAP front is is that I always want then more details why can&#x27;t you say cuz he cuz there he catch himself a couple times go well I can&#x27;t say more on this XYZ why can&#x27;t you say more somebody needs to say more at some point if we&#x27;re if what&#x27;s being alleged there are actual there are remains of of um physiologically different entities that do not originate on Earth and they&#x27;re being kept in a room or in a vault somewhere where I would like to see them I the people should be able to see them it&#x27;s always so so grush says that he knows people who&#x27;ve seen them or he&#x27;s able to he&#x27;s kind of doesn&#x27;t describe them I it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not enough it&#x27;s so close to the information we want and then but we never take that extra step of just disclosing whatever it is which I I hope should be disclosed um and there&#x27;s always a kind of insinuation that I can&#x27;t say more because um I could get you know in trouble or the the government well then who what is the agency or official or person who has said you can&#x27;t say more because then we need to get that person to stop doing censorship well I think there&#x27;s multiple classifications of apparent secrecy here um and it seems quite purposeful the other thing is I&#x27;m not exactly sure how much the American public generally cares right now with uh with cost of living and housing and other things that are you know untenable in terms of their everyday Liv there&#x27;s aliens are aliens taking up the housing are aliens driving up the prices like I don&#x27;t know how okay I there there are whole memes across black Twitter about this unless aliens are helping pay in bills like we&#x27;re not concerned with whether they exist or not um I did not know that it is hilarious I I will have to send some of them to you I I think that you know at any given point when you have multiple people from both sides of the aisle at this point um seemingly not being fully not fully exposing something that they know uh specifically um with many questions that have Arisen around extraterrestrial life or whatever you want to call the beings that we don&#x27;t really give a name to um whether they&#x27;re existence but also how long we&#x27;ve known about them where they come from um the composition those things are important for for our scientific reasoning I don&#x27;t know how much of our government is ever going to really tell us uh I find that infuriating I think it&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t agree I think it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s true is it a national security concern Well yeah if it&#x27;s yes if it&#x27;s true it&#x27;s like the most important information that would ever had be disclosed in all of human history all of human civilization I think um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not persuaded that it&#x27;s something other than BS personally I don&#x27;t think they have all this evidence and they&#x27;re not showing it because they don&#x27;t have it it doesn&#x27;t exist and it&#x27;s not real but but then what is up with it does exist it&#x27;s huge but why would you and I guess this is like deeper than his discussion uh what would the point of the fars be to have these people who are like okay well we know something but we can&#x27;t tell you the something that we know um there may be some remains here but we can&#x27;t really say you know anything about them what is the point in this dog and pony show that doesn&#x27;t actually lead to a show publicity I don&#x27;t know um I mean they they might again most of these people are hearing this secondhand so they might fully believe like I&#x27;m not accusing David grush or anyone else involved in this of saying anything that they don&#x27;t think is true but a lot of this information even comes to them secondhand they&#x27;ll say well I I know someone who saw we have a report and we have evidence that&#x27;s been kept quiet about someone describing what they saw and I I I fully believe those accounts do exist and I I I believe they&#x27;re being covered up by the government and they ought to be released I don&#x27;t think they will ultimately reflect a true finding of alien life if they did that would be remarkable and we really ought to know about it cuz it would be transformative it would be huge knowing that there are not necessarily alien life but organisms that life can grow in other places be it whether that is um biological or otherwise I do think is important uh in our in our study in they describe crafts as well they say you know not just like a piece of mold on an asteroid or something that seems perfectly plausible that doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t seem so beyond belief but they said they&#x27;ve identified crafts so an intelligent enough life to assemble an Interstellar space object uh an object that can move across space something of what they&#x27;re describing sounds like something of a technological capability that is pretty extraordinary or an intelligent enough human that just planted it there well could be that could be us from the future could be um artificial intelligence like there are a lot of options all of them would be would be major major Revelations and would you know would change the scope of human society we could learn from their techn I mean to truly learn that we&#x27;re not alone in the universe that there&#x27;s other intelligent life out there that would be I mean that&#x27;s that Discovery is something that a lot of people anticipate will happen one day I don&#x27;t know that it will uh but maybe it&#x27;s already happened and the government&#x27;s keeping it all secret that&#x27;s very frustrating if it is the case we&#x27;ll see um and well not from Gru or any of these these others but I do think that that information will come out um and when it does there is going to be people who&#x27;ve been waiting with baited breath for their aha moment for years so this is going to be a very exciting moment for them I call it BS all the way around so we&#x27;ll see in the future we&#x27;re we&#x27;re too Skeptics but even if it happened you&#x27;d be like ah inflation is is the real issue I don&#x27;t know about that Amisha I don&#x27;t know more Rising right after [Music] this</p>
