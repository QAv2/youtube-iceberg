            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this is uh a channel that is dedicated toward uh educating the public on various obscure and esoteric topics that could have a revolutionary effect on your life if you knew about them um things that have been suppressed uh people who have been deemed crackpots who are actually dedicated researchers who spent their whole life working on something and never got paid never got famous uh but continued to work on it anyway and uh came up with some fantastic results that nobody knows about so uh today is the 348th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory this is a theory that was put forward by Dewey B Larsson back in the 20th century and uh his theory is uh can be kind of summarized as uh Universe of motion we live in a universe made entirely out of motion and in Larson&#x27;s world uh that is um kind of a different kind of motion uh what you would call scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but it has no Direction it has no units attached to it um you don&#x27;t say uh the motion is north or south or anything like that um and this is something that you can model with a clock uh the clock is getting later and later and later but it&#x27;s not uh going in any specific Direction you can also use a balloon with spots on it all of the spots if you blow up the balloon all the the spots are are moving away from each other and uh once again in no particular direction um each dot is moving away from each other Dot and not only that but the locations between the dots are moving away from other locations between the dots all of the locations are moving away from each other and the further away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other other uh like a scale uh on a scale um hence scalar motion and um the direction that can be imputed to these motions and has been imputed to these motions is the result of a reference system not as a result of the motion uh in order to come up with any type of Direction you have to assign one of these points as being arbitrarily the one that is motionless you can say oh well we&#x27;re going to say that this one is motionless when you do that then all of a sudden the directions from each one of the other dots becomes more clear but uh up until that time uh you have a scalar motion motion with a magnitude but no direction and this MO this kind of motion has been known by science but it has not been investigated or understood in its significance and Larsson puts it at the center of his narrative at the center of his uh Universe of motion it&#x27;s a universe of scaler motion um but uh the Legacy scientists have kind of uh put it over in the closet as kind of a sideshow uh oh well we know about this kind of motion but it&#x27;s not important and even though uh their own Hubble Telescope has observed that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and unless we want to say that our galaxy is at the center of the universe um which we&#x27;ve already you know I think we&#x27;ve we gotten past that but uh unless we want to say that then um our galaxy is also participating in the same motion away from all of the other galaxies so that is a scalar motion and also if you kind of reverse the order and you start sucking in the balloon instead of blowing up the balloon all of the dots will be moving toward each other and that is a motion that um is is analogous to gravitation um and so when you are defining a gravitational field like this body is moving toward this other body you are uh imputing a reference point to that uh to one of those bodies and that is where the field or the direction is coming from so the gravitational field is not a consequence of the scalar motion is a consequence of the reference point that you have assigned arbitrarily um gravitation is a motion of of all uh locations toward all other locations uh analogous to the surface of the uh um Contracting balloon now another thing about motion uh is that motion is the relationship the other other people have had the uh you know notion of a universe of motion um but Larson um stood out because he defined motion as the relationship between space and time and I guess I would also say the relationship between time and space uh they&#x27;re both um interchangeable and um because space and time are that that creates a reciprocal relationship between space and time hence the reciprocal system of theory uh and um space and time are basically uh not independent entities they don&#x27;t exist by themselves they only exist together in motion motion could be thought of as a fraction with time or or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator uh such as speed speed is um the car is moving 20 m per hour 20 mil of space in one hour of time space over time acceleration I drop the rock out of the window and it fell at 32 ft per second per second that is acceleration 32t of space in one second per second or 1 second squared time over space to the second power is acceleration so these are relationship fractions of with time or space as the numerator space or time as the denominator minator energy it took me 3 hours to push that thing one mile there&#x27;s 3 hours of time in one mile of space time over space energy and so on and so on and so on all the scientific quantities that we know of are relationships between space and time but again space and time uh could be in multiple dimensions that&#x27;s what Larsson calls coordinate space coordinate time he&#x27;s saying that space and time both have three dimensions XYZ coordinates we&#x27;re accustom that Concept in space three dimensions of space I would uh say that it could be four dimensions as well uh but um some people might um disagree with me about that uh I I I don&#x27;t know that the dimensions have to be orthogonal uh meaning uh 90° angles they I think they need to be independent but that does I don&#x27;t know that that necessarily means orthogonal okay and then also that uh leaves the concept of coordinate time three dimensions of time which is a blasphemy for the Legacy scientist but it is an inevitable part of the reciprocal system because whatever quality aderes to either space or time also adheres to the other uh space or time and so uh you have I&#x27;m sorry um so you have um coordinate space coordinate time and you also have clock space and clock time the clock clock that&#x27;s a scalar motion a motion that has magnitude but no Direction the time is always getting later and later and later that&#x27;s clock time clock space is that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and then you also have what Larson calls the discrete unit postulate space and time only come in discrete units there is no minimum uh you know there is no minimum unit of space SP or time or there is a minimum unit of space or time you have to have a full unit before you have anything if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have space or time and those units are very small but they are existent you have to have a full unit if you have one unit of space in one unit of time space over time or speed one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light which enlarg and system he calls unit speed 1 over 1 equals 1 this is the place the special place where time and space are equivalent to one and um so for that that marks out that this is the center point of Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system or the zero point the null point the origin The Ether the reference point Larson calls it the progression of the natural reference system all points are moving outward at the speed of light that is the state of rest of a universe of motion which makes sense if you have a universe of motion you have motion before you have everything else so even the state of rest is in motion and half of this universe is moving faster than the speed of light which large calls the cosmic sector half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light which Larson calls the material sector the material sector is the only sector that the scientists know about uh hence uh Einstein&#x27;s dictum that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe so lar uh Einstein is is conceding that the material sector is the only sector and he doesn&#x27;t know anything about the cosmic sector um fortunately for him and for the Legacy scientists we can determine things about the cosmic sector uh Without Really probing into it because it is a basically a mirror image of the material sector exactly what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector is what&#x27;s going on in the material sector except in its reciprocal so you have to reverse the roles of space and time so in the material sector you have relationships based on coordinate space three dimensions of space and clock time time is always getting later and later and later in the cosmic sector once you cross that speed of light boundary the rules invert and then you end up with relationships based on coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart so those are the basic relationships we&#x27;re going to look into a paper that was written by Dr Bruce paret today uh this is actually the third installment of this um so if you want to go back to the beginning of this paper you go back two episodes uh and this paper is just called scaler motion Dr Bruce pet was uh one of Larson&#x27;s uh principle revisers after Larson died in 1990 um you know the whole thing was kind of up for grabs and some people came along who were kind of Orthodox lonians who felt that Larson got everything right some people came along that just wanted to revise everything that Larson did but I think kind of the middle ground was taken by Dr Bruce pet and Dr KB K neru who uh applied the spirit of larsson&#x27;s reciprocal system uh but uh also corrected some things that he gotong WR or he overlooked which Larson admitted that he was subject to error as far as that was concerned he believed that that the system itself was correct but that he could have been mistaken about certain aspects of it uh of his derivation of his deduction of okay if we&#x27;ve got the postulates here and the reciprocal system what do we what what kind of a universe does that create and he he took a few missteps as far as that was concerned according to Larson and according to nuu and pet and uh so they came out with What&#x27;s called the rs2 the reciprocal system 2 the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system and we&#x27;re looking at uh so uh pret wrote uh nine short papers here rs211 rs212 and so on we&#x27;re looking at RS 2104 today which is on scaler motion now in the earlier parts of this paper LS uh paret defined scaler as you know something that has a magnitude but no basically no units no direction now he&#x27;s getting around to defining motion uh in the context of scalar motion okay so it&#x27;s giving the dictionary definition of motion changing place or position motion is a simple enough concept to understand but when you consider it in the context of scalar motion it becomes an oxymoron how is it possible for quantity for a quantity possessing magnitude only to change place or position when both place and position are totally foreign to the idea of a magnitude only scalar it cannot and there lies the problem with the term scalar motion what is meant by the term motion when associated with the concept of magnitude the answer is found in how we express the concept of motion as speed an inverse relation between some quantity of spatial distance s and some quantity of time t as s over T speed is just a ratio of space to time and therefore is motion and in a more generic sense simply a ratio of quantities it is important to understand that the concept of motion is a subset of ratio because ratio deal with magnitude whereas motion deals with quantity magnitudes of something namely time or space time and space in essence we have two similar Concepts that of scalar ratio generic and that of scalar motion which is specific to space and time scalar motion as used in the context of the reciprocal system of theory is therefore the projectively invariant cross ratio with specific aspects of space and time Concepts such as scalar waves scalar energy or scalar fields do not exist in the theory okay so let&#x27;s just reiterate this um scalar motion as used in the context of the reciprocal system of theory is therefore the projectively invariant cross ratio with specific aspects of space and time so uh he mentioned earlier that the cross ratio from projective geometry is a ratio of ratios and I think he&#x27;s saying that space and time are ratios and so speed is a cross ratio although I could be wrong I&#x27;m a little bit lost see if he can clear clear it up for me and maybe you as well in Larson&#x27;s books and papers lson uses motion as a ratio not a cross ratio because he makes an assumption about the absolute nature of unit speed as the natural datum of measurement and therefore eliminates it from I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m getting a little distracted here uh okay because he makes an assumption about the absolute nature of unit speed as the natural datm of measurement and therefore eliminates it from the cross ratio for convenience he makes an assumption about the absolute nature of unit speed as the natural datm of measurement and therefore eliminates it from the cross ratio for convenience since 1 / n / 1 over 1s 1 / n now uh par this section is called a universe of scalar motion three dimensions of scalar motion the scalar dimensions are behind all structure in the universe of motion these can be seen at the astronomical level particularly the expansion of galaxies that are often described described as spots on an inflating balloon the most common question that students of the reciprocal system ask is how can you have motion without something moving the problem stems from the fact that motion is taught as a mechanical quantity an amount of something typically velocity not magnitude not associated with a unit of measure try replacing the word motion with ratio as it will help to overcome the conceptual program in because you can have a ratio without anything moving okay I&#x27;m going to have to think about this uh a little bit as I um digest it over time I&#x27;m I&#x27;m kind of lost maybe my concept of ratio is a little bit off I&#x27;ve read this paper a few times before and apparently um I haven&#x27;t been able to figure it out yet um I was struggling with it yesterday but now I&#x27;m struggling with it more but we&#x27;re going to keep proceeding here what is actually moving our locations and for that to work you need an observer something to observe and a datum from which to measure change Larson scalar motion has a ratio to observe a ratio to measure change from the unit speed data forming the cross ratio but lacks The Observer so Larson scalar motion has a ratio to observe but lacks The Observer scalar motion cannot be observed directly but only by how it changes locations in space and time we call these scalar induced changes of location force fields electric field magnetism and gravity I think this is like what I was saying before that you don&#x27;t have a um you don&#x27;t have a direction until you define a reference point uh with gravitation which is basically the uh contraction of a ball of balloon with dots on it all of the locations on the surface of that balloon are moving toward each other but they&#x27;re not moving in any particular direction uh or field until you define a reference point and you arbitrarily say this one we are choosing uh to be stationary and all the other ones are moving in reference to that stationary one and then you can impute directions to all of the other ones um and I think that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s trying to get at here is saying that um we call these scalar induced changes of location force fields so the force field would be that relationship between uh the reference point and whatever the other uh the other dot the other yeah the other dot that you are choosing uh that it appears as if they&#x27;re attracting each other they&#x27;re moving toward each other but it that is not the case they&#x27;re moving toward all others um but when you isolate one you pick one as the as the reference point it appears as if there is a force field between the two because they&#x27;re moving toward each other but they aren&#x27;t they&#x27;re moving toward all others uh so um this is what he would he&#x27;s calling a scalar induced change of location the the uh scalar motion cannot be observed directly so you&#x27;re you&#x27;re not without that reference point you&#x27;re not observing anything directly yeah only until you define the reference point can you kind of uh begin to see the motions and then what you&#x27;re seeing is skewed what you&#x27;re seeing is a an abstraction you are abstracting one point from the whole system and um and then making the measurements based on that abstraction okay so uh it the force fields um magnetism electrics electric field magnetism and gravity um these scalar induced changes are called force fields even though there is actually no interaction between what is observed so there is no interaction between these points you we we observe it as a a force field but in reality there is no interaction it&#x27;s all points moving toward all other points um no need for interaction okay for example considering walking toward a door you have an internal motion that is mapped to a location and that motion is forcing a change of location you are not being magically pulled to the door by an invisible force it is solely an underlying motion that is causing your change of location this is the concept underlying the instantaneous attraction and repulsion of field effects such as gravity it appears instantaneous because there is actually no interaction at all they are independent motions that when observed appear to be interacting the lesson to be learned here is that in the reciprocal system scalar simply means magnitude only where the magnitude is a a finite number of great greater or equal to one and scalar motion refers to the ratio of speed which can be expressed in two forms s/ T velocity I think he means speed uh velocity is a speed with a direction scalar motion refers to the ratio of speed which can be expressed in two forms s over T velocity or t/ S energy I think he I think he means speed there but I long sis lost so I&#x27;m not lost I&#x27;m hanging on I&#x27;m a little confused but not maybe not totally lost okay well in either case that is the end of the paper and um uh he&#x27;s got a few footnotes here and uh I&#x27;m trying to see if there&#x27;s anything uh important in this um no okay um all right that&#x27;s the end of that paper and uh it was tough for me to get through that um but we&#x27;re going to tomorrow we&#x27;re going to move on to RS 2105 which is called uh Quantum Pi Pi the uh Greek letter that uh stands for the uh relationship between a uh the diameter of a circle and the um circumference of a circle and [Music] um this paper has also got me a little bit confused but um we will try to trudge through it tomorrow and see how we do this is uh it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that this is uh this particular paper is like utterly fundamental to the reciprocal system too uh but uh for some reason pet has it included in this whole bunch of nine papers um it it doesn&#x27;t strike me that this is fundamental but I could be totally wrong and I want to present this in a way uh you know that is faithful to what uh what pet wrote Because I am not in the position to kind of judge him um right or wrong because I&#x27;m confused about some of his his uh you know some of the things that he uh that he says and so I don&#x27;t want to put words in his mouth or edit his words out um unnecessarily so we&#x27;re going to go through RS 2105 tomorrow um and uh thanks for tuning in today have a</p>
