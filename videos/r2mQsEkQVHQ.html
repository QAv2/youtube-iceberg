            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>i&#x27;m going to go along in a rapid clip i&#x27;ve got a lot of information here so here we go the sse is no stranger to the subject of ufos unidentified aerial phenomena is just a new acronym for ufos back a couple of decades ago peter sturrock one of our founding members of sse arranged with rockefeller to hold a week-long workshop at the rockefeller residence where we brought in the best of the ufo researchers and then a panel of independent experts and had a week-long discussion of physical evidence related to ufo objects of which there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a significant amount of data and lawrence rockefeller hosted the whole thing it was it was a wonderful meeting eventually uh after publishing in the sse journal peter sturrock put together a book the ufo enigma and it is still one of the best books you can find out there to take a look at what are the physical aspects of ufos that researchers have uncovered however of course the government also is no stranger to the ufo phenomena anyone who follows a field would be familiar with project sign grudge and blue book but in 1969 the content committee shut it all down and said really we don&#x27;t need to be involved in this area anymore we&#x27;re we&#x27;re not learning anything we&#x27;re not getting anywhere it&#x27;s not clear that this is a significant area and so for the average person on the street that&#x27;s when it all kind of ended at least serious government interest in fact that&#x27;s not true the very memo that shut down blue book written by general bolender had as part of its language reports of ufos which could affect national security would continue to be handled through the standard air force procedures designed for this purpose nonetheless as far as the public was concerned that was it i mean even the air force public affairs office put out circulars all the time in response to questions saying no well we gave this up in 1969. what in fact did occur was that there were programs going on behind the scenes anyway as required by the belinder mineral now most people didn&#x27;t know about these programs they weren&#x27;t advertised they weren&#x27;t responded to foa requests usually went dry but that all changed last december when the new york times published a front page story on how there was this program investigating this area advanced aerospace threat identification program it was deeply buried but new york times had good sources and they came up with information about the program and so there&#x27;s been a lot of publicity about it since the new york times broke the story washington post cnn fox news has been picked up all over the place and one of the reasons why it&#x27;s attracted attention at this point are the quality of the sources going public ex-senate majority leader harry reid is the one who initiated the program top-rated f-18 pilots who encountered advanced aerospace vehicles at close range were permitted to come forward and tell their stories which up until now they hadn&#x27;t because they didn&#x27;t want to lose their flight status by reporting what they had found at least publicly and a number of significant department of defense and intelligence community officials have come forward to talk about the reality of this phenomena and the fact that there were programs going on the program was nicknamed advanced aerospace threat identification program atip people have trouble trying to get documents out of the pentagon by saying they want all documents in atip and they have a hard time because that wasn&#x27;t actually the name of the program that top name there is the actual name of the program but atip was with the nickname that it went by it began in june of 2007 defense intelligence agency was concerned about the fact that obvious observation had shown that advanced aerospace vehicles crafts of drones of unknown origin were flying all over the united states over waters in fact globally is the case and so a congressional budget was approved to address the issue behind the scenes center majority senate majority leader harry reid from nevada was the one who was the initiator of the program joined by senator enuay and senator stevens these are the people who generally approved programs that were in the black under high security behind the scenes and so they set up this program senator reid has not uh walked this back since all the news came out he&#x27;s been very forthright and given a number of interviews this particular statement sort of captures it all we don&#x27;t know the answers but we have plenty of evidence to support the questions this is about science and national security if america doesn&#x27;t take a lead answering these questions others will well there&#x27;s a twofold nature of the threat first of all you&#x27;ve got these advanced aerospace vehicles flying around that we don&#x27;t know where they come from who&#x27;s driving them what the intent is possibly off world even but the future threat was actually as far as a department defense went and the intelligence community one of the greater concerns what happens if potential adversaries achieve significant breakthroughs by getting hold of advanced technology either based on their study of the phenomena or from sensor data or crash retrieved materials then that could provide a problem for the united states in the sense of threat and there&#x27;s reason to be concerned about that this is a document in the program we dug up out of the soviet union it&#x27;s a very thick document it shows that the soviet union had a massive program also trying to get to the root of all of this and in this document a number of research institutes and military institutes are are listed and of course they had the same concerns we did is there threat from the phenomena or might the americans make headway before us and that be a threat just to give you an idea of what&#x27;s being observed which many of people seen because it&#x27;s been in the news a lot lately back in november of 2004 a nimitz carrier group was out on patrol off of san diego and on several occasions an advanced aerospace vehicle would descend rapidly from sixty thousand feet to fifty feet in seconds and then hover and then take off like a bullet when it first happened and happened over a number of weeks actually uh 2f18 i&#x27;ll talk about 2f18 pilots were vectored onto the site where this they were being observed by the radars to investigate and what they saw was what they called a tic-tac-craft solid white smooth no edges about 46 feet in length uniformly colored no nacelles pilings and wings the f-18s could not obtain lock with their radars because they were stealthy but forward-looking infrared radar could pick them up to some degree based on their heat signatures and the advanced aerospace vehicle appeared to demonstrate advanced acceleration aerodynamic and propulsion capability beyond anything that that we knew existed on the planet i&#x27;m going to play a flir video that many of you may have seen i&#x27;ve got sound with the video do you have a drawing bro there&#x27;s a whole fleet of overlook on the usa oh my gosh oh going against the wind the wind&#x27;s 120 knots west it&#x27;s rotated i&#x27;ll play it one more time my gosh they&#x27;re all going against the wind the wind&#x27;s 120 knots west that&#x27;s not an s though is it it&#x27;s not i don&#x27;t understand but if there&#x27;s a little thing now you might ask yourself well like what can you prove from from a videotape i mean you can see videotapes all over the internet and so on but this was data fusion their gun camera tapes they&#x27;re these video tapes for the pilots voice recordings data link recordings from aegis and many other military platforms expert witnesses so in fact the data density and this is what&#x27;s changed the field a lot our detection capability has gotten so advanced that we&#x27;re losing our inability to see exactly what&#x27;s going on the flear displays were recorded uh there are detailed debriefs of the pilots in that original new york times article you can see a page long debrief of dave fraver oops key assessments the advanced aerospace vehicle vehicle has no known air vehicle in the inventory of the us or foreign nation as far as we can tell low observable characteristics are stealthy they exhibit advanced aerodynamic performance we can&#x27;t imagine how they do it and recognize that these are infrared tapes from the pilots so if there was some kind of hot propulsion gases coming out the back you would have seen it but we don&#x27;t see that they had the advanced capability to remain stationary and then take off like a shot dave favor says it was like somebody suddenly shot a bullet so how to respond to this the defense intelligence agency put out a broad area announcement in fact it was unclassified they wanted to evaluate 12 potential threat areas with regard to these advanced aerospace vehicles there&#x27;s a list of them exactly what you would think you&#x27;d want to know lyft propulsion signature reduction human effects and so on now it turned out that anyone any aerospace corporation could could apply could send in a proposal dia chose beagle aerospace as a contractor to address the threat now there&#x27;s been buzz on the internet about okay well senator reid came from nevada and bigelow aerospace is in nevada so wasn&#x27;t this just some sweetheart deal in fact that&#x27;s not the case it was a broad area announcement anybody could go for it bigelow was actually a good choice he&#x27;d spent a lot of his own money because he was interested in this area up to this point investigating the phenomena and he had the best proposal and so he was tasked and so we set up a special organization called bigelow aerospace advanced space studies so we we call it bass to do all the things you&#x27;d expect a program like this to do well bass connected contacted me at earth tech international to collaborate as a subcontractor and i agreed to do that okay what did i address as a subcontractor well one of the critical issues is that there&#x27;s so much high level security and compartmentalization in this subject area and there&#x27;s a lot of it it&#x27;s difficult for contractors to obtain expert opinions on advanced technologies because they would expose why they were interested so i acted as a surrogate i was contracted to commission mostly unclassified white papers from experts around the globe where their particular aerospace related subject areas would be in 2050 as like a general survey of aerospace futures i decided this would be the best way to get the best knowledge we had across many technologies without actually exposing why we wanted to know so i let out 38 contracts over a two year period i&#x27;ll show you what the studies are on you can read them there positron aerospace repulsion iec fusion is a compact energy source warp drive dark energy extra dimensions metallic glasses for aerospace use really cutting edge kinds of things here&#x27;s some more of the papers that i commissioned negative mass propulsion anti-gravity for aerospace applications and so on programmable matter invisibility cloaking these are just the kind of things that we needed to have maximum technical input from the best people around the globe and so that that&#x27;s what we did that&#x27;s what i did now we could wait we told these people they could publish their uh reports in physics journals and engineering journals but of course the contractors didn&#x27;t want to wait for that so the defense intelligence agency bundled up these 38 papers and put them out as defense intelligence reference documents posted on a jwix server that anyone in the government or contractors could get access to by and large they have not been released and to the public yet a couple of like that so let me give you an example of well how does this stuff help people who are chasing these really difficult problems i&#x27;m choosing one here metamaterials for aerospace use i love to talk about really fancy materials but they&#x27;re classified however there&#x27;s a lot of materials that have been picked up or provided even in the public domain i&#x27;m going to give an example because it shows exactly what this structure is for how to deal with this this is an open source sample it was sent anonymously to talk show host art bell the fellow claimed to be in the military he said that this sample was picked up in a crash retrieval and so he sent it by email so what does that mean chain of custody non-existent providence questionable could be a hoax it could be some slag off of some foundry floor or whatever however it was an unusual sample so we decided to to take a look at it it was a multi-layered bismuth and magnesium sample bismuth layers less than a human hair magnesium sample is about 10 times the size of human hair supposedly picked up in the crash retrieval of an advanced aerospace vehicle looks like it&#x27;s been in a crash the white lines are the bismuth the darker areas are the magnesium separations so the question was what about this material so naturally we looked in all of the national labs we talked to metallurgists we combed the entire structure of published papers nowhere could we find any evidence that anybody ever made one of these secondly some attempts were made to try to reproduce this material but they couldn&#x27;t get the bismuth and magnesium layers to bond thirdly when we talked to people who in the materials field who should know they said we don&#x27;t know why anybody would want to make anything like this it&#x27;s not obvious that it has any function well years later decades later actually finally our own science moves along we move into an area called metamaterials and it turns out that exactly this combination of materials at exactly those dimensions turn out to be an excellent microscopic waveguide for very high frequency electromagnetic radiation terahertz frequencies so the wavelength is 60 microns which is you know pretty small size but it turns out that because of the metamaterial aspect of this material those bismuth layers that act as wave guides can be 1 20th the size of the wavelength and usually when you make a waveguide it&#x27;s got to be about the size of the wavelength so in fact this turned out to be a material that would propagate sub-wavelength waveguide effects why somebody wants to do that we still don&#x27;t know the answer to that but anyway it was amazing that we&#x27;ve gone through this and this is the kind of structure we go through a lot you get a material sample of unusual characteristics to be evaluated the method of manufacture is difficult to assess or reproduce [Music] the purpose of the function is not readily apparent as with our sample here and then as our own technical knowledge moves forward we finally see a possible purpose or function comes to light that sequence is repeated over and over in this particular area i&#x27;ll pick a second one here for the engineers and physicists in the crowd probably be more interesting space-time metric engineering this happened to be the paper that i myself provided one of the questions is can the reported anomalous observables of these advanced aerospace vehicles be accounted for on the basis of known physics i mean you hear people describing craft taking right angle turns at high speeds and other things with the hovering and rapid acceleration and so on as if the craft didn&#x27;t have any inertial mass well it turns out although general relativity einstein general relativity is usually used in astrophysical applications and gravity studies and so on you can look at it from an engineering standpoint so if you take an engineering approach to general relativity what i just showed can be can be understood if you could change the space time metric the way general relativity i&#x27;m talking about textbook not some fanciful physics you could even get faster than light travel alcubierre warp drive warp drive as in as in star trek again you might think that&#x27;s a fanciful kind of thing but that paper was published in one of the top general relativity journals classical corner gravity the warp drive hyper fast travel within general relativity so if you engineer space time metric you can begin to line up observables with physics that we know and love even if we can&#x27;t reproduce it what about the velocity of light constraint people are always saying that uh you know how could you have a wormhole you let you go from one side of the universe to the other aren&#x27;t you beating the speed of light well what does a physicist and engineer mean by the speed of light he means this little equation here where the speed of light is given by 1 over the square root of the permittivity times the permeability of the vacuum so the point is if you re-engineer those vacuum parameters then you can make the effective speed of light higher in the engineered region and so those are the solution in general relativity that are called wormholes and again it&#x27;s not science fiction this is just right off the shelf uh standard uh textbook general relativity applications so what that means is a reduced time interstellar travel is not as skeptics would say you can&#x27;t get from there to here advanced et civilizations now or ourselves in the future not fundamentally constrained by physical principles the exotic physics for such can be addressed in engineering terms metric engineering is aware does this have any help again by the way this paper also was published as one of the defense intelligence reference documents and since we are permitted to uh publish in the open literature uh i published that paper in a british interplanetary science journal and engineering journal so if you&#x27;re interested in looking at the details you can get learn as much as you want to know about metric engineering and that helped us understand some of the aspects i mean you may have heard the phrase dense stars you get redshift well it turns out in this engineered technology you get so-called blue shift that is frequencies are upshifted to higher frequencies so for example in this room so for example in this room most of the radiation coming off our bodies off the walls and so on is in fact in the infrared and but we see things in the visible range but what happens if you get into a volume of space where the vacuum has been engineered in the way i&#x27;ve been discussing it turns out you get a blue shift so in fact the infrared that you don&#x27;t ordinarily see can get blue shifted up into the visible so it&#x27;s not surprising that all these crafts should be so luminous now the downside from all of this is the fact that visible light which doesn&#x27;t have any particularly harmful effects gets blue shifted up into the ultraviolet so you get too close to the landing craft you might get a sunburn or off into the soft x-ray region so the chance of radiation poisoning so if you run across one of these sitting on the ground i would recommend you don&#x27;t and it&#x27;s powered up i&#x27;d recommend you don&#x27;t brush up and well that helped us to understand we as part of this program we looked at some cases that were really good from brazil 77-78 it was like close encounters of the third kind thousand pages of documents all done by the brazilian air force investigative team 500 photographs 15 hours of motion film a lot of medical injuries i know you probably can&#x27;t read that from here but just a list of the different kinds of medical injuries that occurred when people encountered these craft at close range and it has some overlap with cases that we&#x27;ve investigated during the program of injuries occurring well despite the progress in the atip program let&#x27;s face it topic is inherently anomalous right therefore despite the reality of the observations and all the people that we interact with in the intelligence community and the pentagon agree the data is there it&#x27;s it&#x27;s real nonetheless the topic doesn&#x27;t fit smoothly into known profiles of government programs for sure and by virtue of natural security implications it&#x27;s high compartmentalization of the topic therefore slow pace of cumulative progress and integration we call them stove pipes you have a lot of people with lots of detailed information about some particular aspect but they don&#x27;t talk to each other even it&#x27;s sitting at the next desk and let&#x27;s face it advocacy of the issue in government circles is not viewed as career enhancing in part because despite the weirdness of the subject if you don&#x27;t make a lot of progress you know it doesn&#x27;t look good on your resume that you&#x27;re moving up the line so because of that [Music] there&#x27;s a forward story many of us involved in the program decided that there should be an outreach program in the public sector so this is the forward story the goal was to establish a broad-based high-quality scientific community of interest in the public sector concerning these unidentified aerial phenomena and other related leading-edge topics and so we got together and formed a company called to the stars academy of arts and science it was co-founded by entrepreneur tom delong i&#x27;ll talk about him in a minute senior intelligence officers from the department of defense and cia and distinguished research scientists we all banded together to form this academy it was set up as a public benefit corporation so the public can invest and therefore it&#x27;s owned by the public so this is something new whatever comes out of any of the research or any of the released of information is actually going to be owned by the public it&#x27;s not going to disappear into a black hole very transparent structure if you go to the website you can see everything from the financial structure to the activities and we do have a web-based community of interest where things get posted for example those this f-18 flear tape i show we now have three of them up there probably more to come all right well who are the principals of this organization tom delonge blink 182 rock star frankly i&#x27;d never heard of 182. but my son told me oh yeah we know about blink 182. but anyway in addition to being the rock star that he is he&#x27;s also a director and producer puts out books and music and film and so on and he&#x27;s had a lifelong interest in the ufo area and so he started talking with various people and he was kind of the i could you say the action-oriented person who said why don&#x27;t we set up something why don&#x27;t we make this more available to the public and he got to a number of us and so we all began to band together lou elizondo who was in fact the department of defense&#x27;s the pentagon&#x27;s 8-tip program director resigned from the pentagon and joined us chris mellon 20-year career deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence minority staff director of the senate select committee intelligence he joined us we got jim simavan 25-year career in cia&#x27;s director of operation he was the real james bond kind of guy steve justice just retired as program director for the billion dollar programs at lockheed martin skunk works he joined us and then i agreed to be on the board so i joined them in addition to my science and engineering background i&#x27;ve had a lot of activity and in classified areas so i was it was a natural fit for me interacting with all these people we also put together a policy and scientific advisory panel of the best people we could find chris mellon agreed to be the chair dr come kelleher he was actually the deputy administrator at bigelow aerospace to run the atip program out of the pentagon dr gary nolan top genetics genetics professor at stanford university dr khan 30-year career with cia counter biological weapons program dr rapp professor of military and emergency medicine uniform services university dr gilpin consultant on academic biomedical research and research law so we put together a team as panelists to keep us on the straight and narrow of really top people who have wonderful backgrounds and really want to see scientific work be done in this area so the goals for the to the stars academy are promote the concept that such forefront topics as ufos seti consciousness studies even telepathy and psychokinesis should not be considered taboo for serious scientific consideration so i mean it&#x27;s a perfect match to the ssc because that&#x27;s our goal in the ssc as well and of course a big idea is to generate funding to underwrite significant research in these areas develop user-friendly databases so information that is generated can be accessed by anyone provide positive support for collaborative government aerospace industry and academic efforts to accomplish all of the above so we want to act as the glue in the public sector and create entertainment properties books and documentaries and so on so that whatever is learned can be generated can be delivered out to the public uh the structure of the organizations has a science structure an aerospace structure and an entertainment division what are the activities of this organization to date actually we were responsible for legitimizing the topic in the mainstream press that story that came out in the new york times and so on which then got picked up by washington post cnn fox news was based on agreed upon interviews with those of us that i&#x27;ve just gone through a list of and given the quality of the sources coming out from the shadows for example ex-senate majority leader harry reid top f-18 pilots significant department of defense and intelligence community officials the bar has been raised on legitimization of this topic in the public arena we think that&#x27;s an accomplished goal to date and via the community of interest postings on the website we now have three high quality f-18 video tapes of unidentified error phenomena encounters they&#x27;ve been previously languishing in the pentagon servers nobody doing that much with them these are still being generated one of the tapes is from 2016 off the east coast of the united states i mean there are a lot more tapes hopefully we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll get a lot more of them posted uh we only we don&#x27;t just produce positive results what people would think would be supportive results one of our scientists science advisors is gary nolan from from stanford university who&#x27;s a genetics expert and there had been claims that some small humanoid skeleton found in chile so-called atacama humanoid you know might be e.t you can see why somebody might might think that if you see the structure but anyway nolan and people from other universities put together a complete genetics thing and uh did the entire genome and found that in fact no unfortunately this is not evidence of et it&#x27;s a deformed human and so that&#x27;s up on the website if you want to read the paper it was published in one of the top genetics journals very well peer-reviewed and meetings are being set up with people from other countries because other countries who also have materials don&#x27;t necessarily want to give them to the us government because they disappear in a black hole and they never learn anything but given our commitment as a public benefit corporation that that&#x27;s not going to happen with us they&#x27;re now talking to us and we&#x27;re collaborating on obtaining materials from foreign countries and of course we&#x27;re negotiating with media outlets to get all this out in the public in the form of documentaries or tv shows or whatever so basically that&#x27;s the back story and the forward story and i&#x27;m glad to answer any questions i&#x27;ll answer it either i can&#x27;t thank you thank you for a terrific presentation um so your good friend john alexander published a book and i know i&#x27;ll have a chance to ask him this too why was it so hard for him to find who was you know who&#x27;s doing the research who was holding files on ufos and his book he said everybody thought that somebody else was doing it but you know said everybody said in all the departments it&#x27;s not me it&#x27;s not us they&#x27;re doing it it was somebody else doing it and uh if if materials are being held in special access programs uh casual conversation even with high-level people and who know your interests and they&#x27;re interested too won&#x27;t necessarily reveal the facts well i think lou elizondo even said his own boss wasn&#x27;t quite sure what he was doing so i don&#x27;t know if that was true that&#x27;s true thank you um uh my name is joe bookman i was part of the organizers of the 2013 citizens hearing which was an attempt to bring the best of the evidence before six or four members of congress i don&#x27;t know if you were aware of that if you were i&#x27;d be interested in your take on it but um my second question then would be out of everything you said i thought one of the most interesting things was there are a lot more tapes um are those classified and if not or even if they are can you characterize them in any way or tell us what you might be about they&#x27;re not a lot different from this and some of them are classified because of where they were taken but as far as the content of what we&#x27;re interested in from a technical standpoint they&#x27;re not that different and provided you strike out the say location and so on then there&#x27;s a chance of getting them declassified and we&#x27;re working on that yeah if that was a tv channel i&#x27;d be quite likely to and generally speaking out of the whole world of the ufo field or more specifically regarding that citizens hearing from five years ago is there anything you found useful beneficial i know there&#x27;s a lot of hoax tourism and posterism and fraud involved in what&#x27;s called technology well you have to pick and choose among the data i&#x27;m familiar with the citizens hearing and so on and certainly the depositions by the individuals who were in the launch towers for missiles who had bob salas for example that&#x27;s all really good data and so and the faa administrator who came forward all good data thank you hey thanks very much for the talk uh um i wanted to bring up something um in regards to um the nature of the release and i guess it was the figure was 22 million as well as a program that was stated to be closed i guess it&#x27;s i guess it might be a leap but i think uh it&#x27;s basically a common knowledge amongst uh ufo researchers that the spending in actualities and um you know the billions if not more um so some people in the ufo research community have you know raised the question of you know is this a wooden duck on the pond uh to state a figure so low is 22 million and then state that the program no longer exists um i was hoping that you might make some comments on uh the great deal of concern i think that has risen from these these statements thank you that&#x27;s a fair concern this 22 million dollar program was one particular program that doesn&#x27;t say there weren&#x27;t other programs with other funding levels and so it isn&#x27;t like suddenly there was this one program it didn&#x27;t last long didn&#x27;t have that much money and it shut down i mean interest is continuing negotiations are continuing other programs are being looked at so a lot is going on i and my colleagues spend a lot of time in washington talking to committees that are looking at this from many different angles so the general view that oil is just one program came forward didn&#x27;t provide much of value and then it got cancelled that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not really the case and also those those figures are associated with the figures that went out to contractors but that doesn&#x27;t mean that people within the system aren&#x27;t still working on it you know um all of us maverick and inventors working in our garages on metric engineering devices is there going to be a clearinghouse for um people to um trade discoveries like just the thing about the frequency shift oh we can all be looking for line shifts and lasers to see if we generate micro effects in that but just something like that is incredibly valuable but maybe there&#x27;s a lot of other things like that well we have a maverick and vendor program at earth tech international my organization and also the to the stars academy is putting together a research organization so if you&#x27;re doing symmetric engineering in your lab and you&#x27;ve got some laser shifting and frequency bring them all we&#x27;ll look at them okay thank you very much thank you</p>
