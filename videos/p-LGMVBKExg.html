            <p>[Music] hey good morning everybody my name is Miguel Cisneros I&#x27;m part of the honeywell homes now receive do training and tech support department and first of all thank you very much for your time when this and at this moment we&#x27;re gonna what we&#x27;re gonna this webinar is going to be about the Lynx series panels why is the best wireless solution with and we&#x27;re going to see what the advantages for your also for your own automation on video and we have the fast and safe solution for your projects okay [Music] star of the one second just one second let me okay there we go Lynx touch this actually there is three series three families or lynx lynx touch this is the 50 the 5100 the 5200 and the l7000 100 series pretty much they&#x27;re similar not there&#x27;s some differences between them but the 50 the 5100 it is not longer on we not selling that anymore so we have only the 5200 series on the l7000 series okay um the honeywell lynx lynx touch features as a bright full of color tactile screen as you can see on the other picture with graphic icons every source on an easy operation is really easy to to navigate from the from the from the screen and going through pan to different screens and also to programming it&#x27;s all touchscreen is very easy and it also has an advanced alert communication and a home automation and the control capabilities of this these two panels those are the you can see that in the left side it&#x27;s the 5200 city the 5210 on the right side is the 7000 the seventh of the screen is a little bigger pretty much that you can see more you can if you connected to two cameras you can see up to four cameras instead of only one camera view if you use the 5210 but basically it&#x27;s a little bigger not too too much and we&#x27;re going to see the characteristics in the following slides linked a third series our total moves and wireless other bunnies is 100% wireless well we say 100% which actually if they have one only one wire Sun that you can you can wear it once on so number one that&#x27;s the only one everything else is Wireless and they all work with with Honeywell wireless devices the the 5800 series it won&#x27;t work with any other devices in terms of wireless devices for security you won&#x27;t work with any other brands on the Honeywell it&#x27;s reliable and plus innovation they touch the screen and completely color it&#x27;s fully color and it&#x27;s easy to identify the icons because are pretty big and easy to read easy to find out to follow the icons we&#x27;re going to see some features as I say it&#x27;s easy to understand the icons you see to use the touchscreen nothing difficult about it full-color graphics and easy flow operation meaning between when we move between between screens it&#x27;s really easy to go back or go forward different screens it has a system&#x27;s own voice notification family message center we&#x27;re going to talk about it with later integrated Seaway technology you can control thermostat door locks lights a/c garage door etc high voice operation on the phone hands-free you can talk through these panels just more the benefit of this panel is supports communication to central monitors via conventional telephone lines or GPS my IP or y5 all these are accessories that we can install inside the inside panels we&#x27;re going to see a little bit more later communication via GSM 2g 3G 4G it depends where is applicable it&#x27;s comparable fully compatible with Total Connect let you control your Seaway equipment and devices through Total Connect you can see the weather in your city you can get emergency alerts and traffic and also news and in the screen of your panel through Total Connect remote systems services I&#x27;m sorry you can operate the link touch from any smart for a smart phone or compatible device it&#x27;s fully compatible with Total Connect it&#x27;s easy to use easy to identify the status of songs many are easy to follow I understand simple simple words simple English nothing fancy nothing technical full Texas ting information I&#x27;ll show multiple songs per page this is on benefits for these dollars it has an easy menu navigation touch programming options reduce installation time and close because basically you&#x27;re not running you know writing any more cables every all the devices are wireless so you just go to the main pattern let you start like programming the wireless devices you cut a lot of time installing time and also money right programming options available next an existing list up low and down low a below to compass software what is a compass of a compass software is a software the Honeywell and receiver has that you can download it for free at the my web tech that come my website that Honeywell calm and then you download compassing with this software you can you can connect remotely to the to the panels not being on site meaning if you&#x27;re in your office or somewhere else you can if there isn&#x27;t this a there&#x27;s a problem with the panel you can remotely connect to the panel and fix easily you don&#x27;t have to send a technician um you know wasting time going to the to the to the site where the panel is located you remotely can fix it the only thing you can do it with there is a device that you got to change or change batteries or something you know then you just that&#x27;s what you get a you get it away physically and on the site but everything else programming you can do it you can do it remotely through the compass software their communication options is a Wi-Fi communication module the I offer the lowest cost communication for the alarms because using the Internet the remote service solution installation time-saving no data cable to install and the reflection of Monte operation cause whether it is used as a backup or primary the 4G cellular technology 4G 3G this modern radio finds the best signal in the area in ensuring that the alarm signal reaches the Central Station maximize installation opportunities IAM and they&#x27;ii uses also the conventional analog telephone line this patterns are comparable with that too so these three ways of communication basically for this Lynx touch panels this advanced communication options give installation company the flexibility they need to service all the customers whether they rely on the mobile phones voice over IP or conventional telephone lines you we also this panel they they do they have the the Seaway technology centralizing control the Seaway connectivity module also you gotta use order a little module we&#x27;re going to see later on inside the panel in order to get this this service and this module allows you to integrate security lighting thermostat locks and a lot some more options allowing you to enjoy centralized control at the tips of your fingers you can even do it through your phone to your cell phone we want to see some features of this this panel basically they have a 80 sons one as we say before one is the only ones on the so number one is a hardwired zone does the only one it has 16 extra son for for the key fob meaning each key five uses up to four so view you can use up to four key fob in this panel and the other 63 sons are RF protection zones from Psalm number two to so number 64 the key fob is going to use some 140 through 155 you can have a 232 user code on the 5210 or 58 on the l7000 you can see up to 120 a viewable events log on the 5210 or 256 on the 7000 those are events that happening on the on the panel but the actions or the that the users do on the panel you can see it and without asking the Central Station for a report or something you can see up to 128 he has a 16-3 - as the skaters the 5210 he has a the screen is 4.7 inches color display the 7000 has a 7 7 inches a little bit little bit bigger they both had to weigh voice over GSM IP or Wi-Fi they both are Total Connect remix has a the Total Connect he has remote services and then both can see the tour Acuna cameras a local view they have to the camera have to be in the same network as the panel and as I said the 5210 you can see in the screen up to one one camera at a time but in the 7000 you can see up to four four cameras at a time these more features intuitive programming interface to expansion sport for Seaway my five is inside the panel we can we can install two modules one for the Seaway or work for the y5 to dedicated buttons for easy to use the panic and the home button who are in the front no you can see let me seek and I can have a laser point right here you can see the panic on red and the homepage on the right side contact ID and saya of reporting form options they compatible with desire reporting form options these are the the module we&#x27;ll be talking about this is the L 50 100 zero a is a little module who was inside the panel if you want to have the Seaway technology capabilities and this is the L 5100 Wi-Fi if you&#x27;re going to have Y 5 on this on this panel those are not included you gotta get it as an extra this is the 50 L 5100 y5 includes a WPS enrollment that&#x27;s for security the 5100 z-wave that includes the network Y inclusion they both this both panel includes the advanced the APL the advanced protection logic which is a new technology in case of they want to destroy the they want to destroy the panel I want to talk a little bit of more about it later it has a garage door status and control you can see on the panel the notifications about severe weather or tornadoes you can control the water wall also and this is the here we got the Seaway module and the Wi-Fi connection and here we got the L the internet options if you wanna have it as an option as you know you can connect that in the wired internet these are the two the two module and this is therefore LG this is for GSM communication internet for GL and the ilp5 communication models allow the Lynx touch both of them to control a communicate with the center station via GSM cellular network or the Internet if you if you had only met and your internet goes down there&#x27;s no way this panel is going to communicate with the Central Station unless you have either a phone line or GSM communicator right the GSA has a little a little sim card over here and it&#x27;s going to is going to connect to which to who whatever a cell phone company in your in your area with the most cover wherever it has a more signal in your area it&#x27;s going to connect automatically and it&#x27;s going to be able to communicate to Central Station if the internet goes down right more facial speakerphone options it has a speaker phone option message center you can leave messages here in the in the panel and it&#x27;s going to show don&#x27;t see here but it&#x27;s going to show this is a new one is a new message is going to show there is a new message you can leave messages here like for example you you there&#x27;s nobody nobody&#x27;s going to be in the house and you&#x27;re going to leave a message for your son your daughter when they come back from from school so they&#x27;re going to see this a message here so they can click on it and listen to your message communication options the way we already talked about a part which is the another line telephone an online gsm IP and Wi-Fi remote phone control features is this is when we use the parts line remote programming over parts lines and I learn it using compass oft where we can also connect the composite of a using just the telephone line you have to be define I have to be registered to a learning otherwise you won&#x27;t you won&#x27;t be able to to see the to connect remotely but when you when you register your your planet to a Lebanon now you&#x27;re going to be able to see their the compass the you&#x27;re going to be able to see the programming of the of your panel menu driven radio registration is going to show you the signal strength display - real clock a real-time clock and calendar either if you are connected to two alarm ring is gonna is going to update it automatically otherwise you can type it in there the time and the turning of the meditate voice announcements for resisting status and end user device activation this is a little table of a comparison of the old three panels as I said before the 5100 is no longer available only the 52 series and the 7000 series and then this is the comparison between zones the sixth the 5200 has 64 songs the 7080 the 52 has 32 users you can assign it can be up to 34 users did the 7000 48 the cameras you can see only one in the 7000 you can see up to four and this is the like the locks this the term of tells how many you can have it at the same time communication they will have the same communication or know the seven and sorry the 7000 has no pot analog lines anymore judge DSN IP and y5t when load 128 256 garage door up to 3 the 5200 the 7000 for and rules things and schedule 20 20 20 they&#x27;re both the same both both funny have the this feature this is a new feature the nice day arming and the styling excitation the styling exit option for away arming it doubles the exit delay time and the armed night option the quick arm if enable is they all going to show in the other screen if you wanna you can select it or no the ninth day arming the system can be armed at in at night oh no I&#x27;m sorry this isn&#x27;t can be arming nine state in the the optional nine state by choosing the arm nine option after choosing a stay arming this also we only this option will only show on the keypad if a motion zone has been chosen for arm nine in the zone programming this is programming you will if you you get a select the Sun that you don&#x27;t want it to to go on a learn any song chosen we still be active when arm in the stay mode and will activate the learn all the other interior zones not chosen on the on this programming if you&#x27;re going to add soon we bypass as usual and the silent exit since exit warning is primarily enabled this allows the end user to choose arming away with no exit warming warning during the arming process so if you go inside and exit it&#x27;s not gonna I&#x27;m going to give you any exit warning when you when you arm the system this is some sigh a listed features that are included in this panel song options are permanently enabled the DX arrow the exit warning the reset closing the power in previous state those are this panel they have to be compatible with the SIA listed this is organization who rules the whole alarm systems on the world other fields has some restrictions and default changes like the swing swinger suppression the suing a suppression is the option that limits the number of messages that is going to be sent to the central station for a specific zone like for example if son is in trouble and then you don&#x27;t want that travel to goes like all nine sending any signals with the Central Station so what you do which is limited if there is a travel or something to just eliminate two three times four times five times only now not all the time the alarm report delay by default is 30 seconds the enter delay the entry late 182 also its 32nd by default you can change it any time and exe delays sixty seconds by default you can change it also any time but those are the those are the program in the eraser bite by by default by the fabric and it be changed at any time but it you have to be like that so they comparable desire listed you know we&#x27;re going to see a little the wiring this is the inside of the other panel here over here we can see the with the telephone line another telephone line goes the taper in the tip and ring here we&#x27;re going to see the two connectors for the battery the small one is the normal standard high capacity battery and the other one is the super high capacity pallet here we can see the Sun so number one the only song that it which is why here with the 2k another line resistor here we can see the power the power supply you want to make sure in this in this case here it&#x27;s very important that you go positive with positive and negative with negative nine no it&#x27;s not like the other Vista panel which the AC power is now it really doesn&#x27;t matter which one which one goes to positive negative in this one yes it&#x27;s a DC so you got to make sure you put this one right right the positive and the negative okay this is a axillary connector if you wanna use a power supply connector that they sell it to instead of a instead of running to cable from the power supply to the terminal that is like a power supply to just connect here this is a speaker connector this is a microphone connector and here you this is where you a we only saw the module if you if you happen to get the module this is where you can install it this is the connector this is more there are small small modules that they&#x27;re going to go here basically this is how it is in the inside of the other panel this is the backup batteries these two back cover is a high capacity of a super high capacity part numbers there&#x27;s the part number the normal battery standby time is four hours and the super high capacity is 24 hours and those are the the part numbers if you&#x27;re gonna if you can order them this is how you do this this is a temple of all the panels at the tamper if you open the if you opened the the panel is going to is going to send you an alarm and this is how you install it they have the mountain hooks this is the back edge this is the front case and then the solder hose mounting holes that you can install it either the crystal around under on the wall or you can stand up on an on the table for that you have to get another another part which is Stan Stan app device so you can have it on your on the table we want to see basically those are the features that this planet has buffered in the 5200 7000 as you see is 100% Wireless and then you save you a lot of time and cost in terms of installation and managing this panel they both compatible with compasso you can you can you can access remotely this the programming of this of these panels is totally compatible with Total Connect and also you can you can have zy technology and this and y5 and also you can see the camera to laconic cameras if they install the same network so very the program is very easy we&#x27;re going to see a little bit we don&#x27;t a hole into we&#x27;re gonna we know that we&#x27;re not going to go into the whole programming thing but we&#x27;re going to see some very important parts of the programming so you see how see how how easy it is to twist all to program the the zones the devices the Wylla devices in this in these two panels this is the the main screen you select more on the first page of the home screen the you click on just remember this is a touch the screen so you just touch on more it&#x27;s going to open another it&#x27;s going to open another window so you press here tools you have other options a mistake or say did you press tools by default then I&#x27;m going to ask you further in you&#x27;re going to enter to enter the code book by default since we&#x27;re going to go to programming by default the code is solar code is 4 1 1 2 later on you can change it and then here if you pull if you type installer code it&#x27;s going to send you to the programming mode screen if you put a master code which is 1 2 3 4 ready for you&#x27;re going to go to to see another another optional officials write like add users for example is you do like schedules like you&#x27;re going to do it with the with the master code not with installer code with the installer code is basically to to do the programming Ozone&#x27;s programming of communication the report you put the 401 - and then you&#x27;re going to go to the to the main menu or the programming you&#x27;re gonna select program this as you can see you have different different options you select programs and think it&#x27;s going to show you another options but before we go any further there&#x27;s another way to is to go to the programming mode if you don&#x27;t have if you for example you don&#x27;t have the the solid code or you forget it or they change it and you don&#x27;t know which is in solid code there&#x27;s another way to get into programming without knowing the story code which is this you power cycle the the the panel and then you turn around while the panel is initializing you&#x27;re going to see initialization on the screen it&#x27;s going to show a red system standby button on the top it&#x27;s going to display that after the red minor changes to yellow or green then at that moment you&#x27;re gonna press there is going to be an icon that you&#x27;re going to press security and then you get a follower by away or stay any any of those as soon as you do that you&#x27;re going to press it clear the clear icon you&#x27;re going to see it an icon set clear followed by zero zero and then after you do that it&#x27;s going to show you this second screen as as if you were like installing there if you were typing in the the solar code this is the second this is the second way how to get into programming this is the way without knowing the Scala code of you forgot about it and then after here you just can change it back to the to whatever you want in red there&#x27;s a notice system as we in the disarm state to enter programming if he&#x27;s armed you can do it you can just cking go just can go to the programming room okay when you enter to programming both both of the but the icons on the front the button is going to be flashing meaning meaning that did the UM and programming mode and it&#x27;s going to show you a lady&#x27;s system programming so just to make sure them if you see if you&#x27;re in programming you&#x27;re going to see the LED flashing the first thing we always tell people like it&#x27;s too unless you you get this panel brand new but if you got a brand new the snow there was no programming before so it&#x27;s from factories brand new but if you got it from somebody else oh you bought it on eBay or something else we always recommend to to do the factory default so you can erase everything what was saved on this palette before like which you don&#x27;t know all the users or the songs or the report or the account numbers everything and the way to do it if you go when you go here when you get into programming mode you go to is to installer code now I&#x27;m sorry to system to the whole configuration well the first this is the first screen so you go down the arrow for more options and then in the second screen is going to show you default configuration you click you click on it and then just going to show you this all kind of default configuration you&#x27;re going to press number one and then is gonna ask you if you are sure you say yes I think it&#x27;s going to be like twice or three times baby bib and then the bib confirms that everything was erased you go back with a back arrow and then you go you will if you go to the solar code here you can change the distillate go by deposit four one one two if you want to change it you go clear or you click on the back arrow I think it&#x27;s going to erase it and then you put the new four-digit installer code and then you select none make sure you know those those two the four digit don&#x27;t forget that and then you go another option system types here you&#x27;re going to make the necessary change this is where you enable or disable a lot of features of this panel like for example the the RF Jam if you want to you can enable or disable the two ways voice the phone notification here it depends on what you what you&#x27;re going to do you either enable or disable the event log alarm you enable it or disabling you don&#x27;t you just click once you click once and it&#x27;s going to just going to change it to disabled after that whatever you do after you&#x27;re with don&#x27;t forget you have more options if you go down you will save it otherwise you won&#x27;t it won&#x27;t save your your changes and we stay the way it was before so you always save it to program the day and time to just go to the day anti option and then you click on it if you have a communication communicator like for example the GSM or the uh the IEP I mean the L ILP f-35 communicator is going to be updated rheumatica via the alumni network if not to just click on their time it&#x27;s going to show you the the new this new window and then you put the you select the date and then you and then you go down the arrow it&#x27;s going to just you&#x27;re going to input the time then you go down the arrow is going to input the time zone depending where you are and then also at the end always you save it otherwise you won&#x27;t save any any changes you just it so you save it and then you get the time and date on the panel this is how you&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re going to add the wireless zones to add edit or delete any wireless zones you will we&#x27;re gonna select under the programming system menu zones in this case we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re going to configure the zones it&#x27;s gonna I&#x27;m just going to show you this screen they already it&#x27;s going to already by default it&#x27;s going to show you like so number two is our own front door so no batteries backdoor it doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to you have to keep those you can change at any time just this is what it comes by the by factor default but you can change it anytime you you click on add new like for example we&#x27;re going to do the front door we click on it we then we&#x27;re going to is going to open this one number two and then we&#x27;re going to put all the information of the zone number two the first thing is going to ask you for the CL number you click on the see a number and then these two ways to learn to enroll they see the device will serial number or all devices has a why they ask you for the CL number because all the wireless devices has a serial number I sticker on the device and this you can enroll this via RF or the second the second option is type in the serial number on the pattern the way you do it a via RF via wireless you&#x27;re going to open and close the device one time then you&#x27;re going to open and close the device again it&#x27;s going to the first time the first time is going to get the serial number the second time is going to get the loop number without you typing automatically it&#x27;s going to take it when you open and close the device and then you&#x27;re going to do a third time to come fill the same number loop number and gonna you&#x27;re gonna you wanna hear a beep a trip I think it&#x27;s three bits on the system so that the beeps is telling you that that you already took it then you press done and you done then you go to some description you change it if this this panel has already set up like a dictionary with a lot of zone description word so view if you&#x27;re looking for a word just operate pressing the the first letter like for example if you&#x27;re pressing s here the first letter that this shows on the screen is going to be safe and then you press the L is going to change it to sliding and then we you when you when the correct word is displayed you just select done you know until you you you find a word and you press done and it&#x27;s going to it&#x27;s going to select it now for example here we just select the sliding word so in some species number two so I got it then we&#x27;re going to go to the vise type proven and they&#x27;re going to show you all the device type you&#x27;re going to go down for more options [Music] sample if response I option for door you&#x27;re going to select the respond type for this zone depending on the on the respond time is going to show different options they&#x27;re not always the same it depends on the device type okay he&#x27;s going to show you a different option for the particular device type so you know for example this case is a door so we&#x27;re going to select entry x1 and then we&#x27;re going to select the alarm report you wanna if you want report the alarm yes or no the time you wanna you wanna listen to the chime on the on the on the on the panel or not and then if you&#x27;re going to supervisor and supervise this zone after that you press save and then this zone is or it&#x27;s safe so in order to program a zone you just gotta fill out all these options steel number loop description do you put a no description you want the device type the response type and then this reception is a depends on on the client if they want a supervisor or not supervisor you wanna hear now here people don&#x27;t like to hear that and all the time when you open at or when you close the door and if you want to report it to the learners in the station up okay this is basically how your program is on here how you program a key fob same thing very very similar you in the programming zone you press the key option you go to add new you&#x27;re going to press a key type and it depends what type of a key fob it is we have a one button to button for button after you select the the button you go to the serial number we&#x27;re going to same thing with the CL number in this case you wanna you wanna press the left button up up right left button up left I&#x27;m sorry up left like for two seconds and then when when you when you press it it&#x27;s going to it&#x27;s going to beep once is going to show you the the serial number of the button then you press it again just going to show you the loop number you press it for two seconds you&#x27;re going to release it&#x27;s going to show you the climate and then you press done after that just doing one zone remember this the key fob have four zones just pressing one zone it&#x27;s gonna it&#x27;s gonna it&#x27;s going to fill out all the other zones automatically example in this case we&#x27;re going to start with some 140 which is the first key fob so the key just doing one the key the bottom key number one is going to be there McQuaid the key number two is going to be desired and the key number three is gonna be armed stay as shows and shows on the line deck and the key fob buttons the little the little icon the little pictures in each one and then key number four for now it&#x27;s going to be not respond we&#x27;re going to change it to panic we go does that&#x27;s the main function of the of the key number for the panic and then you get a after that you just assign the key fob to a user otherwise if you if you don&#x27;t assign a user to the key fob it won&#x27;t work just won&#x27;t work you have to assign a user so you go to user you click any user number four or whatever number three and then you select it and then you turn this is see this is how it looks like they keep up with the different people sorry with the different options are my way our mistake is are and respond if you&#x27;re gonna not respond how to program to panic you just click on the respond you have different options which one you&#x27;re going to put 24-hour audible 24-hour silence no panic usually 24 hours audible or siling if you&#x27;re going to send it just to the center station you click on that just save it an instant okay now we saw another some other features that we&#x27;re going to go really quick with this the Central Station programming if you&#x27;re going to program that you go to the main screen again and then you go to report you go and click on the primary center station information or the secondary whatever if you have to you click in each one the type contact ID four-digit the depends of what type four digit ten digit depending you just select it go to the phone number you click the phone number if you&#x27;re gonna put a nine first you you put a nine and a comma or you go to to get outside line for example if you&#x27;ve got a personal you put a nine comma and then the number you depress done or Whitten done or save depending on different screens are different options this one is done you go to account number you put the account number 24 6000 for example in this in this screen you press done if you&#x27;re going to change it it&#x27;s already account a common number razor you the way you change it is you clear first or you press the back arrow and then it&#x27;s going to clear it and then you put a new one okay it&#x27;s going to put the FF ever and then do you&#x27;re ready to put a new account number communication communicator type depends where you have installed in your in your system and then you gotta go to the dynamic priority or dynamic the delay dynamic priorities if you value communicator yesterday here which wing which way is going to send a signal first through to a phone line to GSM to IP independent what you have on the planet and the dynamic delay it is going to tell you the time 30 seconds 60 seconds 90 seconds if teen seconds to wait until they send a signal to a central station this is where you you change all these options you go down if you&#x27;re going to report everything you go press to report all and then you&#x27;re going to report every single active activity of the other panel otherwise you can say it you can go to to the other options and and select one by one okay from this era we there is more options here if you go down like the sounder you can configure program the standard how how many minutes is gonna is gonna sound the time out if you want it to the alarm sound or not the burglar a bell time out the fire Bell time all of you gonna go if you&#x27;re gonna hammer confirm this this there&#x27;s are the option for the for the sounder in here assisting the song sister configuration here like the entry late one the enter late to the XE delay the backlight time out all these the quick on the quick exit you can in here you can change it options if you click on the down arrow and then after you do select everything you need to select you save it and then you are there if you&#x27;re going to reset the master code now they the first one was the installer code master code is by default one two three four you&#x27;re going to reset it you click on reset it here it&#x27;s going to going to tell you it&#x27;s going to double us yes or no and then you you put a new one and then that&#x27;s it you change it programming the learning communication model this is when if you have a communicator module like the GSM or IP the way you do you go again to system programming on your communicators communicator pad is either this is where you see they&#x27;re only Wi-Fi would be the same or both of them at the same time this is where you&#x27;re gonna this is where you&#x27;re going to select it you&#x27;re going to select the APL enable yes or no what is APL actually APL is it&#x27;s a new feature like for example is going to give you additional 75 second delay to send a signal to the center station like for example when this when the system is a how he works it&#x27;s like for example when a will you your they want to destroy you they&#x27;re gonna go inside your house they&#x27;re going to wrap your house and the guys going to want to since everything is connected to the to the panel inside the panel it&#x27;s not like other planet like the Vista panel for example that the communicator and everything is in different places the main panel for example is in the basement and then it&#x27;s all the other devices and differing all the places in this in this case the the Lynx is only in one only one place and everything is installed inside so so if they&#x27;re going to rub your help probably they&#x27;re going to destroy your destroy your panel and then when you throw the panel is going to destroy everything the communicators everything but that&#x27;s why this is a this feature goes it&#x27;s good the advance for the protection logic as soon as the delay at the delay door is open is going to wafers the first 30 second sentry depending how many seconds is going to wait for for somebody to put the Atlantic all right like normally you open the door just gonna is going to give you a time to go to the panel and and disarm the system in this case no wise man is a resistible the data just destroy them just destroyed for example no it&#x27;s just throw the panel so it&#x27;s going to give you another signify second delay before sending the sending the the signal to the Central Station if then nobody nobody if they see it it&#x27;s an opening and nobody put the call is going to send it out and 75 and the other 75 seconds is going to send the signal to Central Station saying like this on alarm if it is a normal entry of your house and then you&#x27;re going to open the door the it&#x27;s going to see it&#x27;s going to send it the scene automatically but it&#x27;s going to put on hold until eces that you put the code this is going to disarm there they learn that your panel and then the whole is not going to be sent to the to the center station but if they nobody is going to put a code thing is going to send the signals of the Central Station that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s the main thing about the APL logic okay communication programming if you&#x27;re gonna connect the communicator you&#x27;re going to program the kanessa communicator and then you&#x27;re gonna we prevent the communicator with a learner for example you go you go to communicator then you put the CID so this is a count number right CID the city the CID the center station ID and sup ID they have it done supervision how many you want to do 24 hours even as a nun you&#x27;re going to do 30 days you change it over here the old a long time there&#x27;s more options on the top on the bottom then you&#x27;re going to go remote account communication you can enable or disable it I&#x27;m multimode communication and hazard reports in a pending way or how you want it but this is where you program all the options for communicator programming GSN default I&#x27;m the IP fault I&#x27;m all these options we&#x27;re going to go in details but this is where you change the options if you had a tan communicator on the on the panel okay GSM rollover those are more options on the communicator programming but it&#x27;s pretty much every time you install a communicator you&#x27;re going to have all different options how you want a program real register or how they&#x27;re going to send the signal to the central station and the alarm name this is where oh did you say internet for our the test depending why you want it this the after everything you&#x27;ve done is going to send a physical ascender program information to learning the communicator that time is going to show you it&#x27;s going to show you a warning that is now register because it&#x27;s now register yeah you say okay and then you go to an unregistered later on this is communication diagnostic set up communications register device you&#x27;re gonna win you&#x27;re gonna raise the device the communicator oh sorry it&#x27;s going to raise it come file it&#x27;s going to show you that on the screen it means that is where is sending the information to the to alarm name so you get away a little bit after you coming back it&#x27;s going to tell your registration successfully when they accepted all the options that you put it it better by the account information in today&#x27;s correct then you go back to the back arrow two times to return to this to the Installer programming screen and then you go again to communication once the communicator has been racially communication diagnostics you go to GSA information the es information and signal stream will be display like the signal s rain it&#x27;s over here you gotta have a minimum three in order to to have a you communication then you select the internet communicator Internet Information is going to show you all the IP address and everything of the of the of the panel then you select down the arrow you go communication status to show the status of the planet so you&#x27;re going to wait a little bit and then everything should be okay everything pass so pretty much then you go test communication to send signal to the monitoring station and then after everything again pass is going to give you the okay and then if you&#x27;re going to test again another communication you select the necessary test options select by arrow icon after testing is complete this different testing so you make sure your communicator is talking to the center station this is a test Ethernet so everything should be okay again then you go back communication ID numbers this is to view information about your your panel this is information the MAC address and everything about your panel if you need it the IMEI of the SIM card and everything you go up just leave yuna configure Wi-Fi view say they don&#x27;t configure Wi-Fi it&#x27;s going to is going to show you the access ask an access point it&#x27;s going to show you the different wireless that you have available you select the one you have you click edit and then you join it it&#x27;s going to ask you for a password and you put it in and then it&#x27;s going to show you that you already play here you really connect to the Wi-Fi this is the local white half in your house or whatever you you have to do panel another user options are like for example you go more here and then you go to same when you go to the to program so in this case you&#x27;re going to put one two three four which is a master code this is going to allow you to for example to add new users so the way you add new users you go users you click on users and the icon if you&#x27;re going to change the master user code it&#x27;s here you click on master you edit it you put a select user code and then here you put a new user code and then after that you press done and it&#x27;s gonna it&#x27;s going to change the user code you save it and then it&#x27;s done here you go back you go back and this is the video setup if you wanna see the videos you click on the video if you&#x27;re going to see your cameras I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re going to go to you&#x27;re going to click on the video on the screen which is a little icon with a little camera use you go to scan in the bottom right you click on the scan is going to show you the available cams you click on the do click on one it&#x27;s going to turn green if you select it again it&#x27;s going to is going to change it to yellow and it&#x27;s going to the edit option is going to appear so you go edit you put the name the camera if you&#x27;re going to put a name then you go back and it&#x27;s going to show you the the camera on the screen in this case this is only one camera because it&#x27;s a 52:10 if you have a l7000 it&#x27;s going to show you up to four cameras you can select up to four cameras at the same time and last part is testing the system there&#x27;s many options to test assistants the first one is walk test they worked is mode allows each protection point to be checked for proper operation it takes a very rare panel battery and send a test reporters into the station if it&#x27;s enable okay we have the go no-go test and is used to verify if we got enough signal strength on each devices we have the Sun discovery which is going to sense the zone data to the Torico name we had the RFS nifflas during the this is what I do it&#x27;s the keeper we display all active Wireless zones is going to fold each term middle causing each one to send signals as a as a system I mean the panel received a signal for each channel middle the so number of that family will display under this will it will disappear from this display so meaning it&#x27;s going to it&#x27;s going to take every single devices and then when it confirms that is sees it it&#x27;s going to it will disappear from the display okay dial test if you&#x27;re going to test the dialer diagnosis when you click on the diagnostic it&#x27;s going to tell you to reboot you&#x27;re going to do a complete power reset of the of the panel it&#x27;s going to ask you you sure you say yes you&#x27;re going to see this little like a dust mode screen window on the panel which is it&#x27;s rebooting the panel and that&#x27;s it this is pretty much about the links panel the the 5210 and the 7000 this is some numbers you&#x27;re going to take a note so number take a picture some numbers of the different support tech support teams that we have if you got any any problems with any panels you can call when e this number if you were lost if you were on those of those countries and this is the if you had any problems you can send an email to that email address that&#x27;s the tech support address homes support Clair as received calm and also if you take a picture the QR graphic in the the screen right now please with your phone if you take a picture it&#x27;s going to open a survey it&#x27;s very important for us to for you to fill out the survey which is going to ask you just a couple points of to three questions and it&#x27;s in English and in Spanish I think he&#x27;s going to show you in English if it doesn&#x27;t show you in English initially in Spanish you can go on top and then you changed the language and is going to show you in English and fill out the fill out the fields I think it&#x27;s four or five questions only it&#x27;s very important for us to see how we doing on this webinar or if you win other topics for example you just put it there which or the topic you wanna you want to hear about and then we got gladly going to do another webinars for you guys without that oh we almost we pass a little bit the time it was one o&#x27;clock just thank you very much for your help I mean for your to be here too for your time [Music] you</p>
