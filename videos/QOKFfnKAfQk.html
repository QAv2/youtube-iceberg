            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[music] Good afternoon, beloved community. I am Melissa Miller, host of The Chosen Heroes, and thank you so much for sharing your Sunday afternoon with me. We have a really, really uh special guest. The one and only Anna Toledo is here to give us a great presentation. So, let&#x27;s kick off um with the Targeted Justice news and review for this week.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Sick and tired of your gangstalking? [music] There are many things you can do that are protected free speech. Number one, find out where [music] the police union meets. It&#x27;s usually once a month. Put these flyers under the windshield wipers. [music] If they are parked in the street or on public property.</p>
<p>Number two, find the fusion center near you. Identify who the director [music] is. Put up yard signs around the fusion center and along public streets that lead to the fusion center. The criminals hate this. For example, if the director&#x27;s name is John Smith, on the yard sign, put [music] John Smith is a gangstalker.</p>
<p>Number three, find out who is on the police advisory council appointed by [music] the mayor. Send them flyers via email or find their home address. You can use sites like fastpeoplearch.com to get you the information [music] that you need. Remember, there are many legal ways you can do to get back at them. However, [music] when traveling to fusion centers and police union meetings, always take someone with you.</p>
<p>Do not go alone. Gecko Pico, a targeted law-abiding citizen, [music] has a way to record his V2K, and he shows you how you can do it, too. We have seen [music] this done before, but by using a loop and better noise filtering, the words becomes more apparent. [music] It&#x27;s a little rough, but he explains the phrases before he plays it in a loop. Dr.</p>
<p>James Lynn has a book that explains the V2K technology, auditory effects of microwave energy, available now on Amazon. The privacy oversight board reviews the watch list. Go to the site in the upper right hand corner with the icon of the magnifying glass and type in watch list. In [music] Germany, it&#x27;s guten which also means good day. Nihow is exactly how hello sounds in Taipei.</p>
<p>In Portugal, it&#x27;s hola. In Arabic, salm. Same travel means [music] hello. In Macedonian, it&#x27;s aloha. In Hawaii, they say in Greece.</p>
<p>In Israel, the word shalom and that means peace. The Italians have [music] the vi. When you&#x27;re at the Eiffel Tower, just smile and say sal hello. Hello. Hello.</p>
<p>Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.</p>
<p>Hello. Though the way to say it [music] varies most everywhere you go. It meaning never changes. Hello. Hello.</p>
<p>HELLO. GOODBYE. &gt;&gt; Calling all digital warriors. [music] Please share, repost, copy and paste this video on all social media platforms. We [music] are still looking for volunteers.</p>

Of course, my major platform is is X. And um I I could I couldn&#x27;t do I do this for each and every one of you because, you know, we we have to band together and and get this program exposed and shut down. Next week&#x27;s guest is going to be Bob Gman and he is going to give us a wonderful presentation um and discussion about Morgllan syndrome.</p>
<p>this I&#x27;ve had multiple uh targeted individuals reach out to me and wanting this subject covered and um graciously Bob has accepted to join us next week and provide that you know necessary discussion. He is it it&#x27;s going to be great. So I I ask that you you tune in and don&#x27;t miss out. So, our very special guest today, beloved community, let&#x27;s all extend a heartfelt welcome back to Anna Toledo, who is a fearless warrior in the battle against government weaponization and injustice. And for those unfamiliar with her story, Anna hells from Puerto Rico where she earned her law degree and built a distinguished career as an environmental attorney specializing in Clean Water Act citizen suit lawsuit.</p>
<p>She tirelessly addressed water pollution crisis and pursued multiple cases challenging government and agency failures. She enforced vital environmental laws. And tragically, her unwavering commitment drew retaliation from corrupt oligarchs and polluters, marking her as a targeted individual. Anna has endured organized stalking, invasive electronic surveillance, surveillance, illegal medical implantations, and assaults via directed energy weapons resulting in severe physical harm, including burns, chronic pain, Havana syndrome symptoms, and even a fabricated cancer diagnosis followed by unnecessary radiotherapy. In the face of these relentless attacks, she made the difficult decision to flee Puerto Rico in September 2022.</p>
<p>Undeterred, she embraced a new calling as lead council for targeted justice where she now also serves on the advisory board. Her primary focus is civil rights and shutting down the criminal unagnowledged special access targeted individual program. Her passionate advocacy, unyielding resolve against corruption, and dedication to human rights have earned her profound respect and admiration within the targeted community. Renowned for her transparency, deep compassion for those in suffering, and refreshingly candid advice, Anna hosts a weekly podcast called The Gavl every Wednesday at 8:00 PM, delivering timely updates on government developments and related issues. And on a personal level, Anna embodies resilience, gratitude, forgiveness, and the transformative power of turning adversity into purpose.</p>
<p>Re recently, she left the supportive circle of friends in Texas to relocate to Washington DC, positioning herself closer to the key government representatives who hold the influence to dismantle these targeting programs. She has already convened meetings and delivered powerful testimonies to select officials shedding light on this modernday form of human enslavement. And today she joins us with and has prepared a presentation about the privacy act. And in addition to that, she will share her latest updates on her groundbreaking work in the nation&#x27;s capital. So without further ado, hello Anna.</p>
<p>Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Hi. &gt;&gt; Thank you Alisa. I I feel so humbled by your introduction. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m so happy to be here because this is an effort. Yeah, I&#x27;m doing a lot, but I depend on the effort that the community does carries out to shut this down. This this is not just a oneman band a woman one woman band that h this has all of you are very important in this battle. So I&#x27;m so happy to be here. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>And it it is I I&#x27;m so I was so thrilled um when I heard you know that you had mentioned to me that you had prepared this you know very very informative uh presentation about the privacy act. So, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and and bring that up on the screen so that everyone can see. All right. And let&#x27;s get to the first slide. So, you want to to go ahead and describe what the Privacy Act of 1974 is all about? &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. Well, before before I go into it, I I want to explain that the reason why this initiative I think this initiative is important because we have number one, Chuck Grassley exposed, declassified and electronic communication that explained the existence of the prohibited access and restricted access files, both of wh which are not within the purview of the officials, public officials that answer FOYA Privacy Act requests. The importance of this lies in the fact that that is where I am absolutely certain your nomination to the TSDB is hidden as well as all the other information regarding that the FBI has called on you has has uh collected on you and the reason why it&#x27;s in the prohibited access is because you&#x27;re not a criminal and they know it and they know they shouldn&#x27;t be uh having your records And that is what you know the privacy act of 1974 specifically said that each agency that maintains a system of records it they can only have information about an individual as it is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the president or and collect collect information to the greatest extent practable directly from the subject individual. What is the information you provide when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual&#x27;s rights, benefits, and privileges? For example, like applying for B SN SNAP benefits or or or Medicaid or whatever. But here&#x27;s the thing.</p>
<p>In the first in the first one you see that they and in the context of the FBI they can only maintain such information about an individual as it is relevant and necessary to accomplish the purpose of the agency. We know that the FBI has that the inspector office of inspector general has specifically stated that there are noninvestigative subjects in the FBI terrorist screening database. that does not meet any mission of the agency. So that is a let&#x27;s go to the next slide that that is you know the the first strike they have in there. They are maintaining records on you that they should not have and here it explains what comprises record.</p>
<p>Of course, this statute was drafted in 1974, so it&#x27;s old. But now record that is why in the foyer request that I I wrote the privacy act request which is different from the foyer because even though they come from the same statute as a privacy act requester that you&#x27;re requesting your information you have a broader right to it because you have constitutional rights that protect you. And so um here like privacy for example. So the term record can also include for example text messages. Yeah with the new technology emails.</p>
<p>But basically it says any item collection or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by the agency including the money they spend on on u gangstalking you including but not limited to education, financial transactions, medical history, criminal or employment history and that contains his name or the identifying number which we know it&#x27;s the terrorist screening center number because the the way they classify you is not through your social security number but an assigned terrorist screening center number. So basically it&#x27;s a record is the universe of anything that can contain your information. Let&#x27;s go to the next one. &gt;&gt; Yes. And um &gt;&gt; we have questions here &gt;&gt; just to uh make a note.</p>
<p>So, you know, of course, Snowden, um, Edward Snowden did bring forward just how not private things are and how easily accept accessible it is. So, anything that has a digital footprint is up for grads with these agencies, you know, it&#x27;s just I and that that&#x27;s just worldwide. at any given moment they can just, you know, for whatever reason if they want to flip that switch on somebody and then they have it all at their at their fingertips and they scan everything. They have instructions that anything and everything that comes into the agency, if it&#x27;s not in electronic form, they have to put it into an electronic form and enter it into their big, you know, Sentinel big huge big huge Sentinel database. Exactly.</p>
<p>And then they have the back door to the social media platforms. We know that with Facebook and such. Um, so I mean they really they really have their tentacles into everything. They can learn every every aspect about us. But those are your records that are filed in that agency.</p>
<p>So if they have let&#x27;s say posts from you from Facebook stored in their system they have to produce them just the same way if they censored a post of you from Twitter they have to produce it. So the system of records means a group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or some identifying number symbol or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. Why is this important? Because the FBI criminals when they answer your foyer requests, they said, &quot;Oh, we search in the central records system.&quot; But that is a very limited subset of their entire sentinel system. And now that we know that there are two hidden categories, that is why we have to emphasize no no. Foya says you have to look all your files, not just the ones you decide to search.</p>
<p>And if they challenge that, like no, no, I&#x27;m only going to look here. Well, guess what? That&#x27;s part of the initiative that we want this to be a nationwide initiative. We have targeted individuals in all the states. This is the way you are going to obtain the receipts on you. This is the most important thing you can do right now to shut down this criminal program.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s Do you have any questions, Valisa? Um, you know, to me, I think we we&#x27;ve gotten to a point in time where each and every one of us is ex, you know, they assess us in terms of a threat score. So, it we know that there&#x27;s many avenues of how one can get activated or or you know, um, or marked as a as a risk or a threat. Of course, whistleblowers, of course, those that stand up in the face of corruption and speak the the truth speakers, you know, not the ones that are just going along, you know, from the day to day in the herd. Um, and not, you know, u searching or reaching out for anything more than what they did the day before. And I&#x27;m not trying to disinish those, but there&#x27;s a lot of enttrainment uh through, you know, of course, social media, through media outlets, news and such that kind of keep people in that stuck, you know, glazed over zone.</p>
<p>And then there are those that are, you know, they the morality of the individuals and and their their courage to speak out against the, you know, the herd. And I think that is where we are especially getting into this time where we&#x27;re going to be graded in some aspect on risk and okay this person just goes with the flow or this is one that is going to to be vocal or speak out um in truth. Do you feel that we&#x27;re headed in into this or we&#x27;re here right now in these scoring systems like with this sentinel you know data collection data data centers that they have on us they they can screen risk I think that if we know we are targeted we are in a special category which is you know it doesn&#x27;t get worse in terms of the targeting okay like the people that don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re targeted the people that don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re on any list and this is something I&#x27;ve been exploring with the amazing work that uh Dr. bear has done for me because you know they have all these they&#x27;re creating now these different lists that we don&#x27;t even know what they are obviously um but I I I think you know I I I think that I don&#x27;t know if this is what you&#x27;re asking but we cannot we cannot be in more list than we are already are if if that makes sense to you. &gt;&gt; Well we&#x27;re like at we&#x27;re on that list.</p>
<p>[laughter] it doesn&#x27;t you know that that&#x27;s rock bottom you know and that&#x27;s why it is up to us to rise from that and and uh you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s one of the things that uh I was really very proud when I talked to this one person that we&#x27;re going to be meeting with I said to him you know they&#x27;re going to call you and tell you I&#x27;m a criminal and a terrorist or crazy &gt;&gt; yeah and in the days of this you know perfected crafted SCP to make us all seem, you know, discredited, emotionally, mentally unstable and and all of this stuff. It It is crumbling. is just &gt;&gt; absolutely absolutely because when and that and that&#x27;s and that&#x27;s how why this show is so important and that is why the voices from our community you know and I really urge people I know that some of you feel this urge to be recording the car there or the drone there but that doesn&#x27;t that doesn&#x27;t do good to the community because you have to put yourself in the position of a normie that doesn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re showing ing them. So it, you know, it is up to us to maintain that seriousness about what we put out there in order to not be classified as delusional or, you know, you know, the the the narrative. That&#x27;s why Dominic&#x27;s Dominic&#x27;s documentary is so groundbreaking because it explained the program not the entire program but great part of the program in such intelligent and dispassionate you know yeah there was emotion but but it was you know nobody can say anybody speaking on that documentary is crazy or delusional I don&#x27;t know if you agree with me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I agree 100%. Um, that was a very great representation of our community and that we are, you know, speaking the truth about these things happening to us. And the way that he delivered it, it was very digestible. I think for those unaware, it did not, you know, you know, lead or even hint at any kind of psychosis or instability the way that that was presented. He really um he did such great service for this community by putting such a well um you know informational documentary together for us.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what I you know I urge people to just look at it and see how people express themselves there &gt;&gt; and and just keep that line because again some normies there&#x27;s there&#x27;s there&#x27;s you know that famous line from um Jack Nicholson you can&#x27;t handle the truth some some normies cannot handle the truth that as you know &gt;&gt; the I think they&#x27;re conditioned to that too because if they&#x27;re plugged in to what the media and mainstream is feeding them, that perpetuates their own, you know, bubble of not understanding what is truly outside of the box in terms of what&#x27;s really going on because they are fed, you know, what the media wants to to feed them and to keep them stuck energetically and to buy into, you know, oh, that must be a delusion or instability. But if you if they would zoom out and just see the bigger picture of what this this whole year has represented and that we have been fed mistruth since birth. You know we we we were conditioned into not you know question authority and to you know everything that is presented to us by the government is for our best interest. So that that that illusion should be shattered at this point. But there are still some that would rather stay stuck than to come to terms because psychologically it is a very overwhelming you know to know that there has been such deception uh all this time.</p>
<p>But for us, it was easier for us to see all of these things unfolding because we already know what is possible and the cover up and you know the you know the sigh up on us uh to keep us you know for people from hearing what we have to say in truth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, back to system of records. Uh, it it FBI, which is under DOJ, includes FBI guardian, eguardian, central record system, which is the little place where they were only doing the searches. NCIC, which is what they send to over 18,000 law enforcement, over 1,200 organizations, over 800 corporations, which is the one where we are tagged as suspected terrorist.</p>
<p>um the Sentinel which includes the prohibited access and the restricted access files. So FBI cannot say uh no I&#x27;m just going to look here. No, they have to look into the universe and I have a right as an American citizen or resident. I&#x27;m going to go later into the people that are non citizens that can have a right to to this under this law. So stay tuned.</p>
<p>But you know as an American citizen I have a right to see everything. There&#x27;s very short few exceptions. We&#x27;re going to discuss them now. Everything that is in their files. So if we can go to the next uh slide.</p>
<p>Okay. It&#x27;s what records can they keep there? Maintain records about we had discussed this as as its relevance. So let&#x27;s go to the next one. Okay, this is very interesting. But can you go into the one the what records they cannot keep? It&#x27;s the six slide.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, the the previous one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What records they cannot keep. Okay, there. &gt;&gt; So, this is very very important because of course they&#x27;re going to have them, but they&#x27;re not going to show them.</p>
<p>But and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to have to move into phase three because I&#x27;ll tell you about phase two later. But it says the statute says that the agency cannot maintain records describing how the individual exercises their first amendment rights. So, we know that in December of 2021, there was a memorandum that Tulsa declassified saying that anybody that opposed COVID mandates was to be classified as a violent domestic extremist. I don&#x27;t know if you remember that. And so, the same with the J6ers.</p>
<p>Every J6er should do a privacy act request. If you know a J6er, you know, tag them, send them this this video because they need to do it. It is beyond their Brady um their Brady uh documents. As you know, the Brady documents are the ones that when you are in a criminal case that you have been accused, you have a right to get what it&#x27;s called the Brady documents, which is exculpatory evidence. Well, now that it has come out publicly that the J6ers were entrapped and moreover then the the it is very likely that the pipe bomber was a setup so they could add the terrorism charge to all these J6ers.</p>
<p>Well, this didn&#x27;t come out of the blue. For months prior to J6, these people were being spied upon so they could be entrapped. They were spied upon by the FBI. And those files are hidden. They are hidden in their systems.</p>
<p>And they have an obligation to give them to them. And that is what Ed Martin said that when Chuck Grassley, Senator Grassley declassified the electronic communication about the prohibited and restricted access files, Ed Martin immediately said, &quot;This is a huge problem with the Brady violations.&quot; Now, is that the reason why Ed Martin only has one employee under him? because they don&#x27;t want him doing the job that he&#x27;s supposed to do, deweaponizing the government. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m just throwing it out there. But you see that that&#x27;s what they cannot, you know, a lot of targeted individuals have been illegally placed on the FBI records and lists for exerting their first amendment right.</p>
<p>So, and that&#x27;s in complete and direct contravention of the privacy act. So let&#x27;s go to the next one. There&#x27;s penalties. There&#x27;s penalties for employees. H they can there&#x27;s even criminal penalties for people for example that disclose your information which is what we have been saying that they disclose your information without your authorization to third parties.</p>
<p>Like for example, the infra guard and citizen corp minions that go around spying on you and the vandalizing and killing your pets and vandalizing your property and sneaking into your property. So this is a provision that when the time comes for exposure, we want those FBI criminals fired and convicted for sharing our information illegally. Let&#x27;s go to the next one. Okay. So, here&#x27;s the here&#x27;s the right that the privacy act this is not the FOYA.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the privacy act which is the cousin of the FOYA, right? &gt;&gt; And it is it&#x27;s the or the sister actually pretty much like the sister. It gives you the right to access to your records. Agency that maintains it&#x27;s upon the request of any individual to gain access to his or her records or to any information pertaining to him or her which is contained in the system. No exceptions. It doesn&#x27;t say in there uh the system that the agency decides to look in.</p>
<p>No, it&#x27;s all the records within the agency system, which is exactly that is why Michael Sidell, the the guy that was the head of the foyer office for the FBI, he signed many of our denials. we cannot confirm or deny because he was hiding your records and my records in within the agency because since we&#x27;re not criminals, the FBI is not supposed to have anything on us. Absolutely nothing. So, uh that&#x27;s what it gives you the right and then it gives you a right to go personally. And this is what I&#x27;m going to want ask you all when you do your privacy act request.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re going to say either you send me all this in a c in a CD ROM or else I want to go personally and inspect my records. And it gives you even the opportunity the right to go with someone and it doesn&#x27;t have to be an attorney. Notice what it says. It says permit and upon request a person of his own choosing to accompany him or her. So you can go with a witness and to review the record and have a copy made of any or portion thereof.</p>
<p>So you can ask for your records to be brought to your local FBI agency for you to examine them. &gt;&gt; Now that&#x27;s very good to know what and what do you think? I know that many uh TIS have stated that they have did foyer request and and and things have been turned up you know uh blank or denied of their request. What do you think is like contributing to the failure? Is it the wording being used or is it just the resistance you know from the agency to to give that information? &gt;&gt; Both. That&#x27;s why uh that is why I&#x27;m going to put this presentation in the targeted justice website and probably in the targeted justice newsletter for reference for everybody. So you need to put the specific language.</p>
<p>This is a privacy act request for the for me and and these are my names and my also known as my alliases and these are my addresses and this is my email. So, you cannot say that I didn&#x27;t because this this is one of the things they say. Oh, you didn&#x27;t uh you didn&#x27;t provide enough evidence to be able to locate records from you. So, you&#x27;re going to put in there. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what they told.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, you have to put, you know, your your maiden name or your mar and your married name and your, you know, I have, for example, I&#x27;m Anna Toledo, but I also put my mom&#x27;s last name, Anna Toledo Davila, or Anna Louisa, you know, my middle name. You have to put all your all the possible combinations so they don&#x27;t come back and say what they said to you. Oh, we couldn&#x27;t locate anything. Okay.</p>
<p>And then the second part is you have to look this the the statute says you have to look in your system of records, not in just one part of your records. And this includes egardian guardian prohibited access files. And remember one thing, if you have filed any sort of complaint with the FBI or if you have had a phone call denouncing directed energy weapons or whatever, that is one record they have to produce to you and I know they have not produced it to hundreds of you because for example I have but the good thing is I found when I went to Puerto Rico now I found a document that I took there and it was signed by one of the criminals. So I have that evidence when I go to court to say they didn&#x27;t even produce this which I gave to them and of course I&#x27;m not going to say what the document is. So let&#x27;s go to Okay.</p>
<p>So the other thing that you have uh yes let&#x27;s go. &gt;&gt; You ready for me to &gt;&gt; No, it was in Puerto Rico. It was in Puerto Rico. So let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s go.</p>
<p>Another another thing another right it gives you the privacy is within 10 days you can send them a letter saying you need to correct this record of mine because this is wrong for example if they come you know if they are forthcoming which I don&#x27;t have much hope but let&#x27;s say they do without having to go to court well and they give you your nomination form as a c as a terrorist guess what you have to write to them and say you have to correct this because this is not accurate and they have 10 days to correct it. Okay, so this you know it&#x27;s a powerful tool that the only reason why this is the moment to exert these rights is because Senator Grassly exposed that they had hidden files and that&#x27;s illegal. They cannot do that. Okay, because the FOYA people have to be able to search the entire system, the entire Sentinel. And so if you have problems with security clearances, put in there people that have a security clearances to look at the whole thing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Did you want me to play the video of Cash Patel that? &gt;&gt; Yes, please do. Please do. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me go ahead and bring that up.</p>
<p>and we&#x27;re going to continue to expose it and you&#x27;re going to see everything we found in that room in one way or another, be it through investigation, public trial, or disclosure to the Congress. &gt;&gt; See, that little clip is his talking about the burn bags, the documents that were found, you know, the seven bags that were supposedly going to be burnt documents and that a a it seems a white hat put them somewhere so they won&#x27;t be destroyed. Well, if they are going to make these documents public, they cannot deny which are third party documents, they cannot deny us access to our documents. and and um and Cash Patel also said publicly and I and I uh played it in one of my gallos, I kicked down the prohibited access door file door. So we have now receipts to hold him accountable because he says accountability is coming and he knows about this because he has written about it in his book government gangsters.</p>
<p>how the first thing that the government had to do in order to shut down the deep state was empanel a new church committee. And let me tell you, the church committee never really died because there is a Senate Select Intelligence Committee directed by Tom Cotto on whose door I have knocked already three times. And those of you in Arkansas, please write to him. And he refuses. He has not granted me a a a meeting yet.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s the thing, his committee has an obligation to have shut down this program years ago. And they are looking the other way. And they have one CIA asset in that committee who is croning, who is the senator from Texas that when I went to his office with Sally Pester, they literally kicked us out of there. So, he shouldn&#x27;t be in the Senate Select Committee, Intelligence Committee, because he&#x27;s covering up for the CIA. And I certainly hope that that Ken Paxton wins his seat in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>So, so now you know about that, you know, once they give it to you because they&#x27;re going to have to give it to us, whether it be extrajudicially or after a judicial procedure. Well, then you have a right to have the record corrected. Let&#x27;s go to the next one. The exceptions. &gt;&gt; So, the exceptions, it says the exception, the the agency doesn&#x27;t have to give you the documents if they are compiled for the purpose of identifying criminal offenders.</p>
<p>We already know we are non-investigative subjects. And alleged offenders consisting only of identifying data and notations of arrest. the nature and disposition of criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, or information compiled for the purpose of criminal investigation. Again, we&#x27;re no they&#x27;ve been waiting to get lucky to get any criminal information on us and and they just wait and wait and nothing happens. And that that that is what is you know it really does you know confirm that that&#x27;s why they want us to act out in a way that is either harmful to ourel or someone else so that they can get that conviction or that charge on us and to to sequester the information from coming forward.</p>
<p>Absolutely. And that is why I tell tis bite your tongue hold your breath take a breath because they want while they are creating a situation for you like a difficult situation it&#x27;s a setup they are microwaving you they&#x27;re microwaving you aggressivity for you to act I&#x27;m going to tell you something when I was in Puerto Rico all of a sudden I would bump into these criminals. They&#x27;re like, you know, very wealthy criminals, oligarchs. And what they wanted me because they knew what I thought of these people, right? Just all of a sudden in the corner of my house, I would see like I remember this one instance. And what they wanted was for me to say, you know, you&#x27;re this and this and that.</p>
<p>So that that person would file some charges against me and then they would set me up. Mhm. &gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t know I was targeted, but for the grace of God, I kept my mouth shut because I have a law license to protect. And that is what made me be very proper about what I put out there. See, in in terms of private people, because I have no problem calling the CIA criminals criminals and the FBI criminals because they are public officials and they have to prove me wrong.</p>
<p>So when when they set you up in a situation where you are very angry or very frustrated, you have to invoke the Holy Spirit and you have to take a breath because while they are putting you in that situation, they are microwaving you to make you act out criminal in in some way that they can accuse you of something. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; Okay. How It happens a lot. I I know it.</p>
<p>But and I know that for those that are, you know, newer and just trying to understand, you know, what it is, what all this incompensing experience as a targeted individual is. The best word of advice is to never act out in any way that is unfavorable to you or against anyone because as Anna has uh stated, they can entrap you by getting a charge or a conviction on you and then they will deny information being released as a reason because of that. And you know that doesn&#x27;t mean that if you have had a violation or a charge that you don&#x27;t give up. you continue to to do the fight and expose and to bring awareness of what is going on. I mean we are under heavy attack the most sophisticated directed energy um you know central nervous system override you know trying to hijack uh our our thoughts and of course our privacy and stuff you know we&#x27;re it we we&#x27;re under constant bombardment.</p>
<p>So just uh just food for thought. Just be be careful, very careful going forward. &gt;&gt; Yes. And and I&#x27;m going to tell you I I I didn&#x27;t make that up. The lighthouse taught me that there there are studies that policemen when they are in these like you know that they have these uh in the street encounters with riots and stuff that they have microwaved the policemen to make them more aggressive.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t make that up. Okay. So uh and but that like I said that doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re going to stop exposing the criminals. It&#x27;s just that you are not going to do a personal attack that the person can say oh I felt stopped intimidated. I felt that person was going to attack me.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what you need to avoid because it&#x27;s a strap and a setup. Okay. So let&#x27;s go to the next one. Remedies for non-compliance. Well, if you are an American citizen or resident, you that the agency um fails to produce the access that you&#x27;re requesting.</p>
<p>Remember, you&#x27;re ask you&#x27;re asking either for digital say exact copies of your documents, anything on you, including the communications that were generated in order to reply to your privacy act request and also so you can file it in your district or in Washington DC, right? And it&#x27;s injunctive relief for access and correction of records. And you can also the ones here in America can act ask for damages resulting from the nonp production or non-compliance with the statute. Okay. Now, erh, so those are additional remedies aside from the criminal penalties that people that violate, officials, public officials that violate the act can incur in. Okay.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s go to where to file the law. So, let&#x27;s go to slide 14 that says, is it just for for Americans? And this are the good news. Okay, it&#x27;s not good for news for everybody, but as a result of the Judicial Redress Act of 2015, everyone in the European Union has a right to file a privacy act request with the agencies that are listed in the judicial redress. No, not the agencies. The agencies that the attorney general h included to be susceptible under this act to you know to produce information.</p>
<p>Fortunately, DOJ under which FBI is and DHS are two of those agencies. So this judicial redress act extends the right to pursue certain certain civil remedies under the privacy act. the European Union as a regional economic integration organization covers from all 27 member states. So if you&#x27;re in Germany, in Spain, in France, you have a right to demand to see your records from DOJ which includes the FBI, includes the United Kingdom even though they are not part of the EU. Now here is one one one of the things that um it&#x27;s not going to be included and it&#x27;s not for them or not for us it&#x27;s all the files for example we know that infra guard does most of the hacking of our electronic communication social media etc.</p>
<p>So the reason that the FBI created infra is to have them to be exempt from FOIA. But you know I wouldn&#x27;t worry about that right now because eventually we can get to the point where a court can order them through a subpoena to produce the records on you. So we&#x27;re not like my mom used to say let&#x27;s not cross that bridge until we get to that river. So the people in Europe have the right to file injunctive relief and for the correction of record. So if you&#x27;re not a terrorist and you were illegally, you know, you have a right to demand the correction of that record.</p>
<p>Now the only the limitation is that it has those cases have to be filed in the District of Columbia not in your hometown like any other person throughout the United States. Okay. Uh the remedies for the Europeans. Let&#x27;s continue. See only covered records which is personal data transferred from a covered country to a US agency for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>The remedies is injunction and access to amendments. Okay. and also to the unlawful willful disclosures which is what is FBI doing sending my information to the CIA and the space force? Why are they doing that? &gt;&gt; Okay, next one is um it&#x27;s limited to the designated federal agencies which have been numbered. I can I can just read you some of them some of these agencies uh that have been uh approved but for example department of justice office of the associate attorney general bureau of alcohol tobacco antirust division board of immigration appeals so a bureau of prisons but I think that the two that are most important for the the victims of government weaponization are both DOJ which comprises FBI and DHS which both are included in these designated federal agencies. Let&#x27;s go for the next one.</p>
<p>the caveats it doesn&#x27;t for the European people they they don&#x27;t have the right to a injunctive relief or to try to put people in jail but that doesn&#x27;t really matter what matters is getting access to the documents in my opinion because these damages and even if you&#x27;re going to file under under the privacy act a lawsuit the damages you can prove are are nothing compared to the damages you will approve after you obtain the information. So I you know I wouldn&#x27;t I would just ask for nominal damages and then extortion of remedies but this this is important both and I&#x27;ll explain in the next slide for the people it for the people in Europe it is a requirement prior to filing a lawsuit you have to within the period that they give you which I think the FBI now gives 90 days you have to file an appeal for this I am going to be publishing both the targeted justice newsletter and targeted justice website a format of the appeal so you don&#x27;t feel lost in space so you know you know how to adapt your situation to the appeal that you want to write okay and again as I said the venue for the people in Europe unfortun is is the district court for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia unfortunately my beloved people in Australia my beloved people in Mexico and Argentina they have not being included in this act yet. So you do not have the right yet to be included. Now the Supreme Court has said that United States citizens don&#x27;t have to exhaust administrative remedies in order to go to a court of law and demand compliance. However, that kind of fight, it doesn&#x27;t cost you anything to file the appeal.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s free and I&#x27;ll provide you with the information. And the reason why we want to do it is because we want to eliminate that argument and give a court an excuse to dismiss by filing your appeal and then getting their denial. You say, &quot;Look, I gave them an opportunity to correct their mistake and they insisted on committing their mistake.&quot; So uh and also most United States courts in the context of foil not privacy act have ruled that you have to exhaust your administrative remedies. Remember what we want is to exclude giving them excuses to not comply. So, um, the language to include this, I&#x27;m going to put in in the, you know, if you go to targetedjustice.com/activism, that&#x27;s where the format I&#x27;m going to update the format there to include that in the alternative.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t want to produce me the digital copy of this like right away. I want to examine every record that contains my name and my identification. er you know whatever you use to identify me. So um you look for that in the targeted justice website. Rule of thumb we need to file the appeal and I&#x27;m going to be posting it in targeted justice in my media and in my and in targeted justice website.</p>
<p>Now what&#x27;s what you say? Well they&#x27;re going to deny me. Okay, we are in a very different moment from 2022, 2023, and 2024. Right now, we have an administration that even if even if they&#x27;re not fully practicing it, okay, that they are saying we are transparent and we the prohibited access and the restricted access files are no longer. And we have Ed Martin saying that that was a violation of Brady to every TI that is in prison because he was not granted his Brady files that stated all the setup and entrapment that the FBI criminals perpetrated upon him or her. &gt;&gt; Well, this is the moment.</p>
<p>Okay. So, uh this requires organization. You have to be meticulous about your records, about what you send them. I prefer to send them by mail, priority mail, to have a little file, scan everything, document everything, be very organized because I want this to be a nationwide and Europewide effort. &gt;&gt; We can shut down this program through this effort.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s each one of you. What have you done today to shut down your pro this program? This is one very important thing that you need to do for yourself and to shut down the program. So, um I don&#x27;t know if you have any questions, Melissa. Sorry, I went on with the information. &gt;&gt; No, no, this is this is very informative.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s very inspiring. You know, I I had a denial from my information. I I thought I had listed all my name variations. I I am was previously married. So um but maybe I missed one or maybe just something else was not um you know as it should be.</p>
<p>I had resistance on on that first attempt, but it&#x27;s not going to deter me. I&#x27;m going to try again. This is, you know, definitely confirmation of the necessity to go ahead and request that information again uh to see what I can, you know, find. you know, I I have a strong, you know, probable reason why and how I got, you know, on this blacklist, you know, working for a private u multi-millionaire with, you know, connections to HBD Foundation board and um you know, politicians throughout all of Texas. You know, no, no law firm would touch anything with him because they knew they would lose.</p>
<p>and the most prominent one in Houston told me that directly. Nobody can go up against that man and win because of his unlimited resources and um you know um farreaching connections. But that shouldn&#x27;t deter anybody. It didn&#x27;t deter me to continue to seek out and find and and want to to uh gain information on how all this happened to me and have it, you know, in front of me to look at. So this is very in empowering and inspiring and I hope others you know tuning in today do as well because we will be showing an example of the the writing for that request and we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll review that when um do we want to go through a couple more of the remaining slides here or do we &gt;&gt; I think I I covered them.</p>
<p>I what I did want to say is that courts have recognized the class action mechanism in the context of privacy act. So, you know, I I cannot emphasize enough how even if you were denied and I know that recently some people have already been denied like Marana, like Amelio, they have already been denied their um their privacy act request and I&#x27;m working to draft since I have a benefit of having their denials to draft the sample um appeal and I will provide it to them, but I will also post one without names obviously &gt;&gt; so that people can copy it because um you know we have to pressure we have to hurt these people into transparency and you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a matter of time. is this this won&#x27;t you know they can they can only hide it for so long you know now with the disclosures on the prohibited access what I did wanted you to uh show if you could is the other two uh the other two for privacy act request that I sent was a number one on DESAC dsac.gov golf. That is the agency that is comprised of 800 corporations, the ones that have over two billion dollars in revenue that they come into your house and spy on you. If they&#x27;re like, for example, the people that put the alarm or the people that put the AC, well, if they are among the 800 companies, they are sending the FBI a little report on you.</p>
<p>And then also DHS, DHSTSA, uh if you have the addresses there, the email addresses. Why? Because they publicly put out the records on how they spied on Tulsi every time they she flyed around. So if they put out the records that they had on Tulsi, why not yours? &gt;&gt; So you should have Yeah. Uhhuh. Exactly.</p>
<p>So for these email addresses, what uh what uh information should the uh community send to these? Can can you explain these &gt;&gt; in the this act? Just say this is a privacy act request. I want any and all records that you have on me. And these are my identity and this is my identifying information. And um and for DHS, you want all the listed a list of all the flights that they followed you around if you flew, all the reports that were rendered, all the pictures, photographs that were taken of you, everything that is on your file as a result of the surveillance perpetrated under the quiet skies. That&#x27;s very good information.</p>
<p>And then we also have up here um an example um of the Privacy Act uh re request. And it may be a little small this to read, but Anna, you said that this this this template uh is going to be uh along with the presentation that you put together on the privacy act today on targeted justice. Will it be in your uh Mera uh Substack newsletter? &gt;&gt; I I&#x27;ll put it everywhere. I&#x27;ll put it everywhere. and and and targetedjustice.com as a person permanent record and and I&#x27;ll and I&#x27;ll have it u posted in targeted justice and substack.</p>
<p>Please notice the foyer address for DHS which of course they haven&#x27;t answered but it&#x27;s foyer at tsa.dhs.gov. So you want to keep that evidence. You want to print out that email. You don&#x27;t want it being erased &gt;&gt; and you want to keep very organized files and then picture or scan of them and it&#x27;s put them away somewhere else because you you know we are all subject to breakings and we don&#x27;t want documents disappearing. We&#x27;re going to make this happen.</p>
<p>Melissa, you know I am I am here um this week. I I I really want you to hold us in prayer. I have asked the people that have been diagnosed with Havana syndrome, even if you do not want to form part of Dr. Lenbear&#x27;s civilian registry, which is the most amazing tool we have to document that Havana syndrome is not just happening to federal employees. If you want to make if you want to shut down this program, one of the ways is proving to these people in Congress that it&#x27;s not just federal employees.</p>
<p>You can send me the sworn statement. You can contact me at PJProton.me. If you only if you have a diagnosis, please don&#x27;t say, &quot;Yeah, I got an MRI and because I saw my brain like that, whatever, I know I have a syndrome.&quot; No, it&#x27;s a diagnosis from a medical doctor. I know I have Havana syndrome. I have six guys.</p>
<p>I have MRIs, but I don&#x27;t have a diagnosis. So, no, I cannot do the sworn statement. You know why? Because it would be perjury. So, you don&#x27;t want to commit perjury. It&#x27;s a statement under penalty of perjury that I promise absolute confidentiality and I would only show it to the people that were meeting with to prove that it&#x27;s not just happening to federal employees.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And what Dr. Burr has has stated before, you know, since most medical doctors, they may not really be up to terms with diagnosis of Havana syndrome, but one way to to get what you need is the proven the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury &gt;&gt; and the uh vestibular dysfunction. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. That is sufficient.</p>
<p>But so I I have not I have not received I know there&#x27;s a lot of TI that have been diagnosed and the only ones whose affidavits I&#x27;ve received are the ones that are in the civilian registry. And that speaks volumes of how, you know, we&#x27;re all in on this. I&#x27;m here fighting for all of you. Even those of you that slander, targeted justice, or me, I&#x27;m fighting for everybody because I want to be as free as each and every one of you. So, I really hope that those of you and running out of time because this is this week.</p>
<p>So if uh those of you that want to send it to me with a confidentiality, I really look forward to that because the more evidence we can bring to this person that these are not random civilians, that this is happening in America, the more chances we have of having an investigation started on this. &gt;&gt; And just some pointers from just a previous, you know, um conversation with Dr. Lyn Burr earlier this year on the chosen heroes when you go in to try to obtain the diagnosis that you know the traumatic brain injury the vestibular damage these are the key components of the um Havana syndrome symptoms. So you have to focus in when you&#x27;re having a dialogue with these medical doctors. You can&#x27;t go running in there.</p>
<p>Um it&#x27;s not advisable to say that oh I&#x27;m a targeted individual and I am having you know um you know directed energy and audio uh you know transmissions to my head and what you need to focus in is on the general symptoms which is you know the dis dizziness the loss of balance um feeling pressure in your head and burning Um and then um you know brain fog, cognitive decline. These are the type of words that they understand and let them you don&#x27;t tell them what you need. You let them you guide them with your symptoms to get the the the testing that they need to do to perform this on you to get you that that diagnosis that you need. And again, um, this was an earlier episode with Dr. uh, Lynn Burr on the chosen heroes.</p>
<p>And then, of course, he&#x27;s also documented, you know, how how to how to talk, you know, with with your doctor about the symptoms that you&#x27;re having without mentioning the targeted individual and stuff because that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where they they they shut off on you. Um but he has also created a guide that is um for physicians and educating them about this as well that you can download and that was also part of that episode and I believe I put that link out on um the chosen heroes X. So look for the that information. you know, arm yourself with the best, you know, uh, information you can when you&#x27;re engaging with a medical doctor because again, most of them, they are not going to even if they&#x27;re aware I, you know, some may be about targeted individuals. So, we just need to focus in on the symptoms that you&#x27;re having that suggest the the Havana syndrome.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s that&#x27;s so very true. I want to add to that. Number one, the diagnosis criteria that he created is in the targeted justice website in Dr. Bear&#x27;s tab. Number two, in Rumble channel, we have the spaces that we did with him and he even did like a mock uh interview from a doctor and a patient and he explained how to do it.</p>
<p>So I urge you uh I have to thank Ortain because he created an spaces channel in our Rumble channel and also another reason why we need these affidavits is because of this. We are trying to get NIH to rec to issue guidance for physicians around the nation to recognize the incidence of Havana syndrome in civilians. So that&#x27;s, you know, that&#x27;s one of the things that we&#x27;re working on, one of the initiatives, and we need to convince them that it&#x27;s real, that it&#x27;s happening to nonfederal employees. So, you know, just do it for yourself, do it for this entire community, that we want all to be free. &gt;&gt; And who where should they send um their sworn affidavits to T Justice to at Proton or to you? Anna Anna TJ Anna TJ at proton.me with a subject line confidential affidavit anatroton.me but again if you have not been diagnosed because I in the in the in the sworn statement that I shared the link uh I in my mira I say you know I was diagnosed by this person on this date in this place city and state.</p>
<p>Okay. So you have to put in there the information of the physician diagnosing you. &gt;&gt; Yes. And that that&#x27;s very very critical to you know the validity of you know if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re taking this information and presenting it to um these government agencies and and representatives that can make a difference. They have to see the volume and the receipts essentially that you were uh diagnosed by a medical doctor um with with the symptoms and the condition that um the Havana syndrome you know brought upon you the deterioration um and and and all of that.</p>
<p>So um &gt;&gt; I just want to add to people not to be afraid because I can understand that not not everybody is like me. You know I&#x27;m not afraid of these criminals but uh they are very afraid of this community because there is nothing harder for them to defeat than an empowered community. And if we come together in this effort uh there&#x27;s they they can&#x27;t defeat us truth you know when we are shining light upon darkness there is no stopping us so I I want to I I don&#x27;t know how to communicate do not be afraid of them they are afraid of us. &gt;&gt; Yes we had one person in the chat saying that your audio is kind of chopping up a little bit. Um um it&#x27;s well it&#x27;s part for course.</p>
<p>We know with live broadcasting and and the uh the right &gt;&gt; of course of course we know [laughter] what&#x27;s of course we know what&#x27;s going on. You know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh it would surprise me if it wasn&#x27;t cutting off. But I took out the electric cable. Is that any better? Ask them. Um, can can someone hear Anna better now that she, you know, made an adjustment? You I can see you more clearly because it was a little blurry on my end.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I think they use this. Let me let me turn off Let me turn off my silent night with without Give me just give me a second. Hold on. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>And again, I want to mention, I glad that Anna brought it up, the the conversation example that you have with your doctor and discussing your symptoms and how to engage and interact with them. Definitely take advantage of that. It it will give you good guidance on having that conversation with a physician. And uh it it&#x27;s it really is a great, you know, example and it will it&#x27;ll arm you with what&#x27;s best for you to guide them but not tell them because the doctors don&#x27;t like to be told what they need to to do in terms of testing and stuff. But everything that you&#x27;re stating will give them the information that will direct them to the correct testing for you.</p>
<p>The the important thing is prepare yourself with knowledge. Practice even practice in front of the mirror. You know, I practice in front of I to this day I practice in front of the mirror when I&#x27;m going to have a meeting or something and be very calm and be just like you say, you know, go to the point. Don&#x27;t tell them what they have to diagnose cuz that, you know, it&#x27;s like me. I hate it when somebody tells me what I need, what I have to do.</p>
<p>I just makes me so angry. [laughter] It&#x27;s like don&#x27;t you tell me what I have to. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s like I inherit. [laughter] &gt;&gt; But you know, I&#x27;m grateful to be here. I&#x27;m really grateful to be here and to be and to have this amazing opportunity to to shed light upon upon the darkness that has taken away from so much so much from us.</p>
<p>So, so Anna, um, do you what do you see as the most promising for helping the targeted individuals achieve justice in the removal from the watch list like the terrorist screening database? Would that be, you know, the the proof of having the receipts from the privacy act um request, the FOYA request, uh that these, you know, people that have committed no crimes are are being surveiled and monitored and tracked. I mean, what is it going to take for them to open up for, you know, how how we are being attacked and and stalked in and all of this? What do you think it&#x27;s going to be? I know you&#x27;re kind of up in DC. You&#x27;re pe you&#x27;ve got people&#x27;s attention. You&#x27;ve even had people in representatives and offices there in DC say that they are aware that they know they need to do something about it. I think that um we cannot back down.</p>
<p>We have to explore like right now something&#x27;s got to give. We&#x27;re exploring, you know, I&#x27;m here and and I&#x27;m concentrating in in Congress and Senate and the the deep state has has people that are walls there to prevent me from accessing them. But it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not, you know, it&#x27;s not going to stop me from doing it because I know I&#x27;m going to do it. And then we&#x27;re going through the NIH Avenue too because they are violating their legal obligation to address this silent epidemic that is happening in our nation because of the pressure of the intelligence community. On the other hand, we have Tulsi Gard that she&#x27;s supposed to investigating the abuses of the intelligence community and I don&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s allowing the carnage to continue because all of these mass murders are the result as we know of the CIA clandestine operations.</p>
<p>Like Steven Miller said, they are a clandestine and agency that is illegally operating within our nation. they&#x27;re supposed to operate only outside of the United States, not here. And so, so that&#x27;s another front that we&#x27;re having. But when it comes to what you what people can do, not only do we need them to be a fervent digital warriors, but most importantly to erh maintain the pressure with these request very well written, very well documented privacy app request. And I am going to pro be providing you with the tools for that.</p>
<p>Now that I discovered that through this statute that people from Europe can also demand to see their records. Well, uh we have you know we just need to build the pressure and I know it&#x27;s going to end up on a judicial forum and and I still have not decided I think that you know strategically h how to do it. There there&#x27;s two options that we&#x27;re contemplating how to do it, but I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not going to go into it now because that&#x27;s, you know, I&#x27;m not going to tell the criminals what I&#x27;m going to do, what we&#x27;re going to do, &gt;&gt; but I need you to be prepared. I need you to gather your information and uh and get it going. You know, just get it going and get your appeals going once if they dare deny it as they have already done to two persons.</p>
<p>You know, get it going because a the this you know the program is no longer covert. I really urged everybody and and this is something Melissa that I have tried to inspire people into helping me create a conference with pastors and ministers. they could all meet in one place and then they can show not only Dominic&#x27;s um documentary but also we could have an hour and a half two hour Zoom call with me and with Dr. there or with Richard explaining the weapons and most importantly because ministers and pastors and and priests they are there to save souls and to save lives and to provide comfort and this the the way I see that you know you can help me organize this is by telling them you know your mission is to rescue souls and to give support to people and this can only provide you with some tools so that when you encounter your parishioners, your your church members that are going through the situation, you can understand what they&#x27;re going through and come up with a way to support them. And that is why, you know, I am only one person.</p>
<p>I wish I could be everywhere and I could do everything. But if some you know if if a group of volunteers if you are interested in you know there are so many digital resources to know who are the pastors where how many churches what churches to do this amazing conference and we can do it you know in different time zones also but for them to keep provide them with the tools so they can serve God better and their community. &gt;&gt; Uh, absolutely. And and just something that each a each each person can do today is to, you know, share the Cognitive Liberty mind control video in in public a public forum or, you know, in in a in a uh a chat or a discussion that, you know, um that has a lot of high visibility and traffic and just and drop it there because you just never know how many people you can reach with this information and the way that it is presented is so digestible um that you know someone unaware. It will get the wheels turning and it will give them, you know, the information that they need to then pass that on and to maybe relate that that&#x27;s happening with someone that they know that was describing something that and maybe they were quick to judge or maybe it will help them inter intercede with someone who who does come forward and is expressing that, you know, they are being a targeted person.</p>
<p>So, I mean the simplest these are little things that we can do in addition to I really encourage everybody to request your information and as Anna stated the template that she used for herself and that was modeled off of um one that you know how how Tulsi God got her information correct. We we cannot you know just sit here and knowing that we&#x27;re targeted and there are documents and out there about it proving that it you know it is being done to us with we have to continue to try and if we if we get denied then we we review and let&#x27;s see what you know what could have been something that missed And like Anna said, they want, you know, all variations of of names. So, anytime that you filled out a a credit request, a mortgage application, anything like that, you got to think about every single name that you&#x27;ve ever used. you know, whether it be your initial, your whole middle name, you know, your your previous married name, everything has to be in there because they they will just, you know, throw that out over the smallest little thing, right? they&#x27;re looking for more because isn&#x27;t addresses also part of that or are employers in part a part of that too or well I put my my prior addresses because uh maybe some of the information was like let&#x27;s say surveillance on 122 whatever street. Okay.</p>
<p>And so it it it&#x27;s not necessarily under my name even though it&#x27;s supposed to be with my terrorist screening center number. So I just you know I put and I even put also my emails. Why? Because you know we have these people interfering with our email. So I said in any of these email accounts you you what you want is to prevent them from saying oh no no I didn&#x27;t produce that because you didn&#x27;t specify it was from that account. Like if you said, you know, the happiest person at proton.m protonmail.com, but oh no, I didn&#x27;t know that that was your email.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not true. They know exactly every, you know, they they know so much more about us that we don&#x27;t even know because they have, you know, they have information about the people that betrayed us, the people that sold out on us, the people that investigated us. They have all that information that we don&#x27;t have it yet. So, um we just have to make it so that they cannot deny us information. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>Um absolutely. We we have to we have to we have to try and that&#x27;s a good point about the addresses as well because where for me personally you know on the NIH you know website I&#x27;m under my married name there &gt;&gt; and so yeah so you you have to include all those names and I guess that&#x27;s when I got you know kind of entered in the medical portion of it you know it just boggles your mind when they, you know, we have these so-called laws, HIPPA protecting our medical privacy, but, you know, yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very important to read that fine print when you&#x27;re, you know, signing um, you know, attesting to have its services done because I think that is where they kind of farm that out to to research facilities and stuff or laboratories and things of that nature. But well, circling back, I guess those emails and &gt;&gt; I want to mention something that I saw last week with Tucker Tucker Carlson and it is that um you know, thank God I I don&#x27;t have any of these, but you have to be very careful with all your Google searches because anything that you search in Google is recorded for life. And that and and that is one way that they can come say, &quot;Oh, well, here&#x27;s the terrorist predicate for this person.&quot; You know, be very mindful because you think you&#x27;re in the privacy. Oh, I have a VPN.</p>
<p>No, these criminals, &gt;&gt; they go through everything. So, just be very careful. And I have to emphasize that because it&#x27;s just stay away from people that scream trouble. &gt;&gt; Yes. You want to surround yourself with you know positivity and you know you know good character because guilt by association you know that&#x27;s a very w you know real thing you get lumped into something uh just because others are are behaving a certain way also that&#x27;s probably another uh outlet or avenue entry into this targeted program.</p>
<p>You may not have been guilty of any wrongdoing or suspicion, but maybe people that you associated with were and then they started to look into you to get closer to them and then it just became a blacklisting alto together because of it. Um I wanted to point out there were some some comments too if we want to go through. Um trying to find one from earlier. Let me bring this one up. Um because this was a a a question for you, Anna.</p>
<p>So she they&#x27;re saying that they could not find the paragraph that you want us to add to the letter when we go to the A3P action center. Is there somewhere published where that paragraph exists that will help with the writing? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s in the in targetedjustice.com/activism. That&#x27;s where the sample privacy act request is. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a paragraph that says, but I&#x27;m going to add to it. Give me a couple of days cuz I&#x27;m going to add to it that if you cannot send all this information to me on a CD, I want to personally go to the FBI office and tell me when to, you know, tell me when you&#x27;re going to have them available for me.</p>
<p>So, uh, give me a couple of days, but it&#x27;s going to be in the targeted justice website. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you so much for that. And let me take a look. I had flagged a couple of comments.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve had a lot of interaction with the chat today. Thank you so much for participating. There&#x27;s so many wonderful comments here and it&#x27;s good to see everybody engaging with one another. All right. Of course, I flagged one.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s one. All right. I want to show this one. All right. Riley is saying that they want to get more involved.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re a tech guy and have a lot of technical knowledge on your weapons. You know, we encourage if you have a lot of information that you want to share, you can share that information with targeted justice, you can write the chosen heroes uh at the email addresses. We would appreciate that. Um, &gt;&gt; you know, one of the things that I would, you know, we we don&#x27;t need that much information on neuroeapons. What we really need to help the community, if Riley here could create some sort of um newsletter to help TI&#x27;s fight back the hacking and how to protect themselves and their computers.</p>
<p>I know these people have like really powerful mechanisms and memes, but we really don&#x27;t need information on the neuroeapons. For that, I have lighthouse and we don&#x27;t need that. What we need is to help the community giving tools to them to deal with the hacking and what things to check for and how to protect their phone. You know, like Sean had his phone destroyed. Um, and so did Miguel and so did Jill.</p>
<p>And so that&#x27;s what we, you know, that that would be very valuable for this community to have somebody that could, you know, you could do a news a substack on it and help this community prevent the harm that they suffer from so much hacking from these criminals. I&#x27;m just throwing that out there because that doesn&#x27;t exist. &gt;&gt; Yes, very good point. Um there were a couple of comments out that said that you know um they had made that they would rather be in jail than being tortured. But we I I can&#x27;t urge you enough, you know, just not to do something that will lead you into being in jail because, as we know, inmates have complained and stated that they were, you know, medically implanted and and again, you&#x27;re you&#x27;re confined and you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re going to be subjected to.</p>
<p>So, you never know um how how much worse something could be and until you&#x27;re experiencing it firsthand. So, it&#x27;s better just to be safe than sorry and not do anything to land you in, you know, being incarcerated or in jail. &gt;&gt; And let me if I can only add to that, Melissa. Number one, be very careful what you wish for because there are many ways for it to come true. Number two, when you&#x27;re in jail, you are severely gangstaled, you are severely tortured, and you don&#x27;t even have a little bo bag of water to protect yourself.</p>
<p>And like you said, inmates have no rights when it comes to implantation. Absolutely zero. So, they will implant you any which way they can. So, just be very careful with what comes out of your thoughts and your and your mouth because it might become true. Yes, words are very very powerful and they&#x27;re very they can create manifestation.</p>
<p>So, we want to make sure that we stay in the light and um you know we we&#x27;re already bombarded at every direction uh with negativity as a result of this program. So, we have to be the light shining out, you know, countering it. And I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t uh go one day without you know leaning on you know the power of God and you know the Holy Spirit and protection because you know we we are under serious attack and spiritual attack. I mean this this is this every angle of evil you know coming at us. I was going to bring up this uh comment to uh Katya.</p>
<p>Katia states um they&#x27;re pushing her to get a whole new identity with new name, new B date and SSN. Now I and the reason why I wanted to show this is because there was a uh a targeted individual in conversation. I think it was in one of the uh teleconferences. the V2K had said that, you know, directed them, you know, and I&#x27;m not saying that this is a V2K instance. This could be actual people saying this to you.</p>
<p>But in this example that I&#x27;m stating is this targeted individual was being instructed by their V2K to change their name and SSN and all that information. And then once they changed their name, the name that they chose and the new social, it was from connected to a criminal and then they had criminal charges brought up against them with this new name. So just be very very careful. Um Anna, you want to you know expand your thoughts on that as well in terms of you know if someone is telling or directing to me I view anything that is that is coming especially you know with B2K or others because we know we&#x27;re we&#x27;re really you know we&#x27;re being gangstaled and you know they&#x27;re they&#x27;re wanting to set traps for us. um that I I would I would really think long and hard before doing anything um in that nature.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I would not I would absolutely not do that because that also could be a way of you not accessing like you say either a setup or you not being able to access any more information about you. And you know, one of one of the things I remember that these people like to do is for you to let&#x27;s say change your phone number and then you have there&#x27;s a lot of your accounts that are tied to that number. So then you get locked out of those accounts. You know, it&#x27;s always a setup with these people. So if if there&#x27;s no need for it, why do it? You know, if you think that changing your name is going to uh make your targeting go away, you know, think again.</p>
<p>You are being tracked through the top of your head and anywhere you go, they will find you. So, if that&#x27;s the reason, it&#x27;s a waste of money and time. I don&#x27;t know why any other reason why anybody would do that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because she was being directed to do this.</p>
<p>She was being instructed. You know, I want to I this whole thing is very coercive. It is very um gaslighting this being targeted and it&#x27;s very manipulative. I was being told, you know, that if I wrote a letter saying that it was all in my head and I mailed it to that multi-millionaire that they would give me my privacy back. My my thought then and my thought today is there is no honor amongst thieves.</p>
<p>Okay, you they they have stolen privacy. They have stolen personal information off my devices and tried to use it as blackmailing you know you know gaslighting what whatever you know about your personal very personal things that they want to exploit if if I don&#x27;t do what they want now I can tell you you can stand firm in these these you know you know uh blackmailing because that that is one one thing they really want you to do is to do what they want you to do. And none of these things did I act on that I was instructed to do and nothing came out of it. Meaning that you know nothing came out of it. You know they they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll even tell you that they&#x27;re going to kill you and make it look like a suicide.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what they told me. They said that everyone is breakable. They were bragging about this stuff. You have to deal know what the element that the evil that you&#x27;re dealing with and see it see through it for what it is. It is to invoke fear to isolate you to get you to do something that is not for your highest good.</p>
<p>So if you are ever in doubt in what&#x27;s your highest good, you just need to call upon God and you the Holy Spirit to give you the discernment to know what is only the truth to shield you from the manipulations and and the the subliminal uh and all of that stuff that is being directed at you because that that is that&#x27;s these are the stumbling blocks that each and every one of us have to go through and none of it ends in a success where we get our privacy back. We stop getting tortured because we listen to what a gangstalker, a perpetrator, you know, a violator is a a criminal is instructing us to do. There is no honor amongst thieves. Anna, you want to &gt;&gt; and you&#x27;re Yeah, you&#x27;re bound to lose. you&#x27;re bound to end end up accused.</p>
<p>Uh many of these mass shooters uh were told, you know, if they did whatever crime it was, their voices will go away. You know, don&#x27;t fall for it. The devil is a liar. Don&#x27;t fall for it. You know, how are you going to trust the same entity that is that is torturing you? I I find that so very hard to believe and to understand.</p>
<p>But just you know like Melissa says look look to the Holy Spirit for guidance. Uh because it is it is through the glory of God that many of us are here today. &gt;&gt; You you should never trust your torturer. &gt;&gt; Never ever. [clears throat] You know, &gt;&gt; they are not &gt;&gt; they don&#x27;t have your best &gt;&gt; stop this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They don&#x27;t have your best interest in heart. &gt;&gt; They thrive off of you suffering. They are not going to be the end of your suffering. They don&#x27;t I mean they I mean because if they lose, you know, what they&#x27;re doing to you, then they got to go find somebody else to make some money off of or or like narcissists, you know, to to, you know, to be an energy vampire elsewhere because they have to have narcissistic supply, you know, they&#x27;re they&#x27;re attracted to the light and they want to see, you know, to me, I equivalent this evil as, you know, it&#x27;s like a cat, you know, pinning his paw on a mouse and it&#x27;s wiggling it around and they just love to watch it wiggle. So, this is where you have to flip the script on them and don&#x27;t give them the satisfaction and wiggling to their manipulations and their tactics because that is that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what they want.</p>
<p>They want that reaction. They want that emotional trigger response. They want you to invoke the fear in you. So, starve them. [laughter] Yeah, to I totally agree.</p>
<p>I totally agree. Don&#x27;t don&#x27;t give them the pleasure. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Well, I think that that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a good way to end that was, you know, thank you for your feedback and this wonderful presentation on the um the privacy act. It it&#x27;s definitely, you know, uh, inspired me to to get that that new paperwork out and done and and to not accept the defeat from the first attempt and making sure that I&#x27;m very careful and thoughtful of the information because if we look at it through the lens of when did this begin and we may not be fully aware of exactly we could have become aware aware of it at a certain year, right? But it could have been happening before that.</p>
<p>So, you really need to just kind of, you know, survey your your whole history in terms of your names and your addresses and do not leave any stone unturned there because that entry could be one of those and and information could be really a lot of information could be connected to one of those names, one of those addresses like Anna said. So we want to make sure that when we are completing this request that we are very you know thoughtful and uh in preparing the document so that we don&#x27;t have to you know continuously try and try again. &gt;&gt; Yeah the moment is now. Um look if if the Republicans lose the midterms it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to stop any possibility we have it&#x27;s going to stop it on our tracks. the government the the president is not going to be able to do anything.</p>
<p>And whether you agree with him or not or you have you know whatever your opinion the the truth is one and it is that this under this under the current administration is that we have a hope of freedom. I can tell you that after we have seen what happened with us a and all the scandals that have come out. I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re perfect. I&#x27;m saying this is our moment to do this. So get going and and and just send out your requests and and just do it right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Absolutely. And hi Cool Breeze Tony, good to see you. He says he&#x27;s been making signs kind of like garage sale signs about um you know being the the targeted program. That&#x27;s a good idea. I mean, there&#x27;s, you know, we we need to start, you know, stirring the public interest because, I mean, of course, the community knows what&#x27;s going on, right? because we we live and breathe it 247.</p>
<p>But if we could put a bumper sticker or a a sign in our yard, you know, that says, you know, targetedjustice.com or or something about stop, you know, um government weaponization or, you know, or or whatever it is, you know, you can be creative. You have to draw them to where the source of information is about the targeting program. like Targeted Justice is going to be a really good resource for that along with, you know, when you&#x27;re out there in the community forums in the hightra chats on social media and you&#x27;re dropping, you know, Dominic&#x27;s uh cognitive liberty mind control video. You could also include targetedjustice.com so that you know they have a link to go to in addition to the video that is uh that they&#x27;re watching because they may want to know more information. So this is how we can we can combat the issue of the general public not being aware and to start feeding them the truth &gt;&gt; and and the censorship also I I am the DC group it&#x27;s DC Virginia Maryland Pennsylvania he is going to be preparing uh planning activities for us to go out so please uh reach out to us if you are in the DC area Please uh reach out to me at anatjproon.me so that I can contact you with Rick.</p>
<p>He is fabulous. He&#x27;s you know he is planning so we can we can have you know when you have a group and a support group set up gangstalking [snorts] goes down and um and we get you know how much fun was targeted action that we get to speak the same language. Well, we&#x27;re going to do that group here. So for those of you in this area, please um write to me so that I can uh connect you with Rick who is organizing the group. And I need help.</p>
<p>I need help. We&#x27;re going to bring uh banners. We&#x27;re going to be in in some intersections in the morning. So I want some of you to uh be volunteers with me holding banners at high traffic times just to keep the momentum going of raising awareness. Absolutely.</p>
<p>And uh for everybody, I&#x27;ve got um Anna&#x27;s social media. She has her own website at uh www.ato.com. Her exhandle is there. The Mera Substack newsletter publication link is there along with Medium, her Medium uh blog is there as well and her Facebook account. and she&#x27;s also provided her email address in this podcast as well for those um who are interested in volunteering and being a part of support groups in the DC area.</p>
<p>Uh don&#x27;t hesitate to to to reach out. Anna, it&#x27;s really been wonderful um having this conversation with you uh this afternoon. I really appreciate you um being a guest today. &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me. I I love it and I you know I I really want uh the community to know that you know they are the ones that inspire me to continue going and and I am so appreciative of the prayers which are welcome and needed and the support uh that that you have given me.</p>
<p>So um because you know I am absolutely and don&#x27;t let anybody don&#x27;t let anybody tell you that we&#x27;re not going to be free. It&#x27;s a matter of time, you know, it&#x27;s a matter of when, but we&#x27;re gonna accomplish it. So, don&#x27;t let anybody, don&#x27;t let your V2K, don&#x27;t let the Debbie Downers, don&#x27;t let the pessimistic per tell you otherwise. We will be free, but we we&#x27;re all all of us are in this together. So, we need we need your support for it.</p>
<p>Thank you, Melissa. &gt;&gt; Oh, you&#x27;re welcome. I mean and and like you have said too, we each and every person you know tuning in and those who are watching later are more powerful than we know and realize and there&#x27;s too many of us to discredit what we are stating. So, we just need to continue to fan that flame of truth and awareness out there because, you know, as Anna said, this is going to get exposed and it&#x27;s going to be shut down. People have to understand what they&#x27;re up against.</p>
<p>We it&#x27;s like the the entire population you know outside of you know we have already experiencing this but it&#x27;s almost like they are being guided and and steered into a corral where the everybody will be subjected to this. I I can&#x27;t say it enough. What we do today to stop this targeting is the future of humanity, the children, so that they have they they know what it&#x27;s like to to to be a a divine sovereign being covered by God, right? Because they&#x27;re wanting to disconnect us from that. They&#x27;re wanting to control and to you know experiment and to torture us you know just because we are truth seekers and lightbringers in this world. So it&#x27;s very critical mission right now.</p>
<p>The avenues are opening up. We know it&#x27;s a slow pro. It&#x27;s not it&#x27;s slower than what we want but we have to look back. Five years ago, did was there this kind of presence on social media channels? No, &gt;&gt; you have to see the big picture. &gt;&gt; And greatness takes time.</p>
<p>And we have all of you know God and the divine, the universe backing us on this very critical mission. Not only is it for humanity, but for this planet and the the beautiful creatures on this planet as well. All life on this earth, there is not one segment or space on this earth that is not under directed energy influence and manipulation. So we have to stand strong for humanity. And this this is my prayer every single day because light workers are being activated all around the world right now.</p>
<p>And we are bringing this information forward. We are like a light army, you know, shining through all of this darkness and this chaos and this manipulation. And God is activating these whistleblowers. I and and join me in the prayer of all of these whistleblowers that are coming forward are covered by God and they will have a success successful mission. Their soul mission is activated.</p>
<p>And I really do feel like, you know, of course, Ammy, I know you can relate to this. Our soul mission is activated, you know. I could have never thought my introvert self would have been on a podcast talking, you know, but this is how God moves, you know, and and covers you and and and inspires you and gives you that voice because it is a very important time for humanity. And these whistleblowers bringing forward this information are have have undeniable proof. Undeniable proof.</p>
<p>They are not going to be able to dispute all of this information that is just flooding out from. It&#x27;s just like a damn breaking with all of this corruption and torture being done to innocent women, men, and children all around the world. They cannot repair the dam. you know, they&#x27;re just trying to bandaid it, but they don&#x27;t have the forces because the light will always conquer the darkness. And please know that you carry that light and you are powerful.</p>
<p>Uh, obviously, you&#x27;re being targeted. There&#x27;s something about you that they just don&#x27;t they want to suppress. So [snorts] expand your wings and fly and be encouraged and embrace the beauty of who you are because you are a critical part of the whole piece. So [laughter] &gt;&gt; amen to that. Amen.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Amen. And thank you and God bless and cover you and all the things that you do for this community, Anna. you know, you you&#x27;re you are definitely anointed by God in this mission and covered and we we thank you for all your efforts. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much, Melissa.</p>
<p>And thank you for for what you do also because you&#x27;re holding a lot of people here. So, um let&#x27;s just one thing is for real. We have all become better versions of ourselves since we became targeted. And that&#x27;s my mission. Amen.</p>
<p>Beautifully stated. And thank you each and every one of you for tuning in. And God bless you, cover you, and have a great week ahead. Thank you so much. Have a blessed evening.</p>
<p>See you next week. [music]</p>
