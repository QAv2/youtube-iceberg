            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] Heat. [music] [music] [music] Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Welcome to Gaia.</p>
<p>[music] We are delighted to have you join us in our mission to empower a [music] global conscious community. Whether you&#x27;re joining us live or watching the replay, every piece of content [music] we share is created with the intention to awaken the potential within all of us. [music] And a very special shout out to our Gaia members. Thank you. Your support makes this community and everything we do possible.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re not yet a member, we&#x27;d love for you to join us. [music] There&#x27;s a whole world of wisdom waiting for you. &gt;&gt; The moment you start feeling abundant, you&#x27;re generating wealth. Our watch here is to become conscious. A global community based in higher states of consciousness.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Healing [music] can happen that fast. New discoveries are now confirming what we find in some [music] of our most ancient and spiritual traditions. &gt;&gt; Stuff does just keep on getting older. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s one of the beautiful [music] things about GIO Plus is that you&#x27;re going to find people that resonate with you and that inspires you. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to help you [music] attract a loving partner.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Nothing can stop the manifestation. Every single person is God wrapped in physical form. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;d love to bring the science and the spirituality together. &gt;&gt; This is an incredible time to be alive. &gt;&gt; The moment you start feeling whole, your healing [music] begins.</p>
<p>You just follow the formula. [music] Our work here is not to become spiritual. It&#x27;s to become conscious. Every single person is God wrapped in physical form. You cannot have an aligned state of doing without an aligned state of being.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I would say that manifesting is you consciously creating a life that you love. [music] &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll start with explaining what life force is. So, we&#x27;re going to do this through experience. So, you feel shifts in consciousness now and you take it home with you. &gt;&gt; We are in a very unique moment to begin again.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The nature of our relationships and how we choose them is going to be changing. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;d love to bring the science and spirituality together and see what we can do with our wonderful brains. &gt;&gt; Well, we&#x27;re going to do [music] some movement practice today and spiritualize our bodies. &gt;&gt; Everyone is amazing. I get to explore all these speakers and all these lessons.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Coming to Guyia Plus, you find your own people, your own tribe. Consider yourself part of the Gaia family [music] from this moment forward. &gt;&gt; When we learn to be grateful, it changes everything. &gt;&gt; We can transform pain into power. We can be [music] the change that we wish to see in the world.</p>
<p>You can heal and you can restore your brain and your body. The &gt;&gt; body heals itself in the environment you give it. And we are here to come to a deeper understanding of what real healing is all about. &gt;&gt; Miracles truly do happen. &gt;&gt; Laughter is truly the best medicine.</p>
<p>And when you feel the sensations and you get real with yourself, that&#x27;s when you can start to heal. Healing is our nature. It [music] is our nature to be well and healthy. And the science is telling us this. We must become the world that we choose to see.</p>
<p>[music] This is what the future human feels like. This is what the future human sees. This is what the future human knows. Everything you&#x27;re going to learn is about ways to trigger the wisdom that is already latent inside us. &gt;&gt; My analytical [music] brain eats this up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Open yourself up and allow the magic of epiphies [music] to drop in as a key right now overhead from the sun that corresponds with today. There are archetypes. They&#x27;re touchstones for a journey rather than this is you. You can&#x27;t map an eternal being. This is real and gutsy gritty work.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a living field of wisdom ultimately to bring [music] about collective consciousness and we are that collective consciousness. That intelligence of that future human that lives [music] in every one of us. When you enter into that world of the soul, a whole new world awakens [music] inside you. You are alive during the most profound shift in the planet&#x27;s history. You are a gift to humankind.</p>
<p>There is an infinite multitude of ways to experience existence itself. You are always shifting. You are always changing. Change [music] is the only constant. The things you are afraid of cannot harm you because there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>You are invincible. &gt;&gt; The next level of your evolution [music] is coming to a higher state of consciousness. When you love yourself enough, miracles happen. You are powerful. Are there latent systems in your brain that could alter the way you see the world forever? &gt;&gt; We can start to explore expanding our consciousness, [music] &gt;&gt; unlocking the deepest mysteries of our human potential.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; New discoveries [music] have overturned 150 years of scientific thinking. When it comes to us, to you and me, the way we [music] think, how can we thrive? If &gt;&gt; we can get all those systems in sync, [music] then we have better health, better wellness, and better connections and feelings with ourselves. [music] &gt;&gt; Water is the fundamental element of life and is the telephone to the universe. [music] This is actually [music] the perfect opportunity for a mass awakening. We&#x27;re writing a new story right now.</p>
<p>[music] We have to because the evidence no longer supports the story of the past. This is where our new story begins. &gt;&gt; These are the times that we&#x27;ve [music] been waiting for. These are the times of great transformation. &gt;&gt; The world is now on the [music] brink of change as we enter a new age that we&#x27;ll be discovering and working on together.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I remember everything about our mother civilization through [music] the stories of my grandfather. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s time to wake people up to this deeper history and also our deeper connection with something beyond this world. Do you have more energy in your energy field to be able to override the frequency that&#x27;s creating the illness? &gt;&gt; Our job as I see it while we&#x27;re here [music] is to wake up. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not just about having the information. It&#x27;s about directly experiencing it so that I can create the life I really want to live.</p>
<p>We had one person significantly change their telomere length within 4 days. And that is a quantum phenomenon. People are having instantaneous change in their health during a meditation. And when they change their energy, they [music] change their life. After doing meditation twice a day, take a look at that change.</p>
<p>All that green represents, [music] they changed their brain by thought alone. You have the ability to change your gene expression. We&#x27;re not hardwired to be a certain way for the rest of our lives. [music] And we&#x27;re not doomed by our genes. In fact, we are marvels of change.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to show you how to rewire your brain and show you the latest data [music] that supports my work that your thoughts can have an effect on your brain, your body, and your life. I&#x27;m Dr. Joe Despensza, and our research proves that when [music] you change, everything changes around you. At the deepest [music] level, everything and everyone are one. Very important question.</p>
<p>What is our potential as humans? The short answer is it&#x27;s infinite. [music] The big question of this ancient mind body problem is how do you turn the waters of the brain into the wine of our conscious experience? This whole division between science and spirituality is kind of unique to western culture. As I went deeper and deeper, I wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with the answer until I started to go into the world of quantum physics. This journey starts [music] in the only place that it can. This journey starts with you right here, right now.</p>
<p>The problem is that we cannot birth the new with the paradigms of the old. The prophecies of the Americas talk about the coming of a new human [music] and of a new age, a new era. The first thing that I needed to heal was my sense [music] of feeling unworthy. Modern medicine thinks that we are [music] collection of organs and that you can treat them separately and you forget that this is a miraculous human being that you&#x27;re working with. There&#x27;s a difference between [music] information and wisdom.</p>
<p>That information is knowing that water is H2O, but wisdom is being able to make it rain. Ultimately, gratitude [music] is a way of life. We don&#x27;t know how we got here. We don&#x27;t know why we&#x27;re here. And we don&#x27;t know where we&#x27;re going.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We bless our food. We bless our house. We bless our friendships. [music] &gt;&gt; The journey is into oneself and into the meaning of being. &gt;&gt; We are slowly coming to realize we are all human and getting more in [music] touch with our kinship.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s about how to become a better human being. A better human being. &gt;&gt; I see gratitude [music] as a route to a happy life. There are things that I&#x27;ve yet to do and there are mountains [music] I want to move but I am right here right now and it&#x27;s beautiful. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Let the gratefulness overflow into [music] blessing all around you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Consciousness is a fundamental feature [music] of the universe. The voices of plants that the shamans have listened [music] to for millennia, we can record them now in a lab with a laser. Psilocybin experiences looked like [music] experiences that have been reported over the ages by mystics. &gt;&gt; I think you can explain [music] the strange aspect of consciousness using physical natural laws. You have to extend what we know about the universe.</p>
<p>It cannot just be reduced to my [music] neurons in my brain. Plants are not only able to [music] detect sounds from their environment, but would also produce their own sounds. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s [music] this existential wonder about what&#x27;s really going on here. &gt;&gt; For me, the work with psychedelic [music] plants is a moment of communion with the infinite. We&#x27;re finding all these ways that sound is [music] starting to pop up in medicine.</p>
<p>How was it possible that something so important was forgotten by almost [music] the entire planet? &gt;&gt; The question is, how does sound heal and transform? &gt;&gt; These are real effects. They&#x27;re real medical effects and they can be measured. As Tesla said, if you want [music] to understand the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, vibration. &gt;&gt; Frequency plus intent equals healing. Healing is ultimately about [music] reconnecting with the life force of who we are.</p>
<p>So the path [music] of healing and the path of spiritual liberation are truly one and the same. &gt;&gt; Almost universally, [music] ancient texts and traditions have always placed sound at the core of [music] not only our existence but the existence of the entire universe. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; For example, in ancient Egypt, there was Patah, the god of technology, who went into his heart and felt the world and then spoke it into existence. &gt;&gt; Many megalithic sites, including pyramids and stone circles, are deliberately located on [music] earth energy lines or at nodal points of this global earth frequency grid. They had sound technology to create an anti-gravity field or some kind of magnetic resonance to build these temples and these megaliths.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Free energy technologies are encoded [music] within those megalithic temples. Also ways in which we can live in a manner that is more harmonious [music] with the earth and will enable us to create ultimately a sustainable civilization. That&#x27;s our quest and that&#x27;s our goal. What the science is showing us is the universe appears to be alive. It appears to be conscious.</p>
<p>Near-death experiences [music] are some of the strongest evidence we have that there is life after death. &gt;&gt; Peer-reviewed [music] research shows that human consciousness can affect physical matter. As a group, when we do intention, [music] we create a psychic internet. There is this universal divine force that guides all of us. &gt;&gt; There is actually a lot of scientific work showing how [music] sound can heal.</p>
<p>DMT is likely a portal to another dimension. &gt;&gt; Nature has a consciousness. &gt;&gt; That inner universe within us [music] connects with the greater universe of the stars. New discoveries are now [music] confirming what we find in some of our most ancient and cherished and spiritual traditions. When I weigh [music] 300 lb, I made a sacred commitment that I was going to lose the weight.</p>
<p>I went to [music] the gym 6 days a week, 90 minutes a day, 45 minutes of weights, 45 minutes of cardio. cut my calories, I [music] cut my fat, and at the end of 18 months of this, 702 hours in the gym, I still had a 46-in waist. [music] I was still fat, and I could max out most of the machines. As I&#x27;m recording this, I have exceptionally [music] strong bones, and I&#x27;m lean muscular, but not hyper muscular. 20 minutes a week is [music] my exercise routine using all of the hacks in here.</p>
<p>How could I go from weighing 300 lb down to [music] 8.6% body fat? It turns out it wasn&#x27;t from the exercise. It was from nutrition. If I [music] could do this as a 300 lb computer hacker who couldn&#x27;t touch his toes, who had three knee surgeries before [music] age 25, and I can do this on 20 minutes of exercise a week, imagine what would happen [music] if you learned a little bit more about how to eat, and you spend less time at the gym than you do now with the right tools. If you combine nutrition [music] with fitness, magic can happen. What would happen if you had [music] more energy and you had more results at the same time? Today, the world needs people who are healthy, high energy, strong with time on [music] their hands to do good work.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s you. People today need to come back to [music] nature in all aspects of your daily life. Modern cosmetics have made a shift from using plastic [music] micro beads to minerals. We&#x27;re entering this new period of rediscovery [music] that can allow us to use this ancient knowledge here in the information age. Learn how you can incorporate this ancient [music] practice in your modern life.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The minerals that make crystals up are also part of our own body. From the technology [music] we use to the ancient healing practices it affords us. Discover the power and potential of crystals. &gt;&gt; Even our [music] own DNA is a form of a liquid crystals. So we are intimately connected with crystals.</p>
<p>[music] &gt;&gt; Crystals are a tool for us to become the [music] best version of ourselves. &gt;&gt; Crystals only on Gaia. &gt;&gt; There will be some sort of a split in realities. Understand that that prime creator source in which everything comes from is [music] something that exists within each and every single one of us. &gt;&gt; What happens to a non-believer, a skeptic? Everybody goes through the same progression of their soul.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re going to keep reincarnating in the same realm until you learn the lessons of that realm. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s an attachment to an identity that they believe they cannot shift. We choose the identity that we desire. Until you move the ego aside, you can&#x27;t co-create with these high resonances of the universe. They can&#x27;t coexist.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s studies that suggest that autoimmune conditions can be caused by stress. Stress can affect the immune system. &gt;&gt; Did you have the stigmata? My hands were so bad I couldn&#x27;t even use my hands. Has the Vatican gotten involved with you? &gt;&gt; Yeah, they&#x27;ve investigated me. &gt;&gt; You cannot change what you cannot accept.</p>
<p>Ascension is a process of human attainment. Nobody gets a free ticket. Some believe perception defines our reality. That the only real obstacles that we experience in this world are the ones that we persistently allow ourselves to attach to and believe in. Maybe what we consider [music] to be random is not really random at all.</p>
<p>This season on [music] Codeex, Medatron, that great architect of this universal simulation, has left us [music] a cipher. Medatron&#x27;s cube is actually [music] the geometric form that defines the entire universe and our perception within it. We are not trapped in this cube, this matrix of mind. Rather, we are active participants [music] in it for our greatest good. All of it is interconnected [music] in a sublime symphony of music and geometry.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m Robert Grant and this is Codeex. I became interested in what was going on. Started researching the issue which [music] many people refer to as chemtrails. &gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t be afraid of death. Stay here as long as your sentence is because when you get out of here, it will make sense.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I went like that and the spoon broke. &gt;&gt; We think that our next lives will be in the future. The Hindus call it Brahma time. All time exists simultaneously. Somewhere your [music] great greatgrandfather is a 2-year-old.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The technologies that are in [music] these classified projects, quote unquote free energy zero point or or magnetic flux field generation systems that have been suppressed. If we keep all of this information [music] secret, we&#x27;re going to destroy the biosphere. The late 40s [music] were the same time period that the Mars Germans started uh [music] planning for and building their bases on the moon as well as Mars. &gt;&gt; Dr. Valerie Hunt was actually [music] able to record the chakras that are of course in the body and they also extend beyond the body and determine the colors of them and the sounds of [music] them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I have been to other planets, other dimensions and parallel Earths. This is not only astral travel, but this is uh astral time travel. I&#x27;m being placed in a different timeline of Earth. We are incredible beings with huge potential waiting to be awakened. We can cocreate something better, rise to a higher perspective.</p>
<p>Quantum principles underly everything in our universe. We must recognize that we are not just physical beings. Our limitless [music] potential comes from our spirit, not our physicality. There is no limit to how much we can awaken. Dreams can be such a useful guide in our life.</p>
<p>They can help us solve problems, receive insights, and higher teachings from higher plains. Even if we aren&#x27;t aware of it, we all dream. &gt;&gt; This is Mystery Teachings. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m Dr. Joe Despensza.</p>
<p>I want to invite you into a journey of your mind, your heart, and your body. You are your own genetic engineer. And how you think and how you feel creates your state of being. There&#x27;s energy to heal. There&#x27;s energy for growth and repair.</p>
<p>[music] In order for people to truly begin to make significant changes in their life, they have to get beyond the memory of themselves. If we&#x27;re going to create something new in our life, we have to crave the unknown. Move past the pain of yesterday into the joy of a new future. You are [music] the vortex to your creation. When you change, everything changes around you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There were secret societies that were involved in founding [music] this country. Who were they and what were they trying to do? It&#x27;s on the American dollar bill, new world order. It&#x27;s based on [music] the ancient Egyptian concepts of government, finance, law, and the way the ancient [music] Egyptians understood the world at large. That&#x27;s why you have a pyramid. The truth will actually blow you away.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What if you could reshape your reality using the power of your mind, energy, and intention? Learn to activate your chakras, harness [music] life force energy, and unlock your highest potential with transformative practices. You&#x27;ll learn how to protect yourself from predictive programming [music] and discover how mastering your energy can shift you from fear-based realities into a world [music] of abundance and spiritual freedom. This isn&#x27;t just theory. [music] It&#x27;s a stepbystep guide to spiritual sovereignty, empowering you to align your mind, body, and soul to create a purposeful, abundant life. Ready to awaken to the reality you deserve? Let&#x27;s break [music] through the veil and step into your true power.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Our soul is evolving right now. Life-changing conversations. We may be far greater than we can even perceive. Exploring humanity&#x27;s deepest mysteries. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a new human story [music] that&#x27;s emerging that changes everything &gt;&gt; and tools for your personal growth.</p>
<p>We should never underestimate the [music] significance and potential of humans. &gt;&gt; Energy goes back and forth both ways. Communication goes both ways. &gt;&gt; I love that. That&#x27;s a great way to go about it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hundreds of episodes designed to help you find your truth. Join me as I sit with the world&#x27;s top researchers, [music] teachers, scientists, and authors to uncover leading edge insights you won&#x27;t get anywhere [music] else. Open Minds with Regina Meredith, only on Gaia. [music] This is about [music] the real Shakespeare. Here&#x27;s something we were never told.</p>
<p>The greatest writer in history never wrote a letter [music] to anyone. Not so much as a note has ever been found. I discovered the most important cryptographic key to solving the whole Shakespeare [music] puzzle. I had identified the actual physical location where Shakespeare had left the truth of who he really was and why there had been a cover up. Have you [music] ever wondered what you&#x27;re truly capable of? The kind of power and potential [music] that exists dormant within? Is it a mystery to you how you fit into this crazy world and what you can do to influence it? Well, get ready as we embark on a journey of incredible self-discovery for the road less [music] traveled, for the key to unlocking our hidden potential.</p>
<p>Welcome to Limitless. We&#x27;ve opened the door to one of the greatest mysteries of our existence. What is in what we call the empty space of the universe? My name&#x27;s Greg Braden and I&#x27;d like to welcome you to the divine matrix bridging time, space, miracles, and belief. Almost universally, ancient texts and indigenous traditions [music] describe a field of energy that connects all things. The field, the web, the net, the divine matrix.</p>
<p>It is the release of energy itself. We have within us the ability to interact with the force that fills the empty space of the universe. Not only are we connected through a field of energy, [music] but we are the matrix. And it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re the matrix that the discoveries that describe it are describing us as well. &gt;&gt; Neuroplasticity is the ability for your brain to change its structure.</p>
<p>Our thoughts, feelings, emotions, [music] and even our beliefs have physical representations. &gt;&gt; It is becoming clear that mind and matter are entangled and the separation between objects and consciousness [music] is nothing but an illusion. &gt;&gt; This is the realm where you transcend everything separate and you begin to experience oneness. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Gaia presents [music] Skyosphere Event Center, Dr. Steven Greer, UAP [music] Disclosure, and C5 ET contact.</p>
<p>Hello everybody. [applause] Thank you guys. Good to see you. [applause] Beautiful crowd. Thank you all.</p>
<p>Thanks to the folks at Gaia and the folks I see a lot of you I know. I want to acknowledge uh my good friend uh Michael Herrera who&#x27;s here who&#x27;s been helping a lot with what&#x27;s going on with uh law enforcement, special forces and government and Congress and behind the scenes. He&#x27;s been become a really essential member of the team. And my dear friend Marian Kramer, we met in uh at 19 when we were becoming meditation teachers. So, we&#x27;ve been friends for 51 years.</p>
<p>God bless you. And of course, Paula Harris, I think we first met almost 30 years ago when I stayed at your place in Rome and did all those things. It was must have been the late 90s or early mid 90s. Yeah. So, some great family here.</p>
<p>I consider them all family and all of you, too. So, we&#x27;re going to do a big trip this weekend through things that are going to be a little bit of psychic whiplash. So, I&#x27;ll just prepare you for this. So, we&#x27;re going to go from u, you know, a very deep dive into what&#x27;s going on with disclosure, but each day we&#x27;re going to also focus deeply on the science of consciousness and how essential it is that all of you become ambassadors from Earth to these people. And the reason it&#x27;s becoming criticality at this point is because everything is about to tilt.</p>
<p>Everything&#x27;s about to change. I don&#x27;t often say this, but you should be looking for major things happening on many fronts on this planet in the next 6 months to 24 months. And humans that know how to make contact with these civilizations will be the points of coherence for bridging over to a new civilization. I&#x27;ll just give you a preview on that. So, it&#x27;s very very important you understand that.</p>
<p>And um so as we go through this uh program, let me go to the next SL. Oh, this tilts. [laughter] I just want and and the reason I&#x27;m going to go weave these what seem like competing things together is because you need to understand the implications of what we&#x27;re doing right now. And what we&#x27;re doing right now has to do with there&#x27;s a picture here of me with a member of the House Oversight Committee. uh when I went down to Mexico City to look into this thing called the bugosphere.</p>
<p>Um b u g-a is how it&#x27;s spelled and it was found in an area of Colombia, South America uh called Bugga. It&#x27;s a little town and uh it&#x27;s a very important development and Congressman Burles wanted me to take him down there. Uh, actually I just spoke to the outgoing mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, who wants to go down with me later this month to do some he&#x27;s putting at his disposal uh some wonderful scientists and forensic folks that uh we would normally have access to before he leaves office on January 1st. So there&#x27;s a great deal of interest in this um and also at the national security level um with the uh uh US executive branch and FBI and others that are very interested in this because uh we have concluded that it most certainly is uh not a recently built device and we&#x27;ll get into all those details but I wanted you to also know that our whistleblowers that we have we have a number of new ones Uh, of course you know Michael Herrera, but there&#x27;s some others that have come forward that we&#x27;re going to summarize. Uh, and then we&#x27;re going to also talk about what&#x27;s going on with law enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>So that last part I&#x27;m going to tiptoe around very very carefully because I&#x27;m the primary intel source for uh the US government law enforcement national security people who are now fully aware of the problem and are aware of the criminal organization that&#x27;s been keeping all of this secret and they are going at it very quickly and very hard and it&#x27;s very dangerous actually right now. So um there are things going on even yesterday that are at a very highest level. I&#x27;ll just put it that way. You can infer what you would like. Um that are very positive momentum going into uh a full accounting and disclosure of 80 years of criminal illegal secrecy.</p>
<p>So that is happening. Um it&#x27;s uh fraught. Obviously you can read between the lines how dangerous that would be. But at the same time, we have great people who are doing it. And we have a wonderful team of folks who have been uh have been green beretss and special forces guys who are now working directly with us uh on this investigation and leaisoning with um US national security and US law enforcement.</p>
<p>And so it&#x27;s become very serious. Um and those of you who are here supporting this and those of you there last night for the fundraiser, thank you because it&#x27;s become rather expensive doing this. We are funding all of it without contracts from the government because we will not take money from a government. We won&#x27;t take money from a corporation. And so it&#x27;s you guys doing it.</p>
<p>Thank you. [applause] It wouldn&#x27;t happen without you guys. And I want to also thank uh Raven Noli. She&#x27;s if you see her here, thank her because I would not be here without her, right? She&#x27;s the person who&#x27;s along with my wife of 46 years has kept me doing this and kept me propped up and functional at times not always sometimes dysfunctional but that&#x27;s fun also isn&#x27;t it but [laughter] and uh has kept all this you know really the support team around me going so we have a lot of volunteers but it&#x27;s primarily a handful of people and and Raven&#x27;s a key full-time person who has been with us since 1998 eight. So she&#x27;s 27 years in doing C5 and all the work with disclosure.</p>
<p>So you know, thank you Raven. [applause] So uh next so uh I think that just sort of some recent things you know there was a recent uh hearing up on Capitol Hill House Oversight Committee. So far, they have blocked all the firsthand highvalue whistleblowers. Um, and we&#x27;ll get into this in a moment, but we did submit the testimony summaries of some new ones and they were with an overview letter that you can see here. I&#x27;m not going to read it to you.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a publicly available on our website and in our archive. and it basically gives the recommendations that I know they&#x27;re trying to pursue and that is to make it turn it into a real investigation based on criminal conclusions which would include subpoenas and so we have about 50 high value um folks to be subpoenaed. Uh there are people who like Mr. Herrera who will testify without a subpoena. But the vast majority of people who would be the high value firstirhand whistleblowers who have handled the craft, who have been involved in criminal activities, who have been involved with human trafficking using man-made UFOs, uh torture, uh abductions, which you guys think are alien abductions, but it&#x27;s a CIA aerospace conglomerate doing it.</p>
<p>Uh, all of that has been handed over to law enforcement, but it&#x27;s also been handed over to key members of House oversight, right, and Senate intelligence. Now, Senate intelligence, to my knowledge, has no plans to hold a hearing on this. Uh, the task force at the House is uh so far, um, the primary firsthand whistleblowers have all been blocked. There has not been a substantial uh there have been some minor people who were in the military who saw something but the deep ones the ones who have actually been in the locking skunk works been in the operating facilities or who have managed the flight and the uses of man-made UFOs which is about the 80% of the ones you see are ours by the way all those drone things or all ours we&#x27;re going to get into this and those operations are also embedded with other criminal activities. Right? So, that is that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re going to really need to have subpoenas.</p>
<p>And since we know who the primary people are up to and including the folks who have issued uh wet works orders or a targeted killing of of of witnesses and targeted killings of people, we have the names of some of those folks who are operational for some of the big aerospace companies. Those have been handed off to law enforcement and also to these oversight national security committees in the Congress and also the administration. So this is moving very quickly. I know I&#x27;m probably shocking some of you with this. Uh we&#x27;re out of time to pussyfoot around.</p>
<p>So um having done this for 35 years, it&#x27;s now all coming to a head. Now that&#x27;s very good news. I mean the good news is I think this is all going to come out. The bad news is it&#x27;s being very carefully spun in a direction I predicted in the late 1990s to create a totalitarian military superstate that we&#x27;re going to have to try to resist. Uh next, now the bogusphere.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting critter. Um I didn&#x27;t learn about it until this spring. It landed in m March. How many people have heard of this thing? Okay, almost all of you have some knowledge. So when I learned of it, I went, &quot;Well, who knows, you know, what this is.&quot; And um Haime Muson, who I&#x27;ve known for many, many years since the early 90s, invited me to come down and and I asked him if I could bring Congressman Berles down and and some of his people to look at this.</p>
<p>And you will see that on the top of it there are a number of symbols, right? uh and those have been by two separate linguistic teams been concluded to be a type of proto Sanskrit. So we&#x27;re going to connect some dots this morning to what we&#x27;re going to do at the last part of tonight late. We&#x27;re going to do a a puja Sanskrit a meditation and do contact and then we&#x27;ll break at 11:00 and you can go out till 3:00 or 4. That&#x27;s what I do. Great things happen between 1 and 5:00 a.m.</p>
<p>So those of you who go to bed early, get get over it. What&#x27;s that song? Snap out of it. Where&#x27;s Sher when I need her? But slept you. [laughter] No, I know I&#x27;m terrible. You come on one of these trainings with me and that&#x27;s how it is.</p>
<p>I say the babies are falling asleep. It&#x27;s only 1:00 a.m. Anyway, I know people are really laughing who know me. [laughter] Inappropriate any. So, but uh we have fun.</p>
<p>Uh so that is a very interesting development because when I first had contact and was taken on board a craft and when I was 18, I think most of you know that story if we can revisit it. Um for several hours um is when we created or I created with ETSs the C5 contact which is now in your app, all of it. And I knew that even though I had not learned, I hadn&#x27;t met Marion and become a meditation teacher yet, but I had this experience and the language and words had a lot of similarity to something I thought I had heard. And then subsequently, I&#x27;d be sleeping and my roommate in college, I just started college would say, &quot;You&#x27;re talking in a language not of this world or not used while you&#x27;re sleeping. You&#x27;re in some sort of contact state.&quot; This is after I had went on board and had come back.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t often share this story, but why not? Skya, you guys can handle stranges, huh? Um, we&#x27;re going real strange here, but or as Jed Doctor Jen Heinik said, high strangeness. Uh, they&#x27;re strange and they&#x27;re highly strange. So, recently a congression woman named Luna said to to this billionaire person we know said, &quot;Dr. Kurt&#x27;s a strange man. I took it as a compliment.</p>
<p>It was meant as an insult. [laughter] [snorts] Don&#x27;t worry, I I&#x27;m hardened to all insults. Uh but when I realized it was a type of proto Sanskrit is what two separate linguistic teams concluded, these symbols, they don&#x27;t look like the Sanskrit I learned to become a meditation teacher in 1974. But these linguistic experts, two teams separately have concluded those symbols are a type of proto Sanskrit. And we just received uh tonight, last night or this morning, uh a translation basically what they&#x27;re saying.</p>
<p>And I will share that with you at some point. Is it up here? Oh, I don&#x27;t see it. Oh, is it lost in here? I don&#x27;t see it. Anyway, I&#x27;ll need [clears throat] to have it. the text.</p>
<p>Anyway, um we just got this so hopefully someone can print it out while we&#x27;re doing this. So, uh now this thing when it landed, just so you know, it didn&#x27;t just crash. It ran into a power line and I don&#x27;t know. Let&#x27;s see if we have a a video of it. And let&#x27;s watch what happens here.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s maneuvering uh electrogravetically. It&#x27;s heavy. It weighs 22 lbs when it&#x27;s at its full normal Earth weight. Uh 10 kilos, a little over 10 kilos, 10.112 kilos. So, that&#x27;s more than 22 pounds.</p>
<p>and it was seen all over this area zipping around and well at some point I&#x27;m not sure where the clip was. Uh this is after it hit a high voltage line and on the bottom half of the hemisphere there&#x27;s a burn and a melted spot where it shorted this out and because of that high voltage impact it sort of floated down to the ground and it didn&#x27;t crash hard so it wasn&#x27;t banged up and it landed in this brush and the man who you see going in there to get it we have interviewed and extensively about how that whole event un unfolded. Well, he ended up putting it over to the side cuz when he first picked it up, it kind of burned him. It gave some sort of electromagnetic field radiation that left sort of a burn feeling. And so he took it and put it over in some grass, which in the previous photo you saw there was a big brown area.</p>
<p>So it was putting out some type of non-nuclear but electromagnetic radiation. Now, initially there was a lot of hysteria about that. It was nuclear. Let me explain. There&#x27;s radiations of all types, right? So, if you look at the full electromagnetic spectrum, you can have ultraviolet.</p>
<p>You go out in the sun, you&#x27;ll get burned and you can have that used as a technology. Microwaves, you all have microwave ovens. Well, microwaves can be pulsed and they can cause that kind of burning of an alteration of the grass, uh, etc. and so on and so forth. So, it was not a nuclear.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no Geiger counter reading on this, meaning it&#x27;s a nonionizing and not from a nuclear source, but from some electromagnetic field radiation, which you would expect because these objects, both the ET and the man-made ones, are running on an electromagnetic field that causes a at certain frequencies and rotations a mass cancellation. mass cancellation meaning the weight of it is reduced right and that&#x27;s what has happened here because when it landed it weighed 2 kilos now it weighs four I mean 10 10 it went from two to six to 10 kilos so it went up basically more than 4 to 500% in its weight now what is weight what does that mean the important thing uh is there another slide Yeah. So, here&#x27;s another. Now, watch how it&#x27;s moving. Now, imagine this is pretty heavy.</p>
<p>You know, if you know what a 25 lb weight at the gym feels like, this is just flying along like this. Silent, no means of propulsion, no fuel, no nuclear geer. And you hear it go. Here it is. So, five of these have been filmed now.</p>
<p>Only one has landed. There aren&#x27;t five that we have. There&#x27;s only one that has landed and they are all identical. They have the they they&#x27;re spinning. They have an equator.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re seamless. And they have this kind of writing on the top of it. So what that means is that of the ones that are activated, only five have been filmed that we have the films. There may have been dozens or hundreds of these activated in that region of South America. It was very important.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll get to this in a moment. Maybe that&#x27;s where it hit the &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think these were out of order. Okay, so let&#x27;s just play all these. You see all you know the these are all one of these is very recent. And uh actually one of them was taken by someone with a like a hang glider with a GoPro and this thing comes along.</p>
<p>That&#x27;d be cool. you&#x27;re up there. [laughter] I&#x27;d be down for it. Yeah, this guy. See, it&#x27;s one of those hang gliders.</p>
<p>And uh so this this area seems to have a number of these being activated. And uh I think this whole phenomenon of what I&#x27;m calling the bugosphere activations. So here&#x27;s one hovering in front of the trees. See it? &gt;&gt; You guys see it? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>I have a tiny screen so I&#x27;m not sure. I want to be sure you guys can see it. Yeah. Here it takes off, hovers, takes off. Silent, off it goes.</p>
<p>Sometimes they just go off at enormous speeds or dematerialized and clear air. Um, the only reason this one got disabled is that it was curious about those power lines and went over and got zapped and it sort of fried the circuitry. I have my reasons for why that happened. I&#x27;ll mention in a minute uh why it did that. These are unmanned.</p>
<p>There aren&#x27;t any little people in there. So, these are unmanned remote. [laughter] Um, and it&#x27;s important to note that now because we just got back and we will show you the report from the University of Georgia. It&#x27;s a certified carbon 14 dating lab and Haimey and his scientific team uh Haime Mosone asked me to do the science on this. So I said of course I will.</p>
<p>Um, and we went down with some scientists to get the sampling. So, just to clear [clears throat] up any misinformation that&#x27;s been put out up out there on the internet, around the equator of the bugosphere are 31 portals, little holes, 4 mm, tiny, and inside there&#x27;s a type of resin material like an insulating dialectric uh something that&#x27;s causing it&#x27;s part and parcel I believe of the pulsing of the electromagnetic field so it creates the right resonant frequency. But they had when I saw that as a doctor I went ah that material almost certainly has carbon in it. There&#x27;s no carbon to carbonate in the metal sphere. You can&#x27;t carbonate aluminum or titanium or whatever it is roodium or whatever.</p>
<p>You you can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just not possible. However, anything that&#x27;s organic and carbonacious that would have carbon molecules that you can&#x27;t. So, what we did was very carefully drill out very hard material out of one of those ports that had already been damaged when they were doing some other test. So, we selected one of the ports that had already had some damaging of that resin material, got it out, gave it to the lab, and back comes the report.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s 12,560 years old. Now, think about this for a moment. Here&#x27;s the equator. See those little dots, black dots around the equator? That&#x27;s where we got the resin. So, people have said, &quot;Oh, on the internet, you can&#x27;t carbon date metal.&quot; Well, no, you can&#x27;t.</p>
<p>But we&#x27;re not idiots. Um, you know, the internet is just trash, trash, trash. Um, don&#x27;t Google or AI anything. You know, if it&#x27;s important, you&#x27;ll find it. We&#x27;re putting it out.</p>
<p>But this means that uh now assuming that that resin was put in at the same time of its creation and not later, it&#x27;s at least 12,560 years old. Let me tell you what that means. First of all, there was no smelting of aluminum until after 1876 because that&#x27;s when we had the technique invented and discovered for pulling aluminum out of ore, boide ore. Occasionally where mel uh bulk site would have been under a volcanic effect and would have melted a bunch of it because you need a very high temperature there would little aluminum would be found and it was considered way more valuable than gold or platinum. Uh aluminum was extremely valuable.</p>
<p>You can look this up but and this is 12,560 years old or older. And so the question then becomes how was this done? because there was no manufacturing like this machining and there was no aluminum and this is 94% or so aluminum and or five. So uh that&#x27;s an interesting fact in of itself. Secondly, the [snorts] uh metallurgy that has come back if we have that. Um this is the report from the University of Georgia and you can see the date.</p>
<p>Uh we&#x27;ve just taken the scientist&#x27;s name off for his own privacy because this went public as 12,560 years, right? So that is at the end of the last ice age and some catastrophic geohysical event happened perhaps a a sunflare or a solar storm or some cosmic radiation that caused some sort of geohysical catastrophic event that ended the last ice age. And I think when you hear what the translation of the protosanskrit is, these all being activated as a warning. I&#x27;ll just say that it&#x27;s a three bell warning. Now you have the metallurgy. This was done by the Southwest Research Institute, very prestigious uh lab in San Antonio.</p>
<p>And it gives you the breakdown. And you can see, you know, you have about 94 to 5% aluminum, but it has all these other elements in it. some of which I think are maybe called neodyenium. And some of these weren&#x27;t even discovered until the late 1800s or early 1900s. And the specific composition of this alloy doesn&#x27;t match any known alloy used on earth or created on earth as of this date by our search.</p>
<p>So um we can&#x27;t find any uh known alloy like this from modern human manufacturer. So this is extremely important. Um and what it means that all these elements in here that didn&#x27;t even weren&#x27;t even discovered until the late 1800s and 1900s as well as aluminum being fabricated like that uh would indicate that this is something that predates any modern civilization. Now keep in mind while the Sphinx is much older the pyramid the Great Pyramid Giza is about 4,500 years old. This is 12,560.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s almost three times older than the pyramids. And what this would indicate to me, now this is getting into my hypothesis, is that this existed at a time when either there was a a type of early civilization in that part of the world that had direct contact with extraterrestrial beings and technology or this and created this having very advanced technologies. or it is from an extraterrestrial civilization and that they have been dormant for 12,560 years. The fact that they are all suddenly becoming activated I would say is a leading prognostic indicator as we say in medicine I&#x27;m a emergency doctor um that things are going to be start changing very quickly. So I would say this is a three bell warning uh that I would take seriously.</p>
<p>Uh next, so I think that this is some of the symbol translation that we initially got on the proto transcript. I just mentioned that we have just received a new translation and oh do I have it somewhere? I guess it wasn&#x27;t put up here or Raven can find it. I don&#x27;t know. Um, so this just came in. Now, [snorts] how interpretive this is, I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a an ancient language expert looking at these symbols who&#x27;s a proto Sanskrit expert. I know Sanskrit. I don&#x27;t know protosanskrit. So, I can&#x27;t verify. But this is what Haime Mason has just sent us last night when I think it&#x27;s very interesting.</p>
<p>You know, in the beginning, the principal one, the spirit through the word brought forth the birth of races and lineages where everything was imbued with the purpose of spreading and bestowing upon the sun, the sky, the radiance, the light of the universe, and the realm of the seven worlds, the planets and the gods. Then came the lunar phases, the harvests and the sewing. The land was secured and cultures were formed governed by the two principal movements each with its own direction. It was then that abundance, teaching and knowledge were bestowed. This was manifested from the highest, the most sublime, and the perfect.</p>
<p>It was then that the vortex was created with a great roar. Likewise, the wheel of time, the astronomical wheel, was created, manifesting in the cycles of the earth. Afterward, the absolute and highest draws nearer for the manifestation of good and the generation of virtues, respect for the sacred, surren surrender to truth and the expression of spiritual strength and heroism through harmony and perfect synchronicity. Next, then the resonance of the 30 gods is established. Having done this, Indra&#x27;s great ship commanded by the god of the atmosphere and the sky moved freely with a great roar.</p>
<p>For he had charged the great solar warrior with ending evil on Earth. Finally, after the ship departed, it left a warning of danger, the shattering of worlds by atomic disasters, solar explosions, or destruction, where everything could end due to our decisions and our responsibility forever destroying the great life essence, the breath and the life rod of creation. Is that where it ends? Yeah. Now meditate on that for a moment. Um and it&#x27;s very interesting because you know if you if you look at the vdas and even the bhagavagita there&#x27;s mentions of things like vimmanas there are these flying things that we&#x27;re seeing um and there&#x27;s a lot of this in various mythologies.</p>
<p>Now to the extent that this may be an accurate translation of the protosanskrit again I can&#x27;t say it is or isn&#x27;t but it tracks with what I&#x27;m sensing and that is this hearken from a time when the world was very primitive a great event happened there was an intervention and contact that happened that was interstellar extraterrestrial multi-dimensional because it&#x27;s all part of one and then we&#x27;re now at this time where it&#x27;s going to happen again right so and we know this. Oh, all you know this. You know, things are not going to stay the way they are. Um, and and the fact that this has now gotten activated uh to me indicates that we should do quicken our efforts to lay the foundation for the transformation from the current state of the world. It mentions atomic disasters, right? We have our national security structure tilting towards going to Defcon 1 to fight two uh nuclear wars on two fronts as you know you may not know but we are and there&#x27;s a whole lot of of of of developments that would track with this um both in the geopolitical sphere but also the geoysical sphere.</p>
<p>For example, there&#x27;s a big uh magnetic field disturbance over parts of South America, the Southern Atlantic, and Africa that scientists have been tracking. That&#x27;s an anomaly of the magnetic field of the Earth. And it&#x27;s unusual. And I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s unrelated to the activation of these buggaspheres because they seem to be under some kind of programmed sensor activation. What do I [clears throat] mean by that? When you get in there, when we were taking the metal sample, you could see little filaments of what look like fiber optics, but not like we would run a carter or a wire, but part and parcel of the material.</p>
<p>And this is very indicative of extraterrestrial manufacturing. So when an ET object is manufactured, it isn&#x27;t brought in, you know, if you took your your this thing apart, you know, it&#x27;s all a zillion little pieces, right? No, the bugosphere is seamless. When you get into the metal, and we&#x27;re very careful not to damage much of it, very tiny diamond, you know, tiny tiny drills. Um, what you find is that it seems to be a fully integrated item that like a 3D printer, but it&#x27;s more like a 4D printer. And the way ET manufacturing happens is that it&#x27;s created within a resonant field at the 0 point baseline level of energy that&#x27;s not even subatomic.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s beyond even subatomic. And it creates a field where the whole thing then materializes as a whole. Right? As opposed to digging up ore and materials and fabricating the way we manufacture things. This is very different. We know that this is uh let&#x27;s say absolutely diagnosis of an object being ET versus man-made.</p>
<p>Now the scientists in in Mexico City didn&#x27;t know that. I&#x27;ve worked for decades with people who&#x27;ve worked on the man-made UFOs, but also my uncle his whole career is north of Grumman, but also people who&#x27;ve handled and studied and reverse engineered the ET ones, the non-human ones. And those objects are very different. Uh they are very much more like this bugosphere than anything that would come out of Ford or GM or or you know Lockheed or something. So I think this would indicate that if it wasn&#x27;t an ET civilization that made this, it most certainly was a civilization that had uh received and were had mastered ET technologies.</p>
<p>Um, now what which it is, I would at this point if I were going to vote and had to I would vote that it was a VT origin completely. But it&#x27;s almost irrelevant because if it&#x27;s not a VT origin, it&#x27;s of ET origin by proxy of a very ancient civilization that had seamless involvement at a even technological level with the the ETS. Now what&#x27;s this about the protoanskrit? when I was a kid and I had well I was 18 uh when I had this experience and I went on board afterward I uh realized that what I had learned right after my near-death experience when I was 17 and six months earlier I died and I had this whole experience of unity consciousness and I&#x27;m going to take you at night through all the higher states of consciousness and in meditation so you can experience them um and that it clear that when I heard the Sanskrit and I was do the some that my teacher did the puja and I got my mantra I went this seems awfully familiar it was inside me already I don&#x27;t from somewhere from when when I went out because when I died I went out in space back home that&#x27;s home for me and um so when I had the contact experience I was on the craft for four hours or so something like that three or four hours, but in a state of not like this, but in a state of deep meditation, like a mind meld with these uh ET civilizations. Um, and I guess they figured since I was a a boy that had had a near-death experience and had learned the the meditative state so I could get into that state of consciousness through meditation without being dead. Um, that&#x27;s why I learned I said, &quot;Well, I&#x27;d love to get to this beautiful state of awareness without dropping dead.&quot; you know, it&#x27;s like I only have to be deathly ill on my deathbed every time I experience samadei.</p>
<p>So, [laughter] so I decided it&#x27;d be smart to go ahead and learn meditation. [snorts] And so I did. And when the contact experience happened, I immediately knew that that Sanskrit language had come from the stars or at least the predecessor. which was maybe his proto Sanskrit had come from and I sense it was from uh out in the sector of space where Sirius and Orion, you know, the Orion constellation and Sirius um I I knew it was whether it was that specific star system for from that vector, that sector of space. I I knew it intuitively.</p>
<p>So, and I those of you who&#x27;ve been with me for 30 35 years know that I&#x27;ve always said that. And when I became a teacher of meditation, it came very natural to me the Sanskrit. And I used to tutor other students in the Sanskrit. So it seemed to have been unfolded within me as a consequence of my near-death experience. It seems um and so this is sort of an interesting full cycle for me now that they&#x27;re they&#x27;ve identified these symbols as a type of protoanskrit.</p>
<p>is I just find it very beautiful in a way even though some of the messaging has some both hopeful and ominous components right but that&#x27;s okay we live in a very dynamic time let&#x27;s just say so next so I want to move off of that for a moment u we&#x27;ll have time for some Q&amp;A that&#x27;s the essence of where it is just to say the next phase in the bugosphere is going to be trying to I recommended this in June I I don&#x27;t know if you heard me say this uh to folks is that um there are if you look at the CAT scans there are some strange structures inside. Now, they&#x27;re not well defined, but if you know, and you get a better one if you could get a functional MRI, but you can&#x27;t put a metal thing in an MRI thing and go bang, right? Everybody had an MRI, you have to take all all your metal off, right? And be the thing would, you know, probably kill someone because the thing is heavy almost 20 22 23 pounds. But around that equator, there are two of those. It appears two of those holes, those 4 mm portals go all the way through. Most of them just go very not far.</p>
<p>And then the rest of the thickness is this thick. The the skin of the bugosphere. It&#x27;s not thin. It&#x27;s very heavy. That appears to go all the way through in two of them.</p>
<p>So my proposal, if they would allow it, would be to go through where that resin is, get more of that material, and get it further analyzed for its chemical composition. That&#x27;s a test that&#x27;s still pending, I think. But what we want to see what that stuff&#x27;s made of, right? This the very specific chemical breakdown. And then what we want to do, take that out, run some more tests on the material, re reconfirm its age. We can do another um you know carbon dating on the new material just to be sure it&#x27;s matching up with the other one.</p>
<p>This is you want verification scientifically. I&#x27;m very rigorous as a doctor and a scientist. So and then go in there with a little 2 millimeter fiber optic system. Now that&#x27;s very small with 2 millimeters but they make them. [snorts] And now this is outside my expertise.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d have to bring someone in. I maybe Mayor Adams he says he has people who could help us with this New York City mayor outgoing that I spoke with two days ago and and to go in there with a very high-tech fiber optic system look in the inside and explore the structures but with full fiber optic clarity hooked to a 8K camera. All right, that would be on a screen and being recorded. See what I want to do? So that is what I&#x27;m recommending. I think that would yield a great deal of new information about the internal structure.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if a system that small would have the ability to have a teeny little pincher, you know, to get a sample because if there&#x27;s anything organic in there that like the resin, but it&#x27;s on the sealed there&#x27;s this is seamless. There are no openings to this thing, the sealed um interior. That might give us another indication of its age. For all we know, it&#x27;s older. Perhaps it was made earlier and that the this resin material around the periphery is periodically replaced.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m speculating. So, in terms of scientific rigor, I have some things I&#x27;d like to do. Those are all to be determined. I&#x27;m just saying where I want to go with it, if that makes sense, right? And if there are any scientists here who have other ideas, I&#x27;m all ears because this we&#x27;re in unchartered territory.</p>
<p>By the way, to my knowledge, this is the first time something like this has um fallen into the hands of a civilian and not had a special forces team obtain it and take it. Um the last night I was in Mexico City with Congressman Berles, um we got an alert from Haimey Mus that the uh where this is being kept, the bugosphere is in a vault. I&#x27;ve seen you walked me to it and it&#x27;s in an old bank building that has multiple locks and doors and vaults. There were two Federal armed police that showed up that Saturday night before we left who were trying to break in and steal it at gunpoint. And because I did an emergency alert um on Tik Tok, we have lost our Tik Tok channel cuz that went viral and two million people saw it within a few hours and we no longer have Tik Tok.</p>
<p>So anytime I put out something very critical, our social media gets taken down. Remember all the big tech companies are run by totalitarian fascists tied into the uh this whole criminal enterprise. All of them. every one of them. As they say, they all talk like hippies and act like Nazis.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all you need to know about the tech industry. Okay, so sorry. I will not mince words. I&#x27;m getting I&#x27;m too old and too tired to pussyoot around. So that that&#x27;s what that was.</p>
<p>So now we have a team, I can&#x27;t go too much into it, but very senior special forces uh intel folks that were working with us. So I handed off I said, &quot;Ha, get me a camera image of those faces.&quot; So through facial recognition and ran it through the system, we identified one of them as a narot terrorist working with the federal government on behalf of this global cartel that keeps UFO secrets, runs drugs, human traffics, does abductions, creates wars. It&#x27;s all integrated. It&#x27;s a transnational criminal organization, largest ever. It would make the Gambinos and the mafiosi look like quar boys and that&#x27;s who runs your planet right now.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, that is a fact. And we&#x27;re drilling down on that with law enforcement very heavily. But that&#x27;s how we got this guy identified. So we we&#x27;re, you know, know he is, but he&#x27;s tied into that. And remember, this is not unusual.</p>
<p>Um, in the in in Mexico and other countries and in our country, you have people who are um on the one hand, they have a badge or they have their CI officer or they&#x27;re a ufologist and they&#x27;re actually a knock nonofficial cover. They&#x27;re actually working on behalf of this criminal enterprise for specific, you know, tactical reasons or operational reasons. We know who they are and and that&#x27;s also been handed over. The people doing that in ufology have also been handed over to law enforcement uh [snorts] who are part of this criminal organization. And that would be almost everybody, virtually everybody.</p>
<p>There few exceptions. Um few exceptions. Not you, baby. You&#x27;re clean. You&#x27;re good to go, Kapala.</p>
<p>So um so that I think is just something to keep in mind that there was an attempt to steal this. So, you know, and I&#x27;m a little concerned, you know, I said, &quot;Ha, you&#x27;ve got to beef up security like tenfold around this thing.&quot; Um, so, and if I go down there with another public official with a group of scientists, you&#x27;re going to have to muscle up, you know, and he did. He he had good security for us. Um, uh, for all of us, he he&#x27;s exc he&#x27;s wonderful, wonderful man. Um, and known him for 30 years or more.</p>
<p>But, um, that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re going with this. So, it&#x27;s a very exciting development and actually uh we&#x27;re working on a documentary that will be the bug sphere activations with the subtitle disclosure past, present, and future what we know is coming. And it&#x27;s going to be all these new whistleblowers and all this, you know, stay tuned for that. We hope that can come out next year [snorts] some maybe in the spring. We&#x27;re going to have to crowdfund it and stuff, but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in work.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s in progress. Fun, huh? Maybe we can have a showing at at Gaia with it. So, uh, so the threeey atlas, I have to address this because it comes up every nanocond. Um, u, [laughter] how many of these slides are there? We have Okay, here you go. Uh, this is, uh, the threei atlas.</p>
<p>Um, and how many of these slides are there? I guess they&#x27;re Yeah. Here&#x27;s something I I did, you know, because every TV show and every network that blows up my phone and who who asked about the three Atlas says it&#x27;s an alien ship coming to attack us and recently someone here said there were millions of Draco reptilians on. I you know what does Jack Nicholson say? in a as good as it gets. Go sell crazy someplace else. We&#x27;re all stocked up here.</p>
<p>But [laughter] I love him. What a pig. Anyway, oh my god. In real life, apparently. So, but so I I thought, okay, look, I&#x27;m getting fed up with this stuff.</p>
<p>is this Avi lobe character at Harvard. He&#x27;s of the same pedigree, if you will, of Donald Mensel. Who who who knows who Donald Mensel is? Raise your hand. I&#x27;m just curious. Oh, we have a lot of work.</p>
<p>So, go into the disclosure project intelligence archive, dpiarchchive.com. It&#x27;s uh terabytes of data and 35 years of research and hundreds of top secret whistleblower testimony and videotapes and images and top secret documents. Thousands all in there for you to peruse. We spent half a million dollars creating it. It&#x27;s free.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s for you to use. Have at it. It take you two or three years to get through it, but you can search it. Soon we&#x27;re paying about $20,000 to have a customized AI search capability put on it. So you could put in like Donald Mensel and all the stuff that would come up or write Patterson Air Force Base, everything that would come up.</p>
<p>Cool, huh? So that&#x27;s a work in progress. We have to have it finished by the end of the year if we&#x27;re lucky. So it&#x27;s a very technically complex thing to interface with the internet and a website and a database archive, right? It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot of programming. Um, which I don&#x27;t understand. I don&#x27;t pretend to understand.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a medical doctor, not a tech guy. But um we&#x27;re working on that. But as it is now, you can search and you and there are categories. I think there are 13 categories of uh sections of the archive and you can go through them. But in there in this documents of CIA documents, there&#x27;s one from the 50s that names Dr.</p>
<p>Mensel at Harvard who was astrophysicist who was on the payroll of the CIA. And this is typical of what people like Avi Lo and others are asked to do. So you&#x27;re paid because I look I got a $2 billion offer in 1992 by the head of army intelligence. You know if you&#x27;re high value enough they&#x27;ll give you two billion. What would $2 billion be in 90 199 right now? It&#x27;d be a lot of money.</p>
<p>Two billion is a lot. Two billion in 1992 probably five. I don&#x27;t know. So, I turned it down because I&#x27;m not going to be bought by fascists. I said, &quot;No, gracias.</p>
<p>Adios. Vamos. Out the door you go now.&quot; Um, but [snorts] that&#x27;s a serious offer, too, by the way. Two billion dollars to corrupt me. But over time, they will find people with the right credentials to gaslight the media, the government, and you, the public, and they&#x27;re on the payroll.</p>
<p>So Alvi Lobe uh has been making big stink about this uh always with a xenophobic alien invasion sort of undercurrent right fear terror that&#x27;s the whole game from 1950s to now that&#x27;s been the plan so short hand for you in the 1950s it was decided that and I have a document from the CIA written by the director of the CIA Smith and he said the UFO subject has great great value for its quote psychological warfare value. This thing is a scop now and psychological warfare psychological warfare operations a scop. I&#x27;ll just shorthand it. Okay, so it&#x27;s simpler to say. And when Donald Minsel was doing this, literally they engaged him to be the debunker who said, &quot;Oh, they&#x27;re none of these UFOs are true.&quot; And he even engaged, it says in the CIA document, you can read it.</p>
<p>This is an uncontested bonafide CIA document. Yeah. He would engage amateur astronomers to throw pie plates up, right? Like a metal frisbee type thing, take a picture of it, release it, and everybody, there&#x27;s a flying saucer. And then they would come out and say, &quot;No, that was a pie plate I threw up.&quot; So they could debunk it. See, do you know this? Look it up.</p>
<p>Donald Mensel, Dr. Doc, Donald Mensel. It was a shill for these fascists and this these totalitarian superstate guys. Um, and that&#x27;s true of ufology today. And so that is what happened.</p>
<p>and Avi Loe is asking for $1 billion from our government to create a planetary defense system against the marauding aliens that are coming. It&#x27;s all about money, power, fear, control. Now, if you want to control 8 billion people and not just one country here and there through war and terror or religious demagoguery, you got to create an existential threat that ain&#x27;t just another country. It&#x27;s got to come from out there. And this is what Verer von Brown said to Carol Rosen back in 1974.</p>
<p>He says, &quot;The whole plan is to let this roll at at a certain time. We&#x27;ll roll it out and present it as an alien threat to wait. We can unite the world around a militaristic totalitarian superstate. That&#x27;s where we&#x27;re headed if we&#x27;re not careful.&quot; In fact, we&#x27;re virtually there. And I say this as a warning only because those of us who are not uh if you&#x27;re not vigilant it happens is what Eisenhower said.</p>
<p>Only an informed citizenry can avert this and that means you guys all of us uh in collective consciousness and in our meditation and prayer but also in our actions with our government leaders which I I have to do all the time. Um, and I&#x27;m sure you all saw her at the National Press Club and we &gt;&gt; we have to prevent the weaponization of space because there is a lie being told to everyone that the weaponization of space is now first being based upon the evil empire, the Russians. Then there would be terrorists. Then there would be third world countries. Now we call them rogue nations or nations of concern.</p>
<p>Then there would be asteroids. And then he would repeat to me over and over and the last card, the last card, the last card would be the extraterrestrial threat. And so here we are. That was said 50 years ago to Carol Rosen, dear friend of mine. And now we&#x27;re at that point.</p>
<p>So uh we cannot let the buffoonery of of this subject overtake the truth. Um, so this whole atlas, three atlas, um, if we go back to that card, look at this for a moment. So it&#x27;s 137,000 mph. the closest star system. And this was said by Avi Lobo at one point at Harvard.</p>
<p>Well, it may have picked up our early electromagnetic signals coming from the Earth during the late 1800s, early 20th century and then they came to get us because they saw that we had electromagnet. So, keep in mind electromagnetic signals go at the speed of light, right? 186,000 miles per second. A lightyear is the distance it takes light to go at 186,000 miles every second for a whole year. Every second is 186,000 miles for a year. The closest star system, which is a red dwarf, not very viable, is Proxima Centauri.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s 2.4 light years away. Now, at 137,000 miles [snorts] per hour, it would take 66,500 years for that object loaded with Draco reptilians. Nonetheless, to arrive here now, I&#x27;m sorry, but it&#x27;s like that what Foxworthy said, I can&#x27;t fix stupid. Now, uh, that comedian, to be honest with you, it&#x27;s appalling that an academic at Harvard could put forth such a theory without me being able to bring out these calculations I I did on here. Huh? Yeah.</p>
<p>Right. I&#x27;m not a PhD astrophysicist at Harvard. We&#x27;re so impressed. No, we&#x27;re not impressed. Um, and uh, frankly, it&#x27;s time for us to start calling out this buffoonery for what it is.</p>
<p>It is fear-mongering. It is sewing the seeds of, and this is what happened with the drones last year, and I&#x27;ve said this to the White House and congressional people, that was a SCOP because we had some highv value people who were going to release the definitive videos and documents from the crash retrieval operations out west. Um but they got cold feet and were stood down and threatened. But uh and I also learned that there had been a meeting in a skiff, a secure compartment information facility where the head of the wet works for one of these aerospace corporations was openly talking about killing them and their families. So that didn&#x27;t happen.</p>
<p>Uh now that&#x27;s also been turned over to law enforcement. They&#x27;re fully aware of what happened with that. Um because you all heard me say this is supposed to come out before the inauguration and that&#x27;s what they were going to do. It didn&#x27;t. And here&#x27;s why.</p>
<p>Thuggery. More thuggery. Now, I get threats all the time. I just say buzz off. Actually, I don&#x27;t say buzz off.</p>
<p>I say something else. But uh but [laughter] but that&#x27;s me, you know, because I&#x27;m just that kind of person. Um nice until not nice and then I&#x27;m going to run you right over. But uh I think that I&#x27;m certainly not going to put up with threats. Uh I&#x27;ve been receiving those since 1991.</p>
<p>And I think the people who do want to come forward though, this is why we need to protect them. And this also why they need to have federal law enforcement interrogate them and compel them to produce all this information, which they have. And these are people in my team I know very well. Mr. Herrera knows who some of these people are.</p>
<p>and he&#x27;s gotten embedded with them with me. Um, so we are working very hard to get that done. But in the meanwhile, there&#x27;s this sort of open field for the charlatans and the disinformation operatives to scare everyone and prepare people to believe there is this existential threat coming from space. Why? So we give up our freedoms, we give up our peace, we give up our rights and we become a vassal states of a global super system not based on universal peace which we&#x27;re advocating for and the oneness of humanity and the oneness of life in the universe but in fear and war diametrically opposite of what the disclosure project and the C5 contact ambassador program is for. But this has been a 70-year plan and we didn&#x27;t start this program till 35 years ago um in 1990.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;re behind the curve. But you guys can make the difference. I believe that individuals working together can overwhelm the most evil forces on earth, right? And that&#x27;s what we have to do. That&#x27;s it. [applause] And so next Yeah.</p>
<p>Whoop. So, I&#x27;d like this. Um, I blacked out some of this information. I know it&#x27;s hard for you to read, but if you look in our archive, but also you can get the new briefing document. For the first time in 30 30 years or 30 32 years since I briefed the CI director in the Clinton administration, we have published the president&#x27;s briefing document.</p>
<p>You can get it. Um, I presume you all have the QR code for that. If not, it will they can get it to you. It&#x27;s on our website, drstephvenguru.com. It has some information redacted, obviously, if there are names of assets that have to be protected and some specific tactical plans, meaning plans for a strike team to take down these uh illegal black sites around the world, both US and Okonus outside continental United States.</p>
<p>That plan has been developed and the assets who can do it have been briefed by by me and our team and that is ready to as soon as someone hits the go button they&#x27;ll go. Okay, it is all ready but it has to get a go at you know the level the president. So, uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where that is. But, uh this is something that just shows what the myths have been, right? And the myths are obvious. Most of what you have learned in retail internet-based ufology.</p>
<p>So, for example, there are the good and the bad aliens who are waring in space. Okay. Shall we unpack that a little bit? Now I hate to sound Spockian, but does everyone know what a thermonuclear weapon is? A hydrogen bomb. Right? So even with that level of technology which is circa 1952 a full exchange of a thermonuclear war would leave the entire earth uninhabitable and would be an extinction level event right now let&#x27;s extrapolate civilizations that are interstellar and transdimensional I call it tdis transdimensional interstellar this means that they can go from one star system to another nonlinearly by tra traversing various dimensions at beyond the speed of light because they drop out of linear spaceime like a quantum entanglement or teleportation but on a macro scale the whole craft and everyone on it. Now, that level of technological capability that&#x27;s at that foundational level of space-time matter, that capability weaponized creates a quantum entangled weapon that would one exchange targeting a planet would terminate the planet, turn it into a mist floating through space.</p>
<p>So, the idea that you&#x27;re going to get out of your solar system and be cowboys and Indians, boom, boom, boom, boom. Great movies, sells a lot of tickets to things like this, sells a lot of books, makes Hollywood rich, billion, billions, and billions on Independence Day and Star Wars and Star Trek and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, horseshit. So the the problem with it is it&#x27;s devoid of any scientific acuity or even common sense. You&#x27;re not going to be able to behave that way and be interstellar. If you&#x27;re of that consciousness and are at that level of social and spiritual primitiveness, which most humans are and our planet is, unfortunately, you&#x27;re at a level one.</p>
<p>So you&#x27;re at a level zero civilization. We&#x27;re going to go through this this weekend. Meaning that&#x27;s what Mijuak is over a level zero, which means we&#x27;re not at peace. We&#x27;re cannibalizing our planet. We don&#x27;t have a stable high-tech [clears throat] society that&#x27;s living in harmony with Gaia.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s a level zero. Now, we need to get to a level 2, three, four, five very quickly. We&#x27;ll go through these and how we get there. But it&#x27;s important for you to understand that so much of the mythology of ufology was created through the psychological warfare division of the CIA starting in the 50s. And that includes animal mutilations, abductions, these are all human programs.</p>
<p>Um the threats from outer space, the myth of the good and the bad ali. You also notice that the good aliens always look like they&#x27;re from Norway. [laughter] They&#x27;re white, have blonde hair, nice breasts. [laughter] Right. Right.</p>
<p>Look at the mythology. It&#x27;s interstellar racism. It&#x27;s speciesism. It&#x27;s a what? It&#x27;s an anthropocentric projection of our own racist roots onto this subject and has been exploited by psychological warfare experts and in linguistics at the CIA and they are masters of it and almost everyone has bought it hook line and sinker dangerous extremely dangerous because this is how you end up in an interplanetary war. This is how you end up in an end of the world situation.</p>
<p>An esquetological esquetology is the study of how the world would end. This is how you end up without a planet. So this is serious stuff and people have to begin to be rational and operate on a higher spiritual and intellectual level or we are done my friends. And I&#x27;m not talking in 30 50 years. I mean in 6 to 24 months.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a very short timeline we&#x27;re looking at now. So all of these all of these are, you know, these are all the the premises of of of it all. You have there there&#x27;s the alien hybrid experiments and then you know the whole uh things about aliens. I want to talk about this. The aliens are demons and agents of Satan and [laughter] you know the the the things that the uh you know just on and on and on and we break it down who the primary purveyors are.</p>
<p>I blacked it out. Uh, but this was for the president and his national security team and members of Congress. So, [laughter] because they don&#x27;t know anything, you know, the problem is you think, oh, well, you know, no, I mean, they&#x27;re startnet, is there such a thing as a UFO? I go, uh, yeah, okay. [snorts] So, [laughter] so you&#x27;re starting there, but as soon as they Google the subject, 99% of everything you Google on the subject is preposition disinformation. and my stuff keeps getting put down in the search engines or taken out completely.</p>
<p>We just have our platform Tik Tok eliminated, right? So, if you&#x27;re actually speaking the truth, you get relegated and banned. If you&#x27;re telling the myths, you&#x27;re going to be on 60 Minutes like Louisando, right? So, and that is a fact, you know, because the truth is dangerous to this group. It&#x27;s very dangerous to this group and they have the power. They control the corporations. They control the media.</p>
<p>All of it. So, um, Black Rockck, uh, is a CIA asset that controls much of this, by the way. Yep. One the it&#x27;s the biggest multi-t trillion dollar asset manager in the world, but sad to say. So, these have to be put to bed if you&#x27;re going to have a serious conversation at a national security and law enforcement level and governance.</p>
<p>not here only but overseas as well because I&#x27;m doing this globally. Um so it&#x27;s a singularly daunting task because you have to take someone from do UFOs exist to this very advanced information and then unpack all the embedded disinformation that gets attached to it. Now the best way for disinformation to work is to attach it to truth. So I liken this to the poison pill phenomenon that you know the outside of it is sweet looks yummy inside is your kill is the dis disinformation embedded and that is how they operate and they have key people with credentials academic national security military who are corrupted frankly and who then pervey this is what with a lobe doing it Donald Mel did it Carl Sean did Two of Carl Sean&#x27;s best friends were on my team, George Fennel and James Melany, very famous astronomers, and they witnessed him being purchased by the intelligence community to say what he said about UFOs. And they did it by bribing him and blackmailing him.</p>
<p>So almost all of us get either we get blackmailed and threatened and then we also get an inducement. So a carrot and a stick. And what happened to poor poor Carl Sean is that they had some found some improprieties in his PhD thesis and academic work and they said you&#x27;re going to either be an operative for us or you&#x27;re going to be a janitor at Cornell. You want to be a janitor or you want to be rich and famous. Now you choose.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s how it works. Now, I only know that everything I&#x27;m telling you is based on firsthand knowledge, not googling conspiracy theories off the internet. And I think it&#x27;s important for you to understand as we become come out of childhood&#x27;s end here on this subject, how seriously embedded and brainwashed the populace is on this subject to be oriented towards war and conflict with nonhuman intelligence. Next. So we have over 750 military and uh corporate and government whistleblowers and we have 150 plus black sites where these operations have taken place and some are that are currently there is a top tier of them.</p>
<p>These have all been handed over to federal law enforcement and to the White House and Congress. Uh, it is in the archive. If you want to look at each one of these and study them, all you have to do is go to that section of the archive. I did this in part because everyone thinks I&#x27;m going to drop dead soon. So, um, [laughter] he&#x27;ll have to take they&#x27;ll have to take over.</p>
<p>God bless you. Um, next and here&#x27;s a map of them. Um, now [snorts] when you look at this, some of these are incidental facilities. In other words, an event happened or a craft was downed and they had to build a sk underground skiff uh like in in uh uh Fort Cell, Oklahoma. It&#x27;s not a primary site like the Dougway proving grounds or Edwards Air Force Base Complex or uh Wright Patterson or the Nellis Air Force Base or the Nevada Test Range.</p>
<p>But there&#x27;s assets there. So based on debriefing hundreds of these whistleblowers I have accumulated from whoever had a compartmented clearance to any of them. We would take that information reference it and created this right now. So this is a great tactical value to national security and to law enforcement and to the Pentagon because believe it or not the majority of people in the Pentagon CIA don&#x27;t know about this subject. It&#x27;s highly compartmented.</p>
<p>The presidents certainly don&#x27;t have full information and Congress less so. Uh the only exceptions are the people who are corrupt parties to this who are actually a knock a non-official cover. So by day they&#x27;re a congressman in reality they&#x27;re on the payroll of this cabal. Okay that&#x27;s how it works. And um so but this is a very useful tool.</p>
<p>Next and it goes global. We now I will admit that our knowledge of of Okonus outside contin United States is how it&#x27;s called military okonis is much thinner than us. So um but we do have some assets and that have provided details of places around the world. I&#x27;d say of all these one of the most important one is down there in Pine Gap in the center of Australia on the bottom right you&#x27;ll see. And um I I did meet with the minister of defense of Australia some years ago.</p>
<p>Um, it was the year Sirius came out, you know, the movie Sirius, uh, in 2013. And he had no knowledge of operations dealing with the UFOs in in Pine Gap, but we did. And I have people that I&#x27;ve debriefed who&#x27;ve worked there. There&#x27;s a big facility underground there where they&#x27;re manufacturing the aliens. You know what you folks call aliens? The grays and the little things and the creepy things.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re making them. I know the physic one of the physicists who worked in there. They&#x27;re nanobiio technology life forms there. Some of them are just robotic ones, but they&#x27;re really cool ones are biological and they have a neural cortex, but they have integrated circuits in them and those are man-made. The dulce complex is also another one where they&#x27;re making those and they fool anyone.</p>
<p>I mean 100% of folks would be thinking it&#x27;s a real extraterrestri. So, whatever you think we have technologically, multiply a thousandfold. And that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to unpack this weekend because you need to know what we humans have, but they&#x27;re in the hands of some very dark folks who can stage every manner of frightening thing, you know. So, think of uh the global terror of 9/11 or the global terror of COVID times a thousand. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re capable of.</p>
<p>And that people call false flag. Uh some people call it project blue beam. I haven&#x27;t been read into that particular code word program. Uh I know other programs and I know what their technologies are. We know the full scale of the technologies which some people don&#x27;t want to hear but I think you need to know what they are and we&#x27;re going to go through those.</p>
<p>Um next. Now this is about two years ago almost exactly. Um, I was asked to go out and meet with a covert team of operators at these black sites out in the Mojave Desert. So, the Edwards complex, Edwards Air Force Base out in the high desert is in a big they&#x27;re dry lake beds. That&#x27;s where Gordon Cooper had the film The UFO that landed.</p>
<p>And I knew Gordon. He and I did a presentation in DC together years ago. Um and so this man had reached out to me a few years ago um who was a u operator uh Delta Force guy but operating as a knock. He he was actually joint special operations command out of Fort Bragg but he was a nonofficial cover as a contractor for aerospace companies. Um this particular facility you&#x27;re looking at is the Lockheed Skunk Works test range and uh Mr.</p>
<p>Herrera has also been there in this same gentleman&#x27;s chopper, I believe. Um, as have some other people I pulled in who are uh special forces guys who are working with us. Now, what you&#x27;re looking at here on the right is the entry, one of the entry points where you go underground. Um, and these uh are where they&#x27;re testing the man-made UFOs. So you have circular ones, spheres, discs, octagons.</p>
<p>These are made by the Loheed skunk works. They&#x27;re anti-gravity. They can go from hover to over the horizon like a spark off a flying wheel in one or two seconds. Man-made. Now, the president and the national security teams in Congress when I first started meeting with those folks had no knowledge of this.</p>
<p>None. Now they do. So, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s they&#x27;re all having, excuse my language, the special forces guys talk like this. They&#x27;re all having an oh moment right now in the last year or so because they&#x27;re really realizing what I&#x27;ve been saying for 30 years. I knew about this place 30 years ago is true.</p>
<p>Uh but it means it&#x27;s the end of the world as they know it in terms of what they think the national security threats are. And u so this facility on the left you&#x27;ll see what looks like a triangle that&#x27;s not has a couple purposes. It&#x27;s also a elevator that can go down and craft can come up because everything&#x27;s underground. It&#x27;s like very complex underground facility. And when they come up and they&#x27;ll be placed at different distances from uh these electromagnetic pulse generators and other directional energy weapons to hit them to see if they&#x27;re hardened and ready to go out and be operational.</p>
<p>Now these are human craft. Do we have another? It shows Yeah, look at the creepy things. Then that looked like a menacing thing on the right. I took these when I was flying in on the chopper. So I was in the lefthand seat.</p>
<p>the pilot, the operator was in the right and then I had a special forces senior guy in in the back. Um, [clears throat] and about two weeks after this, I was almost killed as you know in a terrible accident because I gave this to the Senate Intelligence Committee and there were people not happy about that. Um, I did it anyway. Do it anyway. Don&#x27;t care about that.</p>
<p>Um, do the right thing regardless. So these are also used to target and down extraterrestrial vehicles. So I was told by these operators that one or two of the uh ET craft are downed every year at each of these sites. I&#x27;m going to show another one in a minute. So this is the Lockheed range test range RCS.</p>
<p>And then there&#x27;s the Tahhan north of Grumman and T E J O N to the north. So if you can visualize Edwards would be here to the south out here is the Lockheed skunk works range and up here going north would be the north or Grman Tahhan range. So we&#x27;ve mapped out all these and this has all been handed off in granular detail up to and including the entry points. Where do you go in? Now what&#x27;s under there? Well, we know what&#x27;s under there. So, the just remember one thing.</p>
<p>Nothing important is on the surface of the earth. It&#x27;s under the earth or it&#x27;s in space. Uh and the uh even if there&#x27;s something important on the surface, it has a redundancy subterranean. And these are called stiffs or dumb subterranean facilities or deep underground military bases. Um and we have a whole map of those.</p>
<p>Um we know the corporations that have been building them. and where they&#x27;re keeping in the vault those plants. So the you have Becktail Corporation and you have hit construction and a few others. The way they&#x27;re built uh we have this in our archive you&#x27;ll see uh is 1960s they came up and patented a nuclearpowered tunneling machine huge and it would create such hu heat that it would go all through bedrock and turn it to glass. these really beautiful glassified rock, you know, tunnels huge and rooms and it moves at a certain speed.</p>
<p>So they&#x27;re it&#x27;s and they can seal off water and this sort of thing. So that has been used since the uh at least the 60s uh where they moved away from just shovels and grinding something out, right? To a nuclear. And of course, that ain&#x27;t nice cuz if you&#x27;re going under somebody&#x27;s house or out in a remote area, but crossing a town deep underneath, you got a nuclear thing under there, right? This is why it&#x27;s so secret. They don&#x27;t want the public to know they&#x27;re using this. But I know who&#x27;s using it, where they&#x27;ve used it, and what they built.</p>
<p>And these are really key facilities that are all through the West, all over the United States, um, and other countries. But that technology is known and we actually have the patent for for that machine that we were able to obtain that was sequestered and and then has been used in these covert programs. So remember that when you go to these places, you&#x27;re going to see very little on the surface. Everything importance underneath. Now, the reason that&#x27;s important tactically if you&#x27;re going to stand up a strike team to to stop these murderous things from happening because they are not only killing ETSs, they&#x27;re killing humans.</p>
<p>So, one of the things we learned, and the operator, this special forces guy wept as he said this to us, is that if they put up a temporary flight restriction over that area and a civilian aircraft doesn&#x27;t notice or just goes in it, they take that civilian aircraft down. There wouldn&#x27;t be a jet line. It would be like a Learjet or King Air or private Cessna or private plane. They then take the remains, they call them biologicals, the human remains, and the craft and incinerator or turn it through some process into powder and there&#x27;s no trace. And then through a cutout, they issue a missing person report that someone vanished in flight.</p>
<p>So if you look up all the vanished aircraft and people, not all of them, some just crash in remote areas, but the ones near anything like this and we&#x27;re mapping those, the FAA a met with a member of Congress is deals with FAA. I said this is a serious thing. So I tell everyone who&#x27;s private pilot, you see a TFR up around an area that has a military significance, you go way around, go 50 miles around because sometimes even when they if you don&#x27;t cross into it, the beam, this electromagnetic pulse beam that hits the ET craft will go outside bigger than they thought. It&#x27;s not that precise and it&#x27;ll hit a totally innocent aircraft. So now we&#x27;re talking mass murder.</p>
<p>Many people have been murdered and this has also been handed over to law enforcement. All right. Uh, next. Y&#x27;all glad you came yet? So, now look, we could go on and on with this. I think one of the one of the uh things you want to understand is that when we&#x27;re dealing with this, we have to same time pivot to uh you have to uncover this rock and you have to deal with it head on.</p>
<p>Nice thing about being a trauma and emergency doctor, whatever came in, I dealt with it, you know, my whole life. I just that&#x27;s how I am. uh it&#x27;s very difficult because you have I call it I I found with many uh officials in the government um they have disclosure PTSD it&#x27;s traumatic and they when when this get goes out of theoretical discussions to something this real and with group of people that have way more power than the constitutional government of this or any other country because of the technology they possess. So, I want to just We only have about 8 minutes left, but I want you to just think about this. You&#x27;re the key member of Congress&#x27;s oversight committees and Senate intelligence and whatnot, or you&#x27;re the president and the national security adviser, director of national intelligence, whatever, FBI director.</p>
<p>This lands on your desk courtesy of yours truly. proven though with a team of people who are now special forces guys that we are sending out that are confirming and bringing in more and more assets and more and more confirmation of all this. What are you going to do? Right? So, one of the problems is holding that together psychologically so that there can be a plan of action and you can do something about it. Uh I know that there are some key people who have backed off because they&#x27;re afraid of the them and their families being killed. Very if I said the name you would know the name key people.</p>
<p>Um and so [clears throat] that&#x27;s a big problem. You know uh it&#x27;s well known that both Robert Kennedy and President Kennedy, Jack Kennedy were killed over this issue because they were pushing on it. So I think that one of the the things that happens and this is true also in other countries. I recently was uh over on the other side of the pond and I was in Great Britain and I learned that there was a prime minister who I won&#x27;t name but I know who he is who when he was starting to dig into this they threatened to kill him and his entire family and children if he didn&#x27;t back off. True.</p>
<p>So now that thuggery is kind of what runs things. I know the first time about four years ago almost I was asked to go into the Senate Intelligence Committee to brief the senior investigator be the equivalent of a threear general if he was still in the military uh on behalf he held the portfolio overseeing CIA NSA NRO and he was the point person for the Senate Intelligence Committee to drill down on this. Right. Well, I go in there and of course you&#x27;re in a skiff secure compartment information so you give up all your electronics and all that and [snorts] it was a we planned to do it on a Sunday so it&#x27; be very few people around because I&#x27;m recognizable. Um, unfortunately this is why I get I can&#x27;t go many places.</p>
<p>I need a I need a costume artist. Make me up as I could be in drag. Like in the bird cage with Jean Hackman. No, I&#x27;m just kidding. Hideous, huh? Um I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be a very good drag queen.</p>
<p>Uh but hey, how you doing? Anyway, &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; um we have fun. So if you don&#x27;t have fun, you&#x27;re gonna eat your gun. That&#x27;s it. Um that&#x27;s true with what I&#x27;m doing. So [laughter] if I go a little like that, it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s my compensation mechanism to have fun and laugh.</p>
<p>Uh but it was soul shaking and I can&#x27;t say who he is. Uh but you know he answered directly to the chairs of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. So um I he said what do you have? I said we have everything. He said what do you mean everything? I said, &#x27;We have almost a thousand whistleblowers. We know where all the black sites are.</p>
<p>We know all all the companies doing this. We can give you the list. We know where their plants are, their facilities are. We know where many of the underground access points are. He said, &quot;What underground access points?&quot; He didn&#x27;t know there were underground bases, right? So someone even at that level and you can take that to the executive branch and the White House and national security, that&#x27;s where they are.</p>
<p>you you you cannot assume they know anything about this of any consequence. And so what we have to do compassionately is to bring them from where their knowledge is. Neutralize the false mythologies that we had up there because that&#x27;s a lot of junk that they would just Google. Um if you Google it, it&#x27;s rubbish. If it&#x27;s in Wikipedia, it&#x27;s rubbish.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all rubbish. if it&#x27;s on this subject is a completely falsified information and sanitized uh absolute fact. I hate to disabuse you of your love affair with your digital devices. Um but an AI will do nothing but put that supercharged aggregate more disinformation together. Garbage in, garbage out, right? So [snorts] at any rate, that&#x27;s why we want our whole archive AI digitized so then you can find everything uh firsthand stuff, right? I&#x27;m not doing I&#x27;m not everything I put out there is from direct knowledge.</p>
<p>All right, direct firsthand with people who corroborate it in military and corporate national security. However, if you look at this whole procedure, you have to then start at zero pretty much with every member of Congress, every president, every president&#x27;s national security staff, the whole changing of the guard that happens every two to four years, right? which is daunting. I&#x27;ve been doing this since I briefed the CI director for Bill Clinton in December 1993. So, it&#x27;s 32 years of this press, you know, it&#x27;s like rewind, press, play, rewind, play. But it&#x27;s evolved.</p>
<p>So, we have more and more information. And in in in Mr. Clinton&#x27;s President Clinton&#x27;s defense, we did learn from these operators out west uh that one of them had been part of Team Red. Team red was Clinton&#x27;s attempt to stand up a strike team to get this team black, the illegal programs on UFOs under control. And of course, team blue that was just the regular military.</p>
<p>But team red was either all killed or they were the ones that survived were brought into team black. But now 30 years later, they&#x27;re defecting over. We&#x27;ve created enough of a pathway through law enforcement and protection. We also have in place the ability to hand them also if they&#x27;re been involved in direct criminal activity to get immunity. All right? So, anyone out listening who has is or knows someone who is at status, they should talk to me privately because we can do that.</p>
<p>Um, and then you know, you have to then create a plan of action. Okay, once you know all this, now what? Right? And that&#x27;s the hard part because it&#x27;s enough. It&#x27;s a very steep hill to climb to master all the knowledge of this and the detail of it and the complexity Byzantine. You know what&#x27;s true, what isn&#x27;t, and all of that. Oops, I hit my And then how do you then fix the problem? Well, you got to fix it on a number of levels.</p>
<p>So information is one thing, but information isn&#x27;t going to stand down the criminal enterprises that are trafficking and children, abducting people. And remember, Jacqu Valet himself in a 1992 book admitted that he had a CIA document that stated point blank that the agency was committing alien abductions as a psychological warfare operation against peasants in Brazil and Argentina. This is a fact and it&#x27;s still going on. Did you hear about in was it Peru where the thing went around and looked like a skateboard and ripped off the faces? That was all human tech. We know the people who did it.</p>
<p>The SCOP around the time Grush and other people were coming out with stuff. So, you just have to we&#x27;re not going to be able to unpack we&#x27;ll unpack a lot of this weekend what the capabilities are, but what you need to look for. You know, what&#x27;s real and what isn&#x27;t. the real ETSs, they&#x27;d be closer to Christ than Gandhi to that. Um, they&#x27;re have no interest in committing those sort of crimes.</p>
<p>Uh, they are intent on protecting themselves from us and, uh, protecting the earth if they can in a long-term way, but there are only a few conditions where they&#x27;ll intervene, and we&#x27;ll talk about those conditions later. All right. So, thank you very much. We&#x27;ll see you. We have a little break here.</p>
