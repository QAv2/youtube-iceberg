            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>There&#x27;s a deeper program called the legacy program. Yeah. That has really seems to have been trying to hide the most &gt;&gt; shocking pieces of what we know from even the UAP task force. Um we&#x27;ve had Louzando on this show and he talked to us about some of what we&#x27;d learned. This is years ago.</p>
<p>I mean, it was when we first launched the program in 2020, but here he is as part of the documentary uh Age of Disclosure speaking to what this legacy program has uncovered. I&#x27;m just going to run the ST 54 here. &gt;&gt; We discovered another deeply hidden and much larger UAP program. This program was so sensitive that it was withheld from the Secretary of Defense, Congress, and even the President of the United States. This program is referred to as the legacy program.</p>
<p>This program had been capturing, retrieving, and reverse engineering UAPs since at least 1947. On numerous occasions, these retrievalss included the bodies of nonhumans, some sort of intelligence, intelligent being that is not human. On numerous occasions, I mean, that is just stunning, David, to to like people who don&#x27;t follow this. He&#x27;s saying they found some sort of alien beings bodies along with the crafts that the government has had it for decades. It&#x27;s happened multiple times and that they&#x27;re all the whole theory of the the entire movie with all of these storied experts.</p>
<p>These are not crackpots. I mean, if they&#x27;re crackpots, boy, they found dozens of them who have been at the highest levels of our government um over generations who are all saying yes, this has happened. And the reason that that they keep it secret from everyone including they point out in the in the piece our own presidents over the over time is what? Well, it depends on the time epoch in which administration. Uh certainly there were former secretaries of defense uh and presidents that were briefed on this matter. um it depended on their level of trust that the you know the deep state if you will the lifers and the governments uh had with those said individuals and unfortunately this uh subject has been a victim of a lot of I&#x27;ll call it uh domestic information operations something I discussed initially publicly in 2023 and there&#x27;s certainly been this game of thrones activity with multiple factions of the deep state uh in a bipartisan manner uh the Republicans and the Democrats are both guilty.</p>
<p>Um, and even in a recent previous administration, in the Obama administration, there was certainly um actions taken uh strategically uh to help a particular uh presidential candidate uh possibly if if this um subject were to become normalized and they got elected president. So, there&#x27;s been a lot of gamesmanship and a lot of uh I&#x27;ll call it house of cards type type activities in the past. But it is true that a lot of people have been uh withheld. I found it deeply disgusting and shocking that even I was not fully accessed into these activities and I did have a congressionallymandated need to know. I investigated this on behalf of the first Trump administration and some of Trump&#x27;s cabinet members and and Senator Rubio when he was sen, you know, a senator, now Secretary Rubio.</p>
<p>And um providing my findings up the chain, uh I was just very disturbed uh to find uh how this was controlled, the self-licking ice cream cone, unaccountable. Everybody owns a piece. Nobody owns the outcome, and there&#x27;s not really a mob boss. The closest person we got that uh I was aware of was unfortunately now deceased Vice President Dick Cheney. Uh Darth Vader himself.</p>
<p>Not shocking that he was involved in this. And essentially when he left in 2009, that was the last time that these activities really had central leadership. &gt;&gt; Yeah. because the film posits that you know the the current and the last head of CIA probably don&#x27;t know but there&#x27;s like lower branches within the CIA that have specific responsibilities and the career employees there probably do and they don&#x27;t look at the political appointees brought in by a president as someone to whom they need to disclose anything they&#x27;re like this guy&#x27;s going to be gone in you know a year two years four at the most I&#x27;m not going to keep disclosing osing this to person after person. I&#x27;m keeping this very dark as my predecessor did.</p>
<p>And they all it also posits that when it&#x27;s super secret, they&#x27;ve been offloading the research to private contractors and that way they don&#x27;t have to include any of these disclosures in response to foyer requests made of the federal government because it&#x27;s been given to a private entity. But that too leads to no accountability and no no person over the life of you know 20 years who&#x27;s got real responsibility because companies get sold, new people come in and then these companies may just exploit the materials for the latest technological advantage. you know, who knows like I don&#x27;t know some AI development or some fast speed train development that a company may have used the information to build a commercial advantage with. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s totally true. you you actually accurately described how it is.</p>
<p>Uh early on the global war on terror, a lot of the money that was initially given to these companies was essentially reallocated uh for overseas contingency operations. And these contractors essentially uh started to do their own thing, if you will, something called Irad, internal research and development. And uh privately they continued certain things that actually the government was trying to cancel as it relates to the subject. and they went off um and retrieved and exploited things essentially on their own uh and only loosely accountable back uh to their government handlers. And it&#x27;s it&#x27;s funny you mentioned the CIA.</p>
<p>Um naturally there&#x27;s a lot of uh good men and women that work there. Uh my wife actually was a CIA officer and she also served in the Air Force with me. Um but uh Chairwoman Luna and the task force and the committee staff uh certainly I assisted in my other uh professional capacity um helping Representative Burlson&#x27;s office did send legal interrogatives uh to several agencies and private companies. CIA was one of them. Um and curiously enough, uh CIA provided what I considered extremely disrespectful response.</p>
<p>They declined to answer our interrogatives on this matter, which is their participation in crash retrieval operations and just referred us to the Pentagon&#x27;s Arrow office, which has a nebulous in a concerning history in itself. And I just find it very interesting that CIA uh did that. Now, I&#x27;m not saying John Rackcliffe or Michael Ellis, who&#x27;s the acting general counsel and deputy director, had a hand in that response. Uh but they certainly are the leaders of their organization. John Rackcliffe has spoke positively on this issue previously.</p>
<p>And I I would hope that John Rackcliffe was placed there uh by DNI Gabbard and the president to enact some reforms on the CIA. And unfortunately, the CIA has a lot of skeletons in its closets. Um other things I know about that I can&#x27;t talk about that are conventional national security issues. Uh but the crash retrieval issue unfortunately is is certainly one of them. And they&#x27;ve um done a lot of concerning things.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s being alleged by you and many others is that is that they have &gt;&gt; literal skeletons in their closet or whatever &gt;&gt; they do &gt;&gt; whatever&#x27;s inside an alien being. Uh because here&#x27;s it&#x27;s it sounds crazy to just throw it out there short form. Sounds crazy, but it person after person, distinguished scientist after uh intel person is making the same claim, validating the stories about Roswell telling other stories that have happened at um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s many military facilities with what appears to be a clear alien craft coming overhead, looking almost diamondlike in shape, being huge, sitting there hovering, coming from something like 80,000 ft and dropping down then hovering in in a way that no vehicle that we know of, right now could possibly do. Nothing invented by man. Um, here is a montage from the movie of top US officials talking about how all of this is relevant because it may pose a serious national security threat.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s S 42. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities and it&#x27;s not ours and we don&#x27;t know whose it is. That alone, just that statement alone deserves inquiry, deserves attention, deserves focus. &gt;&gt; If you have objects in the sky that you cannot identify, that&#x27;s a problem because it could be China, it could be Russia, it could be any adversary. &gt;&gt; Well, any any explained phenomenon could pose a national security threat.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Clapper, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s the way you have to treat those things. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s something violating our airspace. there&#x27;s something fouling our ranges that even the people we&#x27;ve tked in the executive branch to understand this cannot provide an explanation. So I would say in addition to the national security implications, this has implications for basic trust and confidence in the American government. &gt;&gt; I I just want to play one more.</p>
<p>Um, here we have a former Navy pilot describing the UAP&#x27;s defying extreme weather and physics in SOP 45. &gt;&gt; In 2014 to 2015, we were operating off the coast of Virginia Beach off the eastern seabboard. It was during this time that we upgraded our radar from the APG73 to the APG79 radar. And this allowed us to essentially see more objects we weren&#x27;t expecting to see. And there&#x27;s a particular case of one of these objects maintaining a complete stationary position inside of 120 kn winds.</p>
<p>Essentially inside of a hurricane going against the wind. The wind&#x27;s 120 knots west. So look at this thing. It&#x27;s rotating. &gt;&gt; It just seems like they&#x27;re not affected by the environment the way we are.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And there&#x27;s testimonial after testimonial like that. David, that that&#x27;s not unique to have an experienced fighter pilot like our our men and women in the military have been quietly coming forward and reporting on this for a long time only to be told, &quot;Keep your mouth shut.&quot; &gt;&gt; No, that&#x27;s true. And I I have Air Force pilot friends of mine that have seen um outstanding things while on duty to include uh glowing triangular craft uh you know, hovering above other aircraft cruising at you know 50,000 ft. And I did want to point out uh General Clapper, the former DNI in the documentary. Um I certainly applaud him for at least speaking out in general.</p>
<p>Um he goes on, I believe, I&#x27;ve only seen clips of Agent Disclosure, not the whole thing. Um where there was a program when he was the director of national intelligence, uh where they were tracking these vehicles over Area 51, of course, the famed, uh classified test location. And I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed as a fellow Air Force officer and certainly General Clapper ra rose to the ranks as three star general. Uh that&#x27;s all he said in the documentary that that was uh a program he was aware of. Uh in fact uh without being inappropriate I will say that General Clapper was well aware of the crash retrieval issue, managed the crash retrieval issue and when he was the DNI, USDI and DIA director, he placed people in critical roles uh to manage this issue.</p>
<p>uh both publicly and I&#x27;ll just say not uh non-publicly as well and I&#x27;ll allow the audience uh distill what I&#x27;m saying uh at the at the risk of being inappropriate or going too far with my uh discussion. So uh General Clapper, Stephanie Sullivan, other folks in the IC that are well aware of this issue that were in rooms discussing this issue. Um I ask you to be u greater leaders on this. I should not be the only former uh military officer and intelligence official uh that is uh being completely candid with the information that they were exposed to. So um perhaps &gt;&gt; once again James Clapper understates what he knows and what he&#x27;s done.</p>
