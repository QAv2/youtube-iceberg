            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this channel is dedicated to educational matters of the relatively esoteric and obscure um mostly people who are my heroes who put their whole life into something into a project into uncovering uh you know it&#x27;s coming closer and closer to the truth about things especially in terms of cosmologies or theories of everything but at the end of the day nobody really paid too much attention to their work and they&#x27;d uh didn&#x27;t um get famous they didn&#x27;t make any money and their theories didn&#x27;t really get out there very much one of the main people on that list for me is Mr Dewey B Larson and Mr Larson is the um author discoverer of the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory system of theory a Theory of Everything that um you can plug into any subject that you like Mr Larson wrote books on physics and astrophysics chemistry and astronomy and psychology religion metaphysics um including things like dream interpretation economics um and uh a few of his followers have uh written books on many other subjects as well the basic idea behind the reciprocal system of theory is that we live in a universe of motion not a universe of matter and not a universe of energy the fundamental component of the universe is motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time therefore are not are are not the container of the universe but they are the contents of the universe and space and time have a generalized reciprocal relationship uh basically motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator but time and space can come in one two three or even more dimensions that&#x27;s what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time and uh time and space can also have their progressing aspects Larson calls that clock space and clock time time on the clock is always getting later and later and later and later and so to uh space on the clock is always getting farther and farther and farther apart which you would Envision using a balloon and putting a couple dots on it with a magic marker all the dots are moving away from each other if you blow up the balloon if you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other this is uh respectively outward and inward scalar motions scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no Direction space and time also only come in discrete units there is one a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time that&#x27;s one unit and one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light which leaves the speed of light as the background or the origin of the universe whereas Einstein thought that the speed of light was the maximum speed of the universe in Larson&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe or the null point or the reference point the natural reference system of the universe and there there is an entire half of the universe that is actually moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls that the cosmic sector and then there is the half that we&#x27;re familiar with called the material sector that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light that&#x27;s the half that Einstein I understood when he said that nothing moves faster than the speed of light but in the cosmic sector nothing moves slower than the speed of light now this this Cosmic sector is a mystery uh or has been a mystery to us but with the reciprocal system because of the reciprocal postulate um we can extrapolate what we know about the material sector uh through all of our observations and measurements um the exact same thing is going on in the cosmic sector except that the roles of space and time are reversed so we actually know a great deal about the cosmic sector but we just don&#x27;t know it yet because we haven&#x27;t uh understood the reciprocal system now uh in Larson&#x27;s system there&#x27;s basically four different kinds of motion you have a translational motion you have a vibrational motion you have a rotational motion and you have a rotational vibration and these motions can uh occur in one two or three dimensions and they can combine with one another in certain combinations uh I guess the most uh understandable combination right off the bat are not understandable is uh the photon and the photon is a simple harmonic motion which is a wave-like motion Larson says that the simple harmonic motion is a combination of a translational motion and a vibrational motion 90 degrees apart from that and you combine the two and you get a sine wave sum of Larson&#x27;s followers have disagreed with that and said that this uh it is a result of the by rotation you combine two counter rotating motions and you also get a sine wave uh the sine wave uh of the uh by rotational model seems to answer more questions uh it seems to make more sense to me but we will go over the differences and compare those two uh different points later on in the development so right now we&#x27;re with Larson where he&#x27;s talking about the photon as a um as the uh vibration of a an already existing translational motion now you can combine these things even more so once you have the photon then you can rotate the photon in a number of different uh Dimensions uh in in a number of different directions and you eventually create subatomic particles and atoms and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking at right now um this is a Larson&#x27;s 1979 book called Nothing But motion and we are in chapter 10 of this book this book mainly covers physics and astrophysics all right sorry physics and organic chemistry and um we&#x27;re in chapter 10 called Adams he had just gotten done explaining kind of uh the noble gases of the periodic table and how they are an atom is really a uh in his notation is a three um three motion notation a dash B Dash C and A and B are both two-dimensional uh what he calls magnetic rotational motions and then C is a one-dimensional electric rotation and um the uh noble gases are the elements that have numbers for the first two A and B but the the C is a zero and the C the electric rotation is what fills in the gaps between the noble gases um and that&#x27;s about what he&#x27;s what he&#x27;s about to start talking about right here the number of mathematically possible combinations of rotations is greatly increased when electric displacement is added to these magnetic combinations but the combinations that can actually exist as elements are limited by probability considerations as noted in chapter nine the magnetic displacement is numerically less than the equivalent electric displacement and is more probable for this reason its status as the essential basic rotation also gives it precedence over the electric rotation any increment of displacement consequently adds to the magnetic rotation if possible rather than to the rotation in the electric Dimension this means that the role of the electric displacement is confined to filling in the intervals between the inert gas elements on this basis if all rotational displacement in the material system were positive the series of elements would start at the lowest possible magnetic combination helium which is 2-1-0 and the electric displacement would increase step by step and reach until it reached a total of two N squared units at which point the relative probabilities would result in a conversion of these two N squared electric units into one additional unit of magnetic displacement whereupon the building up of the electric displacement would be resumed this behavior is modified however by the fact that electric displacement in ordinary matter unlike magnetic displacement may be negative instead of positive the restrictions on the kinds of motions that can be combined do not apply to minor components of a system of motions of the same type such as rotations the new effective rotation of a material atom must be in space in order to give rise to those properties which are characteristic of ordinary matter it necessarily follows that the magnetic displacement which is the major component of the total must be positive but as long as the larger component is positive the system as a whole can meet the requirement that the net rotation must be in space positive displacement even if the smaller component the electric displacement is negative it is possible therefore to increase the net positive displacement a given amount either by direct addition of the required number of positive electric units or by adding a magnetic unit and then adjusting to the desired intermediate level by adding the appropriate number of negative units okay so um that you can kind of illustrate if you look at maybe the uh second line of the periodic table where you&#x27;re you&#x27;re going from helium up to Neon and so uh you know helium is two one zero so two one one helium is number two uh a element number two and then you add one and you get lithium you add another one to get beryllium and another one to get Boron so Boron is two one two one three the next element is carbon two one four but um he&#x27;s saying that then the next element nitrogen number seven uh you could say it would be two one five but more than likely statistically what it actually would be would be too too negative three um so you would go all the way up to Neon which is two two zero and you would subtract three from That Neon is number ten element 10. so then you would subtract 3 from that to get down to nitrogen so and same with carbon where carbon is two one four but carbon also has an alternate form that is two two negative four because it&#x27;s right in the middle there and uh the probabilities are approximately equal as to which one of those would form uh when you uh get up to nitrogen is more probable that it would take the negative that the third number would take a negative three then the positive five because small numbers are more probable than large numbers so uh you know to complete that then you would have oxygen as 2 2 negative two and fluorine as two two negative one and then you&#x27;re back up to the noble gas neon two two zero okay so that&#x27;s kind of what he&#x27;s saying there uh which of these Alternatives will actually Prevail is affected to a considerable degree by the conditions that exist in the atomic environment but in the absence of any bias due to the these conditions the determining factor is the size of the electric displacement lower displacement values being more probable than higher values in the first half of each group intermediate between two inner gas elements the electric displacement is minimized if the increase in atomic number equivalent electric displacement is accomplished by direct addition of positive displacement when N squared elements I&#x27;m sorry when N squared units have been added the probabilities are nearly equal and as the atomic number increases still further the alternate arrangement becomes more probable in the latter half of each group therefore the increase in atomic number is normally attained by adding one unit of magnetic displacement and then reducing to the required net total by adding negative electric displacement eliminating successive units of the ladder to move up the atomic series by reason of the availability of negative electric displacement as a component of the atomic rotation an element with a net displacement less than that of helium becomes possible adding one negative electric displacement to helium produces this element to one negative one which we identify as hydrogen and thereby in effect subtracting one positive electric unit from the equivalent two units above the rotational base that helium possesses hydrogen is the first in the ascending series of elements and we may therefore give it the atomic number one the atomic number of any other material element is its net equivalent electric displacement above helium two one zero we find lithium two one one beryllium 212 Boron two one three and carbon 214. since this is an eight atom group The probabilities are nearly even at this point and carbon can also exist as two too negative four the elements that follow move up the atomic series by reducing the negative displacements nitrogen to two negative three oxygen 2 2 negative two fluorine two two negative one and finally the next inert gas Neon another similar eight element group follows adding a second magnetic unit in the other magnetic dimension this carries the series up to another inner gas element Argon three two zero so you fill in the gaps there um you know so you start with two two zero Neon so then two two one is sodium 222 is magnesium two two three is aluminum two two four is silicon but silicon can also take the negative uh orientation um of two uh three to negative four um because 4 and negative 4 are the same magnitude so they have approximately the same probability and then um I would think it&#x27;s a slightly lower probability because the three number instead of the two number as the a the as the first number then you have phosphorus as 3 2 negative three three two negative two is sulfur three two negative one is chlorine and three two zero again is argon back to the noble gas uh inner gas at the end of the column so that&#x27;s kind of how the periodic table is constructed A Larson system you have a three number um grouping there the first two are the we have the primary magnetic rotation and then you have the secondary magnetic rotation and then the third number is optional but it is um the electric rotation and that third number is what fills in the gaps between the inner gas elements so uh uh at element number 18 argon the magnetic displacement has reached a level of two units above the rotational base and each of the magnetic dimensions in order to increase the rotation in either Dimension by an additional unit a total of two times three squared or 18 units of electric displacement are required this results in a group of 18 Elements which reaches the midpoint at Cobalt three two nine and terminates at Krypton three three zero a second 18 element group follows as indicated in this table that he has uh the final two groups of elements contain uh two times four to the second power or 32 members each the heaviest elements of the last group have not yet been observed as they are highly radioactive this is uh you know uh in Larson&#x27;s periodic table goes all the way up to number 118 or at least 117 but the ones that we&#x27;ve observed in the laboratory I think only go up to 105 or something like that um but he says that these other elements exist but they&#x27;re highly radioactive and constantly consequently unstable in the terrestrial environment okay we&#x27;ll leave it off there and start up again tomorrow thanks for tuning in and have a great day</p>
