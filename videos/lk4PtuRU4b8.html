            <p>hello and welcome to my channel this is a channel dedicated to uh education and uh we try to learn about um various theories of everything um also might want to put that as um you know the Magnum opuses of uh people you know who spent their whole life working on something and in general they never got any credit nobody ever uh knows their name or their theories um but at least I&#x27;ve found something valuable uh in their work uh through the research that I&#x27;ve done and I&#x27;m just trying to share these various uh theories of everything Magnum opuses uh cosmologies um just different All In compassing theories today is the 324th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory which uh among all these different cosmologies is probably my favorite so that&#x27;s probably why I&#x27;m focusing on it so so much uh and um the reciprocal system of theory was originated by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century up until his death in 1990 and uh about 60 years before that he had his first epiphanies about um the nature of this universe and uh took him about 30 years to work out the Kinks and uh put together his two fundamental postulates from which he um deduced a theoretical Universe basically How the Universe operates if if the postulates were were true and then uh wrote books based on those findings he&#x27;s got books on physics and chemistry and astronomy also he&#x27;s got works on economics and a lot of metaphysical subjects liberal art subjects including uh philosophy and religion and um psychology even a little bit of stuff on biology and uh some of his followers have even gone further a field into crypto archo astronomy and conspiracy theory and um um you know I guess uh various other occult subjects now the basic idea behind larsson&#x27;s theory is that we live in a universe made out of Mo motion it&#x27;s not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it&#x27;s made out of motion and for Larson motion was the relationship between space and time with the uh stipulations that space and time are basically identical to each other except that they are reciprocals of each other and they always come as a package deal there is uh you know no independent existence of either time or space they only exist together in motion you can think of motion as a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator and you can think of motion in a very broad sense Larson refers to this as scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but has no specific Direction uh which you could Envision using um a balloon with dots uh dots on it and uh you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other that&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but no specific Direction all the dots are moving away from all the other dots um so there&#x27;s no specific Direction it&#x27;s not a vector and um um both time and space have the same general qualities uh one being that they are coordinate meaning that they have three dimensions this is a blasphemy to uh many physicists out there who uh regard time as being one-dimensional but in Larson system um time has an aspect that is three-dimensional and time and space Also are progressing and this is rather um Blasphemous to the physicists out there who uh regard St space as being stationary U time they they reckon to be progressing time is always getting later and later and later um but in no specific Direction so it&#x27;s getting later in a scaler manner um but they normally don&#x27;t think of space as progressing don&#x27;t know why because the Hubble telescope way back almost 100 years ago identified that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other um that&#x27;s a scalar motion outward and um you know basically the only reason why we perceive space as being stationary is because we are in a gravitational field and gravity is the opposite d uh um motion as the progression or a progression an outward motion uh gravity is that inward scalar motion and uh when you are in a gravitational field the gravity cancels out the progression so it&#x27;s not until you have uh you&#x27;re talking about distant galaxies galaxies that are far away and gravity has attenuated that you can start to see the effects of the progression uh basically we see uh space close up and we see time far away and that&#x27;s why we see time progressing in a scalar manner um because we&#x27;re we&#x27;re seeing the very far away uh view of time whereas we&#x27;re seeing a close up view of space and so it appears to be um stationary there are other Vantage points in the Universe where it would be the opposite um and we&#x27;ll talk about that in just a moment then also space and time are quantized meaning that they come in um units they come in chunks you have to have a whole chunk before you have any space you have to have a whole chunk before you have any time and uh the chunks are very small but um you know on the level of of uh the atomic level they are significant and um if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light which Larson refers to is unit speed um 1 over 1 equal 1 and unit speed therefore is really like the background of this uh reciprocal system this Universe of motion um or you could call it the zero point The Ether the origin um the state of rest of this universe is moving outward at the speed of light in all directions um and that is uh Blasphemous to the uh Legacy scientist also who um you know they they make their measurements from zero you know from no motion we&#x27;re going to see how fast this is moving this is moving compared to um zero but in a reciprocal system uh that progression outward at the speed of light is the reference point so we measure our motion from that speed and half of the universe therefore is moving faster than the speed of light and half is moving slower and the scientists only recognize that half that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light that is what M Larson calls the material sector but he refers to this other sector that the Legacy scientists don&#x27;t know anything about as the cosmic sector and those two sectors are identical to one another except that they are reciprocals and you need to be able to Interchange the roles of space and time uh to move from one sector to the other so in the material sector as we said we see uh we see space close up space is stationary um three-dimensional coordinate and time is progressing so we see time far away and it&#x27;s progressing ing in a scaler manner it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later and later but if we crossed over into the cosmic sector we would see coordinate time we would see time up close and it would appear to be motionless um and then uh we would see space as progressing things are always getting farther and farther and farther apart and um so we would be seeing space far away and time up close if we were in The Cosmic sector and then there is um um two other boundaries so there&#x27;s really three major boundaries in the reciprocal system there&#x27;s this first one the unit speed boundary the speed of light boundary and that divides into the material sector and the Cosmic sector but then within the material sector we have what is called the unit space boundary if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you don&#x27;t have space that is the discrete unit postulate part of the first postulate of of the reciprocal system you have to have a full unit before you have anything so if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you don&#x27;t have space and if you don&#x27;t have space then you only have time and so in this realm of less than one unit of space and one unit of space is approximately I believe it&#x27;s like 500,000th of an inch and so if you&#x27;re dealing with less than that uh you don&#x27;t have space and so you are in this realm of only time Larson refers to this as the time region and the time region is really the realm of your atomic uh and molecular activity and also when you cross that boundary just like when you cross the speed of light boundary the rules reverse and you&#x27;re in this realm of time instead of being more in the realm of space and the same thing occurs over in the cosmic sector but with time within one unit of time now one unit of time is the incredibly brief period of 1.52 * 10- 16 seconds so you can fit uh 6576 quadrillion of those units within 1 second and um a quadrillion is basically a u a um a billion million and um or a million billion and uh within if you don&#x27;t have that full unit of time then you don&#x27;t have time by the discrete unit postulate and so you only have space so you&#x27;re in a realm of space only and if you&#x27;re in this realm of space only uh you are uh basically again dealing with what Larson calls Cosmic atoms and Cosmic molecules um these are referred to by the Legacy scientist as um antimatter and the Legacy scientists have come up with the number of different convoluted theories to explain this but uh Larson has something quite a bit more straightforward they&#x27;re just um normal matter but they&#x27;re in the cosmic sector and occasionally they come across into the material sector and interact with us but when they come across into the material sector sector they uh immediately start to Decay because they are unstable in this environment just like when we uh would cross the speed of light boundary and go into the cosmic sector um you know we would have trouble maintaining our stability okay now what we&#x27;re doing today is we are reading over uh the next portion of this paper that Larson wrote uh that is called the nature of time and uh we read the first installment of this yesterday so if you want to go back to the beginning of the paper you want to go back to and watch yesterday&#x27;s episode um but we will start here um he in the first part of the paper he basically just went through um and looked at um how Legacy science really has taken the time phenomena for granted and that they have not rigorously defined what time is and you know uh Newton he quoted Newton and Newton said you know time being onedimensional that being known to all or something like that you know it&#x27;s just like we&#x27;re just assuming that time is onedimensional everybody knows that um you know if you study Tree of Life or if you watch any of my tree of life videos that&#x27;s like eighth the eighth sphere it&#x27;s the consensus worldview everybody knows that so therefore we don&#x27;t have to um you know prove it or show it or demonstrate it or anything you just just you just have to assume that and Larson is showing how foolish that is uh here in the first part of the paper so now we&#x27;re moving to the second part here as a general proposition the superior majority of this approach is not open to serious question but a direct extrapolation does not appear feasible in this case as we have no positive knowledge as to what the properties of space and time actually are anywhere and consequently there is no adequate base from which to extrapolate all previous investigators have therefore relied upon assumptions some related ated to our rather vague General impressions of space and time others wholly conjectural not because they preferred to do so but because they felt that they had no option the method which I have employed to overcome the existing difficulties is to approach this question indirectly beginning with an examination of the relation between space and time this relation is one that has never been adequately explored here to for in the days of Newton its existence was not recognized at all the two entities being regarded as completely independent since then there has been a growing realization that they are not independent and that basically we must deal with space time not with space and time individually thus far however it does not appear to have been suspected that the existing concepts of the fundamental nature of space and time may be in error that time for instance may be actually something other than a unidirectional one valued one-dimensional Continuum and the hypotheses that have been Advanced as to the character of the space-time Rel a such as M minkowski&#x27;s concept of a four-dimensional Continuum have retained these basic assumptions and uh thus have simply applied speculation upon conjecture instead of starting with arbitrary assumptions the first move in the present investigation has been to extrapolate to the universe as a whole the relation between space and time which we find existing in the known region of the universe in this known region the relation between space and time is motion and in motion space and time are reciprocal reciprocally related uh now just think of the concept of speed uh the car is moving 15 miles an hour 15 miles of space in 1 hour of time space over time space space divided by time is speed so there we have a reciprocal relationship between space and time so he&#x27;s saying that that is the common uh understanding that we have of motion in this known region and so he&#x27;s saying that like you know in common knowledge space uh is reciprocally related to time in Motion in uh particularly in speed and uh so he&#x27;s saying that now I&#x27;m going to extrapolate what we know about this known region to these unknown regions of the universe and I&#x27;m just going to uh you know kind of use the hypothesis that space and time are reciprocals of one another uh in the whole universe because I know that they are in the known region okay and um this is not Sur or assumption nor is its accuracy in any way open to doubt it is positive Knowledge from which we can extrapolate irrespective of the nature of the properties of space and time individually the method of extrapolation leads directly to the conclusion that we should postulate a general reciprocal relation between space and time effective throughout the Universe of course any new Viewpoint that conflicts with long-standing beliefs concerning space and time no matter how firmly based it may be will seem strange and hardly credible on first consideration but nothing that we actually know about space or time is inconsistent with this reciprocal postulate the truth is that we know very little about either of these entities time quote or no sorry no quote time has always been mysterious and elusive but even space which seems so much more understandable has been a difficult problem for those who have sought to discover its true nature and no General agreement on this score has ever been reached to Aristotle space was merely a relationship between physical objects to democratus and his fellow atomists it was a container in which such objects exist to Einstein it was a medium connecting these objects certainly it cannot be claimed that there now exists any positive knowledge about the inherent nature of space to which a new Theory must conform on the contrary the conclusion of this current investigation which in effect asserts that space face is merely an aspect of motion has a much greater has a much greater a priori probability of being correct than any of its predecessors since it has been reached by way of a more reliable process nevertheless the proof of the pudding must be in the eating that is we must develop the consequences of the New Concept and see whether they give us a more logical and and consistent picture of physical relations than the currently accepted ideas it will not be possible in a short article of this kind to describe all of the results that have been obtained in the application of the reciprocal hypothesis uh to a wide variety of physical phenomenon during the many years that this investigation has been underway but the general nature of the results can be demonstrated by a typical example and in the discussion that follows the consequences of the reciprocal postulate will be developed far enough to produce an explanation of gravitation something that no other physical theory has been able to do the gravitational findings are particularly interesting because they not only demonstrate with uh demonstrate the ease with which this new development um surmount the difficulties that have stood in the way of progress in such areas as this but also show why we get a distorted view of space and time from our everyday experience and why most of the inferences as to the nature of these entities that we draw from such experience are erroneous and misleading no doubt many readers will be surprised at the assertion that Gra gravitation Still Remains unexplained as there is a very common misconception that Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity supplies such an explanation but as Willam dis uh desitter has uh pointed out very clearly no hypothesis thus far Advanced to explain gravitation has ever had the least chance they have all been failures Einstein&#x27;s contribution the cter says is to make gravitation identical with inertia and thus to put it in the category of one of the fundamental facts of nature which have to be accepted without explanation like the axioms of geometry after 50 years the inadequacy of this treatment is clearly apparent as RH dick puts it gravitation is still an enigma and it may be well the most fundamental and least understood of the interactions a recently published review of the proceedings of the first Soviet gravitational conference confirms this opinion with the following comments the Gathering seemed painfully perplexed with endless questions nearly all of which remain unanswered the Crux of the gravitational problem is the Dilemma which no previous theory has been able to avoid the apparent necessity of postulating either an action at a distance which is philosophically unacceptable to most scientists or propagation through a medium which is completely lacking in observational support and is faced with seemingly unsurmountable insurmountable practical obstacles after 300 years in which it has been agreed that these are the only two possibilities the new development based on the reciprocal postulate now produces a third alternative that has been completely overlooked by previous investigators one in which gravitation acts in a Perfectly Natural and understandable way instant taneously without an intervening medium or a medium like space and in such a way that it cannot be screened off or modified in any way all of which are exactly in accord with what our observations have indicated to begin the explanation of how these results were obtained let us now return to the basic assumption of the reciprocal relation between space and time it is evident that this assumption necessitates a further postulate that space and time have the same dimensions since quantities of different dimensions cannot stand in a reciprocal relation to each other we can recognize three dimensions of space and with the simplest assumption that it that is consistent with both reciprocal posture and The observed properties of space is that both space and time are three-dimensional limitations of both space and time to discrete units is also necessary in order to make the reciprocal postulate mathematically workable extrapolation of the relation between space and time that is observed in the phenomenon of motion thus leads directly to three conclusions about the properties of time and space which can replace the assumptions that the physicists have made with quote without ex examination together with the further assumption that space time as thus defined is the sole constituent of the physical Universe these can be combined into to one comprehensive postulate as follows and so this is larsson&#x27;s First Fundamental postulate the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion or as he called it SpaceTime so the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and in two reciprocal aspects or two reciprocal forms space and time okay uh we&#x27;re going to leave it off there I think I&#x27;ll probably start up tomorrow and read that First Fundamental postulate again and then we will eventually he will explain that a little bit and go into the second postulate a little bit um but you know again that&#x27;s um he&#x27;s he&#x27;s using the postulate as a hypothesis but he&#x27;s explaining you know where this is coming from um basically a process of extrapolation we&#x27;ve determined that time is three-dimensional or that space is threedimensional so we&#x27;re going to extrapolate that to space and we determined that motion is a relationship between space and time uh which creates a reciprocal relationship uh if you have a reciprocal relationship they need to have the same dimensionality they also need to to be um in discrete units and uh then if um if we have um yeah so if we have we have three so they are both three-dimensional and they both come in discrete units and they both uh have um are reciprocals of one another okay um we will uh resume this article tomorrow and I appreciate you tuning in today</p>
