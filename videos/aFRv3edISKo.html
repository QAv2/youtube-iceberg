            <p>I mean, the fact that it was doctorred indicates a cover up. If there&#x27;s no cover up, why doctor the photos? Interesting. So, here&#x27;s all three of them beside each other. And uh you can see that there&#x27;s a significant spot that it thinks is has been dithered or smoothed with some sort of filter in the 1969 image that&#x27;s not in the other images. Right.</p>
<p>This spot right here, it looks kind of like a leaf shape that seems raised or brighter or blurriier or something. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that right there means someone altered this picture. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s just incredible. &gt;&gt; But who? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the big question, man. And why? &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And why between 1963 and 1969? Why are there no archival photos? And why was this photo altered?</p>
