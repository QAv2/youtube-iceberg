            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>All right. Jason Sans, uh, one of the whistleblowers that has been really, I mean, has spoken a lot on various different programs was the one that myself included, a lot of the people kind of questioned when he first uh, appeared because he appeared on like Twitter spaces and that was where he first started giving all this information out like that&#x27;s where he said this is why I&#x27;m speaking my truth here now on uh, on Twitter spaces and people well why are you doing it there? And and then I I spoke to James Fox when he was promoting his documentary and he kind of took the I gave James Fox respect for that. He kind of took the hit for that. He said that was on me because I had a picture in the back and I was trying to hold the fact that this guy wasn&#x27;t um was going to be in my documentary. I wasn&#x27;t going to say anything about it yet.</p>
<p>And there was his name in the background and people started looking at him and and you know he had to say something. And so eventually he came out and did that because his feet were kind of put to the fire. So, um, anyway, he has been very vocal in a lot of different spaces. Like I said, he&#x27;s been on Rogan, he&#x27;s been on other things. He&#x27;s had conversations.</p>
<p>They have not asked him to be in part of a hearing yet or any of those things. People have when he first came out a lot of people and I think it was Jeremy Carbell and other people said that you look at this his or his credentials, we can say he&#x27;s legit. Just such everything that he&#x27;s saying, we don&#x27;t know. Well, he&#x27;s saying something else right now. Um, props to Red Panda Qual for posting this particular clip.</p>
<p>And this is when he&#x27;s talking about the craft that has been recovered and the other things that have been recovered o all over uh whether history and recently whatever it might be. SN says that the people or the NHI that their craft well they&#x27;re coming back for it. How he knows that I don&#x27;t know. Check this comment out. &gt;&gt; I was like guys what on earth did I just hear? because this person said that they had just finished uh interrogating this Eban and uh that the EAN had said that they were going to be coming back 50 to 70 years um from you know either the 1990s or the Hollowman Air Force Base cuz that was also mentioned during the call uh meeting that was supposed to take place um uh at Hullman Air Force Base.</p>
<p>So 50 to 70 years, it&#x27;s about 2030s uhish is a window of time that they were going to come back and ask for their equipment back, their prisoners to be released. And uh then the I think they they called them the emissaries could be exchanged. And uh I just was shocked. I was like I I I can&#x27;t believe it. I I just listened to one of the most interesting things I&#x27;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. I mentioned to you guys last week my schedule&#x27;s kind of hectic. I&#x27;m bouncing around. I&#x27;m all over the place. I&#x27;ve been busy lately and it&#x27;s been it&#x27;s been nuts.</p>
<p>But luckily enough, cornbread hemp, they have these CPD gummies. It&#x27;s really helped me unwind and I&#x27;m super thankful for it.

<p>Okay. So, look, there&#x27;s a lot of things that you we&#x27;ve heard in general, right? When it comes to this, the 2027 2030 area, that&#x27;s been something that has been talked about at great length, different places. CIA had talked about it at one point and um that that date in particular was the big date. Now, this particular thing is newer uh with an interrogation in of one of these beings saying that they were coming back for the crash stuff and the other things. And what does that mean though? They didn&#x27;t say inside of that comment there that it was they were coming back aggressively.</p>
<p>They just said they were coming back to to get these things, right? Well, I mean, look at it this way and scratch your head and say, what if? Let&#x27;s paint a scenario. Now, most people, myself included, are going to say, you know, that&#x27;s not really going to happen, right? I know, but let&#x27;s paint this scenario. Let&#x27;s say that ThreeI Atlas is indeed what they what some people think it is and that it&#x27;s finally the announcement that we are not alone. We will know sooner than later of what that thing is. Well, let&#x27;s say hypothetically, and it is like, okay, look, uh, you&#x27;ve had these things.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve left these things with you. You&#x27;ve had you&#x27;ve had enough time. Well, we we we want them back. I hope that we wouldn&#x27;t be stupid enough to say, &quot;No, you can&#x27;t have it back.&quot; You give them whatever they want back. And you say, &quot;Okay, can we have can but can we have some answers now?&quot; And now that you&#x27;ve showed up and you want your stuff back and everybody else knows you&#x27;re here now, can you like We want some some answers.</p>
<p>Can you tell everybody else the answers? Is that is that if you have the answers? Maybe you don&#x27;t have the answers. I don&#x27;t know. Um so that&#x27;s if that&#x27;s three Atlas if that if that indeed is it. If not, if it&#x27;s another thing that that&#x27;s what this information is because let&#x27;s paint another scenario. Let&#x27;s say that whoever it is in the powers that be and they know that this is like a credible thing that they are telling other people going all right look we only have so much longer we can hold this facade and we have to hold it for as long as we can but we got to realize that we got to let the facade down because there&#x27;s only so long because you can say something&#x27;s a balloon you can say uh we don&#x27;t have that you can you can do that until you&#x27;re blew in the face.</p>
<p>You can find ways to maneuver that. If something appears in the sky in the way that they did it, whether it&#x27;s a District 9 or Independence Day or anything like that, if something appears like that, oh, that&#x27;s not real. That&#x27;s AI. They just made a Hollywood actress. They can make that ship.</p>
<p>Can&#x27;t do that. Um, but again, this is a lot of hypothetical what if? Who knows? Uh, do I Now, what do I make of Jason Sans comments as far? I don&#x27;t know what to make of Jason Sand still. I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know. I mean, he just sounds so convincing that he believes that all this stuff had happened to him and these conversations that he had if you listen to the stuff that he talked about on Rogan and I I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>I I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve said the same thing a million times over that I I just can&#x27;t shut people down or shut things down because I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know the way that the universe in the world really works and what&#x27;s really out there. Um I still as I&#x27;ve said many times over what I believe I I don&#x27;t necessarily think and again could be wrong but I don&#x27;t think threei Atlas is going to be a an alien spaceship. I don&#x27;t think anything is going to come and collect ships and I don&#x27;t um and whatever it might be. I I I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t uh I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen because I I am more convinced in my mind that if whatever these things are flying around in the sky that interdimensional to me seems more likely that something was able to figure out quantum physics way more than we do back and forth bending time and space and figuring out technology in ways that we didn&#x27;t do. And maybe we do have certain ideas because of these things what we were able to now do with our technology.</p>
<p>That to me makes sense. Doesn&#x27;t mean that the other stuff isn&#x27;t possible, isn&#x27;t true, but I don&#x27;t know. Um, and I just wonder, it does fascinate me. Do I think that there are other things, other beings, other uh Yeah, I I do. Do I have any reason in general? Like when I think of like Moment of Contact and that that to me still I think is James Fox&#x27;s best movie.</p>
<p>But when I think of things like that and stories that were told, could they be fabricated stories? Of course they could. But for some reason, do I believe them? Yeah. You want to call me a sucker for believing them? You&#x27;re you&#x27;re more than welcome to. But for some reason, I feel like there are certain stories like that and interrogations and things. Not even say interrogations, conversations maybe.</p>
<p>I think that this universe is bigger than we all know. But those are my thoughts on it. I&#x27;m just curious to whether or not anything shows up. I don&#x27;t know. I I will anything show up in the fact of where we&#x27;re at our in our lifetime.</p>
<p>It was one of the things that when I was doing a lot of interviews for this subject, I would ask each person whether it was Tim Gallaghette or whoever it was, I I would say, &quot;Do you think we&#x27;re going to see the disclosure in our lifetime?&quot; Most of the people Ryan Graves is another one when I asked most of the people said yeah and Ryan Graves had an answer more so like in one way or another depending on what you your your answer is for what disclosure is right he had he had a more he had a his answer was to me one of the most interesting and Tim Galedet also was pretty much cut and clear and said yes I I think that we will get disclosure straight out um and I think that if you&#x27;re an advocate for it you&#x27;re optimistic in that way that you want to do that. Now, how much information in general comes out and how much truth we really get and if there is something like this with interrogations of other beings, you ain&#x27;t getting that right away unless it&#x27;s leaked and it&#x27;s officially leaked. And then there are other people who are leaking videos that are saying this stuff. problem now, and even though I goofed on that um AI actress thing, the problem now, and this is something that they the people who are holding the secrets could bank on is um AI. Anything that you show could say that&#x27;s not real, that&#x27;s AI.</p>
<p>I mean, I I I know scenarios of people that were clear as day, real footage, people go, that&#x27;s not me, that&#x27;s AI. It&#x27;s like, what are you talking about? It&#x27;s not you. Of course, that&#x27;s you. Uh but but prove it. It&#x27;s AI.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s the the bigger problem that you&#x27;re going to have now with all these things. AI CGI with the way you can create things in the air. I don&#x27;t know. You It&#x27;s I still And I said this on this show yesterday. I still feel like something&#x27;s coming.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what it is. And I don&#x27;t know why I feel that way. I just feel like something&#x27;s coming. Is it this? Is it the Hey, we want our [ __ ] back, which I would understand. We can give that to you.</p>
<p>like my friend crashed his car and he stole his car. [ __ ] you. Give it back to me. I want everything else back, too. Um, so we&#x27;ll see.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. What do you guys think? Put your thoughts in there. Let me know. I appreciate you and we&#x27;ll see you on the flip side. Hey, I&#x27;m telling you, get yourself some of the that cornbread hemp.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s amazing. Really is relaxing. Chill. Tell you a little bit more about it. Catch you on the flip side.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
