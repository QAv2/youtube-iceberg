            <p>useful for intelligence u missions as well and um uh on the one hand the US has to figure out how to manufacture them much more cheaply and effectively like China can do with DJI uh uh &gt;&gt; with our own component parts we don&#x27;t want to be buying &gt;&gt; exactly exactly but the second thing we have to figure out is the autonomy software to go on these things to help them operate uh uh uh in &gt;&gt; okay I&#x27;m super interested in drones bio I had not thought about as the revolution that China was &gt;&gt; I think bio is the micro the macro technology to think about for the next uh teen years. General AI I think is pretty interesting but uh I think bio is is even more interesting. Although of course, you know, the two will probably intersect somewhere here. But at the micro level, the the sort of mission that exists today that that I&#x27;m excited about it, it&#x27;s the autonomy for drones.</p>
