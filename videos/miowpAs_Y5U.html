            <p>Lost inventions that could have changed the world. First, the eternal light bulb. In a California fire station, a mysterious light known as the Livermore bulb has been glowing continuously since 1901, over 120 years, and it still has not burned out. Many believe early manufacturers created extremely long-lasting light bulbs, but stopped producing them to keep customers buying replacements. This idea gave rise to the theory of planned obsolescence where products are designed to fail to drive profit.</p>
<p>Second, Joseph Pap&#x27;s engine. In the 1960s, Hungarian inventor Joseph Pap revealed a new kind of engine that ran on inert gas, a fuel science claimed was impossible. It was silent, efficient, and produced no combustion. But during a public demonstration, something went terribly wrong. The event ended in tragedy.</p>
<p>The invention vanished and every document describing how it worked disappeared. Two inventions that could have changed everything, erased before the world could understand</p>
