            <p>most people have probably had the thought where they think to themselves what if I am the only truly conscious person and everyone else is basically just NPCs and it&#x27;s a good question because we still don&#x27;t really know our understanding of what Consciousness is is actually very minimal could The Human Experience where we make music and write books and fly to the moon and ask these questions about our own brains really just to be an arrangement of atoms which is where Donald Hoffman&#x27;s Theory comes in about a third of our brain&#x27;s cortex is involved with vision and right now as you stare at the screen billions and trillions of neurons and synapses are engaged but only about 13 million of those are photo receptors the rest of them are actively trying to create what you perceive to be in front of you based on the information that your brain has and the key word here is that it&#x27;s creating which leads him to believe that Consciousness might be the one true fundamental force of the universe which he said would explain the bizarre nature of quantum physics where particles will literally change their form based on whether or not they&#x27;re being observed he also says that this would explain the fine-tuning problem where our universe is seemingly fine-tuned to support life and it would be if Consciousness was as fundamental to the universe as space and time itself</p>
