            <p>Because the reality is crash retrievals in bodies. That&#x27;s the reality. Technology um reverse engineered technology uh unagnowledged special access programs where the attempt is being made to garner as much knowledge as we can from the physical technology that we&#x27;ve recovered and to try and understand the biology of the beings that pilot it. And it&#x27;s not one species. And species is the correct word.</p>
<p>Whether whether or not people like that, it it it doesn&#x27;t matter. Again, there&#x27;s this disconnect down here at the public discourse, the level of the public of public discourse where where Tucker is. Um, and that&#x27;s not to say that Tucker is not well informed. I&#x27;m sure he is. I&#x27;m sure he has his sources.</p>
<p>But if you&#x27;re going to be well, if in my mind, wellinformed means you&#x27;ve been exposed to the data. You&#x27;ve been exposed, you&#x27;ve seen the images, you&#x27;ve been exposed to the data, you have an a basic understanding of the what&#x27;s called the legacy crash retrieval program because that is stone cold fact right there. Uh is there a metaphysical element to all of this? I suppose. But I always have to remind people that in the words of Arthur C. Clark, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>
<p>So at what point where where&#x27;s the where&#x27;s the dividing line? Where&#x27;s the delineation between highly advanced technology and metaphysics? Where&#x27;s the divi where&#x27;s the where&#x27;s the dividing line there? Under.</p>
