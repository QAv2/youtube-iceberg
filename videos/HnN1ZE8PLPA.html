            <p>this is a quote regarding the mysterious anti-gravitational work of Thomas Townson Brown through the utilization of the Byfield Brown effect the Flying Saucer can generate an electr gravitational field of its own the field acts like a wave with the negative pole at the top of the wave and the positive pole at the bottom the saucer travels like a surfboard on the incline of a wave in the context of electrogravitics the Byfield Brown effect is claimed to produce an anomalous force that defies gravity allegedly towns in brown was able to harness effect using his specially designed version of an asymmetric capacitor who was townend brown why were parts of his research concealed why is his report mysteriously missing from the naval research laboratory why was an Air Force General frightened by his work this episode is a must listen for anyone interested in mysterious fringe science theories of anti-gravity strange coverups or simply an unbelievable story</p>
