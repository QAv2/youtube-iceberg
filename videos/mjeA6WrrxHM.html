            <p>When a laser emits beams of light particles called photons at a screen with two slits, you’d expect to see two strips to correspond with the two slits. Instead, we see a pattern of light and dark bands.</p>
<p>This suggests that light behaves like waves that pass through both slits simultaneously, interfering with each other to create the pattern on the second screen. However, when scientists used a measuring device to observe the slit that each photon passed through, the interference pattern disappeared,</p>
<p>and two strips appeared. The act of observing which slit it went through changed the behavior of the photons! No one knows why observing a particle causes its behavior to change.</p>
