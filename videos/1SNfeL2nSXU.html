            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>in this video I am going to discuss the real science behind free energy and Zero Point Energy and like all my other videos I&#x27;ll be giving you the straight physics explained in terms that normal everyday people can understand if you don&#x27;t understand something I say try to go look it up for yourself first and if you still don&#x27;t understand just ask me by typing a question in the comments below and if I have time and I think the question is valid I will answer it what is Zero Point Energy Zero Point Energy is real science while free energy is fringe science because it&#x27;s never been experimentally proven to work without violating the second law of Thermodynamics the second law of Thermodynamics is an expression of the universal law of increasing entropy stating that the entropy of an isolated system which is not an equilibrium will tend to increase over time approaching a maximum value at equilibrium this is partially derived from Newton&#x27;s law of inertia an object at rest will stay at rest unless an outside force is applied when there are unbalanced for forces on an object it causes the object to move this means that whenever an object moves its motion or change in acceleration is always due to an unbalanced forces acting upon the object but more important than the law of inertia is the law of conservation of energy energy can neither be created nor destroyed it simply changes form it also likes to change form from a less ordered more to from a less into a less ordered more chaotic state so if you have an or an ordered state it tends to um go toward a less ordered state so say you have all the gas molecules of one type on one side of the room and all the gas molecules of another type on the other side of the room they would eventually disperse themselves evenly into each other in mix due to the law of increasing entropy in every mechanical or electrical systems such as those that use electromagnetic electromagnets some of the energy is always converted into heat and less friction can be totally eliminated Bose Einstein condensation uh for example superc conductors and and super fluids are the only known ways to achieve this however keeping them super cooled is an energy consuming process in and of itself another interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics states that heat cannot spontaneously flow from a material at lower temperature to a material at higher temperature this is because heat is the same thing as internal kinetic energy kinetic energy is the energy of motion uh internal means that it it is contained so internal kinetic energy is just a measure of how fast the molecules or atoms are jiggling or flying through space probably bouncing off each other uh so when you heat something up you cause the atoms to shake faster and harder move around faster and harder uh when you cool something down you cause the atoms to shake slower take an ice cube for example ice is just dihydrogen oxide H2O in the solid state of matter this is where the atoms have been cooled down to the point where they stick together think of atoms as Tiny magnets and when you heat them up they start bouncing off one another because they move around more and become less sticky uh so when the ice begins to melt what is happening on the molecular level is that the H2O molecules begin to jiggling fast enough where they start to break apart and sort of slide around but they still keep stuck to each other somehow a little bit of stickiness so they kind of slide around on each other and this is what causes surface tension in water this they&#x27;re still attracted to one another but they&#x27;re sort of sliding around and if you heat the molecule up a little more they bounce off each other with too much energy for them to stick together and this is what we call the gaseous state of matter this is also conceptually explains why heat cannot spontaneously travel from cold to hot because the hot molecules will always jiggle the slow ones into moving faster or bounce them around more so if the temperature can be thought of as a scale of how fast the molecules are jiggling what happens when you cool something down to the point where the atoms stop jiggling all together surely we can&#x27;t cool them down any further than this point cuz anyone knows he can&#x27;t go slower than stop this hypothetical point is called absolute Z - 27515 de C and I say hypothetical because nobody has been able to actually cool something down this cold scientists have come very close but no one has actually been able to reach absolute zero this is due to a quantum mechanical principle known as the Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle usually math equations turn a lot of viewers away but this one is important and it&#x27;s really a lot simpler simpler than it first looks the term on the right is H bar over 2 Plank&#x27;s constant over 4 Pi the term on the left can never get smaller than this because it must always be greater than or equal to the term on the right the term on the left reads Delta P Delta meaning change in and P for meaning momentum so Delta p is change in momentum times the change in position X or Y or Z depending on which position you&#x27;re talking about it moving in what this equation essentially means is that we can only know a particle&#x27;s position and momentum to within a degree of Plank&#x27;s constant over 4 Pi this says that as soon as we know the exact position of an atom its momentum changes and this is definitely true because in order to look at an atom we see and see where it is you have to bounce a photon or light particle off of it and then detect that photon with an eye or Optical sensor of some sort but when that Photon bounced off the atom it transferred some of its momentum to the particle or the atom changing its momentum and thus its position so you only knew where it was you don&#x27;t know where it is anymore because by looking at it you Chang the state of it Heisenberg developed this principle by using a series of statistical probability matrices the schroering equation amounts amounts to the same thing but only schroer used wave functions to derive his model as opposed to The Matrix approach that Heisenberg took again they both amount to the same thing and that&#x27;s is that the laws of quantum mechanics are probabilistic in nature this is why Einstein didn&#x27;t like quantum mechanics he said God does not play dice with the universe well apparently sometimes he does because half of thermodynamics is based on statistical mechanics so if the individual shaking of the atoms can be cooled down to the point where the atoms stop moving entirely we would also therefore know its exact position and due to the ber uncertainty principle there would be a violation and the atom&#x27;s momentum would then therefore have to change in order to satisfy the principle basically the atom would go back to vibrating just outside the H bar or two over two limit of of smallness or the electron or whatever the particle was that you were considering to increase the particle&#x27;s momentum requires energy and this energy comes from nothing seemingly so we call this energy the Zero Point Energy because when we cool something down to absolute zero this energy comes out of nowhere and says no no you&#x27;re not getting to absolute zero you can&#x27;t get this cold you can only get this close but you can&#x27;t get any closer than that then you can get a little bit closer than that but you can never get you can never actually get there it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like a theoretical uh infinity or an ASM toote so the only way to tap into Zero Point Energy is to cool something to absolute zero unfortunately it takes such massive amounts of energy in order to actually do that it makes this absolutely useless as a source of power or energy like a lot of these other devices out there that you get less en you always get less energy back than you put in you can never get more back than you put in it&#x27;s the laws of physics this isn&#x27;t I mean this is simple science here you should know this people shouldn&#x27;t be fooled by these internet hoaxes I mean I&#x27;m after viewing pretty much every video on YouTube dealing with free energy such as the race to zero point and that compilation that shows about 100 different claimed free energy devices of course none of them work because people who made them can&#x27;t explain how their device produces free energy without violating the second law of Thermodynamics everything in nature moves toward a less ordered um I mean a less ordered more chaotic State you can&#x27;t go in reverse everything moves toward a balanc state magnets are only a potential field you have to put energy in in order to get energy out and you can never get more energy back than you started with when you use an electromagnet to turn the magnets on and off at certain times this electromagnetic energy comes from the electricity traveling through the wire and some of that energy is always lost to friction because from some resistance in the wire as the as the electricity travels through the wire some of it&#x27;s always converted into heat so you&#x27;re always losing energy you can never be creating more energy or there&#x27;s no way to create energy or any any serious way that I&#x27;ve ever seen except for one and now that I&#x27;ve turned all my viewers Away by telling them the truth of about the physics behind free energy and debunking half of those hoax claims out there I&#x27;m going to attempt to redeem myself and regrab those viewers attention with a remarkable concept for producing a constant voltage without violating the second law of Thermodynamics a so-called Infinite Battery stay tuned it&#x27;s coming soon</p>
