            <p>hello so the myth has long been that in order to stay young and beautiful looking we need special wrinkle creams according to Dr John Leakey the world-renowned Beverly Hills Beauty expert most of those wrinkle fixes on the market are nothing more than glorified moisturizers so recently Dr Lakey has focused his attention away from mainstream cosmetic practice to pursue a revolution anti-aging technology breakthrough one that some experts say could empty the wallets of the Cosmetics industry his personal clients have dubbed his new do-it-yourself technique the age rewinder method because it can take years or even decades off your appearance in under two minutes I could do with some of this stuff Dr Ley has released a stepbystep video to the public free and uninterrupted where he outlines exactly how to use this simple solution from home the videos wrecked up over 2.3 million views and Counting so far thousands of women what about the men are reporting they look decades younger so you can find out more about this yourself right now go to bhmd numeral one.com Ross or click on the link in the description box below that&#x27;s bhmd numeral one.com Ross now there is one thing that Dr Ley asks from his viewers if watching this video helps you look and feel younger than you have in years then please share this video with your friends and loved ones together we have the power to make as many women reclaim a youthful look as possible go watch the video at bhmd numeral one.com Ross right now or just click on the link in the description box [Music] below hello and welcome back to reality check so I&#x27;ve had a long interest in the northwest of Australia I start my book in plain sight at the place called The Harold e halt Naval communication station which is a very very mysterious former United States facility now an Australian run facility that actually communicates with American nuclear attack submarines in the Indian and Pacific Oceans using VF very low frequency radio waves and the thing about this whole area is that it&#x27;s been a hotspot for a very long time of how does one say this politely anomalous objects and adjacent just to the east of the uh Northwest Cape is a place called the pilura desert a gigantic squ of Western Australia rolling red desert country that to the original people there is beautiful and also deeply mysterious when the first settlers came too as colonists to Australia in the 18th century they were puzzled by what became known as Min Min lights orbs glowing spherical orbs drifting through the outl and the fascinating thing about it is that aund and something years on we still have no answer to that mystery well our guest today is Dr Andrew Morgan and he&#x27;s a kiwi like myself and he&#x27;s also a uh person who&#x27;s got extraordinary scientific qualifications and he&#x27;s taken a very very close interest in the whole subject of uaps anomalous phenomena across that part of Western Australia and what is uncovered is actually quite fascinating it&#x27;s a poke in the eye for those people who constantly say oh yeah yeah yeah if there really are UFOs and nhi why do they only ever show themselves over cities in America and that&#x27;s not true at all I just don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve been properly looking and I often think the only way we&#x27;re ever going to crack this mystery is by sciencing it and that&#x27;s what Andrew is doing he&#x27;s a scientist he&#x27;s a teacher in science at a at a school in Western Australia but he&#x27;s got a very illustrious background in studying of science he went to the University of Oakland did an undergraduate degree in Zoology completed his Petty Dive Master qualifications moved to Queensland in Australia in 1995 and did a masters in Marine Science at the University of Queensland in Brisbane returned to New Zealand at the end of 98 and did a PhD in environmental and Marine Science at the University of Oakland he was commissioned as an officer in the New Zealand Navy did his basic training bridge watchkeeping and vessel safety over two years joined the active reserves in 2007 taught Marine studies at the Bay of Plenty poly Technic and tonger in New Zealand for 5 years while also Consulting to the fisheries and aquaculture industry and he moved very sensibly to Australia in 2012 with his family and he consulted in the off shore oil and gas industry for 5 years as as an environmental advisor in Exploration drilling planning and approvals and he&#x27;s now The Honorable profession of teaching in science I presume Andrew is that correct H yes thanks Ross Yes um career science teacher so I&#x27;ve been 30 years in science now and back into the teaching profession again now the thing I find very brave of you to admit because it&#x27;s very controversial for a scientist is that as well as being a scientist who&#x27;s endeavoring to study anomalous phenomenon ever since you were a child you&#x27;ve been what is politely called an experiencer you believe that you have had encounters with nhi with a nonhuman intelligence can you tell me about that yeah that&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a lifetime experience and um I&#x27;m very careful about the the vocabulary I use as a scientist and I&#x27;ve written a book on it now too which has made me go back through my life and and look at all these patterns and occurrences uh with with entity interactions and all the common vocabulary so dreams Visions astral projection bilocation and and that sort of phenomena that um no one ever talks about because of the stigma attached to it and what I wanted to do was say look here&#x27;s a here&#x27;s a career scientist um 30 years in science wants to understand more about how this has impacted his life I mean look at Professor Gary Nolan for example he&#x27;s a he&#x27;s an experiencer as well so there&#x27;s a lot of these people and very high up in their professions coming out and talking about this now and I think we need to have a conversation about understanding how this impacts people&#x27;s lives and what it all means so what does it all mean what were the kind of experiences you had let take me back to some of the earliest experiences you had as a child as a child I&#x27;d say at seven and nine years old I had I suppose it&#x27;s a typical childhood experience of what they call little people in your bedroom uh that I had twice when I was seven and when I was nine uh and back then I&#x27;ve got no concept of what UAP is what nhi is as a child you don&#x27;t it&#x27;s just a a novel experience unusual and then you put it in the back of your mind through your life and it&#x27;s only later on as a teenager where I have these really Vivid experiences uh in my room uh and I&#x27;ve always been able to remember my what I do when I&#x27;m asleep it&#x27;s I suppose it&#x27;s a little bit unusual because I&#x27;ve been able to go back and recount and remember these experiences of being conscious while asleep and out of out of your body taken places uh when I got older uh and more recently that turned to in into even craft entity interactions um as as well so you you&#x27;ve actually you believe you believe you&#x27;re a classic abductee you&#x27;ve been taken from your bedroom at night and and taken somewhere else to a craft perhaps yeah I&#x27;ve because I had did did a bit of research on this I didn&#x27;t understand it myself um because there there&#x27;s the physical phenomenon of that that you read a lot about but then there seems to be some connection with Consciousness uh and people talking about how Consciousness is is not your character and that that can be separated from your body physically so I&#x27;ve gone gone more down that Avenue and researching uh and talking to people about about how that works uh so that part of you can be taken places and then and then you come back so science at for me you&#x27;re the scientist you&#x27;re the guy who works on the kind of empirical scientific method you believe clearly that what you&#x27;ve experienced ever since you were a child is real that it&#x27;s not some kind of hallucination some kind of psychosis why do you believe it&#x27;s real what is it that has given you that confidence that you&#x27;re dealing with something that is in fact non-human intelligence in hi I suppose I suppose the confidence comes from from my maturity uh in thinking over over 30 years in science and and understanding the science of Consciousness um because it&#x27;s repeatable when it&#x27;s the thing is is it measurable uh yes it&#x27;s repeatable and there are common there are common themes through your life around uh the types of experiences and visions and even even places that you seem to be in and circumstances whether that&#x27;s uh they call it flying dreams and they can often be in the same the same place or the same circumstances there&#x27;s um uh interaction with sometimes that can be interaction with a craft uh and I&#x27;ve I kind of in my book I classify them into different experiences normal normal dream processing which I&#x27;ve read about you know you&#x27;re processing what happens during the day uh you may or might not remember that then there&#x27;s uh Visions uh which are that can be precognition or of something that hasn&#x27;t happened uh then you&#x27;ve got your outer body and astral projection uh which is going places and then from there the other one that I&#x27;ve come across is is the interaction in your room at night where uh you&#x27;re you seem to be I suppose they call it paralysis sleep paralysis and something&#x27;s going on there&#x27;s a presence in the room you can&#x27;t move and what what I tried to understand is fear uh there&#x27;s a lot of talk and Consciousness studies about overcoming the fear of something that you don&#x27;t know and that once you can seek to understand it you have more freedom to interact and I&#x27;ve found that in in my older years I&#x27;ve got more freedom in the circumstances to question to interact and to ask what&#x27;s going on is it hard to speak about it I mean there&#x27;s a lot of stigma associated with saying that you&#x27;ve been abducted or that you&#x27;ve had interactions with nhi are you concerned about blowback for talking like that uh yes yes and no I think I think we need to develop the vocabulary because uh there&#x27;s so much pop culture around UFOs and UAP even the word anti-gravity that was coined because they didn&#x27;t understand what they were what they were looking at so I&#x27;m try I try to avoid the pop cult termin terminology and and facilitate a discussion about the science behind it all because I believe I believe there&#x27;s a science that connects all of this from uaps to UFOs to Consciousness studies to experiences and what they experience I think there&#x27;s a whole and if you go back through ancient history the Ancients certainly document a lot of this stuff and had a deep knowledge of it from from what I can gather so we need to have these conversations you know the thing I love most of all is that your your mission if you like took you to one of my favorite bits of desert it&#x27;s beautiful country the pillur desert and I I think this all started to really happen for you did didn&#x27;t it when you were at a place called Newman which is a mining town in the middle of the pbra desert yeah that that&#x27;s right about five years ago I took the opportunity to teach up there in science in that town uh and that&#x27;s when things did take off by myself up there coming back to Perth and the holidays to family but um I had the opportunity to go camping uh out there and also talk to indigenous people and locals at the pub and all that and if once you get to know people they they they say there some strange things happened up here and there&#x27;s some very interesting dream time stories as well and because at the time I was writing a novel series uh which places reverse engineered UFO technology in the deep sea mining industry I was researching the topic and I went camping uh in carag gen with a telescope and I was looking around at the night sky and I just had this sense that there&#x27;s a lot more to see than than than just the the light the light spectrum the visual light spectrum and I need some more gear so I went and thought I&#x27;m going to invest in some infrared uh digital camera and then so round two of my camping trip I set up to do what I was going to do at night and and tested my film on that and then after dusk I was filming uh the sky and then the Horizon and what do you know as you said orbs appeared in my field of view so let&#x27;s talk to one of those images there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a beautiful image that you&#x27;ve sent me on video that you captured of it almost looks like a sun it&#x27;s a solid white spherical object moving very slowly tracking past trees presumably right in front of your campsite and it moves across Open Sky across trees again and then disappears out of sight was that one of your first classic sightings of the spherical orbs that you see in the outback yes that was that was before I developed all the the field methodology to to apply the scientific method I was just scanning and that was one of the first ones I saw that came right past me where I was filming uh on my first trip with those digital binoculars and that&#x27;s what inspired me to get other gear so I went and got an electric magnetic field intensity meter uh got G counter and another gear and I I&#x27;m you&#x27;ll probably talk about this soon but I got in contact with someone I could uh trust to talk about how we develop the methodology in the field uh to collect reliable and repeatable data and have a data data driven program and research up there so that&#x27;s what I really like about your work you remind me a lot of my friends John and Jerry Tesco over in Long Island New Jersey who are currently dealing with a plague of a swarm of drug own uaps of some kind hovering over over the east coast of the United States but you know they decided in their retirement years that they would science the subject of uaps and boy did they find some interesting stuff and what I love about you is you&#x27;ve done the same and you&#x27;ve teamed up with a guy called Brian Tyson what what can you tell me about Brian and what role does he serve in your research yeah that&#x27;s right so several years ago uh when when when I had this first field trip I was hunting around for someone I could Le with that didn&#x27;t have uh an agenda uh was not interested in in in owning any of what I was doing but would help out in the capacity that they could and in his particular role he he had a personal interest in UAP and I hooked up with him through my uh social media channels uh because I saw him commenting on UAP and I just mentioned that I had this project going on in the pilra and was he interested in looking at um like you a little bit of footage and some images and he said yeah happy to help have a look and then the relationship involved from there professionally and personally uh and he became a key advisor on scientific methods uh interpretation a bit of speculation what we need to do to develop the research into the future because I I only had a self-funded budget so we came up with proposals and funding proposals for how we might expand that into the future so he&#x27;s been he&#x27;s been quite key in the background and and wants to remain in the background due to the nature of his job and his work which is fine uh but yeah he&#x27;s been a key player and so one of the things have you you&#x27;ve had papers published haven&#x27;t you uh we we self-published on Research gate and that&#x27;s an interesting story because we did submit to a journal uh and waited the six to eight weeks for the first lab paper to be reviewed double double blind review so One reviewer came back positive published with minimal uh Corrections and the other reviewer just focused on one thing and that was the cameras only filming at 30 frames per second I can demonstrate the all artifacts of filming and so the journal rejected the paper uh and which means the other two papers we didn&#x27;t even get to um have reviewed so what we did is we published them as research papers through research gate attached to our our lab which we just call Energy scape so they&#x27;re they&#x27;re published self-published on Research gate now now let&#x27;s deal with that firstly um is 30 frames per second filming a liability for you scientifically improving your thesis uh yes and no because we should have a frame rate of about a thousand and Tesco and Tesco would tell you that as well but to compensate and I even say this in my research paper to compensate we looked at reli reliable repeatable measurable uh data driven approaches over multiple times so going back doing the same thing over and over and over again your your point is is that if this was a camera artifact it would occur incidentally it wouldn&#x27;t occur pretty much all the time how often are you seeing these objects that you call orbs and rods uh every time we go to the same at the same site and do the same the same same standard pattern of data collection the intensity and the numbers of them might vary but they&#x27;re always at that sight uh we think talking to Dr Tyson that it&#x27;s connected to some sort of temporal or interdimensional anomaly at at the site as well so but to measure that we need more gear I mean we&#x27;ve looked at Electric magnetic field intens tensity we&#x27;ve made correlations between the manifestation and the let&#x27;s deal with that because you&#x27;ve mentioned a GE counter and you&#x27;ve also mentioned an em detector let&#x27;s talk about electromagnetic energy did you notice anything anomalous about the electromagnetic energy in the area where you were yeah um so there are naturally occurring mag em anomalies and there is with the hisan lights as well uh in Norway and we found that there was a buildup during the day in the middle of nowhere there&#x27;s nothing around that could there&#x27;s no high voltage power lines were a away from anything that could generate the volt meters and microteslas um that you would associate with Suburbia uh and that would build up to late afternoon and then we found that the the intensity of the manifestation of orbs and rods had a correlation between zero and one with the intensity of the electric and magnetic field build up during the day now I&#x27;d like to get more data on that because we only we had four data plots on a linear regression graph uh to get the cor a strong correlation so we&#x27;ve got more work to do but there&#x27;s certainly an indication that there is something anomalous going on there so can you say that the the electromagnetic radiation that was anomalous was it causative or correlative to the appearance of the orbs and rods do you believe uh we post a number of different theories on that so the key at the moment is not to say it&#x27;s this or it&#x27;s this or it&#x27;s this we post several different theories and one in particular was to do with um energy coupling or energy Cascades in the area because we&#x27;ve got I think it&#x27;s called Pio uh electric uh naturally occurring phenomena as well where you can get really small natural orbs um from the build up of uh electric uh and magnetic intensity in the atmosphere so there&#x27;s that as well but we think that masks this other UAP phenomena as well which could be a life form extension it could be technological it could be hiding there we simply don&#x27;t know before we get into the life form issue um you also mentioned you had a radiation detector did you pick up any anomalous rep radiation no it&#x27;s yeah the gamma the gamma radiation was on the same meter and I I tested for that andal was always Baseline background levels and I think it&#x27;s because you&#x27;d need to be right near an actual object or an imprint or or or a physical trace for that for that to register so in terms of background levels not above them so paint me a word picture I mean I love the pillur it&#x27;s a beautiful part of Australia and the funny thing is the great mythology about Australia is we all walk around with big hats on and walk around the Outback but very few Australians ever get out there and it is Wild Country uh paint me a word picture of where you are it&#x27;s Big Red Hills covered with scrub and blooming hot during the day yes yes you go you go in the dry season between April and September because it simply gets walking around in 40° is very difficult um yeah it&#x27;s Barren so carage Kagen uh National Park is where we are for the field workor uh so it&#x27;s Red Rock and dirt uh lots of termite Mounds short Bush and shrubs and and grasses lots of canyons uh gets down to freezing at night uh so there you got gorgees and canyons with water um beautiful landscape during the day and at night uh I found in the area I was working and I did some you know field work at night time getting up in the middle of the night quite quite creepy because it&#x27;s deathly silent almost not normal there no insects no birds uh extremely quiet and a little bit creepy when you&#x27;re sampling and recording the stuff going on around you cuz you&#x27;re ready for something to pop up in front of you and get oh my God where did that come from um so I found that quite unusual as well when I&#x27;ve been out tonight at night in other areas where you&#x27;ve got background insects not the odd bird fluttering I mean I did we did debunk some of this we looked at um camera blurring we&#x27;&#x27;ve looked at and I&#x27;ve filmed and recorded four different types of organisms in infrared and we know that they are organisms because we did a back bound re some backround research on our nocturnal fers up there so yeah very very desperate isolated place so do the Aboriginal people in that area do they talk about anomalous portals or or objects themselves is there anything in their mythology or their dream time stories about this kind of object yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s interesting there&#x27;s a couple couple of things there cuz human Township uh the swimming pool there is built on top of a Dreamtime story cuz the aboriginals to Make It Rain up there they had a rain dance and apparently where the swimming pool is there used to be some rock um big huge rocks in their dream time story and they would dance around them and apparently these rocks would split open and a light would shoot up shoot up into the sky and then it would rain and to to me that was a UAP story uh I probably have to ask the elders about their interpretation of that now from their dream time but that&#x27;s just one and then I had an anomalous experience up there with a a uh an elder that had passed on when we went camping somewhere overnight and I asked a um a indigenous person about this experience of being my sleep being interrupted in my Consciousness by an indigenous Elder said oh they probably didn&#x27;t want you there and you shouldn&#x27;t have been there so I took that as advice not to go camping back there without actually asking to be there so let&#x27;s go into the detail of the orbs and rods you&#x27;ve written you and Bri a fascinating paper that in my view presents pretty compelling evidence that you&#x27;re seeing something that is actually intelligent and responding to you can you explain why you think these orbs and rods are intelligently responding to you yeah because we&#x27;ve got a huge Archive of of video footage and done extensive analysis in frame by frame analysis and and video clip analysis uh in a radial manner uh around the the cardinal directions and we found that they demonstrated object avoidance uh so that&#x27;s whether that was an obstacle that they would turn on a dime uh in instantaneous acceleration as well so some of the five observables uh camera recognition or being filmed in infrared uh they they would come into the field of view and then turn and try and move out of it uh pretty quickly as well and same of the Ober can I just for a moment just interrupt you there okay let&#x27;s just try and think about that an infrared camera itself is not emitting any energy is it to try and capture the images that it&#x27;s capturing is it well we have in the 850 nanometer Spectra so C there must be something about that Spectra that interrupts some of the I think it was orbs orbs did it not rods the orbs would do that and then I found in one very interesting one where I was filming an orb and trying to track it as it moved up into the sky uh it would try I would move to the left or right or up and down with it and then it would move very quickly backwards and forwards as if it was making fun of me trying to trying to track it so that that there a trickster quality to this phenomenon yeah there was a there was a trickster and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s been um mentioned in in other studies as well so there was that there&#x27;s object avoidance there was some of the five observables there&#x27;s avoiding the camera avoiding the Observer uh as well so your own words in your own words what you think this is intelligent can you explain to me uh you believe that this is intelligent we think yeah we we think there&#x27;s some form of intelligence now now what what Dr Tyson and I came up with was a a little table that looked at that as to whether that represented a life form extension an or an extension of an ecosystem phenomenon that&#x27;s not in the visible spectrum whether there&#x27;s some sort of mixture there of naturally occurring and technological because we&#x27;re we&#x27;ve been speculating that these places with Magnetic anomalies are good places to hide if your nhi as well so whether there&#x27;s some biom there uh so there&#x27;s a technology that mimics natural phenomena and I talk about that in my papers as well uh and how that can be because these rods had counter rotating spindles around them there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s no airframe like aleron&#x27;s fuselage um there&#x27;s no wings like organisms but there were these counter rotating spindles in our digital analysis going around them and some of the orbs had bisected rings as well and yeah so it&#x27;s very interesting so you saw differences between the orbs and the rods they don&#x27;t behave the same do they what are the differences so the the the rods have Extreme Velocity instantane in instantaneous acceleration uh turn with no inertia uh and the orbs and and predominantly the rods move in straight lines uh we did see them avoid objects but the orbs were more erratic so they were slower still still quite fast slower um Turned without inertia um but they tended to investigate more so there was different types of orbs there were orbs that had seem to investigate what was around them and there were orbs that just moved through the field of view and the ones that investigated uh were able to turn instantaneously uh no inertia so all of these objects uh were able to overcome inertia and demonstrated some of the five observables you know what I find amazing about this Andrew is if what you&#x27;re saying is right and if you can exclude the probability that these are artifacts inside your camera that are doing these effects you&#x27;ve founded another form of life yeah uh I did talk to Dr Tyson about that about because one of the things with the life form extension and and I said well do you think it&#x27;s sentient as an as an intelligent an intelligent organism and not just like um an animal uh as intelligent but actually capable of of of thought or thinking or some or some level of Consciousness but what what what he did say and what I thought was if this is a temporal anomaly it could also be a silhouette of something that we don&#x27;t have the full manifestation of in our own Dimension uh so we&#x27;ve been looking at that as well so this is doing my head in so you guys are theorizing that where you were filming in the pillur desert Karen Genie national park there might be some kind of interdimensional portal that this life form these orbs and rods are coming through and and just to get my understanding of what you&#x27;ve just said the reason why sometimes they appear translucent rather than solid is because they might they might only be partially in this Dimension there might be shadows of themselves from the other dimension yeah that that&#x27;s one of the the one of the several theories We&#x27;ve Got U and I called it the Looking Glass effect because when I was filming there was this perfectly still still night there&#x27;s no wind no Breeze no fog no clouds No no um fog coming up from the ground but there was this Haze uh quite a quite a few times through through the footage and it&#x27;s not there when you&#x27;re looking around and in it was um what I call ghosting orbs that yeah was sort of translucent and then there were the solid ones that would come out of that and and be moving off and around so that that was yeah you say solid were they solid objects do you think do you think you can say definitively that they were solid objects uh yeah that&#x27;s uh no no I wouldn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t say that we&#x27;ve come to that conclusion because we don&#x27;t know whether they their plasma uh whether they&#x27;re uh they&#x27;ve got a structure to them underneath that because I said to Brian what if they&#x27;re actually harnessing the energy that&#x27;s around them uh and not creating it themselves but plasma itself is a solid because it shows up on radar sometimes doesn&#x27;t it yeah um yeah and yeah if we had the technology and some more instrumentation uh because that&#x27;s one of the things bought up about our research papers is is understanding more about not just the the morol of these objects but the underlying structure and how that plasma uh is generated so whether they&#x27;re generating it internally or externally yes it&#x27;s still a fourth state of matter as a as a light as a light b or a rod with a plasma around it now the thing I find really shocking about this is because you can&#x27;t afford a camera that can shoot a th000 frames per second that&#x27;s the only reason that you didn&#x27;t get published in a peer- review journal that would give you the opportunity to publish your good science in a journal that might give you the approval if you like of the scientific Community for what sounds like a potential discovery of a non human intelligence yeah I think yeah that&#x27;s um I find that incredible really when you think about it the implications are extraordinary I mean we&#x27;re spending hundreds of millions of dollars on seti you know trying to communicate with radio signals Across the Universe from what you&#x27;re saying you you you are hypothesizing and still working obviously on trying to prove it but you&#x27;ve got a pretty solid basis for a hypothesis that what you are exploring is another form of life yeah I think I think we have the beginnings and the groundwork um to do that and I think um the key is application of the scientific method and yes cheap yes cheap gear but cheap gear done well cheap gear done well is better than expensive gear given to someone that has no idea what they&#x27;re doing and just films and there&#x27;s no methodology I think the key here is methodology uh scientific meth methodology and hypothesis driven research and yes we need funding to to prove or validate more what we&#x27;re doing but I&#x27;m being rejected from a journal for I mean I have to stay professional I can understand from this physicist perspective that he has concerns but there was another reviewer that said we should publish this as something here uh and move forward because we&#x27;re not I think when you get a reviewer looking at one Journal article they don&#x27;t see the other two papers that are coming after it they don&#x27;t see the hundreds of hours of video footage and Stills and they just get a summary um so in staying professional yeah I understand that and there are ways to self-publish now and it&#x27;s I think you know this whole publish rep perish thing needs needs to be discussed more at universities as well because it&#x27;s all tied to funding models as well of course as a university scientist well let let me let me be the ultimate skeptic I feel I feel the obligation to be the voice of debunking skepticism just for a moment here um the the scientific Community would you agree broadly takes the view that uaps UFOs they&#x27;re not capable of being proved in Material Science that that essentially it&#x27;s never been verified and and that these things can&#x27;t be you know you can&#x27;t gather data on them you can&#x27;t measure them you can&#x27;t sense them therefore it&#x27;s not real what do you think of that suggestion that hypothesis I I think it&#x27;s Antiquated because Technology&#x27;s changed and our thinking has changed uh and if if the scientific or Academia is still thinking like that I think very quickly and very soon as you&#x27;re probably well aware they&#x27;re going they&#x27;re going to get left behind if they don&#x27;t get on board and yes some of us have taken a risk professionally stepping up you know Gary Ary ler uh I&#x27;m myself I&#x27;m a little bit lower down the lad professionally because I&#x27;m not an academic but I have an academic background I&#x27;m and I&#x27;m an educator and a scientist so I think if they don&#x27;t change their mindset when this all starts to um accelerate as it is already they they&#x27;re going to miss miss the boat on all this um yeah the technolog is there to do it now U I don&#x27;t understand why they would still I I I think it&#x27;s entrenched it&#x27;s an entrenched mindset within Academia it&#x27;s it can&#x27;t be there for it isn&#x27;t I mean that&#x27;s talked about a lot as well and we know historically uh well for me personally I&#x27;ve written another book coming out next year on our missing science uh which we could discuss and I&#x27;ve looked at the whole UFO UAP thing since World War II and some key figures that have come a foul scientifically of the powers of be including otus car Douglas tour Dr ningle Victor Shaw berer uh all these guys seem to be talking about the same science of field repulsion field repulsion technology I&#x27;m wondering whether if some of the stigma is facilitated by Counter Intelligence over those eight Decades of Legacy programs and all of this and that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s distilled into the university system and into their mindset so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a mindfield as you know of Counter Intelligence personal agendas you know Blue Book uh project sign project Grudge there there&#x27;s a whole history behind this in terms of Academia that I think we need to overcome the stigma of to move forward now you and I have got a mutual friend Josh Josh York who&#x27;s an anthropologist who operates in that part of the world and he&#x27;s in touch with a lot of the Aboriginal communities across that desert area um I was fascinated when I first spoke to Josh he told me that it is a big thing in the Aboriginal communities that they frequently see what they describe as structured craft hovering over the landscape at times black triangles and it fascinated me because I start my book in plain sight with an account of a young woman who was at the Harold e Hulk Naval communication station when it was an American base and there was a gigantic triangular craft that hovered adjacent to the base over a road leading up to the base and she told this chilling story about how when she was asked to come into the base to talk to officials about what had happened that night when she and two police officers had seen this gigantic hovering craft it was quite obvious to her that the base personnel and more importantly the people who&#x27;d been flown in from overseas from American Military overseas and civilian Personnel they knew full well about these objects and the whole intention was to try and cover it up and shut it down is it a plausible possibility that what we&#x27;re seeing is some kind of American testing of prototypes I mean the thing that fascinates me about her story is a lot of the accounts from the Aboriginal community in that part of the Western Australia desert and over the Northwest Cape they started when our good friend George NEP started reporting on Area 51 Groom Lake the Nevada test range and all of a sudden the um cover of Groom Lake was blown as a place where you could safely test military prototype Vehicles is it possible that what you&#x27;re seeing and what the Aboriginal Community are seeing are some kind of secret military technology perhaps being tested in the Australian arback by the Americans I think we could I think there&#x27;s a lot of speculation in there yes the the indigenous communities have had a long history uh because I&#x27;ve talked to Josh myself and I&#x27;ve met with him and and a couple of indigenous people up there talk about objects and even around Minds sites up there we&#x27;ve got conversations and pubs about objects and lights and unusual lights at night and and there a particular person at a mindsight up there sent me some photos of physical what I think is physical craft uh as well in terms of discs and cylinders I didn&#x27;t see a triangle can we see can we see those photographs that was one thing you hadn&#x27;t sent me just yet but can we see those images of the that the person I&#x27;m trying I&#x27;m trying to get the highr ones because they were low res off the phone so the when they were sent it reduced the file size so I didn&#x27;t want to send those because it&#x27;s they&#x27;re too pixelated uh so I&#x27;m still waiting to liaz and and get more of the highr versions of so in anti in anticipation of us getting them can you talk to those photographs and tell me what you see yeah um because I got a little bit of video um sent to me as well around this mindsight because I won&#x27;t talk about companies and and naming Minds sites it&#x27;s um that wouldn&#x27;t be professional but around a particular mindsight there&#x27;s an increasing occurrence of uh objects in the night sky and during the day uh this the typical rainbow colored one that&#x27;s been filmed at night that I&#x27;ve got a bit of footage of that just changes flashes a whole lot of different colors and moves up and below the Horizon uh there was a another footage of a large the silver cylinder one that people talk about uh I&#x27;ve got some footage of that just hovering in the night sky and there was another one uh in the in the M pit during the day and often the distance up against or close to one of the walls of of the pit uh that had a had a more of a jellyfish like um structure to it but what this person did say was that they I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s they&#x27;re more aware of them now so they&#x27;re seeing them more or Mine Workers uh reporting an increased uh presence or activity around around that area because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s broad it&#x27;s around the area outside of these mines as well so it&#x27;s they might be seeing objects that are a few miles away um from from where they&#x27;re working there are actually quite a few fans of reality check way out there in that West Australian desert because they send me their own images of what they&#x27;re seeing over their remote abortional communities and a lot of what they&#x27;re describing is what you&#x27;re describing um spheres silver spheres silver tubes what in Earth are they Andrew yeah if you if you do your research historically and you go back to pre and postor War II um there is the um what I call the pop culture narrative and then there&#x27;s the uh the the um scientific narrative so in the pop culture narrative they talk about you know flying sources and and cylinders I think there&#x27;s a couple of books is it David child dress has written books about that whole uh Nazi Germany narrative for flying sources and cylinders so so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a potential there for technology that&#x27;s already been seconded away uh in the private Aerospace sector uh proved and tested uh so there could be that as well and that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve had these hearings in the US and Congress about all this as well about who&#x27;s got this technology and why why why aren&#x27;t we aware of it have our adversaries got hold of it and are they are they doing better than us so there&#x27;s that maybe the Australia maybe there isn&#x27;t a presence up there that&#x27;s a bit of both uh nhi and human engineered technology that with or without the help of nhi the triangles I I they&#x27;re up there because I&#x27;ve been like you I&#x27;ve been sent a photo of triangle lights in the skies by community members up there uh in the clouds as well and I&#x27;ve seen a couple of objects myself uh one at night one during the day uh that were of a different structure so and I think there&#x27;s a difference too cuz obviously the engineered ones you know it&#x27;s u a structure that&#x27;s been assembled and it tends to be the nhi ones have no external features that show that they&#x27;ve somehow been been uh assembled let&#x27;s talk about what you referred to earlier the peo electric effects in rocks I&#x27;m I&#x27;m searching here for prosaic explanations and um one of the things that really struck me when I was in Egypt was there was a lot of talk about the quartzite in Granite and the piso El electric effects of granite uh carrying a lot of quartzite that they are in in many ways conductive or attractive of electrical energy um can you develop that hypothesis for me how might a piso electric effect in rocks help or assist in an understanding of the uaps we&#x27;re talking about yeah we talk uh I think it was in the third paper that we&#x27;ve published to research gate we talk about energy Cascades uh enhancing uh the phenomena up there through natural accumulation of Electric electrical energy so with the courtz site uh you&#x27;ve got mag you&#x27;ve got highr um magnetite there uh which is has a magnetic field you&#x27;ve got quartz site uh which has a Under Pressure quartz under pressure generates an electric field so when uh and uh the pill is a Katon so it&#x27;s one of the oldest rock formations on the planet so in terms of pressure and movement uh you&#x27;ve got the excess electrical and magnetic energy in that whole area anyway and combine that with freezing and thoring of water deep in the rock formations because it&#x27;s a desert climate that generates pressure friction and electrical energy as well so that all comes up out of the ground uh and and can coales and that&#x27;s why they talk about these naturally occurring uh spheres small spheres that can that can form from concentrated a M energy well that that&#x27;s what I was going to ask I mean is it is it possible that the orbs and rods that you&#x27;re seeing are something caused by the pzo electric effect of rocks simply rubbling rubbing together that we don&#x27;t need a an nhi explanation for this that it could just be a geological explanation as I know they&#x27;re looking for at hin in in Norway as well you know everybody&#x27;s still looking for a a possible geological explanation to explain the phenomenon that occurs in this Valley in in Norway called hin yeah um and I I compare and contrast hin lights in in the papers that Brian and I have written um and I think even even in in uh is it uh toorani and his papers talks about the potential for that that naturally occurring phenomena to mask the presence of any technological phenomena as well I the same could well apply we need more research to look at that but uh there is the potential for that up there but what I found is some of the the K the kinematics and morphologies of some of some of these orbs and rods don&#x27;t demonstrate a random a random a random pattern of movement that you could associate with a naturally occurring phenomena which implies that there must be some form of intelligence that is um connected to some of these orbs and rods and I think to danani and his papers and his work um poses that question as well is that do the kinematics in here Stalin demonstrate an intelligence is there a mixture of both in there and we simply don&#x27;t know at the moment we we need more more fieldwork and more instrumentation to separate the two if they if they are mixed together in this in this area is one of the things that you would cite as evidence of intelligence that when you point your infrared camera at these objects object and start detecting them um I think you&#x27;ve described it as a phase shift they appear to change phase and change shape or form in some way yeah yeah uh the fa phase shifting was interesting because I&#x27;ve if they were just going on in and out of the field of you you you you couldn&#x27;t you couldn&#x27;t say much about it but when I went back through and looked at the frame capture analysis and at some of the videography they would manifest in physical space in the field of view and we and in my third paper we show some frame capture of that of an infrared this orb just appears and coalesces as a light as a light ball out from out of out of nowhere uh so it&#x27;s not coming through the field of you it&#x27;s actually manifesting in the field of you uh the rods are too fast to do that because I don&#x27;t have high again we talk about highspeed uh cameras to do that but the uh ORS were moving slow enough and manifesting slow enough that we did capture that on film and so if that was but again is that a naturally occurring light bu was that uh form of intelligence so it&#x27;s what we we can&#x27;t separate the two at the moment because you know the light the large light the large orb that you&#x27;ve got video of moving through the field of view when I first went up there that&#x27;s a lot B bigger and and it has a completely different morphology to a smaller one as well so they&#x27;re not all the same can I just ask this for a beer with a very small brain if light is light those orbs are clearly some kind of light or energy or plasma do you agree yeah yeah there there is some kind of energy there light ball plasma some form of energy why can&#x27;t we see them on anything other than infrared I I this is where I put forward to Dr Tyson the energy Cascade hypothesis within an inter dimensional anomaly is that to go from invisible to infrared to the visible spectrum requires a certain amount of of energy to manifest in physical space so I put forth that as a theory is that and I think toot R talks about this too uh that the level of energy required to be in the infrared spectrum and the visible spectrum is different so and if they&#x27;re harnessing energy externally which is another model we put forward not generating it themselves then they&#x27;re totally dependent within that temporal anomaly on available energy uh and energy Cascades as to how how intensely they manifest so I&#x27;m recording them in the 850 Spectra nanometer Spectra uh and it may simply be that the the the intensity of energy required to manifest and the light Vis visible spectrum is not enough so so do you need more or less energy to show in infrared than you do invisible light uh I&#x27;m still researching this but I think in terms of energy Cascades it&#x27;s more so I think I think because yeah I&#x27;ll have to go and do some more research on this but because I&#x27;m still talking to Dr Tyson about about plasma and light Bull and and energy Cascades within this anomaly if it is a temporal anomaly uh because appears the more the more you move away from the site the less of these objects there are they still have the same intensity but there&#x27;s less of them so where where&#x27;s the energy coming from uh for the for that number to manifest and concentrate radially around a certain area uh and there&#x27;s that energy intensity like you said related to their ability to manifest uh is it are they choosing or are they just choosing not to manifest visibly is there a uh Dr Tyson even talked about um what he called conscious or the observer effect uh in in quantum mechanics is that you observe something and therefore it&#x27;s matter and when you&#x27;re not observing it it&#x27;s a waveform so there&#x27;s that whole area of physics as well as is the Observer having an impact on the manifestation and and one of the final questions Andrew do do the things you see the orbs and rods do you only see them at night uh yeah but that&#x27;s mainly because of the gear I&#x27;ve got um I do Electric magnetic field density right through um day and night uh but the infrared camera I&#x27;m setting up to film uh an infrared uh at night so daytime yeah what is it possible that they are showing themselves in the daytime it&#x27;s just you don&#x27;t have the type of camera that could pick them up because the infrared would be lost against the daytime heat yeah exactly yep and I think that&#x27;s where if we get into more fieldwork and a proposal to develop this further with with better technology that we can set up um sensor arrays 247 and look at uh other the full spectrum because we&#x27;re we&#x27;re very limited with 850 n nanometer Spectra and EM field intensity just what about the uh the rest of the infrared Spectrum the visible spectrum even the ultraviolet Spectrum what would you need to be able to measure them during the day high-speed cameras hyperspectral cameras what would you need yeah we need hyperspectral cameras so we can do day and night uh alongside em field intensity and also the radar arrays as well to see if there is a signature from an are they an actual object so we&#x27;ve got the um hyperspectral cameras you&#x27;ve got your em field intensity you&#x27;ve got your radar a uh I think we&#x27;d be getting a lot further along the track in terms of what is going on there we all we can say definitely is something is going on here it&#x27;s anomalous uh it may or may not be naturally occurring and there seems to be some form of intelligence attached to it so we&#x27;ve written three papers on that put forward our theories behind the data suggested a way forward and put place it in the context of the scientific liter literature globally uh and in particular the hisen light research with the exception of um hin and the work of mimo Torani the Italian scientist that you&#x27;ve mentioned a couple of times is anyone researching these orbs and rods around the world I&#x27;ve had uh this this anecdotal evidence on from YouTubers and and there&#x27;s also there&#x27;s also historically I found on on the internet people have written books on and called them um spirits that have passed over um there&#x27;s this whole uh that whole side of it too and I I I stayed away from that I said look this this&#x27;s a science to all this uh some people have connected these ORS to to spiritual path over spiritual the spiritual side of things and I think yeah there&#x27;s a conscious Consciousness Connection but let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let&#x27;s be scientific and you know just because we don&#x27;t understand something let&#x27;s not turn it into religion let&#x27;s keep with the science and and find out what the Sciences uh are behind it all and I again I allude to the fact that there is there&#x27;s a missing branch of science in the public Arena that I think other people are well aware of what do you think that missing branch of science is Dr Andrew Morgan yeah we had a discussion about this the book the book I my book on my life is an experience of the book on UAP coming out next year and all my background research and one word actually three words I could sum it up is field repulsion science uh everything seems to be connected to to that and if it&#x27;s so highly coveted why and we had the conversation about I SC of weapons technology uh even to go back to Maxwell&#x27;s original Quan notation where time is a scale of fourth dimension and that&#x27;s all been taken offline and modified as well so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s something missing across all of this so do you think some science is being actively suppressed by some in the scientific establishment or is that too big a call no I I I think yes and no I think there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a naivity uh about it because you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know and the ones that do know uh that&#x27;s maybe career ending or not a good idea and then there&#x27;s Counter Intelligence as well so because if you go back through and look at all the stuff that&#x27;s been taken offline and there&#x27;s a stigma around it people&#x27;s careers have been altered changed or they&#x27;ve disappeared or not working on anymore and they&#x27;re all in that area of research is is dis rotating dis technology counter rotation field repulsion and and go to I&#x27;ve gone into Russian work and even um torsion Fields a lot of the torsion field research is is by Russian scientists in in nature uh and in terms of Technology application and that&#x27;s all connected to field repulsion science as well so where where is all the science why is it not in universities in high schools uh connected to special relativity and quantum mechanics so where is it because the big thing that fascinates me is even physicists like Eric Weinstein admit that there&#x27;s a huge hole in modern physics that string theory doesn&#x27;t work it doesn&#x27;t explain the known universe we&#x27;ve got a huge problem with modern physics and for much of the last 60 to 70 years it&#x27;s struggled to explain a unified physics theory that actually explains the whole universe um what do you think this field propulsion technology is exactly to can you explain that to a lay person without making our heads explode yep yeah it&#x27;s key it&#x27;s key to to make sure we call it field repuls not propulsion so field repulsion uh and it&#x27;s all to do with um uh go back to Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic atom uh and spin a subatomic Spin and electron spin uh and and everything spins and when when you generate an electric field from that uh you generate a repulsion so if you looked at do Dr ning&#x27;s dis technology same sort of thing getting that that that spin technology to generate a repulsive field uh you go to um Victor Victor Shaw&#x27;s uh implosion Drive spinning disc uh again generating a field around it which allows it to shoot up in the air at in in instantaneously uh and then Otis car same sort of thing uh with uh with with uh uh field repulsion so generating a spin and a repulsive field so that&#x27;s that seems to be where this scap is but I I go I think we need to have a conversation about the relationship between Einstein and Maxwell because I&#x27;ve been researching this and what happened to Maxwell&#x27;s Quan notation uh and scale of time I think it all started from there whether that was on purpose or inadvertently because heavyside turned it into Vector calculus and then Einstein that got a special relativity from from all of that um but Max and Einstein knew each other so Einstein must have known about Maxwell&#x27;s Quan mathematics because he was a genius mathematician and helped Einstein so has that been taken offline what happened to it why is why are we not talking about scale of time and field repulsion U since then and every time it has been bought up it&#x27;s it&#x27;s disappeared so by whether by Design or oversight a science is being suppressed I I I think so and and maybe there&#x27;s good reason for that but we&#x27;re at a stage now where we can acknowledge that yes you can hold on to the technology but give us our science back please because we need to understand how How the Universe works and I think uh understanding the fourth dimension is going to uh in terms of what I&#x27;ve just talked about is going to unravel or bring back what Eric Weinstein was talking about in terms of our missing science and understanding deep space travel uh and hopping around space and and not moving through physical space to get to somewhere that takes hundreds of years to get because that&#x27;s never going to happen I think people are well aware of it well Dr Andrew Morgan I think your little adventures in the pillur desert examining mysterious orbs and rods May one day provid us with an answer to that big question and I sincerely hope it does Dr Andrew Morgan thank you so much for joining reality check um I think all of us would like to see your research continue it&#x27;ll be great to see your um uh work better funded so that you can get the equipment you need to do the kind of research that&#x27;s needed to definitively get a result and hopefully get you published in a peer review journal yeah thank thanks a lot Ross I think we have more questions than answers at the moment but I I look forward to what the future holds so thank you very much [Music] thanks for watching go to join nn.com to find newsnation on your television provider
