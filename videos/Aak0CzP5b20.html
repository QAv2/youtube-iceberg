            <p>so this is Ari to go he patented technology on free energy he was headed to the airport to go meet some investors but he never made it to his flight because he was found dead in his car that&#x27;s random this is Stefan marinov he is the leader of the European free energy movement in 1997 he had a major breakthrough and as they were working on their prototype he was found dead what yeah apparently he fell out of a window this is Dr John Mullen he is a nuclear physicist that worked for one of the largest military contractors in the world apparently he discovered something really big in the realm of energy but unfortunately before he could come out with this information he died from arsenic poisoning but don&#x27;t worry his girlfriend was the primary suspect um she was actually found dead in her apartment as well um they didn&#x27;t go after any other suspects case closed this right here is Demitri petronov he invented a plasma battery that powered his two-story house for 14 months one day he went to go get bread from a bakery and was never seen again Zachary Warfield was also working on a plasma battery he had actually met with Demitri a couple of times where they would exchange notes he mysteriously died in a boating accident in Washington DC Eugene Malo was an expert physicist in Cold Fusion he claimed to have a working prototype of a free energy device but the day before he was going to go public he was beaten to death That&#x27;s So Random Rory Johnson invented a cold fusion motor that generated over 500 horsepower the department of energy took a restraining order against his technology so he could never publicize it and you&#x27;re never going to get guess what happened to him everyone who knew him said he was super healthy had no health issues but he died mysteriously Mark Toman was awarded a patent for a zeropoint Energy System after he developed his working prototype he was found mysteriously dead and the crazy thing is his research is missing what or you might recognize this one this is Stan Thompson he developed a car that ran off of water after developing his working prototype he went to go to lunch with two investors so that he could gain money to push this technology out there he died during lunch his last words were been poisoned Nicola Tesla believed he could make free energy and all of his research was funded by Guess Who JP Morgan when he claimed to have figured it out and he wanted additional Capital so that he could expand his inventions JP Morgan shut him down I&#x27;m sure it has nothing to do with the fact that JB Morgan owned General Electric he owned copper mines he owned rubber Mills convention secrecy act allows the United States government to classify ideas and patents under secrecy orders which indefinitely restrict public knowledge of them the government gave itself the authority and power to classify ideas the law applies to all inventions in the United States regardless of what the idea or invention is if a patent is applied for or granted all patents filed within the United States are required to be reviewed any federal government agency with classifying Powers May request any patent to be restricted under invent vention secrecy act so let&#x27;s talk about who might be those uh government agencies who have classifying Powers well the dod Department of Defense you know that includes the Army the Navy the Air Force now the space force the Central Intelligence Agency the National Security Agency the Department of Homeland the department of energy the FBI the Department of State the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Department of Justice so you have it pretty much everybody that oversees anything of any significance in this nation has the power to classify under the invention secrecy act ideas restricted by The Invention secrecy acts secrecy orders can be prohibited from any public disclosure sales to any party except the United States military industry any appeals are limited to the United States Federal agency that itself restricted the idea a Declassified document from January 1971 the patent security category review list lists the categories of all inventions that the United States patent office would refer to the armed services patent Advisory board for consideration of becoming classified under the invention secrecy act the highlevel categories of inventions from 1971 which can be forcibly classified are listed as the foll each section includes an expansive spectrum of topics beneath so we&#x27;re going to look at what categories can be classified in terms of inventions and ideas so amplifiers recorders sensors and electronic tubes this is interesting that there is a need to classify top secret amplifiers and Recorders yet they put it there computers so which also means that whatever technology we have available in our computers is most likely not even a fraction of what truly is available because most of it probably gets classified and only used by government agencies and the military concealment Communications counter measures and counter counter measures I get that contract this was a peculiar one so if you have any ideas or inventions around contracts then that might fall under the secrecy act and those ideas might be classified secret very strange of course exposable INF flammables don&#x27;t get me wrong but then it gets really strange m mapping charting and geodyssey what could possibly be so dangerous about mapping charting and geodesy what is geodyssey geodyssey is the science of measuring and understanding the Earth&#x27;s shape size orientation in space and gravity field this is sort of very peculiar and interesting so they say that they have the right to classify any inventions and ideas that pertain to geodyssey the science of measuring and understanding the Earth&#x27;s shape size gravitation in space positioning in space and so forth but not just the Earth but other planets too now I&#x27;m asking you how could that be dangerous to National Security military photographies missiles navigation equipment that&#x27;s another one that&#x27;s strange to me why you would have to classify navigation equipment what could danger could that possess or oppose power supply and propulsion systems propellants and fuels and vehicles so these are extremely potent categories right but let&#x27;s look a little bit further here as of 1971 a list of restricted Technologies included solar photovoltaic generators with efficiencies above 20% so if you develop a solar generator that has a higher efficiency than 20% Then this would be deemed a restricted technology under the invention secrecy act energy conversion systems with conversion efficiencies exceeding 70 to 80% were also subject to review and potential restriction the exact criteria for screening patent applications under the ISA The Invention Security Act remain classified and have been denied under the Freedom of Information Act if we can make Power production efficient or conversion beyond the 70 to 80% range we&#x27;re not going to roll this out to every household we&#x27;re not going to let the people know we&#x27;re not going to let Humanity know no we&#x27;re going to classify it and suppress it</p>
