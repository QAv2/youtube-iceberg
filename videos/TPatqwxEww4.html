            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas and we do educational material here and um today I believe it&#x27;s the 105th episode of uh working on the reciprocal system of theory and uh we probably will uh do other subjects here in the meantime but we&#x27;re going to be doing probably a few hundred more videos on the reciprocal system as well because I think it&#x27;s that important but we&#x27;re getting the end of this particular book which is called Beyond Space and Time by Dewey B Larson and Dewey B Larson is the originator of the reciprocal system of theory back in the 20th century starting around 1930 when he had his first um inklings of all of this and then he uh gradually developed the theory by in induction over the course of the next 25 years came out with his fundamental postulates uh in the 1950s the main uh gist of the fundamental postulates is that in Larson&#x27;s universe the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion and for Larson motion uh was the relationship between space and time any kind of uh motion is some kind of relationship between space and time and that relationship is implied in a ratio and it also implies that space and time are the same they are reciprocals of each other so they&#x27;re the same in quality but they are inverted the uh in the same way that two-thirds and three halves are inversions of one another and uh time and space do not exist in and of themselves they only exist together in motion and uh time and space both have multiple dimensions three or more Dimensions Larson said three uh but he kind of admitted that uh there were other kinds of geometry where they could be larger uh and uh also that time and space are both progressing they flow they&#x27;re always getting time is always getting later and later space is always getting further and further apart and that time and space are both only in discrete units there&#x27;s no con continuity there&#x27;s no um you know one hundredth of a unit or you know 0.26 of a unit there is only one and then there&#x27;s two and then there&#x27;s three uh and one unit of time in one one unit of space per one unit of time is the speed of light and the speed of light unlike Einstein uh saying that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe for Larson and Larson&#x27;s Universe of motion the speed of light is the default it&#x27;s the midpoint of it&#x27;s the null point and the origin of this universe and there is in fact half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light as well as the half that we&#x27;re familiar with uh that he calls the material sector or sector one that moves uh slower than the speed of light that is the world of chemistry and physics and uh mostly the the world that we&#x27;re familiar with and uh Larson calls the half that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light sector two or the cosmic sector now sector one grows and Aggregates by um bonding aggregation and uh up to its most complex level which is DNA DNA has uh mil billions of atoms per molecule at that level it becomes complex enough to be able to accommodate a unit from sector two the cosmic sector that unit from sector 2 controls the unit from sector one in the same way that a thermostat controls a room it&#x27;s just a very small part of that room but it controls the environment and that is the same way that the DNA molecule Works under control of sector two and that is what Larson refers to as the life unit and that life the life units start out as single-celled organisms such as amoeba and um virus and um eventually evolves and develops up to its most complex level which Larson says is the intelligent human being and at that point the intelligent human being becomes uh able to accommodate uh overall control by a unit from sector three now for Larson sector 3 is the area the region that is outside of space and time are independent of space and time uh I would suggest that he is pointing to this actual the speed of light the one over one region where all those space and times just disappear and you just have uh the one and um other people probably would have called sector three God or goddesses or gods or um you know um spiritual World religious world numinous uh but uh Larson called it sector three he said that sector three is always good and only good and he says that sector three commit communicates uh with uh uh an intelligent human being uh but and those messages are always correct but uh through things like intuition ESP uh scientific Insight religious Revelation but that the human beings uh ability to decode those messages to understand those messages translate those messages is very limited uh because you have to think of the human being as kind of like a single-celled um spiritual organism we&#x27;re just getting started on our spiritual journey we just got to the point where we are uh complex enough to uh get those messages and so we&#x27;re not Adept yet at at decoding those messages intuition uh the messages can be very simple and so they&#x27;re kind of universally decodable but for things like scientific insight and religious Revelation they&#x27;re much harder to decode and require a great deal of dedication uh concentration and prep ration to be able to decode those messages and most of us aren&#x27;t there yet but we are on our way and so in his final book here beyond space and time that came out in 1995 five years after his death um he goes over all these different sector three phenomena and we are in uh I think the third to last chapter that&#x27;s called um the the road ahead and he&#x27;s looking um I think that&#x27;s what the chapter is called and he&#x27;s looking at uh uh kind of making the yes kind of making the comparisons uh between Communications from sector two and communication from sector three and what kind of what it entails uh to be able to decode these messages from sector three so we&#x27;re going to start out with Larson right here his own words uh coming from chapter 26 of beyond space and time there is however an important difference in the way in which the necessary information is transmitted the new biological organism gets its instructions automatically and a cell is supposed to develop into a Cocker Spaniel uh that is supposed to develop into a cocker spaniel does so develop barring accidents without any direction from the individual okay now when he&#x27;s talking about biological organism a cell and so on that&#x27;s sector two okay so that is the communication that is the um control from sector two uh the cosmic sector the faster than light sector but this is just the life unit on the other hand now he&#x27;s talking about sector three on the other hand a new sector three unit does not get its know-how automatically the information is available to be sure but access there to may be too difficult or as it is received the truth may be so mixed with error that it is not possible to distinguish clearly between the two hence unlike the biological situation where the potential normally becomes the actual as a matter of course Improvement of the ethical component of the human personality requires a continuing application of effort both by the individual and by those who have the responsibility for imparting the required information to him when we recognize that the ultimate goal of existence is to bring the entire human race and all intelligent extraterrestrial beings as well up to the sector 3 standard which few individuals if any have yet reached it is clear that the road to the ultimate objective is a long and difficult one even at best achievement of the goal will require an extremely long time the available evidence indicates that many billions of years were required for aggregation that&#x27;s uh sector one the ruling process in the inanimate sector sector one to produce a DNA molecule from the original hydrogen and at least a few billion years were required for evolution sector two the ruling process in the biological sector to produce man from the most primitive life form uh although there may again be some speeding up of the development process as we go from sector two to sector three just as there was in going from sector 1 to sector two it seems probable that the time which ethical Perfection the ruling process in sector 3 will require in order to complete the transformation of the various forms of intelligent life from a condition only slightly above that of an of the animals to the full status of ethical beings will not be less than a period of hundreds of millions of years and it may very well be considerably longer uh just saying I I&#x27;m questioning all of these timelines and um you know he&#x27;s making assumptions that these original um timelines are correct that it took billions of years for the aggregation and at least a billion years for the uh Evolution and um I think those are very questionable uh Dr Bruce paret one of the people who came along and uh resurrected Larson&#x27;s Theory after he died corrected a few of his errors and uh really uh moved the theory forward before his death back in 2020 uh agreed with that and he um he looked at some of these timelines and he kind of cut them by in some cases like a factor of a thousand so maybe when he&#x27;s saying hundreds of millions he might just mean be meaning hundreds of thousands or maybe even less um but that&#x27;s just my point of view so back to Larson The crucial question then is what can we do to accelerate this painfully slow process there are two primary tasks to be accomplished first the requirements for progress toward the ultimate goal must be defined more clearly and in greater detail then the individual members of the human race whose advancement toward the sector 3 status is the objective at which we are aiming must be acquaint acquainted with these findings and persuaded to put them into practice as the activities of society are now organized at least in the west these are the responsibilities of philosophy and religion respectively it is true that there are major differences of opinion as to the proper role of philosophy and its connection with religion some observers regard them as separate and distinct one author said philosophy is one phase of human culture religion is another but the relation between the two fields of thought is clear if we compare their content the subject matter of the usual philosophy courses in the universities consists of epistemology the branch of learning that treats of the nature of knowledge Logic the methodology of reasoning metaphysics here used in a narrow sense in which it is concerned with reality and existence ethics which deals with the standards of human behavior and Aesthetics which explores the factors that affect man&#x27;s appreciation of beauty logic is procedural rather than substantive and the status of Aesthetics in the general picture is still somewhat uncertain the other three of the subjects enumerated above are therefore the primary fields that philosophy currently undertakes to cover as expressed by one writer there are strictly three Universal constants existence knowledge and value on this basis back to Larson on this basis he reduces the essential content of philosophy to ontology the study of existence epistemology the study of knowledge and axiology the study of values uh the basics the basis of ethics for present purposes we will say that the foregoing constitute the subject matter of metaphysical and moral philosophy now for comparison let us ask what subject matter is treated by religion in general religion a religion gives us an explanation of the existence and ultimate Destiny of the universe and of man and an explanation of the origin of this and other religious knowledge and code of ethics that is it treats of existence knowledge and values the same items that are of most concern to the metaphysical and moral philosophers the subject matter of religion is thus essentially the same as that of the metaphysical and moral fields of philosophy uh and moral fields of philosophy furthermore religion arrives at the same kind of conclusions about these matters as philosophy and when we make due allowance for the wide diversity of opinions in both Fields much the same conclusions but there is a significant difference in methods and procedures the task in which the philosophers are engaged is primarily a search for knowledge religious organizations on the other hand regard the revelations received by their Founders as adequate sources of knowledge and they devote their energies to putting that knowledge into practical use when a philosopher reaches some conclusions regarding his subject matter he writes a book but when an individual receives or thinks that he receives a religious Revelation he initiates action he organized organizes A continuing and systematic program of persuading others to accept that Revelation as authentic and to pattern their lives accordingly accordingly religion says Abraham caplet is not merely an intellectual belief but something to live by we thus find that the relation between philosophy and religion is analogous to the relation between physical science and engineering or between the pure and applied branches of any science this fact may be expressed by the statement that religion is applied metaphysical and moral philosophy there will no doubt be some objection to the statement on the ground that the theoretical aspect of religion is theology rather than philosophy but theology is something quite different there is no considerable overlapping of the subject matter and theologians are to some degree philosophers as well but theology is not like philosophy primarily aimed at discovering new truths the theologian&#x27;s task is to explain and interpret the already existing system of religious thought to which his organization is committed an appropriate analogy from the physical field would be to compare would compare the product of philosophy to a textbook and that of theology to an operating manual it has often been pointed out much to the distress of many who do not like the idea that pure science is neutral it has no goals engineering and other applied sciences establish objectives or are assigned objectives by other agencies and they then proceed to take actions directed toward these objectives utilizing the information supplied by pure science for example the various factors entering into the mechanical properties of materials strength elasticity resilience Etc are evaluated by the scientists working in the Laboratories in the course of this activity they may determine that the elastic limit of a certain grade of Steel is 20 25 000 pounds per square inch this is what the philosophers call an is statement the expression of a fact as noted philosophical discussions have laid much stress on the point that ethical theory has no way of going directly from such an is statement to an ought statement the expression of an obligation but this is equally true in the physical field the mere fact that the strength of this particular steel is sufficient to support a load of 25 000 pounds per square inch does not tell us anything about how much of a load we ought to put on it of course if our objective is to design a structure that will withstand the load that will be imposed we ought to sole proportion the members that the elastic limit will not be exceeded at any time but if we are designing an overload device to prevent damage to a certain unit of equipment we ought to sole proportion the bolts or other fastening devices that the strength of the steel will be exceeded and the overload mechanism will come into play before serious damage is done thus the nature of the ought statement cannot be specified until an objective or goal is assigned okay I believe we&#x27;re gonna hold off here uh before getting into the next section and uh yeah so I think really when you look at Larson his his overall thing is he&#x27;s trying to really unite uh philosophy and religion science and religion and the reciprocal system is the ideal tool for that and I believe he had a great amount of success uh probably posthumously uh and uh he he laid the foundation for what we can do later as well okay have a great day thanks for tuning in</p>
