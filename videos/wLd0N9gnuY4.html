            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is a channel dedicated toward educational topics uh generally we look at um important theories of everything that you might uh not uh might have missed or you might not know be aware of and uh today is our 319th video on Dewey B Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system system of theory the reciprocal system of theory is a theory of everything that you know allows you to once you know the rules of the system you can apply the system to any subject that You&#x27; like not easy but um something that um Mr Larson shows how you can do it and um some of his followers have done the same um now uh Larsson lived in the US in the 20th century and in the late 1950s he came out with his two fundamental postulates um from which he ended up deducing an entire theoretical universe and then he wrote his books based on that theoretical Universe um the basic idea is that we here in this universe we live in a universe made entirely of motion and for Larson um motion was the relationship between space and time in fact when lson first put out his fundamental postulates in the late 50s he uh he actually used the term SpaceTime instead of motion uh he eventually changed that to motion and uh late in his life uh he died in 1990 he um also uh used the idea of just instead of motion of just change in three dimensions so that gives you just an idea of the the kind of the scope of this idea of motion SpaceTime but uh motion was the relation ship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other they don&#x27;t have any Independence any independent existence in and of themselves they only exist together in motion and basically motion is a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator there are uh a numerous different kinds of motion and each one of them has kind of a different uh time space um uh what&#x27;s the word time space configuration so for example speed which is the most basic motion that that most of us can think of is space divided by time the bicycle is moving 20 m per hour 20 mil of space in 1 hour of time space over time uh but then we also have uh for example acceleration acceleration uh I I dropped the ball out the window and it fell at 9.8 m/s squared 9.8 m of space and 1 second squared of time so space over time to the second power is acceleration uh these are the most obvious ones but then all of our other scientific phenomena also are relationships between space and time fractions uh such as matter itself matter is time to the third power over over space to the third power pressure is time over space to the fourth power energy is time over space uh and that reveals a little bit more about pressure as as well because if you have matter uh uh if you have uh energy is time over space uh you can think of that as it took me 2 hours to move that pile 25 ft F feet uh that is time divided by space and if you have pressure is time divided by space to the fourth power you can also then conceive of pressure as energy per volume as volume is space to the third power so uh pressure can be conceived of as energy per volume and then uh you could also put in the idea of force force is the conjugate of acceleration force is time over space to the second power and then you could also then think of pressure as Force per air area because area is space to the second power so pressure would also Not only would it be energy per volume but it would also be Force per area and then I suppose you could also say that force would be energy per space um so anyway you can play around with those uh once you kind of know those General configurations and uh come up with um kind of relevant uh ways of thinking of of some different ones these qu uh quantities now um larsson&#x27;s first postulate you know basically says the universe is made out of motion motion is a relationship between space and time space and time both come in three dimensions coordinate space and coordinate time space and time also come in progressing units or what Larson calls clock space and clock time that means the clock is always getting later and later and later time is always progressing it&#x27;s always flowing it&#x27;s getting later and later and later um this is a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction like a clock and then uh you also have uh what is um known as clock space clock space basically means that space is getting farther and farther and farther apart um and uh you would uh Envision this using a balloon with dots on it um an expanding balloon the balloon as you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction This is an outward scalar motion that is uh the progression of space or the flow of space uh Larsson also points out that you instead of using the expanding balloon if you want to fill in that third dimension he uses what you would he he says a a a rubber ball uh you could also use something like raisin bread um where when you put the bread in the oven all of the raisins when the when the bread expands all of the raisins move away from each other um and then space and time also have their uh have their uh quantized aspects they come only in discrete units there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you do not have space so too with time um so you have to have that full minimum unit a minimum unit of space is uh approximately 4.56 * 10us 8 m and a minimum unit of time is 1.52 * 10us 16 seconds so it&#x27;s a instantaneous kind of thing but that is one unit of time uh you could fit uh six quadrillion of them into one second and um if you have exactly one unit of space and you have exactly one unit of time then you have the speed of light so the speed of light is 1 over one equals 1 unit speed is what Larsson calls it and Larsson refers to this uh outward movement at the speed of light as uh the progression of the natural reference system uh we just uh went through a paper that he called reference systems and the uh you know whereas in in Legacy science the stationary uh the reference system is stationary uh we measure all our motions from zero you know the car is moving 20 M hour 20 mil from zero but in lson system the measurements are made from the speed of light outward in all directions so lson refers to that usually as space displacement that is the amount that you are uh moving that is displaced from that original um motion outward at the speed of light so in the universe of motion you have [Music] motion uh that precedes everything else so uh the state of rest of a universe of motion is a motion outward at the speed of light that is the state of rest okay so that that would be the origin or the zero point or The Ether um or the reference system is the speed of light outward in all all directions and you measure your motions from that and so that basically means that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light and then half is moving slower Larson refers to this as the cosmic sector and the material sector respectively and this also shows that in the einsteinian world the world the Legacy science uh folks follow um they only recognize the material sector and not the cosmic sector uh where Einstein says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe he is neglecting an entire half of the universe that Larsson refers to as the cosmic sector but even with our utter ignorance of the cosmic sector uh we can quickly make up the difference because of the reciprocal nature of space and time uh where in the material sector exactly what&#x27;s going on in the material sector is the same as what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector except that you have to invert the roles of space and time so for example in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and you have clock time the time is always getting later and later and later in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time three dimensions of time and you have clock space space is always getting later and later and later and so that is where you know you start with your phenomena in the cosmic sector in the material sector you have um also a sub region that he refers to as the time region and this is the region where you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space remember if you don&#x27;t have uh a full unit a full Quantum of space then you do not have space and if you do not have space that means that you have time because the universe is made out of space and time or the universe is made out of motion uh and so it has to be space or time or both and if it&#x27;s not space then it has to be time so that refers to the time region this is the region of uh action of less than one unit of space meaning that it refers to microscopic phenomena such as atoms and particles and molecules and in the cosmic sector you have a small region that is referred to as the space region and that is when you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time then you only have space and the space region is the region of action of um instantaneous um particles uh where you have um Cosmic atoms and Cosmic particles and Cosmic um molecules and uh Legacy science refers to these things as um uh antimatter um msons okay now that just gives you uh kind of an extended background on the reciprocal system today we&#x27;re reading uh an important paper that Larsson uh put down called the inter Regional ratio and the inter Regional ratio is a really difficult concept for a lot of people to grasp but the basic gist of it in my mind is that the inter Regional ratio is the statistical probability uh you could also use uh uh potentiality probability igen State um and it basically is what you lose in the translation when you take your measurements into a different region of the universe so you know we just talked about these four regions divided by three boundaries there&#x27;s the unit space boundary there&#x27;s the unit speed boundary and then there&#x27;s the unit time boundary the unit the unit speed boundary divides between the material sector and the cosmic sector the unit space boundary then divides off this time region from the rest of the material sector and the unit Spa uh the unit time boundary um or the space region divides off the space region from the rest of the cosmic sector so you really have three boundaries and four regions um we generally reside in the uh the material sector uh the the macro area of the material sector so when we want to make a measurement into the time region or we want to make a measurement into the SpaceTime region which is the um the half of the cosmic sector the macro half of the cosmic sector or the macro portion of the cosmic sector we uh we what we observe is not the full picture what we observe is just a small um percentage of or ratio of what is actually going on so we have to take what we observe and multiply it by the inter Regional ratio to get the actual picture of what&#x27;s going on so he&#x27;s about to explain that process so the inter Regional ratio ends up being very fundamental into making um uh making measurements especially when you look at maybe like his book the uh basic properties of matter when you&#x27;re determining things like the interatomic distance or when you&#x27;re determining things like like the uh atomic weight of particles um you you you&#x27;re you&#x27;re using the inter Regional ratio in all of those uh those determinations and the inter Regional ratio varies depending upon whether you&#x27;re applying it to a an atom or whether you&#x27;re applying it to a subatomic particle or whether you&#x27;re applying it to a photon U these are these are different inter Regional ratios and he kind of uh deres those things in this paper here okay so at the uh n this is how it starts inter the inter Regional ratio at the 1984 Isis conference in Salt Lake City a discussion of the inter Regional ratio concluded with an understanding that each of those concerned should write a statement of his ideas on the subject for publication in reciprocity which reciprocity is the journal that was founded to dedicated to uh the pursuit of the uh you know understanding of the reciprocal system what follows is dwey B Larson&#x27;s contribution to that okay so the first point that should be noted in connection with this ratio is that it is a basic physical constant like the gas constant the gravitational constant Etc conventional physical theory has no explanation for any of these constants it simply uses the measured values without attempting to explain where they come from or what they mean or even if they have any meaning um so this is an important point to just make be because it it again applies to really about the the history of science uh people skeptical so-called skeptical scientific people they gener generally when they look at the reciprocal system they try to pick it apart with every ounce of their being and so they&#x27;re you where is he coming up with that reciprocal where&#x27;s he coming up with that inter Regional ratio he&#x27;s not even D he&#x27;s not even explaining where it comes from but at the same time they&#x27;ve just accepted the gravitational constant and the gas constant without any questioning whatsoever you know even though they stand in the same uh in the state in they have the same standing uh they are constants and none of them have any type of um explanation backing them up but now Larson is actually going to provide the explanation for the re for the inter Regional ratio but there still isn&#x27;t going to be any type of explanation for the gas constant or the gravitational constant but these skeptical scientists out there are you know uh you know busy wasting their time uh poking holes in Larsson Theory where but they can&#x27;t turn the mirror on themselves and and apply the same standard upon their own theories okay if anyone has difficulty in following the theoretical derivation of the inter Regional ratio I would suggest following this prevailing scientific practice for the present and accepting this ratio as a measured value leaving its theoretical status to be considered later after more familiarity with the theory has been gained but I am going to provide the um you know the theoretical basis for it here but if you if if that&#x27;s too much for you just accept it as is and we&#x27;ll figure it out later this ratio can of course be measured in the same way that the other fundamental constants are measured that is by applying one of the relations in which it participates this is how I obtained it originally I measured it and used it in my studies long before I formulated the reciprocal system of theory and found a theoretical explanation for the measured value in order to appreciate the significance of the ratio it is necessary to have a reasonably good understanding of the basic features of scalar motion uh now just recall that um earlier this week uh within the last seven days or so uh I went through a paper that Larsson wrote that is called scalar motion so if you want to go back about a a handful of days uh I I think that paper went on for about four days um and so you can learn uh all of the basic features of scaler motion from that paper but basically scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction and scalar motion is something that is recognized by scientists but until Larson came around it was not recognized in its significance it was seen as kind of an anomalous uh you know random um outlier uh in regular scientific theory Larson put it toward the center of his uh Universe of motion the existence of this type of motion is not recognized by conventional science but there is an obvious oversight as scalar motion can be observed for instance we find that the distant galaxies are all moving radially radially outward away from our own Galaxy since we cannot justify assuming that our galaxy is the only stationary object in the universe we have to con include that we are likewise moving away from all of the other galaxies that is we are moving outward in all directions a motion in all directions is a motion with no specific Direction that&#x27;s the motion of the galaxies thus the motion of the galaxies is scalar from the postulates of the reciprocal system of theory we find that the basic motions of the universe are scalar simply relations between space magnitudes and time magnitudes once we have recognized that motion of this nature actually does exist even though conventional science does not recognize it as such the postulate that this kind of motion the simplest form of motion is the fundamental entity is entirely logical of course fundamental postulates have to be justified by their consequences but it helps to know that they are sound ly based in a three-dimensional Universe of motion there are necessarily three dimensions of motion that is what the adjective threedimensional means but only one dimension of motion can be represented in the three dimensions of space portrayed by the conventional reference system any Motion in this reference system can be represented by a vector and a combination of any number of such motions is a one-dimensional motion represented by the vector sum in order to grasp the significance of the expression three dimensions of motion the term Dimensions has to be interpreted in a mathematical sense that is um the forgoing expression refers to a motion that requires three independent quantities for a collective definition to distinguish these dimensions of motion from the dimensions of space or of time that can be represented in the conventional three-dimensional reference system I am calling them scalar Dimensions okay so this is the uh you know the key thing is uh and he went through this in his paper on scalar motion also is that in order to represent a onedimensional scalar motion you need three dimensions of space so that&#x27;s your whole coordinate system your ukian coordinate system is required just to represent one scalar Dimension and there are three scalar Dimensions which means that the other two scalar dimensions are outside of the realm of your reference system they cannot be represented by a [Music] three-dimensional coordinate cartisian [Music] um ukian uh reference system so um that shows you the limitations of our kind of geometrical representation scalar motion is not not geometrical it is mathematic uh you only have magnitudes you do not have directions and so uh scalar motion is represented by magnitudes and um our reference system is limited um and so depend you you you can use different reference systems to represent different things Larson uses the n what he calls the natural reference system and he says that is the reference system that the Universe actually conforms to that is uh the zero point the reference point is motion outward at the speed of light but the conventional scientists use your stationary reference system where the 0 point is zero motion from you know wherever it is that you&#x27;re measuring and and um you know you get different results depending on what reference frame you&#x27;re using and you can also reference you know you can measure from not only from zero space but you can also ref uh reference from zero time so um those are you know um fundamental points but so he&#x27;s basically attempting to construct conu A system that uh can compensate for the fact that the reference system is not giving us the full picture and that&#x27;s where a lot of this inter Regional ratio comes in we will resume uh this paper uh and finish this paper tomorrow and um you know again if if the derivation uh escapes you don&#x27;t worry about it just hang in there and um just accept it as is uh and then you can ask questions later that&#x27;s the key to the learning the reciprocal system is that sometimes things aren&#x27;t going to make complete sense because you just don&#x27;t have enough of the picture and you you&#x27;re too invested we are all too invested in the old paradigms and so there&#x27;s a lot of unlearning that needs to be done and um you know we&#x27;re always trying to fit our the new Concepts into the old Concepts but in some cases the new Concepts overrule the old Concepts and we have to set aside the old Concepts and so in terms of the reciprocal system it requires that we suspend disbelief uh just for a little while enough to become accustomed to the system and then we can wait it out on its merits um and and give it a fair hearing but we can&#x27;t really give it a fair hearing if we&#x27;re already invested in these old paradigms um so that is my advice about learning the reciprocal system and uh hope you follow that uh hope you at least take it seriously and uh thank you for tuning in today have a great night</p>
