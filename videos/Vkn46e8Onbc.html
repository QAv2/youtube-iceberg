            <p>remote viewing is the scientific term for clairvoyance using our sixth sense to get information about a distant place or object i was a straightforward laser physicist at stanford university i graduated my phd there and then i worked on a textbook graduate level textbook on quantum electronics and lasers and there&#x27;s nothing like writing a textbook on the subject to realize how much you don&#x27;t know and one of the things that struck me as i was working in the book was that we have a pretty good quantum description of all kinds of mechanistic inorganic interactions but we don&#x27;t have a quantum theory that even begins to touch on mind or that kind of thing from 1972 to 1997 during the cold war the cia funded what was known as the stargate program to test if remote viewing could be used as an intelligence tool the very first is not talking about one out of 100 the very first soviet facility we looked at uh was over in the soviet union and it turned out our remote viewer pat price in this case drew a picture of a crane and he said i&#x27;m lying in my back on top of a two-story building and this crane is rolling over my head and it&#x27;s so large that a man is only half a wheel height well when he told me that i i thought that was ridiculous but in fact it turns out that&#x27;s exactly what the site was like i don&#x27;t know if you can see here but uh in fact that little dot there is a man and so when we ask him well what do you think the site is used for he said well i think it&#x27;s for some space application it was only after the cold war was over and people from our country got to visit the location we found out in fact this was for space application the old-fashioned theory was that remote viewing had something to do with the brain sending and receiving electromagnetic brainwaves like a mental radio transmitter and so one way to attack that is to do experiments over longer and longer distances and we eventually did experiments over continents and didn&#x27;t see any degradation of the apparent quote esp data so this didn&#x27;t seem to matter so that seemed to be a structure against the electromagnetic idea the brainwave idea we then put people aboard submarines took them down to the bottom of the ocean there&#x27;s enough shielding of electromagnetic magnetic waves in sea water conductive sea water that should have blocked it out in fact the world viewers said oh this is quote psychically quiet i can do better than ever so the major area that we&#x27;re looking at actually is has to do with the fact that although empty space appears to be empty quantum physicists know it&#x27;s not really empty it&#x27;s uh full of what we call quantum fluctuation energy or vacuum energy pal thinks there is a mysterious energy pervading all empty space in the universe including the cells of our body and our brains he calls it vacuum energy or zero point energy it might connect us all in which case it might explain remote viewing it&#x27;s our liquid nitrogen tank yeah the reason it&#x27;s called zero point energy is that even if you were to cool the universe all the way down to absolute zero where all thermal motions get frozen out this energy still exists you</p>
