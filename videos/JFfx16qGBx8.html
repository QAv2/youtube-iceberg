            <p>ninety eight thousand dollars worth of this couple has a lot of debt they&#x27;re both teachers and work full-time and today I&#x27;m helping them come up with a deaf payoff plan so I&#x27;ve arranged their debts from smallest to large if they were doing this that snowball they will literally start at the top and work their way down until they pay everything off but notice how high these um interest rates are in some of these credit card debts so I I will not recommend that the snowball for this couple they only owe 366 dollars on this first debt so we will pay this one first and hopefully next month it&#x27;ll be paid off and then they can throw the 52 dollars roll it towards the next dead which would be the Discover Card which would be that number two then we&#x27;re gonna do the well Capital One and then the Wells Fargo card and then the car loan since they&#x27;re paying off their debt quickly they are going to be paying this off next month so they would take the 52 dollars that they would have been paying to sales every month and roll it over towards the next debt which is the Discover card</p>
