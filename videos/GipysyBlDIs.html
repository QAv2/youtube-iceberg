            <p>Top three urban legends in the USA. Three legends. Real clues. These aren&#x27;t just spooky stories. Each one left behind police files, newspapers, or even government memos.</p>
<p>Number three, Moth Man. In 1966, couples in Point Pleasant reported seeing a redeyed winged creature. A year later, December 15th, 1967, the town&#x27;s Silver Bridge collapsed, killing 46 people. The official investigation blamed a faulty eyebar, but many locals believe something more sinister was at work. Today, the town leans into the mystery with a museum, a statue, and a yearly festival.</p>
<p>Number two, the bell witch. For years, a family in Adams. Tennessee was tormented by an invisible voice that knocked, slapped, and even spoke full sentences. The story spread so widely it ended up in 1800&#x27;s histories and an 1894 book. And in 1931, Tennessee marked the site with a state historical marker, but skeptics say it&#x27;s just folklore, and believers can still tour the Bell Witch Cave.</p>
<p>Number one, Skinwalker Ranch. For decades, ranchers in the Anetta Basin in Utah reported strange lights in the sky, strange animals, and other high stranges. Then, in the late 2000s, a US Defense Intelligence Program funded studies here. We know this because of government letters and briefings, but what&#x27;s happening remains a mystery. Which legend would you spend a night at? Comment below and follow for part</p>
