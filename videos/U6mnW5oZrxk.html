            <p>a promise is a representation for a future value it&#x27;s represented as just a javascript object and it has three different states fulfilled meaning the value has successfully returned to the promise rejected meaning there was some error when trying to get the value so like a network request it failed and the promise is now rejected and then pending the premise hasn&#x27;t resolved with a value nor has it rejected it is still going to get the value in performing that task</p>
