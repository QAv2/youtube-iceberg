            <p>Compassionate, elegant, and fast becoming a style icon. She&#x27;s also witty, athletic, and playful with the public. Kate is widely acknowledged as the perfect princess of Wales. When she married Prince William, the excitement was felt across the nation. The first commoner to marry a future king for 350 years.</p>
<p>And while some reflected on the legacy that the previous Princess of Wales, Diana, had left behind, we must stop the landmines if we can. &gt;&gt; It is clear that Kate&#x27;s own journey has been influenced by the mother-in-law she never met. In this video, we will look back at how Diana&#x27;s actions have impacted Kate&#x27;s fashion choices, her role as a mother, and her work as Catherine, Princess of Wales. Succeeding from the women who held the title before, just how similar are these two women? And what has changed about the role of a British princess? Kate, what has she learned from Diana? In May 2023, at the king&#x27;s coronation, the eyes of the world were of course on the king, but also on William and Kate. As we saw them both in their ceremonial gowns and medals, it was a time to reflect on their new status as the Prince and Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>Kate occupied a central role at the ceremony. Stunning, regal, and clearly looking like a queen in waiting. Her ivory silk gown coated in silver embroidery by Alexander the Queen represented the four home nations. And most notably, she wore a pair of Diana&#x27;s earrings, a strong gesture to commemorate her memory and a symbol of the type of princess she would like to be. Kate started dating Prince William over 20 years ago, going from girlfriend to Duchess of Cambridge and now Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>and one day she will most likely be our queen. Many have drawn comparisons between Princess Kate and Diana, both beautiful young women whose lives were irreversibly changed from marrying into the British royal family. Diana was a global superstar, fronting magazine covers and during her time with the royal family, she amassed a loyal fan base around the world. While Kate&#x27;s presence is more subdued, there are some strong parallels with Diana we can see emerging. Kate herself has embraced these comparisons, but now she is carving her own path in her own unique way.</p>
<p>Her first official introduction to the institution was when William proposed and both did a press call for their engagement. We&#x27;ve been talking about marriage for a while, so it wasn&#x27;t a massively big surprise, but uh I took her up somewhere nice and uh in Kenya and uh and proposed. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s very romantic. There&#x27;s a true romantic in that. &gt;&gt; There is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Diana may not have been there physically, but she was on Kate&#x27;s hand symbolically. &gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s a family ring. &gt;&gt; Is a family ring. Yes. It&#x27;s my mother&#x27;s engagement ring.</p>
<p>So, I thought it was quite nice cuz um obviously she&#x27;s not been around to share any of the um the fun excitements of it all. that this was my way of keeping her sort of close to it all. &gt;&gt; An iconic blue sapphire, the exact same engagement ring Charles gave to Diana. It is clear Kate was aware of the importance of this gesture. &gt;&gt; Obviously, I would love to have met her and she&#x27;s obviously she&#x27;s an inspirational woman to to look up to.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a ring she wears everywhere and keeps close to her heart. At 28, Kate was sat alongside her partner, from whom she had been courting for 9 years. A stark contrast to 19-year-old Diana, who had been seeing Charles for approximately 6 months prior to their engagement announcement. The relaxed way in which Kate and William are with each other feels very different to the awkward romance exhibited by Charles and Diana. And I suppose in love, &gt;&gt; of course, &gt;&gt; whatever in love means.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Kate and William&#x27;s long courtship may have been because of lessons learned from Charles and Diana&#x27;s marriage. Kate had a long time to become accustomed to the royal way of life and see just what she was signing up for before she made a decision that would ultimately change her life. That&#x27;s kind of almost why I have been waiting this long is I wanted to give her a chance to see and to back out if she needed to um before it all got too much. &gt;&gt; And I&#x27;m I&#x27;m also glad that I&#x27; I&#x27;ve had the time to sort of to grow and understand myself more as well. So hopefully &gt;&gt; does that mean I &gt;&gt; hopefully good to a good job.</p>
<p>Yes. &gt;&gt; Good. Both Diana and Kate entered the royal family wearing the same ring, but their paths to get to that point were quite different. While Diana came from aristocracy, Kate and the Middletons are upper middle class, self-made business people from Barkshshire. Kate was raised in a loving home and went on to study history of art at St.</p>
<p>Andrews where she met Prince William. By contrast, Diana grew up next door to the palace, and both of her grandmothers were ladies in waiting to the queen. She was so young when she became involved with Charles, and people comment that he never quite saw her as his intellectual equal. Both relationships have come under intense media scrutiny. And prior to becoming part of the royal family, both Kate and Diana wereounded by the press.</p>
<p>Diana was often left to deal with cameramen on her own. &gt;&gt; Too long, &gt;&gt; whereas Kate was granted some support from the institution. Please turn around. &gt;&gt; Charles and Diana&#x27;s marriage was not a happy one. They separated in 1992, officially divorced in 1996, and a year later, Diana died in a car crash in Paris.</p>
<p>Kate would have been watching these scenes unfold on television like the rest of us. Her vision of Diana was formed much before she had ever met her son. It wasn&#x27;t just Diana&#x27;s love for the public that Kate has mirrored. It&#x27;s also her love for children. Kate&#x27;s role as a mother comes before her role as a princess.</p>
<p>Something Diana paved the way for. Breaking royal tradition, Diana had baby William in a hospital, whereas all other royals were born at the residence. Kate followed suit when she had George. Diana also insisted that baby William join them on their royal tour, his first photo call being in Australia. Similarly, this is where George had had his introduction to the press, but in the more casual setting of a play group.</p>
<p>Diana was fiercely protective of the boys and wanted them to experience a normal life. From queuing at McDonald&#x27;s to cinema trips and theme parks, she instilled a sense of fun in them. As part of their protection, Diana developed a relationship with the press to try to control the intrusion on their lives. Diana struggled under the limelight. But I was not aware of how overwhelming that attention would become.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Kate has found a way to keep the media attention at arms length, taking her own photographs and trying to control the narrative. Kate is echoing Diana&#x27;s energy and goodwill towards the public, displaying real empathy and warmth wherever she goes. Kate and William have a small portfolio of charities. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll all agree that the mental health of children and adults is one area where a long-term view will make a huge difference to generations in the future. Often choosing subjects that carry stigma, something Diana was praised for during her time.</p>
<p>Addiction can strike any who suffer stress in their personal or professional lives. &gt;&gt; Famously hugging people with HIV and visiting Angola to talk about landmines. &gt;&gt; Cuz I&#x27;m not a political figure. I I I am a humanitarian figure. &gt;&gt; Kate has carried on the royal lineage of supporting these charities and cultivating a positive relationship with the people of the UK and beyond.</p>
<p>In more recent years, Kate&#x27;s role as a style icon has evolved and similarly everyone can remember Diana for her chic outfits. For Kate, there are some choices which are clear homages to Diana&#x27;s style. Comparisons in the archive show you how much of an influence she has had. During the 80s and &#x27;9s, Diana regularly topped the best dress lists, and now Kate is being namechecked as someone in fashion to watch. She seamlessly blends high street and designer and has started what is known as the Kate effect.</p>
<p>After she wears a dress from the high street, it soon sells out. One dress that&#x27;s not so easy to get your hands on is the one she wore to the No Time To Die premiere, a gold gown by Jenny Pack. It caused quite a stir, some suggesting she upstaged Mr. Bond himself. Both Kate and Diana have used fashion to say something.</p>
<p>Most will remember Diana&#x27;s famous black dress and choker combination that she wore to the Serpentine. The revenge dress was what it became known as. This was after her divorce and coincided with an interview Charles was giving to ITV about his affair with Camila Parker BS. Kate has also had to experience some private drama between Harry and William. And while she hasn&#x27;t spoken about it publicly, she has shown great stoicism by appearing as a solid unit.</p>
<p>Most notably at the Queen&#x27;s funeral where she participated in a walkabout with Harry and Megan. Diana was seen as the royal rebel. But Kate&#x27;s approach is quite different, graceful, and unobtrusive. She understands the importance of the institution and is keen to repair any rifts. Perhaps that is what we shall see her do, act as a peacemaker and honor her mother-in-law&#x27;s legacy by mending the rift between her two sons.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think in the comments. Over the last few years, Kate has emerged as a confident princess, acknowledging that she will continue to embrace Diana&#x27;s memory in everything she does alongside her partner, Prince William. Of course, no one could forget Diana. But clearly now there is a new Princess of Wales, and that&#x27;s Princess Catherine.</p>
