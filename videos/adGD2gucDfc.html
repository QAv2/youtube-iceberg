            <p>Why is towns and brown always linked to UFOs? Thomas Townsen Brown had pioneered in the science of what he called electrogravidics which popular culture calls anti-gravity I think is more correctly called gravity control or inducing artificial gravity but finding a means of inducing gravity and and because of the nature of his work it had been associated with the study and curiosity about unidentified flying objects after years and years of talking about UFOs, he said, &quot;No, let&#x27;s call them aerial phenomena.&quot; But that&#x27;s the expression that Brown used to describe them. And and the inference that we&#x27;re circling here is that to whatever extent he became aware of these aerial phenomena, he wanted to try to identify what technology propelled them and to see what he could maybe fathom that he might be able to like reverse engineer from and whether it was associated with any of the technologies that he himself had explored in in the course of his research into the field that he called electrogravitics.</p>
