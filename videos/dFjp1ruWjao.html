            <p>so if some of the encounters are actually representing alien civilizations visiting us why do you think they&#x27;re doing so you suggested that perhaps it&#x27;s this study understand their own past right right what what what are some of the motivations do you think and again from from our perspective us as humans what motivations would we have when we approach other civilizations we might discover in the future well i think one motivation might be to steer us away from the precipice right or on the assumption that you know even if we make it past the precipice at least uh we&#x27;re not a bunch of psychopaths you know running around so maybe there&#x27;s a little bit of motivation there to make sure that your the neighbor that&#x27;s growing up next to you is not you know unruly um you know but i mean maybe it&#x27;s sort of a moral imperative like what we have with you know creating uh national parks where animals can continue to live out their lives in a natural way i don&#x27;t know i mean that would be i mean the problem is we&#x27;re imagining from a anthropomorphic viewpoint what an alien might think and as i&#x27;ve said before alien means alien right i mean not hollywood aliens but a whole different way of thinking and a whole different level of experience and let&#x27;s say wisdom hopefully that we could only hope to understand you</p>
