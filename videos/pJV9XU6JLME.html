            <p>okay what you&#x27;re gonna get right here this is me reacting to dr harold put off nuclear physicist owner of earth tech international works for time to long works with or did work with isn&#x27;t it is an um an ally of luis elizondo and christopher mellon melon carnegie mellon melon family robber baron melon um in the disclosure of ufos and what the government knows so this this guy this scientist this nuclear physicist dr harold put off um has been in the study of ufos with i got i&#x27;ve seen videos of him with uh colonel philip corso talking who wrote the day after roswell so this is my reaction to his speech in 2020 at berkeley so i&#x27;m doing i&#x27;m a multitasker i&#x27;m a huge multitasker i&#x27;m playing video games up here going on another tv over here this is my computer setup you&#x27;re looking at right here got another tv i&#x27;m playing video games watching movies all that stuff like that but i&#x27;m listening and you&#x27;re going to hear my reaction the stuff that dr harold put off who works for the ufo program had an employee who still works in um dr eric davis nuclear physicist that did work from the earth tech international that was at skinwalker ranch that you know he&#x27;s a consultant of the ufo program right now that&#x27;s dr eric davis who worked for this guy hero put off and that john peterson guy heard about him uh with cath catherine austin fitz uh who audited the black budget and supposedly catherine austin fitz was invited to a meeting with this guy john peterson right there this guy right here invited to a meeting with him where he asked her if he wanted to meet some if she wanted to meet some aliens and he&#x27;s part of the navy and bob was our work for the navy and what we&#x27;re getting now is the navy&#x27;s disclosure i don&#x27;t know i can&#x27;t imagine kind of what the what the ocean has to do with aliens if they&#x27;re if they actually have bases like um you know the unidentified inside america&#x27;s ufo investigation says that you know louis cells i know says they well they might have bases though they might be using water as a fuel because you could split the hydrogen from oxygen you&#x27;d be using hydrogen to power your craft or whatever but the guy john peterson is an interesting character runs a think tank a navy think tank and i watch this video of um richard dolan talking about how he asked catherine austin fitz who audited the black budget um if she want to meet some aliens he works for the navy same navy that&#x27;s disclosing ufos the same navy he&#x27;s he works for a think tank them so i&#x27;m gonna react to the video like i said i&#x27;m playing xbox and watching movies and a lot of things but i&#x27;m gonna hear it just like you hear it we both gonna react to it at the same time this is dr harold put off in the year 2020 talking about ufo crash retrievals retrieve materials and what the government knows so let&#x27;s pay attention let&#x27;s check this out this is going to be interesting to listen to to say the least very interesting um i mean he and i i remember we were sitting on a board together in las vegas and 27 times i went to las vegas in three years for weekends just to sit around with uh other and the reason why he&#x27;s an old friend of mine is because early on when i was doing some work in the department of defense and wandering around doing a project for the secretary of defense as a matter of fact looking at new ways to think about the future i ended up in some crazy place up in uh connect uh colorado where they were doing a new science convention and and it&#x27;s a whole different story on its own but it just blew my mind because i didn&#x27;t know what i was getting into and it was just crazy ufo things and all kinds of plants that talk to you and yeah it&#x27;s weird and uh you know what i&#x27;m talking about cleaning the surface and uh and anyway i heard about this thing about remote viewing and uh and it was this deep secret program right that the government had to use psychics to spy on the soviets and the russians and other such people and so i had enough clearances and stuff to poke around and knew how the system worked but i we&#x27;ve been friends and been involved and uh all things unusual for uh for a long time and the thing of course it brought us together in addition to remote viewing at the beginning was the our mutual interest in the whole ufos and alien life and the possibility that there was a whole lot more going on in this part of the galaxy than most people understood uh the importance of that uh relative to the kinds of reasons why we all come together here or in these styles that you all come together here is that we&#x27;re in this middle of this extraordinary transition uh and there&#x27;s a place 10 15 years from now when it&#x27;s a whole different kind of place that operates in a way different way and part of the reason of that is because almost certainly human beings have started to integrate themselves into the larger community of civilizations that led in this part of the galaxy and the reason why that&#x27;s going to happen is because of this man and some of his friends because they uh represent the opening uh to this whole disclosure process that uh about what the united states government has been doing under the table for a long time of course they&#x27;ve been lying to us telling us of course we don&#x27;t have to think about this stuff but they did and they were and what al and his friends are doing are trying to put that on the table and make that part of the legitimate conversation that we all have and in the process they facilitate this emergence of the transition of of humanity he&#x27;s a clone physicist and you know done a bunch of stuff and he can talk to you more about it but it&#x27;s just wonderful to have you with us thank you thank you [Applause] and as you&#x27;ll see from my uh message up here backstory and forward story there&#x27;s a back story about the government&#x27;s involvement and the ufo what we now call it uap an identified error phenomena program but there&#x27;s also a forward story where some of us who have been part of that program have banded together to try to get more data out for the public to have a conversation about so i&#x27;m going to cover both aspects let me begin with the back story anyone who follows the ufo area knows that you know starting in 1947 we supposedly had the roswell crash and whatever and there were a lot of people calling the air force and saying i&#x27;ve seen something in the sky and so on and the public pressure was so great that project sign was set up right for 47.48 to gather data from generally the public about of course was the longest running uh organization to investigate whether there&#x27;s anything that we should be taking seriously in what the blue book of people had found and they came to the conclusion there&#x27;s nothing here don&#x27;t worry about it nothing worth following up on and so basically public knowledge about any ufo program ended there and so between 1969 and roughly now if you sent something into the air force public affairs office and said well what are you learning about ufos what&#x27;s going on we shut that program down in 1969. truth however is that the very memo that shut down program written by general bonder had down in the fine print of the memo reports of ufos which could affect national security will continue to be handled through the standard air force procedures that affect national security handled separately this has been very much under the covers december 16th 2017 when suddenly there was a front-page story in the new york times talking about a program that has been going on called advanced aerospace threat identification program and we call it atip and this was absolutely amazing revelation they had good sources i was part of the program i thought they would never see the line today and suddenly there i am even and suddenly this big barrage of immediate publicity the thing to realize is that this is a game changer the reason was that the kind of people who are now coming forward which i&#x27;ve listed here excellent majority leader harry reid who actually founded the program top rated 15 pilots who are encountering what we call advanced aerospace vehicles department of defense and intelligence community officials began to come forward because of what had been revealed to answer questions and so suddenly this whole area via the media move from being just the tinfoil hack crowd for news on a friday afternoon when you don&#x27;t have anything to write about but suddenly oh my god you know there&#x27;s something really going on advanced aerospace threat identification program atec so everybody agency was concerned about threat from advanced aerospace vehicles crafts and drones of unknown aerospace so this was all done behind the scenes the rest of congress didn&#x27;t know the program was being set up so that that&#x27;s how that talk got started and once the news came out in the new york when they times things you gotta watch what they say you said advantage of the major political players that were involved yeah of course what are these things what are they what do you mean crap flying over the continental united states and we don&#x27;t know what they are the major threat they were concerned about the major thing they&#x27;re concerned about is future threat what happens if a potential terrestrial adversary say the russians the chinese or whatever achieve some significant breakthrough and develop game changing disruptive technologies based on their evaluations of the phenomena or maybe so what he&#x27;s saying is the threat he&#x27;s actually that the government is actually worried about is some potential adversary the russians the chinese make a breakthrough in studying these uh advanced aerospace vehicles of unknown origin that you see on the history channel so a terrestrial adversary suppose the russians of chinese make a breakthrough by studying these unknown advanced aerial space vehicles of unknown origin that&#x27;s what you just said you gotta pay attention to what they say they&#x27;re not russian they&#x27;re not chinese but you&#x27;re worried that the russians of chinese will make a breakthrough in studying advanced aerospace vehicles of london origin that&#x27;s what he said or from crash retreat materials that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re really worried about of course that&#x27;s what the intelligence community and defense establishment have to worry about that&#x27;s their remit and well they should be concerned this is a paper or actually it&#x27;s a giant report about that thick that we were able to get out of the out of the soviet union this is all the way back as early as 1991. and this this report has tons of units and academic institutes and research institutes that were involved in assessing various aspects so this is a big deal and of course the dia and others in the intelligence community understood that that was going on and so to give you an example which probably most of you have seen because it&#x27;s been in the news a lot lately the investigations of uh the nimitz carry group operating off of san diego and in several occasions uh these advanced aerospace vehicles would descend rapidly from 60 000 feet 50 feet above the water hover and then take off i mean astounding kinds of things now when he just said that i actually heard on unidentified it&#x27;s 80 000 feet these vehicles were descending from 80 thousand feet and then not only that when you see anything about feet it&#x27;s about five thousand two hundred and eighty feet is a mile so when you say eighty thousand feet you mean about 13 miles above earth 13 miles above earth and then descending down to 50 feet above the water in front of commander david fraber instantly dropping to 50 feet above the water from 13 miles above earth that&#x27;s what he just said that&#x27;s exactly what he just said so you got to take that and listen to what he just said but again that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a well-respected guy that&#x27;s dr harold put off nuclear physicist and one of these times a couple of f-18s were launched from princeton uss princeton and vectored by overhead to see if they uh the object was holding kind of over the water and he went right down to check it out and and suddenly it took off to the horizon in a couple of seconds i mean he was absolutely amazed what did he described sort of like a tic tac you know the kind of candy you can eat solid white smooth no edges about 46 feet in length about the size of his fat uniform colored no appendages sticking out like wings or tails or whatever they were stealthy the f-18 radars couldn&#x27;t contain lock but forward-looking infrared radar could track well stationary at lower speeds before the infrared radar just picks up the heat signature and so even though uh there&#x27;s no radar lock or whatever i mean didn&#x27;t he was the first pilot to actually get there and see what was uh there to see and of course he had a wingman who also saw it in another plane and there was this event occurring he did not have a pure radar on his particular f-18 so when he landed back at the carrier he told the next flight of people going out you know i saw this thing see if you can get out there and get a picture because you&#x27;ve got your radars operational and so on the second flight out in fact they did capture this picture they so what he said was you know commander david a fravor went out and he was vectored in to check out the ufo above the ocean and hit for some reason his his fa-18 super hornet was kind of ghetto it didn&#x27;t have operational video hooked to the internet like linkedin or and his gopro wasn&#x27;t working or something and so it was four of them and you can see commander dave david a favor talk about it was for for him and his wisdom with his weapon system operator they call him wizzos him and his on one fa18 super hornet and then there was another uh pilot in his wizzo that&#x27;s two fa-18 super hornets with two wizzos in the back so there i mean these are four people in two planes and they both saw them eyes on but they didn&#x27;t have operable cameras or gopros he forgot to put on his gopro helmet and so they sent another plane out and that&#x27;s the video that you see on cnn msnbc and that guy has also been interviewed as well by jeremy corbell so there&#x27;s an interview with the pilot who actually got the video and that interview was done by jeremy corbell on youtube and i&#x27;ve saw that too so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying you might think 2004 i mean why are you talking about things that happened a long time ago it didn&#x27;t stop over the decades lots of views of this happening more recent times 2015 2016. you&#x27;ve got the coast of the united careers and they see the same thing actually interfering with their missions there have been cases where a couple of things are going along something [Music] publicity oh this is displayed on wham and various tv shows he had 12 planes under his group 300 people reporting to him he was a top commander of this air force group the key assessments were an advanced aerospace vehicle known air vehicle inventory of usa coordination low general characteristics he said the key observations was advanced aerospace vehicle of unknown origin not to be known in the in the uh inventory of the united states of america nor any other terrestrial nation country on earth that&#x27;s what he just said what they have on videotape is not in the united states possession or inventory of aircraft nor do they know of that of any other country having possession of any vehicle that resembles that and they can do facial recognition on an aircraft too they have the capability to put a camera on an aircraft and tell you exactly what it is like they can your face that&#x27;s what you just said advanced performance advanced propulsion capability stationary transition to horizontal vertical velocities far greater than any known aerial vehicle and with no little signature so that&#x27;s what the dia had to contend with so how are we going to figure out what&#x27;s going on so for this particular program the latest of many programs they put out a broad area announcement in 2008 and said we want 12 potential threat areas to be evaluated live propulsion control human effects human interface armament and dia chose aerospace&#x27;s contractor to address the potential threats now some critics out there said wait a minute harry reid was a senator from nevada and bobby law an aerospace person located in nevada for years in fact john and i were a part of his uh technical environment behind him so we set up a division of aerospace college advanced space studies and of course he&#x27;s supposed to do all the things you&#x27;d expect someone uh to do a setup program like this i came into the picture is that bass contacted me contacted my organization the particular area that i took responsibility for is based on this critical issue as you can all imagine in these programs it is difficult for contractors to obtain expert opinion on critical technologies because there&#x27;s such high level security and there&#x27;s compartmentalization we call it snow piping so you&#x27;ve got people at this so i&#x27;m given the remit to try to break through this kind of issue and so i was contracted to commission papers from experts around the globe and since we didn&#x27;t want to be in the position of going out and saying we&#x27;re trying to figure out this ufo thing you know can you help us out here i mean associated with that program would have been a disaster i just simply said i&#x27;m doing a survey where were your particular application or your particular interest in your particular technologies be in the year 2050 and as far as aerospace industry and can i&#x27;m going to show you the 38 papers so you can judge for yourself how technically oriented this program was as you can see some creatures out there said oh that program or whatever but of course if you if you read between the lines and you see you&#x27;re looking at warp drive this program is absolutely directed toward trying to address the song to so we just said there were 38 papers commissioned by the pentagon those 38 papers had to do it warp drive wormholes invisibility cloaking stargates you know force fields i think laser technology those things had to do with things that are observed from ufos messing with our nuclear warheads and um you know the pilots are encountering but if you if you pay attention to the 38 papers that the government of the united states of america had petitioned from 38 of the world&#x27;s best scientists that are unclassified papers actually those 38 papers that they had commissioned are absolutely involving ufos they&#x27;re not looking at what the russians and chinese are doing when you talk about wormholes stargates warp drives um invisible invisibility cloaking they&#x27;re not talking about russian chinese they&#x27;re talking about aircraft that pilots are encountering that have been known since like 2010 when there was that uh nuclear um the nuclear uh officers that guard the nuclear warheads at military bases um came out with um i forget what&#x27;s name there will be nukes ufos and nukes what&#x27;s the name robert hastings he&#x27;s talking about the incidents we have at nuclear weapons facilities with ufos where they&#x27;re deactivating our nuclear warheads that&#x27;s been recorded for 50 years that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s talking about so it&#x27;s interesting you know that&#x27;s all coming to light so that&#x27;s interesting to hear another set of papers we were into looking at the four front areas of everything how do you explain that we&#x27;ve had a whole program on evaluating the statistics which is an estimate of how many intelligent civilizations are there capable of technological advance in archaeology he just took that a step further he just clarified it again when he just said that he just took it a step further he said that they this this program required a whole statistical drake equation to figure out how many societies are there in our galaxy capable of getting here and capable of interstellar travel they had a whole paper they redid the drake equation because this technology that the pilots are witnessing on forward-looking infrared and videotaping in tv capture is not ours and it&#x27;s not anyone else&#x27;s so they did the dr they redid the drake equation based upon that evaluation is what he&#x27;s just telling this is totally ufos that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying these papers were collected together and put it out as a series of defense intelligence documents they were put up on a special server called as you see here they were unclassified now the dia often does these deserts typically a series of papers will go off for let&#x27;s say a few couple months after four months and then they&#x27;re taken down and replaced with something else our 38 papers so this is really quite a hit series because they&#x27;re very advanced uh technical detail papers on all kinds of things what did you say right there i&#x27;m very happy to hear that the people work for the cia the dod nsa and all types of three-letter agencies were interested in those papers and we&#x27;re going to the j wicks websites the you know those classified websites to look at those papers and study in those papers i&#x27;m very um that that&#x27;s enlightening that that&#x27;s good i would want people in those positions to be studying those highly advanced papers that have to do with work drive warm wormholes stargates invisibility cloaking lasers you know all types of things like that those 38 papers i would want those people constantly looking at those papers and trying to figure out what they can do with them because those are probably 38 of the best scientists in the world writing those papers for the united states government so that&#x27;s good to hear oh yeah that&#x27;s good to hear that would be of interest in the community so let me give you a couple examples we have one here called better materials for aerospace use i can talk about an open source sample i can&#x27;t talk about others and many of you probably if you&#x27;ve seen various tv programs and interviews and so on you&#x27;ll know about this there was a sample that was sent anonymously by a military source he claimed that his grandfather had been involved in a crash retrieval operation and and so he didn&#x27;t want to identify himself but he sent it forward for analysis that&#x27;s what it would look like this is a multi-layered piece of material and linda howe was the one who got it to begin shopping around and i just felt it interesting to to pause and say that&#x27;s the one that timed along and luis elizondo hal put off his self show um on unidentified inside america&#x27;s ufo investigation that&#x27;s the multi-layered piece of bismuth magnesium and zinc layered an atomic level that piece right there that he&#x27;s showing right there it&#x27;s layered in a way that has to be 3d printed except the only problem with that is is they collected from well somebody gave it to art bill on the coast to coast show who later gave it to linda molten howe who later gave it to tom delong in the ttsa group but it&#x27;s a 3d printed material that was collected from a crash ufo in the 1940s you got time traveling people here whose is that piece of multi-layered curvature layered at an atomic level bismuth magnesium and zinc sample you all listen to lynda molten hal talk about that sample too we can&#x27;t make that sample today no one can make that trying to get analysis she&#x27;s really a stalwart person to try it had layers of bismuth the size of that is less than human hair those are the black areas you can see through here and then they were separated by layers of magnesium which is the lighter areas so that&#x27;s what the sample actually looks like a lot of controversy a lot of discussion about this because after all here you see something that does look like it was going to crash thin lines with the bismuth lines so what do we really know about the chain of custody is not existence providence is questionable so for all we know it could be a hoax it could be a thought it could be some slag from uh boundary floor but nonetheless it was the usual sample so we decided okay well then then we should at least take a look at it and moving on early on linda howell the researcher who had this sample given to her by ardell uh went around too many institutions and groups to try to get some analysis first of all a survey of academic publications interviews with people from organizations involved in special materials and so on they even went to uh archives of the national labs like los alamos and nobody had any data on this kind of construction having been made and then there&#x27;s someone else she went to try to see could they just duplicate the material and in fact they had trouble bonding the magnesium and different players together so it wasn&#x27;t clear exactly how you would make it and then finally in talking to materials experts you say well let&#x27;s just say somebody could make this what would you use it for and all the material scientists said i don&#x27;t have a clue can&#x27;t even a man so what he just said was even if you could make that piece of metal that bismuth magnesium and zinc with some layers of that metal being finer than a human hair no one on planet earth even knows why you would make us such a thing but it&#x27;s a crash it&#x27;s it&#x27;s retrieved from a crash saucer is what the person who gave it to art bill and then it was turned into lynda molten howe from coast to coast and his grandfather the dude&#x27;s grandfather that retreated from crash flying saucer in 47 said it was said exactly that it was retrieved by his grandfather from a correct sorry crash flying saucer in 47 or so but no one on earth knows how to make that you need a 3d printer that could make that and no one even knows why you would make that in the first place no one knows not even this guy saying it right here he doesn&#x27;t know why you would need 3d printed bismuth magnesium and zinc layered in an atomic level with some layers of it being finer than a human hair no one knows that question reason for constructing something like this however what happens is and suddenly we have our whole science of so-called metamaterials has been coming into the fore and developing kinds of stuff and lo and behold magnesium layers about the size that we see this would have a very special property this came out of mandatory research not directly associated material so it turns out this would be a terahertz way back okay what are some what&#x27;s terrible you hear about megahertz gigahertz and the microwave spectrum and then you hear about infrared radiation or terahertz sort of lies in that no man&#x27;s land so what did you say was decades later after linda molten howe got that thing from art bill had it tested herself then had a later on give it to tom delong and luis elizondo and her hero put off himself decades after linda mull got it from our bell our bill from coast to coast and the paper was written um in metamaterials research not associated with that sample itself it turns out that would be an excellent terror hurts waveguide we can&#x27;t even make it characters but it&#x27;s a terahertz waveguide we can&#x27;t even we can&#x27;t even produce that much power development goes uh above microwaves above getting hurts less than the wavelength of infrared heat so it turns out that ordinarily when you have a waveguide and you want to send a signal from one place to another you know you have a pipe for example and the pipe generally has to be about the size of the wavelength i have to wait for example well in this case there&#x27;s a frequency band around five terahertz and the wavelength is a certain size but it turns out in this special kind of material those thin bismuth layers would transmit those signals at 1 20th the size of the wavelength and so that means you now have sub-wavelength effects so what that means is if you want to transmit a lot of data hurts frequencies and usually imagine a stack of materials being developed back in the days samples that&#x27;s for sure but anyway so there&#x27;s a possibility of this and just heard him say it when the sample was found there were no meta materials being made with terahertz we can&#x27;t even produce terahertz right now that&#x27;s such a large amount of power in a frequency just under what he say microwave we can&#x27;t even produce that right now so when the sample was found and still today people don&#x27;t understand what that would eat it 3d printed material credit at the atomic level bismuth magnesium and zinc layered fire finer than the human hair layer after layer after layer after layer what you would even use that for still don&#x27;t know trying to figure it out but still don&#x27;t know has an important fact so actually what we see here then and this happens in many cases you get a material sample unusual characteristics nothing manufacturer is difficult to assess or reproduce as it was here purposes of function not readily apparent but then our own science advances on over the decades and finally we get to but then after a couple decades 10 years plus 10 years plus 10 years our own sciences happen to advance to where a use might be understood not when we got it we got time travelers what is it because it ain&#x27;t our tank in our meta materials it&#x27;s not our 3d printed metals so who&#x27;s is it that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s basically saying he&#x27;s telling you that but you gotta listen very closely with this guy say because you know he wrapped in so many non-disclosure agreements ndas like luis elizando he don&#x27;t just say what he&#x27;s trying to say he will make you figure it out purpose or function comes to mind which is what was the case we still uh have this in the pipeline to do a lot of experiments on that haven&#x27;t been done yet because we haven&#x27;t raised before but um let me pick another one spacetime this happens to be the area that i personally was the leader on the question is can you account for what we&#x27;re seeing based on known physics so what does that mean well all of our electronic devices you know this device holding using electromagnetism and electromagnetism has its foundational equations and everything that we have is really built area of science and technology when it comes to general relativity that&#x27;s mostly been in the purview of uh astrophysicists they&#x27;re trying to figure out what happens when black holes emerge or whatever um no one ever thought of taking the equations of general relativity just like supposed to build something based on this equation this is physics so one of my jobs has been to make a list of all the weird anomalies reported about these objects actually from my standpoint the weirder the better because somebody is making up something that&#x27;s fraudulent in the hoax you&#x27;re gonna try to say something that&#x27;s uh you know kind of could sell make sense but when somebody comes up and says well you know outside the crowd a lot of times what i do is i just sit back and just listen to people i let them talk and i sit back and i just do this right here stroke my beard like this a lot of times and i just stroke my beard just sit back and listen to people i let them talk themselves into a hole so well they gotta explain what they just said a lot of times i let people talk themselves into a hole while i stroke my beard and they gotta explain what they meant by what they said so that&#x27;s you see me doing that i&#x27;m just doing that i&#x27;m just stroking my beard and listen and then you match it up handing off i&#x27;ll give you some examples for example how about zipping across the universe you always hear we can&#x27;t do that it&#x27;s uh you can&#x27;t beat [Music] very famous astrophysicist by the name of alcubierre he was a star trek man and so he said you know i wonder if i could find solutions in general relativity that would let me make and i have a lot of constraints in that you know i want to leave breakfast time breakfast time at home go to alpha centauri for lunch come back and have dinner with my family and i want them to be the same age i am and on the trip i don&#x27;t want to be turned in the sauce on the back of the spaceship with giant accelerations in fact i&#x27;d like to just feel like normal kind of things so he worked through that solution and developed what&#x27;s now called he published this an absolutely tier one physics journal that deals with general relativity and so i was very sort of famous picture of what his word drive a solution look like very sort of so the whole cottage industry theorists who are working on various forms of wardrobe and so on what about the possible light constraint again in general relativity you can solve the equation we come up with something velocity of light is given by a little equation here one over the square root of the magnetic permeability and the dielectric you just simply arrange to reduce the value of those constants and now the effective speed of light is much higher and so even though you&#x27;re zipping through the speed of light as far as anyone on the ground is concerned actually within your engineering space you&#x27;re not actually meeting a lot but it works so the take-home message here is reduce time interstellar travel either by e.t or ourselves in the future not as considerately constrained well unfortunately the equations yeah all these things could be done what would be the engineer required to do it on our solution so far it&#x27;s oh my gosh we have to have so much energy density compactified in such a small volume interviewed on the new york post i believe it was by his name from the ministry of defense a guy from the ministry of defense um and brett tinley from the war zone he wasn&#x27;t interviewed by the guy from minnesota defense it was brett tingley of the war zone and they were going over brett tingley&#x27;s interview from the defense website the war zone interviewing dr salvatore pay which has holds the patent for us ufos i absorb like eighty percent of what i hear and that interview is on the new york post i believe it is post i have it saved on my subscriptions but yeah it&#x27;s there you can check it out but some people left out a loop this is my inner this is my um review to doctor how put off it&#x27;s basically done right here you gotta pay attention these guys see what they say you learn a lot kill a kid man xbox one get on their ad subscribe like check out my jailbreak videos you gonna learn some something you didn&#x27;t know</p>
