            <p>which is more important let&#x27;s say let&#x27;s say grush is right or there there is something and I don&#x27;t know I actually don&#x27;t know which cuz I think you&#x27;re you do an outstanding you don&#x27;t really kind of tip your hand on what you truly believe you&#x27;re not dogmatic you&#x27;re kind of curious you want to hear the answer um uh and and you know for me if I asked you just point blank I said let&#x27;s say grush is right what do you think is the technology that allowed these spacecraft to get here he&#x27;s claiming as I understand it he hasn&#x27;t seen and you please correct me if wrong cuz I don&#x27;t follow this nearly as close as you do um but he&#x27;s claiming that there are people in the government our US government that have covered up the landing of of spacecraft with bodies inside with some type of biologics he&#x27;s called them in Congressional testimony um um I&#x27;ve had on Ryan Graves on my podcast who&#x27;s a former F-18 Pilot We he&#x27;s been here too yeah yeah and he&#x27;s great and he&#x27;s a very sweet guy and I believe you know he&#x27;s Earnest in his mission what he&#x27;s trying to accomplish um and he hasn&#x27;t said though you know he he he did never said that he saw these craft these spheres and exactly he said that he knows the pilots and they would not only see them they&#x27;d see them every day every deployment so and fraver claims he saw this Tic Tac let&#x27;s just say they&#x27;re all real there&#x27;s some kernel of Truth God tells you here Danny boom they&#x27;re true there are Tic Tacs there&#x27;s crash saucers there&#x27;s biologics there&#x27;s cubes with spheres and spheres with cubes what if I asked you Danny what was the technology that was more important to those aliens to get here was it String Theory or was it Metallurgy what would you say it is what technology enabled it more like if you just had a guess was it something like string theory or was it something like Metallurgy I would say something like Metallurgy yeah I mean it&#x27;s much more practical right there&#x27;s nothing about String Theory necessarily that involves anything that&#x27;s a necessary condition for those aliens to get here and yet you have people like Jack and like others that you need this warp drive and you need this Theory of physics and Eric&#x27;s theory of geometric Unity is wrong because this to to answer this question usually presupposes the fact that these distances are enormous which is true I mean these distances are enormous but the age of the universe is also quite enormous right so if you imagine um that these craft have been traveling if they exist and I&#x27;m not saying I actually don&#x27;t think they exist right you know so so i&#x27; rather you know kind of defend that but I think to be an intellectual and to be honest you have to say look let&#x27;s give the other side Steelman the your opponent&#x27;s argument and see if that sharpens up your own so from my perspective when people result as Dave gush has that these things are Holograms and they travel at the you know fast in the speed of light and they can manipulate space time I&#x27;ve heard him when he was on Joe Rogan speculating about this tying in these loose Notions of quantum mechanics and relativity and warp drives and and all these other things um he&#x27;s a physicist too isn&#x27;t he grush no no I think I thought he had a degree in physics might have a bachelor&#x27;s degree or something that doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s a physicist yeah and he&#x27;s not a pilot I mean not um and I don&#x27;t think that those things necessarily like fravor oh you&#x27;re doubting a US Navy veteran I&#x27;m like he has more bigger balls than I do but doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s like better Observer and analytic when it comes to data analysis he did an eyewitness thing you know probably most courts you know eyewitness reports are replete with being completely erroneous Mis misinterpreted you know they have famous studies where there&#x27;s like the Stanford said there a gorilla dribbling a basketball like between all these other people and you&#x27;re you&#x27;re just counting how many times somebody dribbles a basketball and a gorilla goes to nobody notices the gorilla I mean the the fact that human beings are not considered as reliable as other forms of evidence in many situations leads me to say that like yeah I&#x27;m just as qualified I&#x27;m not again I don&#x27;t have the balls that David fraver Ryan Graves have my friend Ariel kleinerman I&#x27;ve had on all these guys I have&#x27;t on David frer uh Alex Dietrich I mean I&#x27;m big balls whatever she has big ovaries I&#x27;m not I don&#x27;t have the courage I didn&#x27;t have the the physical mental abilities to be a pilot at their level I fly a little cess around but um okay I stipulate that but does that mean that you just trust whatever they say I mean are we in the St are we going to take the stance that someone in the government is to be trusted I mean I always thought the government is to be is to be suspicious of right they covered up Roswell they covered up all these things C assassinated so you can&#x27;t have it both ways I mean at some point you have to look and say what do the data tell us right now and I&#x27;m always surprised on my channel how many people just assume that I&#x27;m working for big astronomy or there&#x27;s some like you know conspiracy that I&#x27;m a part of that like because I am skeptical of the existence I&#x27;ll be honest I&#x27;m skeptical not only of the existence of alien technology I&#x27;m fairly suspicious of the existence of alien life which is a prerequisite for alien intelligence and Technology right so and I&#x27;ve made Arguments for that I was on Joe Rogan and Lex fredman um but I&#x27;m not the final word either you know so caveat mtor why don&#x27;t you believe that there is alien life or any you say you said you have said before that you don&#x27;t believe that there is alien life or intelligent alien life because careful about it I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t believe like I say I don&#x27;t believe in gravity either evidence there&#x27;s no evidence that&#x27;s right right but people like Jack sarfati would say that there is evidence and they&#x27;ve seen it and it&#x27;s not something you can measure and test in a laboratory with beakers it&#x27;s something that you have to see it&#x27;s intelligence it&#x27;s police it&#x27;s investigative work it&#x27;s police work like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s something that scientists aren&#x27;t going to have access to and they won&#x27;t be able to measure and detect but it&#x27;s something that exists because they&#x27;ve seen it and they know they know that you know if you have a security clearance or whatever it might be it&#x27;s it&#x27;s verifiable and it&#x27;s there so I ask you are you are you a Christian um I&#x27;m not really like religious do you don&#x27;t believe in God or I mean I believe in God I haven&#x27;t really explored it too much I I I believe in something yeah I don&#x27;t follow us I don&#x27;t follow a strict Faith yeah okay that&#x27;s fine you&#x27;re not practice you don&#x27;t practice right right right um fine but um but you know people that believe the existence of Jesus Christ not only based on the testimonies of the New Testament but also because they&#x27;ve had personal revelation or they&#x27;ve been saved salvation from by works of Jesus that they ascribe to Jesus right um would you would you attribute those scientifically in any way would you say that their their personal revelation of Christ you know in their deepest darkest moments they&#x27;re at the bottom of a bottle or they&#x27;re at the Top of the World when they have a baby or whatever is that a scientific claim or is that a faith claim it&#x27;s not scientific right so in that sense that&#x27;s okay because faith is one thing and and science is another thing these things that they&#x27;re talking about that they&#x27;ve seen with their eyes or they&#x27;ve experienced and there&#x27;s some You Know cover those are also now they&#x27;re they&#x27;re not only Faith but they&#x27;re also saying they&#x27;re scientific if you&#x27;re making a claim that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s objects and those objects have traveled across Interstellar distances and or unless or as Tom dong told me on my podcast a long time ago that those things have come from forwards in time or backwards I I don&#x27;t fully understand right and he can&#x27;t prove it and he has no chain of evidence that traces the the alien spacecraft that that he claims he has evidence of um he&#x27;s lost the kind of provenance as they would call it in antiquing um so at what level do you say well okay that&#x27;s now you&#x27;re just talking about faith which is fine you could talk about faith all you want but you&#x27;re faith is almost like taste like I hate fish there&#x27;s no much you could take me to the seafood restaurant down the Street and tell me how great this thing tastes and and I&#x27;m going to say I don&#x27;t give a crap I&#x27;m not going to eat that damn thing and you could say even as people do it doesn&#x27;t taste like fish I&#x27;ll say you know what else doesn&#x27;t taste like fish a freaking hamburger doesn&#x27;t taste like fish so I&#x27;ll just skip the middleman and I&#x27;ll have my own hamburger right there&#x27;s no amount of that that will convince a person to believe based on your faith in something else which may be very visceral to you it may have saved your life or it may have you know made you a better man but that doesn&#x27;t have any effect on other people and science is about the the the determination of rules and patterns throughout the universe that hold throughout the Universe the capern principal States the universe doesn&#x27;t care who you are where you are what you are What You&#x27;re Made Of what day it is if I drop this this your gift I&#x27;m going to wish you a happy Hanukkah so I brought you a gift so I I got you I got you two gifts oh three gifts um so this is this is your gift for early Christmas present because I want you to keep your anus clean your anus so I got wow this is amazing got to share with Steve oh my god oh Steve we can keep our we can bleach our but you&#x27;re you&#x27;re Ani you know that NASA&#x27;s considering changing the name because it&#x27;s so embarrassing to say you&#x27;re Ani right they&#x27;ve commissioned a panel that&#x27;s beautiful they&#x27;ve come up with the following term urectum</p>
