            <p>the Joe Rogan experience you should tell Joe about how the the government program Alsop was created directly because George wrote this book about a little place called skinwalker ranch where the government was studying this property that happened because of his books um dia guys what you should tell the story I visited that place yeah but you yeah right yeah yes yeah I know I think you got a I think you got a little misled on tell him tell him how the government&#x27;s that he started you know from your work it&#x27;s fascinating some of it some of it stems back to Lazar so we did that story in the series in 89 one of the first people to call me after that was a guy I&#x27;d never heard of before named Robert Bigelow a billionaire he calls me up and says I was really interested in that I&#x27;ve been interested in UFOs for a long time can I help you meaning can he help fund me I said I work for a TV station I don&#x27;t need any help but he was not to be deterred he then reached out to Lazar they had a little he was started meeting with him and pumping up for information and that really amplified Bigelow&#x27;s lifelong interest in it he created something called knids the national institute for discovery science which he he made a science advisory board of the best and the brightest in the both the UFO field and the field of consciousness so they&#x27;re looking at two questions is there is there life elsewhere in the universe is it here and it is do humans survive after death and he assembled this board a former CIA guys two former astronauts men who had walked on the moon dr. Edgar Mitchell doctor helped put off physicists psychologists a really a brilliant little think-tank to take on these two topics I was allowed to be a fly on the wall for some of it not all of it but some and I told Harry Reid about it in 1996 and he said can I go and so he showed up and sat in on the meetings and he was kind of hooked Harry Reid was the first person I told about Bob Lazar outside of our newsroom when I before we aired the stories he had I&#x27;d known him since he first ran for Congress in 1982 and then he becomes Senate Majority Leader so he&#x27;d always had an interest in it but he didn&#x27;t want it to be known publicly that does not help your re-election chances so in 2005 we write the book about skinwalker ranch needs that team bought the ranch they were on the property for seven or eight years at that point and had hundreds of different incidents that they investigated they approached it like scientists would they looked for prosaic explanations they look for gravity anomalies they look for look for psychoactive plants could there be hallucinations caused by magic mushrooms or something or the witnesses lying they investigated the background of the family that lived there and they found out that they it could not be explained that all the range of activity there so it was not only you have activity we&#x27;re talking well which starts with UFOs because that&#x27;s what got their attention do you into Basin in northeastern Utah has always been a UFO hotspot everybody who lives there basically has seen them balls of light orbs structured craft daylight nighttime in 1976 a guy named dr. Frank Salisbury wrote a book about it the Utah UFO display and he took hundreds of these cases that have been collected by the locals there was a local science teacher named jr. Hicks who because he had taught generations of kids science in that area when they people would see UFOs they&#x27;d call up jr. Hicks and he went then go and investigate him and he had hundreds and hundreds of files he gave them over this guy Salisbury who wrote a book about it and he said these are real you know they&#x27;re going on but jr.</p>
<p>Hicks would disregard any high strangeness cases that came along with the UFOs anything weird Bigfoot ghosts anything like that he thought it was too incredible and he and he discarded that Bigelow buys the ranch he hears about these stories going on on this one property flies in meets with the rancher and by this time that Rancher and his family had lived on the ranch for 20 months and they were so scared that he his wife and his two kids were all sleeping at night on the floor in the same room because it had messed with him so badly well their property had had ghost type activity poltergeist kind of things trickster activity for example the wife goes shopping to the grocery store she buys it all this food comes back puts it on the table takes outputs in the shelves leaves the comes back in all the foods back in the bag she would take a shower in the morning locks the door puts a towel and a hairbrush on the cabinet gets out of the shower door still locked hairbrush and towel are gone dad&#x27;s out in the field he is digging a post hole using a post hole digger happy piece of equipment he stops for a second wipes his brow looks back and it&#x27;s gone and they find it two weeks later up in a tree they start hearing voices at night in in the air speaking a strange language they start seeing shapes outside the window at night big lurking humanoid shapes hearing heavy footsteps outside then hearing heavy footsteps inside then their animals started being mutilated cows would the the tracks would lead out into the snow and then just be gone calves mutilated cut up with surgical precision cats wiped out cut up carved up dogs that were vaporized hundreds of these incidents they would see holes in the sky like a great big hole in the sky and things flying in and out of it now this rancher college-educated guy grounded strict religious guy thinks the government is trying to run him off his property so he&#x27;s out there at night lurking with a gun trying to catch whatever government agents are doing this stuff and it&#x27;s not government agents it was something else they start seeing UFOs of all shapes and sizes the first one they saw was like a they thought it was a Winnebago this ranch is a beautiful place and it only has one way in and one way out they see these two lights that look like headlights down in the third homestead how did this guy get past the house here and get down there he must be stuck let&#x27;s go down and help him out the lights start coming toward he and his son and then they go up into the sky up over the trees and then poof gone these different kinds of orbs the white ones that were intelligently controlled not fireflies not bugs blue ones that would go they seem to touch the the fear center in your brain they&#x27;d get near them they look like a little bigger than a softball made out of glass with a swirling blue liquid scared the hell out of the animals and then it scared the hell out of the the people too this literally drove them to their knees with fear these red orbs would Stampede the cattle they lost so many cattle that they began to think that they were gonna go under they had these four prized bulls and I&#x27;m jumping around but there&#x27;s a lot of stories there that these four prized Bulls 2,000 pounds each behemoths very expensive animals because they were raising Simmental cattle had him in the in the corral and the husband and wife they always felt like they&#x27;re being watched he says to the wife as they&#x27;re driving to town man if something happens to one of those bulls will go under will be done they come back a half an hour later all for the Bulls are gone they jump out they&#x27;re freaking out where did they go did somebody steal them are there rustlers looking around all over the place in this Corral is a metal trailer where they used to store tools and there&#x27;s only one door into it and it&#x27;s right it&#x27;s locked with this heavy piece of wire the doors still locked the wire is still on there the guy just as a last resort he looks into the grading on top of this trailer and there&#x27;s the four Bulls inside door still locked they&#x27;re all crammed in there now you can take a forklift you could have a team of 50 people and they couldn&#x27;t get those Bulls in that trailer but there they were he yells to his wife hey honey they&#x27;re in here and when he says that the Bulls wake up as if out of a trance kicked the door down and all got out the knids team which had been on the property for a couple of years at that point fly in they&#x27;d been in Las Vegas they&#x27;d fly back in they look around they check out the animals the whole Corral which is made out of metal had been magnetized so whatever technology was used to get those Bulls from the corral into that trailer left a magnetic signature they were there on the property the nude skies for several years Bigelow owned it for 20 years but eventually they gave up whatever this thing was this intelligence it did not like being stalked and it played tricks on them and they never made this stuff public because what are you gonna do write a paper about this who&#x27;s gonna print it you can&#x27;t make a documentary about it because they weren&#x27;t there any evidence so while all this we&#x27;re saying the cattle mutilations I guess that&#x27;s some evidence but that&#x27;s the only evidence of cows and we communicate cows what what about this other stuff like for the first 20 months when the rancher is there they don&#x27;t have any evidence because he&#x27;s not a paranormal investigator they&#x27;re not taking photos or something they want it to go away so they don&#x27;t have any evidence of that except for what the rancher told them but then they talked to the larger community and the same thing has been happening to all the neighbors the guy lives next door had lost all these cattle as well seized the craft sometimes these craft would float around they looked like stealth fighters with Christmas lights around them floating around silently again I dare any Evan else not really I mean so Bigelow puts up cameras all over the property and you have them focused here where some activity it happened before the thing moves over here you you move the prop the cameras and focus there it goes away toward the end of the study whatever it was that was there ripped one of these cameras were ripped to shreds if they&#x27;re up on top of a telephone pole 30 40 feet in the air and there&#x27;s wires that are secured all the way down the telephone pole and they noticed that one of their cameras goes out they figure well there&#x27;s another camera on another Pole that should have a view of whatever it was that tore this up some kind of animal or whatever well whatever it was was invisible and I know it&#x27;s very frustrating it certainly was for them and for me to try to write about it in that this thing didn&#x27;t want to be caught it wanted to demonstrate it that it was there but I didn&#x27;t want to have evidence the calf that was mutilated was in I know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot to handle yeah the calf that was mutilated it was a Sunday morning it&#x27;s 10 o&#x27;clock on a quiet morning it&#x27;s daylight the rancher and his wife are there by themselves they&#x27;re tagging newborn calves tagged their ears and they tagged this one right by the ranch house 50 yards from their home and they go off across the property it&#x27;s a clear day it&#x27;s unobstructed that their dog is with them and makes a noise that points them back toward that first calf that they had tagged and and the dog indicates that something&#x27;s wrong and they see the mom cow is dragging its leg and going around in a semicircle it&#x27;s in distress they go running back over there and this calf had been completely stripped of flesh nothing left but a hide and bone and one of the femur bones have been ripped out and thrown on the side well they call in the knids guys they bring in trackers there are no tracks there&#x27;s no human tracks no no vehicle tracks no animal tracks the thing had been completely stripped of blood there&#x27;s not a drop of blood on the ground it&#x27;s gone 75 pounds of meat gone again over a time period of 30 minutes is there a team of commandos it comes in and does that go yeah and there&#x27;s this is there&#x27;s evidence of this yeah photographs yeah can we see that yeah where is it I made a movie called hump at the skinwalker it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in there right is that the only place yeah it&#x27;s in surprise it&#x27;s probably some other places there&#x27;s photos on video I mean so that they I&#x27;m with you man we had a speculation about like why why would they do this and why would they do the cattle mutilations like what is yeah is there any speculation some so some of it is a demonstration I mean it seemed to be a demonstration to get their attention this trickster element has been reported in other places around the world there&#x27;s no hot spot quite like skinwalker and I know how weird it it sounds there&#x27;s no spot like that because it&#x27;s never there&#x27;s no spot that&#x27;s been studied to that extent the knids guys were there for well big loan the property for 20 years needs was active for seven or eight then another secret study funded by the government came in under an organization called bass that was the money that Reid got he got twenty two million dollars it went to Bigelow as a contract and they hired all these people and fanned out all over the world try to find UFO information but other related phenomena things that wouldn&#x27;t seem normally to be connected to UFOs but which are a guy from the DIA had read the book and became interested and he asked for permission to go to the property this guy&#x27;s a double PhD a brilliant rocket scientist who had seen it and thought there were national security implications the hole in the sky in particular with things coming in and out he wondered if someone was using technology to make these days film that hole in the sky no again that&#x27;s when the rancher is there by himself so he&#x27;s not not a UFO guy he&#x27;s not trying to I understand but is there any evidence of anything weird anything other than mutilated cows well let&#x27;s see the the video of the camera that was torn up by something invisible they had something that is so in the video you can see the camera being torn apart you can&#x27;t see anything you can&#x27;t be there&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t see anything you can see before it happens it&#x27;s normal and afterward I think you&#x27;re how much time is taking place between before and after I can&#x27;t remember but I mean could that be hoaxed yeah if Bigelow wanted to but again they weren&#x27;t there to in the beginning at least for niz they weren&#x27;t there to to try to prove that aliens are visiting they&#x27;re just trying to figure out why all this weird stuff is happening in one spot right it mixes in a lot of Native American lore that got mixed in the picture but it&#x27;s been going on in that you went to Basin for 200 years why don&#x27;t know I mean our government has studied the meta so like what is evidence it&#x27;s so frustrating to me too when I was introduced to the skinwalker thing through George man I&#x27;m with you like what&#x27;s the evidence what&#x27;s going on the weight of evidence is when you talk to people in the area and they all have these commonalities some people died of exotic cancers from burns from above where lights came down and hit them and that&#x27;s evidence their face is completely irradiated and they [ __ ] died so there&#x27;s the cows the show yeah so you have a scientists like dr. Colin Kelleher hold on for a second that&#x27;s where they found it yeah look at that just what in the [ __ ] can that that is so quick you know did they scan the area to look for another spot where could have been slaughtered before it was moved to this area well that&#x27;s what they concluded is it had to have been taken somewhere and slaughtered and then brought back but yeah who does that little larger please can you just um zoom in on that because that doesn&#x27;t look very surgical to me that looks like wolves yeah it was there&#x27;s no justice they actually did an analysis and it was done with two types of metallic tools but look at all the jagged edges they said they so they took samples and they sent him to to pathology labs uh-huh didn&#x27;t tell the guys what they&#x27;re looking for you tell us what you can see and they put the just said that two instruments had been used one was a heavy machete type instrument that had been hacked and then there is a scalpel that had surgically removed a lot of the flesh underneath it looks like something killed it and then they moved it to that spot I mean if I had a guess the way it&#x27;s eaten though I mean it looks like it was eaten well there&#x27;s no teeth marks there are metallic marks mr. Keith mark yeah and like a slice sliced okay and if something sharp sliced it so I think the bigger point is this was happening on this ranch with owners prior to owners prior to owners I think I got to talk to a lot of people who didn&#x27;t you so here&#x27;s the deal the connection of this so George does this thing he reports on this for for 20 years that the government is now studying this ranch right because of deployment or because of all this weird stuff why is the government spending money through awesome to study this ranch and other things and that&#x27;s where it gets really [ __ ] interesting what happens after with our government programs and that&#x27;s what you know this some is before you to that this image like the the jagged edges around the rib cage that&#x27;s supposedly sliced that looks like hack hacked okay I mean look it could let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s people doing this you know to farmers to get them out of there let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s some program I mean although the cattle mutilation thing you gave me a stack of documents this big has been studied by the FBI it was it&#x27;s happened all over the country no one has ever been caught not a single person more than 10,000 cases with all the same types of cuts I mean this is not my ex I&#x27;ve seen a lot of that it&#x27;s really weird there is really weird and the the lack of blood is the weirdest part of it because if see like what makes sense to me is that something killed that they they butchered it they chopped all the meat off of it and then they removed the carcass from that area and dropped it out there yeah that&#x27;s what it looks like if I had to guess that&#x27;s what knids thinks there&#x27;s no way that it was killed right there because you&#x27;re seeing fresh clean hay underneath it everywhere there&#x27;s no blood which doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all I think the question is is this a government program is this something or is it&#x27;s a scare tactic it&#x27;s been happening since the fifties like what a weird scare tactic click on that one below it Jamie that the brown one with the green yeah that one please thank you that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a weird one too like this is like a hole cut out and there&#x27;s a bunch of these they found all over the country and was weirdness like organs removed but the weirdest part about it is it&#x27;s almost always there&#x27;s no blood yeah I just investigated one which I never thought I would do but I got a call from a guy in Texas yet to see it physically yeah so right before lockdown I go out and I&#x27;m like this is so wild I got to check this out the guy calls me it&#x27;s a pretty freshing one at this point now I&#x27;m no expert but I went and got samples and took him to labs and this sort of thing to see if there were tools used so you got here&#x27;s my experience to get my pictures of this yeah I feel no one on your phone I&#x27;ll show you after I got it yeah so I got great foot great [ __ ] photos weird well listen man airdrop them to me now we&#x27;ll send them to Jaime and we&#x27;ll put it up on the screen so other people okay so let me know after the show is not gonna help us oh yes while you&#x27;re looking I&#x27;ll tell them about one of the theories about the cattle mutilations that dr. Kelleher dr. colin keller developed was that the somebody is tracking the spread of like mad cow prions through the food supply and that they&#x27;ve been doing it under the guise of UFOs since no one would take UFOs and cattle mutilations seriously they just do it in helicopters and there instead of just stealing these cattle they&#x27;re tracking how far this these indestructible prions travel through the food supply because it&#x27;s in cattle it&#x27;s in pigs it gets fed into chickens and things of that and feed it&#x27;s in deer it&#x27;s called chronic wasting disease and in some circles it&#x27;s just weird well quiet it&#x27;s just wasting diseases it isn&#x27;t that it that&#x27;s a different prion disease then bad cow well it&#x27;s a variation creutzfeldt-jakob disease I think - so the same kind of things in different species it is indestructible again so you hit a deer that&#x27;s got this and you grind it up and you feed it to pigs the pigs get it yeah and then and then it could be passed on to other species and it shows up in different ways Kelleher was Explorer the idea well whether or not it might be the cause of Alzheimer&#x27;s or a version of mad cow and humans do you they&#x27;re all going to you right now this so this is a reason oh it says downloading so oh I&#x27;m downloading them and then oh right right right are you on the Wi-Fi no but it&#x27;s coming through here we go it&#x27;s about to go to you it says well I mean I guess this does highlight because this is my very limited amount of I send those to Jamie - Jamie yeah sorry should how&#x27;d you do it&#x27;s ready to roll I see airdrop is open I don&#x27;t see bro bro hold on there ya go young Jamie so this is um this is the stuff that you physically encountered okay you physically saw this cow and I&#x27;m looking at these images right now and we&#x27;re gonna show them sure in a second and this is uh you said Texas yes we&#x27;re we&#x27;re in Texas oh gosh what was the name of it in the Panhandle I&#x27;m yeah I&#x27;m blanking so you see here&#x27;s the deal oh yeah that&#x27;s it so I made the the movie based on George&#x27;s work of the same title hunt hunt for the skinwalker right and that movie was telling this story about how the United States government was studying this property land because of UFOs and weird stuff that and weird stuff included things like cattle pull up this one there&#x27;s a lot of weird images man this uh the the skin removed around the face right so this is - skull this is my first chance to see this for myself because last time I was on your show it was the ones in Oregon had just happened mm-hmm up at that ranch and I thought well okay if I&#x27;m ever gonna do it now is the time to do it so I go I get this call now remind you this is a rancher this is like this is their livelihood it&#x27;s this huge huge area of land that right there stop right there there are a very religious community nobody we go out to the middle of this land and in the middle there&#x27;s this dead cow no blood no blood and and he had seen it prior and and the reason he called me is because in my movie could see this special kind of slice like a jagged slice that is common to these types of things they think are real mutilations and he is looking at it he&#x27;s like that&#x27;s exactly like in the movie and this is a straight shooter he&#x27;s a religious guy he had to ask his pastor if he could even like go on camera with me it freaks him out so he sees this now he sees dead animals all the time and he saw this cow you said before accidentally he was out shooting BB guns with his kid and he&#x27;s on this big part of land and he sees this down bull and he goes over to it and he&#x27;s looking at it and it&#x27;s unlike anything he has ever seen in all of his years before it had surgical cuts there is no doubt somebody killed cut up this animal with this classic like the ear gone two types of tools like a scissor type button but by the way I tried to cut it it is not easy to cut so they had sharp tools and then there&#x27;s like a very thin sliced kind of cut so I got to take it get samples take him to labs and try to see what type of tools did this how did they do this with no blood on the ground and all the soil around it was dead so I was like well why is it all dead is that a natural thing so I took soil samples and took them to a lab and again I&#x27;m outside of Mike&#x27;s this is weird to me okay but I I think there it&#x27;s a real phenomenon somebody is killing these animals something someone whatever you want to say it some things someone is killing these animals in a highly specified technical way that has been repeated since the 50s on our FBI has studied it he has shown me so many reports of these in association with disks saucers like this guy have any association with disks or sauces or anything no he&#x27;s just a guy that owns the like just found this cattle very weirdly weirdly mutilated somebody killed it yeah and he&#x27;s like is this demonic is this some sort of Satanist thing and I said I don&#x27;t think so man this goes back in history like I&#x27;m looking at the cuts is specifically with they&#x27;re very unimpressive what doesn&#x27;t like a laser did it or some how long a scalpel no it was like it was like a serrated one was a serrated tool and by that the thing I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s like something that we could do oh absolutely we&#x27;d have to somehow do it though on in Texas land where the guy would shoot you in the face if you go and try to touch one of his cow see that&#x27;s the other thing no one&#x27;s ever been caught never so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s weird yeah it&#x27;s weird it&#x27;s frustrating too oh yeah I&#x27;ve been to the ranch the skinwalker ranch and the basin more than two dozen times I&#x27;ve never seen anything I&#x27;m interviewed the neighbors I&#x27;ve interviewed the scientists these are PhD level guys who had seen this stuff a lot of times they have cameras that fail I mean it&#x27;s you know you&#x27;ve heard that story before and this is very convenient that it happens just when some giant disc shows up but it does happen that their car batteries would die in the same spot whatever it was messed with them and maybe it&#x27;s humans maybe it is human technology but no humans were ever found to be doing this stuff needs was there for all those years they didn&#x27;t want to tell anybody about it they shared the information with me but you can&#x27;t publish it well there&#x27;s no real physical proof so they just left it there and I had tried to do a documentary ended up I talked to them and let me write a book about it but you know if if people if you&#x27;re looking for physical evidence and solid proof and they don&#x27;t have it now what is the what&#x27;s the primary fear are there any primary theories of why they do this to cows why someone&#x27;s doing this to cows you know you need to catch somebody asked about yeah you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s really weird that no one&#x27;s been caught [Applause]</p>
