            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Good day and welcome to Reality Check. I&#x27;m your host, Ross Kulart. Today I&#x27;m going to talk to you about the new movie Age of Disclosure. The much long- awaited UAP film featuring a brace, I think 34 so-called government insiders telling all about the UAP mystery. It&#x27;s a film made by Hollywood producer director Dan Farah and Lou Alzando.</p>
<p>Lou was very key early on as an executive producer in bringing people from within the defense intelligence establishment and getting their agreement to appear on camera. Uh, and it&#x27;s great to finally see this film finally making it to both a limited theatrical release and to a streaming release on Amazon Prime. So, you&#x27;ll be able to see it from the 21st of November this year, 2025. Um, it&#x27;s going to be released in selected cinemas, very, very limited in Washington DC, New York, and LA. And, uh, it&#x27;s also going to be appearing on Amazon Prime for rental or purchase.</p>
<p>And I strongly recommend everyone here watch it and tell all your friends, tell your neighbors, tell everyone, watch the age of disclosure. Not because it&#x27;s going to tell you, a UAP knowledgeable person, anything new. If you watch reality check, you&#x27;ll already know a lot of what the age of disclosure film discloses. What is significant is what the age of disclosure film will tell to the average Joe citizen. It&#x27;s one of the first opportunities for a wellmade, definitive, objective UAP film to present the evidence for the UAP mystery to the general public in a way that hopefully will seize their imagination.</p>
<p>So, what do we know about it? We know that it&#x27;s positing the conspiracy theory that I don&#x27;t think is a conspiracy theory because that&#x27;s almost a pjorative that there&#x27;s been an 80y year cover up of a covert UAP nonhuman technology retrieval program of craft and biologics bodies um that the US government has been and continues to be involved in the retrieval of nonhuman technology and trying to reverse engineer And boy, I think what what the biggest weight in the film are the people who appear. We don&#x27;t know the name of everyone in the film who appears because we&#x27;re all running blind to some degree. There there&#x27;s only a few very limited accounts of what people saw at the South by Southwest festival in March this year uh where there was the premiere. Uh but we do know that some very key officials are appearing in the film. Um, it was filmed in great secrecy.</p>
<p>Uh, David Grush, by the way, doesn&#x27;t appear in the film. I&#x27;ve spoken to David about this. Uh, but what&#x27;s interesting about the film is that it certainly corroborates and more than confirms everything David Grush told us here on NewsNation in 2023 and in his testimony to the Congress. Um, there is a trailer was released in mid-occtober. Uh, might run a little bit of it here.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a pearler of a trailer. Really gripping. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities and it&#x27;s not ours. &gt;&gt; These are otherworldly things that are performing maneuvers that have haven&#x27;t been seen. There&#x27;s a whole &gt;&gt; I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is so secret. There have been very few people in our entire government that have been allowed or provided access to it. &gt;&gt; Even presidents have been operating on a need to- know basis, but that begins to ramp out of control. It&#x27;s not acceptable to have secret parts of government that no one ever sees. &gt;&gt; People have been hurt protecting and hiding this information.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Some people claimed it would cost them their lives if they spoke out about these things. &gt;&gt; You had information being locked away that could change the trajectory for species. This is the biggest discovery in human history. Um, it&#x27;s an hour and 40 minutes and worth worth buying or renting. I strongly recommend it.</p>
<p>Get your neighbors to watch it. Have a have a have a neighborhood suburban party. Have a street party. Invite your skeptical neighbors along and get them to watch this film. So, the key strength of the film as it&#x27;s been described by people who&#x27;ve seen it is that it&#x27;s got this 34 key insiders of sitting politicians, retired admiral, intelligence veterans.</p>
<p>Um, some of those insiders are already well known to us. One of them, of course, most prominently is Lou Alzando, the former uh head of the Pentagon&#x27;s ATIP program, who investigated UFOs inside the Pentagon. And one key quote from Lou that I thought was a good place to kick off is his comment, quote, &quot;It&#x27;s ironic that the people who created the stigma to cover this up, labeling anybody who talked about it wacky and nuts unintentionally, ended up creating a new national security threat, which is the stigma itself.&quot; And he&#x27;s quite right. I mean, Lou speaks, frankly, as somebody who&#x27;s worked in a very senior role in counter intelligence. And I think he knows a lot more about the legacy program than his security constraints allow him to let on.</p>
<p>And the fact that he&#x27;s talking about how the stigma, the ridicule, the taboo attached to the UFO subject is actually now one of the biggest security threats is of grave concern. One of the most consistent messages that comes from people who appear in this film is the warning that we are asleep at the wheel, that we&#x27;re not thinking about the implications of this technology and this knowledge of a nonhuman presence and that we need to actively publicly prepare for it. That is why there is a mandate for the current president, President Trump and his administration to do the right thing and speak openly and honorably and restore honor to the people, the men and women who&#x27;ve been responsible for covering this up. I presume out of some misguided idea of heeding their national security oaths for the last 80 years. Let&#x27;s go to the basic origins of this story.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States requires that Congress be properly and fully informed about all expenditure in all government programs funded by the taxpayer. That&#x27;s in article one of the constitution. That allegedly has not been happening with the UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program. The allegation is that there is a multi-billions, probably multi- trillions cost program that US taxpayers have been footing the bill for for many, many decades that has been improperly, illegally, and perhaps criminally withheld from the knowledge of the American public. There are very very grave allegations including of murder, intimidation, bullying, threats, all manner of corrupt and improper behavior that have allegedly been used by members of the intelligence, defense, and private aerospace community to improperly suppress and keep this secret.</p>
<p>There is an allegation still to be confirmed, perhaps one day it will be or won&#x27;t be by the White House, whether that there is some kind of an executive order that was put in place back in the days of the Eisenhower and Truman administration, perhaps a pee, a presidential emergency action directive, which has been kept secret, which allows this to be kept secret from Congress. But I would love the constitutionality of that to be assessed by the Supreme Court or some super uh you know superior juristp prudence people in the United States legal system. I don&#x27;t see how presidents can be kept in the dark and that&#x27;s the key issue of all of the people who appear in this film. They would no doubt regard themselves as patriots. They want the truth to be told and this is their ambit position where they state very very clearly that there is a cover up that it&#x27;s gone on for far too long and it&#x27;s time for the public to be told the truth.</p>
<p>Cue the White House disclosure by the end of the year. Don&#x27;t we all hope? So the next up of course is Chris Melon, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence and security and uh a UAP advocate par excellence. Chris brings a certain pan style to the UAP subject and has consistently written and spoken publicly about the need for more open disclosure and transparency. And in a featured clip with Hal Putoff, he warns of existential risks from UAP NHI tech outpacing human control, alleging there are DoD programs that hoard crash debris. He claims that there are multiple crash retrievals confirmed by insiders and emphasizes that there is a secret ongoing cold war for supremacy with this UAP tech being waged between Russia, China, and the US.</p>
<p>Those are big words from a person who&#x27;s been very close to the top of the US national security establishment. A man who no doubt has been read in to many special access programs and other secret compartmentalized secrets inside the US defense and intelligence community. Hal Putoff also appears in the show. He&#x27;s a quantum physicist of course and the former CIA DoD head of the remote viewing program also involved as a scientist with OAP and ATIP. Um he talks about how the age of disclosure is brilliant because it goes quietly behind the scenes, talks to 34 people and says, &quot;Okay, if you all come out at the same time, you don&#x27;t have the stigma associated with speaking out individually.&quot; And so you can make a great step forward.</p>
<p>And I think that&#x27;s a very astute comment from Hal. He&#x27;s absolutely right. Some of the people that appear in this film probably would not have appeared on their own. Key point on Roswell, the 1947 alleged crash of a UAP or perhaps two UAP craft in 1947. Halputoff affirms there are key individuals who should know who say the crash, the Roswell crash was real and there were bodies.</p>
<p>And he also discusses how there are reverse engineering failures that have led to black project deadends. Now, this is one area of the message from age of disclosure that I&#x27;m a little bit skeptical about. Frankly, I&#x27;m not buying it. I do not accept that the US has not made significant advances with retrieved UAP technology. And I do suspect that the um original 2014 2015 approach by generals Mccasland and Kerry to Tom Dong uh through Loheed Skunk Works and um John Podesta in the White House at the time that this was all part of an attempt to try and control the the narrative, a kind of a limited hangout uh where they would disclose yes there are UAPs.</p>
<p>Um, yes, we have recovered technology, but you know, we haven&#x27;t been able to develop it that much. And don&#x27;t you worry your tiny little heads. We&#x27;re doing our level best, but we haven&#x27;t been able to reverse engineer much of this technology at all. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not buying that. And if that&#x27;s the message from Age of Disclosure, I am extremely skeptical about that message.</p>
<p>And I know and I respect Hal Putoff and Eric Davis and others who who are pushing this line. I&#x27;m not sure I accept it. And they are patriots. They&#x27;re good men, but they are, of course, constrained by their national security oath and by the intentions of the gatekeepers who control what knowledge is allowed to be released on the legacy program. The other significant interviewee in this film, and I cannot overstate this, even though he gave his interview before he achieved the exalted positions he now sits in, it&#x27;s incredibly significant that Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State and National Security Advisor acting in the Trump administration, appears in this film and says what he says.</p>
<p>Marco Rubio breaks his silence to some degree on the classified briefings that he&#x27;s no doubt received. And I can tell you as national security adviser, he would have received briefings long after, of course, he did the interview for this film. And those briefings would no doubt have told him the full truth on the legacy program. He called for declassification and states that leaders from both parties view the age of disclosure film as a stepping stone to bring the truth out. I guess at this point I should flag there is a rumor.</p>
<p>There is a rumor doing the rounds and I&#x27;ve heard it from multiple people now. Not from the horses mouth, not from the administration. Nobody in in in the administration has said this to me, but there is a rumor doing the rounds that once the age of disclosure film has aired, there may be movement from the White House. Now, I&#x27;m not holding my breath because even though Mr. Trump did make promises during the campaign to be more open and transparent with UAP videos and photographs and documents and to help us get to the truth of the UAP mystery.</p>
<p>There has been a deafening silence from the administration on UAPs. Now I am told by people very senior in the administration I can put it like that that there is a desire to get to the truth and they&#x27;ve just been distracted by the Middle East by Ukraine by the economy by the need to act on more urgent pressing domestic matters and that they are turning their head to the UAP issue. I guess I&#x27;ve got a onetrack mind. I don&#x27;t understand why any incoming president faced with the probability of being briefed about the biggest secret in human history wouldn&#x27;t immediately scurry to the White House press room podium and say, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I must apologize. We have been lying to you for the last 80 years.</p>
<p>We did not tell you the truth. I, President Trump, as your new president, will tell you the full truth because I believe in transparency, openness, and accountability. and I am going to expose the deep state once and for all definitively for the people that they are because they have lied to you. Who knows that day may one day come. I&#x27;m not holding my breath.</p>
<p>But it is significant that Marco Rubio called in his pre-administration interview for UAP declassification and transparency. So, let&#x27;s hope that the acting national security adviser has exercised sway inside cabinet and persuaded Donald Trump to show leadership and resolve on the UAP issue. Another person who speaks in the film is Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and um she focuses on the national security implications, the possibility that foreign adversaries might secure some kind of an advantage over us in securing access to this tech. And this is a consistent theme in the film that basically if it is true that there is nonhuman intelligence technology in the possession of the US and other nations, we damn well better be the best country at at reverse engineering it. I&#x27;ve said publicly on reality check before that my understanding is that the Chinese have stolen the march on both Russia and America.</p>
<p>that America has made advances in anti-gravidics and energy systems, but that the Chinese are way ahead. And this is the concern that the over secrecy, the stigmatization that&#x27;s been attached to this subject for decades has actually hindered our ability to be properly scientific in achieving the results that we want to achieve. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll get to the truth soon. Tim Burchett also appears in this film and he cheerily asserts that this film is the smoking gun we&#x27;ve waited for. 34 insiders can&#x27;t all be wrong.</p>
<p>And he&#x27;s concerned Tim is about the threats to whistleblowers and alleges the DoD flipped the script on UAP hearings to minimize disclosure. And I agree with Tim. I think what&#x27;s happened in Congress is a disgrace. Congress has been knobbled. Tim hasn&#x27;t been knobbled.</p>
<p>God bless him. He&#x27;s still sticking his head up as are Nancy Mace, Anna Paulina Luna, um Eric Berles, and other prominent commentators on the need for UAP transparency and oversight in Congress. But they are fairly junior representatives and sadly the people in control of the committees and the key opinion leaders in the Congress have so clearly allowed themselves to become supine supplicants to the gatekeepers and the national security state. The people who should be rattling the cage and demanding to know why the Constitution&#x27;s constraints on oversight have not been heeded by the gatekeepers have rolled over and let the generals and the intelligence chiefs tickle their tummy. So this is why we need leadership from the White House.</p>
<p>And here is President Trump&#x27;s opportunity to definitively prove his claims of the deep state and to come out with the evidence that we all know he has of what&#x27;s really going on with the UAP mystery. Another person appearing in this film is a former director of national intelligence, James Clapper. I&#x27;m not fully apprised of what he knows, but um James Clapper of course is a controversial figure because uh he has previously admitted that he perhaps inadvertently, how does one do that? Misled the Senate about the extent of government surveillance. And maybe this is his mere culpa. Maybe this is the former DNI coming in ready to tell the full truth about UAPs.</p>
<p>Um he has made the comment that the UFO files were buried deeper than nukes which I think is quite a telling comment. It&#x27;s interesting also to know that the DNI uh Tulsi Gabbard has also avowed her desire to have transparency on UAPs. So the woman who is currently the director of national intelligence in the Trump administration has been very outspoken about the need for disclosure. Tim Galedet also appears in this film. He&#x27;s the former Rear Admiral, retired Rear Admiral, a genuinely lovely human being and a good friend of this program who was the head of Noah and who has been very outspoken about the mystery of um unidentified submerged objects and the possibility of there being even alien bases underwater.</p>
<p>Um he&#x27;s spoken very enthusiastically about his participation in this film and he has testified on oceanbased UAP recoveries and again the same concern about this global competition for this UAP technology. There are apparently 20 plus military insiders and intelligence insiders who also appear in this film. And there are claims of how the uh there are five confirmed UAP crashes, including the 1947 Roswell crash and the 1996 Vajinha, Brazil crash, which we&#x27;ve talked about very recently on reality check with filmmaker James Fox. talks also about the retrieval of nonhuman biologics, recovered alien bodies. Believe this if you will.</p>
<p>I am so looking forward to the day if and when government admits all of this is true and these smug smiles will be wiped off the faces of those skeptics and debunkers who have for so long resorted to ridicule and stigma and taboo rather than responding logically and objectively on the subject of UAPs. It&#x27;s going to be very interesting to see if the White House does come out and make a public statement in future months or years how that group of determined debunkers are going to behave. I hope they all crawl back to their holes and never stick their heads out in public ever again because they will deserve vilification and approprium. And I think also we should be asking if there are people who have improperly, illegally, criminally withheld this knowledge from the public knowledge, why are they not going to be tried for treason? It&#x27;s going to be a very interesting decision. If the White House does decide to be open on this issue, what will it do? Will it do what I strongly sadly suspect they should do which is offer a truth and reconciliation commission where just like South Africa did after apartheite Nelson Mandela in an act of extraordinary magnaminity decided to offer amnesty to anyone who&#x27;d been involved in crimes against the state in return for their truthful depositions about what they knew.</p>
<p>And it was a very healing process. I got to witness it as a journalist. And even though I hate the idea of people getting off scot-free for their crimes, if crimes have been committed, and I know they have been, I actually suspect it&#x27;s going to be a necessary part of the healing process for the American people and the American government in coming to terms with the magnitude of this cover up. What do we know about the film? We know that it&#x27;s following the historical coverup from the 1940s through to the present day. Um, we know that it gets into the grush hearings and the way that stigma, ridicule, and to have been used to try and control the public narrative.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s going to openly discuss the fact that there&#x27;s been a control group. It&#x27;s going to talk very strongly about the arms race between the Russians, the Chinese, and the Americans for access to and control of this technology and its knowledge. And the key point that comes out of the age of disclosure is a call to action, a bipartisan call where people from both sides of the house, defense and intelligence insiders urge disclosure, warning that secrecy has an expiration date. Now, there&#x27;s no physical evidence of craft shown. It&#x27;s testimonydriven with dramatic reenactments and archival clips.</p>
<p>But what&#x27;s good about the age of disclosure, I&#x27;m told, is that it is an objective, solid retelling of a story many of us know well, but which probably 99% of the viewing public have absolutely no idea about. And that&#x27;s what this film is targeted at. Um the UAP commentariat community of course has come back slugging it basically saying it&#x27;s um it&#x27;s not really going to tell us anything new but I&#x27;m tending to agree with people like Jay Stratton who calls it the most credible landmark contribution to disclosure. Um, I&#x27;m hoping that it makes a big hit in public consciousness and most importantly, I&#x27;m hoping it wakes up people in the current Trump administration to do the right thing and push for transparency and disclosure. Um, the commentary that came out of the South by Southwest Festival airing was strong.</p>
<p>People said they were stunned, they were shocked that it was a highly credible film. It got pretty positive reviews. But on Rotten Tomatoes, it&#x27;s not doing too well. I I think it&#x27;s getting sixes or sevens on Rotten Tomatoes. Um, but there is of course a push back from the intelligence community and I think we need to put it on record that it is so flaming obvious that the intelligence and defense community are clinging on with their fingernails running as much disinformation SCOPS as they can, putting down as quickly and as early as possible for the film to try and cause as much mischief as possible.</p>
<p>Guys, it&#x27;s not going to work. the public are going to be interested in the revelations that this film makes. And if the kind of response that I&#x27;m getting on the street is any guide, people are waking up. There&#x27;s a wisdom of the crowd here. This film will play a key role in waking the public up.</p>
<p>People are suddenly going to start talking, I think, about the UAP subject in a credible and informed way. They&#x27;re not going to immediately default to ridicule and contempt. Um, Lu Lzando has a few quotes that I think are worth reminding people here that this is talking about a cover up, the most successful disinformation campaign in the history of the US government representing 80 years of lies and deception. As Lou says, we discovered there actually was another deeply hidden and much larger UAP program. One of the key arguments behind this film, Age of Disclosure, is whether the UAP mystery is a threat or not.</p>
<p>And this film allegedly pushes very much the threat narrative. And that&#x27;s coped a bit of a flanging from some in UAP circles who suggest that the UAPs, the NHI are nothing but benev benevolent, cuddly aliens that want to wish us well. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s being entirely fair. I&#x27;ve always thought that when people like Lu Alzando and Chris Melon talk about threats, they&#x27;re talking with the perspective of people who are schooled in national security and counter intelligence. And in that world, anything that is conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance on us, and we don&#x27;t know anything about it is by definition a threat.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re not saying it&#x27;s coming to kill us, that it&#x27;s going to war against us, or that it has malign intell intentions, but frankly, until we know more about it, we should treat it as a potential threat. And I&#x27;ve never really taken any more from Lou Alzando&#x27;s comments than that. But on UFO Twitter and social media commentary, there&#x27;s been a bit of a backlash that essentially suggests that this film is pushing a narrative, a CIA big budget false UFO threat narrative. And I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m not buying into wacky conspiracy theories like that. Um I I I do think that um the public should be skeptical about the idea that there is a threat necessarily that these are aliens coming to get us.</p>
<p>But I don&#x27;t think we should discount that possibility. The bottom line is as we know from slide 9 which is a document that was presented to an under secretary of defense which talked about the capacities and capabilities of the NHI. We know that the NHI have the capacity to manipulate human cognition, to actually tap into human consciousness, to physically alter what we see, to manipulate our perception. Anything like that, frankly, is a threat in my book. And frankly, I don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s a dark conspiracy or not.</p>
<p>We should be treating it with caution. And I can respect and understand why the national security establishment might be cautious. Where I am skeptical is the extent to which they try to play down the extent to which the United States has been able to reverse engineer this technology. Apparently, we&#x27;re going to be told that that program has largely been unsuccessful. I&#x27;m not buying it.</p>
<p>There are many, many interesting quotes from people in the film, but I think it&#x27;s probably best that I let you watch the age of disclosure and make your own judgment. And what we&#x27;ll probably do is have a future reality check where we can have an open discussion where I can hear from the audience what they thought of it. And more importantly, let&#x27;s see what the White House says in response. Because frankly, after the um film airs on the 21st of November, it will be airing in Washington. Maybe they can secure President Trump a special seat in whatever cinema it will be.</p>
<p>Or maybe they can have an airring at the White House. It&#x27;s going to be an absolutely key tipping point decision. How the president, how the national security adviser, Marco Rubio, how the DNI Tulsi Gabbard, and how Cash Patel at the FBI, John Ratcliffe at the CIA, how they all choose to respond to the allegations made in this film by key opinion leaders from the defense, intelligence, and political community. This is not some idol UFO documentary made by a bunch of amateurs. This is a serious Hollywood film.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s making very, very serious allegations and I think they deserve to be listened to. So, let&#x27;s talk about Age of Disclosure after you&#x27;ve all seen it. And I hope you enjoy the viewing. Thank you for watching. And before we go, please don&#x27;t forget we do our weekly question and answer and we need your questions.</p>
