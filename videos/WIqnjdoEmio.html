            <p>okay so I built one uh with a sort of knife switch construction and two Banks of capacitors one I Swit in series and one parallel now my One bank here which is now series every single capacitor has 1.7 1.7 and the other the parallel ones 1.35 well I have to do it with that okay so I&#x27;m going to connect the lamp Okay connect the lamp and now we have one and a half amp running from the serial part to the parallel part so I have a voltage that&#x27;s not dropping 1.6 volts and dropping the other side 1.37 and slowly going up very slowly probably yep there we go so the principle it works so now we&#x27;re going to switch over the parallel parallel sir watch the M meter going to the other way the other direction now of course they&#x27;re not really charged very much so now this side 1.3 and dropping and this one 1 54 it&#x27;s going up a little but I do have a lot of losses very slowly we go from uh one amp down so switch over again and we go to the other side again and we have a little more amps because the voltage on the Cal on the left side is a little higher so if I would do this with a short instead of a lamp then probably the losses will be in the heat of the cables I am losing a lot of voltage but I&#x27;m not really understanding what lws and why this is not working forever so it&#x27;s going very slowly still above one amp but I have to compare it with just letting it drain the capacitors how long it takes and how bright the lamp will be it&#x27;s very complicated to see okay going switch over again and now is the other one just a little above one amp again so you look at it this way it does work but I don&#x27;t I think it&#x27;s ideal because voltage over my capacitors is dropping every time so now I in the left side they only have 137 1.38 and on the right side I have 1 Point 19 and dropping and the other one is going up but every time then I Swit I lose I lose some voltage now drop over again now we go to the other side and I can do this for a while but uh just not sure how it where the losses are and why this can or cannot work anyway was fun trying thanks for watching</p>
