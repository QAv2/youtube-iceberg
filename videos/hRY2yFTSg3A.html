            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>so i&#x27;m going to talk to you guys a little bit about a model we&#x27;ve been working on for a while we call it the dynamic vacuum model and we we categorize this as a pilot wave theory we have uh you know a lot of the same thought processes that we&#x27;ve heard discussed in a lot of cases applied to the to the walking droplets but we we tend to go directly uh towards some application of things like the hydrogen atom but the central theme of our approach if you will is that the quantum vacuum is a dynamic medium meaning that it can vary in space and time and as such it can support longitudinal wave modes and so that means that whatever it&#x27;s made of uh quantum vacuum fluctuations what have you the internal constituents are capable of interacting uh and exchanging uh momentum uh and so some of the stuff i&#x27;m gonna talk to you about today is some of the work we&#x27;ve done studying the hydrogen atom and then leaning a little further forward uh into thinking about chemistry we did a very light survey of nuclear physics and then had a little bit of a surprise finding on gravity if you will kind of expanding this dynamic vacuum thought process um so we you know we we went through the process of deriving the acoustic wave equation from schrodinger i&#x27;ll go through that in a few slides here and so in the process of doing that established a kind of a logic framework that says acoustic sorry electron orbitals can be viewed as acoustic resonances in this dynamic vacuum when i say acoustic resonance is i just mean to say longitudinal wave resonances in this dynamic vacuum medium so this is the the this is all uh documented in our paper that&#x27;s published in the physics open uh back in 2019 uh where we went through a process of uh uh deriving the acoustic wave equation uh from the schrodinger equation and we take the path by going through the the made along equations i think most folks on this uh this conference are familiar with his work um you know i think for me in my own process of exploring the history of the pilot wave approach and some of the the debates and discussions that have occurred uh over the years on it you know in some ways this just going through this little exercise here uh it&#x27;s surprising to see that you know we if we make the if we change the schrodinger equation to polar form and then we separate that uh expanded form into its real and imaginary parts you know we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve got this uh this term that appears uh naturally here and that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s identified as the quantum potential and i know uh in the process of becoming more familiar with the pilot wave theory over the last several years that there&#x27;s been objections raised to the the premise of the the quantum potential q uh and it&#x27;s to me in the process of going through this i it&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s inherently implied in the in the schrodinger equation it just requires a you know a coordinate system change to make its um uh its uh its effects more directly mathematically uh implicit uh in the equations uh so anyway that&#x27;s just just something i i found interesting that uh whether people like the pilot wave approach or not it&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost like the premise of the quantum potential is is embedded in in the schrodinger equation but we can go through a process uh following made along where we end up with these uh these quantum euler-like equations can people see my mouse when i move it over the screen yeah yep right and so uh again we&#x27;re just at this point we&#x27;re just duplicating uh what made alone did but now we make the the next step to try and turn these into a continuity equation force equation by making the substitution rho m is equal to m times the probability density and then we have these these two equations the continuity equation force equation and then we can follow a very textbook approach to try and derive an acoustic wave equation for these two these two equations by basically putting a perturbation into the system introducing the instantaneous fluid density the equilibrium density we of course have the condensation at a point that represents the variation of the density normalized uh instantaneous pressure and the equilibrium pressure and then most importantly the acoustic pressure which is the the difference between the two and then c sub s is the propagation speed of the longitudinal wave through that medium and so we can go through the process of assuming that the waves are small kind of linearizing these equations if you will and go through and simplify these equations a little bit to get to this intermediate form i&#x27;m going to go fairly fast through this if you really wanted to look through the uh the paper it&#x27;s available you can spend some more time with it and then we get the the equation of state where we go through and represent the relationship between the total pressure and the mass density as a taylor series expansion and again assuming the magnitude of the waves are small we only keep the lowest order term and then we get this equation of state where the bulk modulus is as defined there to the right and then we can combine these equations to yield the very familiar acoustic wave equation for the system and of course if we want to go through and solve for some eigen frequencies of this system we can uh take a look at the helmholtz equation and then solve for the eigen frequencies of this system now in in order to do that though we need to specify a density field and a velocity field for the system uh so we take the uh the electrostatic field around the proton and we equate that to a density field uh using the einstein mass energy equivalence approach uh and then that gives us this one over r to the fourth density field for the the vacuum quantum vacuum that expands out from the proton and then we derive a speed of the longitudinal waves through that medium you see there in the right hand equation and then we can go through and we can take this system and we can solve for its eigen frequencies uh and in the process of solving solving for the eigen frequencies for the system this is some work we did using comsol to find the eigen frequencies of the system we find we get the familiar n is equal to one orbital with the right to energy and probability distribution and climbing all the way up to n is equal to seven uh in addition to the s orbitals we do see the the p orbitals the d orbitals and it&#x27;s not shown here but we also see uh the f orbitals uh and so a way to think about this right like a p orbital in in this context being a uh a longitudinal wave resonance of the system the medium whatever it is it&#x27;s undergoing this uh azimuthal oscillation about the nodal surface uh that&#x27;s uh kind of represented by that dark area at the center of the the p orbital and so uh the real electron is embedded in this medium whatever it is and the statistics of being able to observe that electron are directly affected by this uh this dynamic of this eigen frequency of the system undergoing this uh acoustic resonance so we this is against the work we did for dartmouth defense science office we wanted to expand the thought process to see does the approach potentially show promise to be used for chemistry if you will and so we just did a an assessment of the hydrogen molecule we took our density field and velocity field that we showed you previously and we created a two atom system where we have two atoms in close proximity based on the separation distance for uh molecular hydrogen and then go through and calculate the eigen frequencies for this system using comsol and then this shows that the frequency response curve for the system you see the the two very large resonances there and that they are both uh fairly close to the anticipated energy level for uh molecular hydrogen you know i think the thing for me right that&#x27;s also interesting about uh some of the work that we did for the hydrogen atom and for molecular hydrogen right the the premise of quantization right it&#x27;s just a it&#x27;s a natural uh response of the system because of the frequency response curve that&#x27;s the only those are the only ways in which the system can interact uh everything else is just completely reflected if you will there&#x27;s no interaction at any other energy levels except for those resonances according to the frequency response curve so in my mind if it provides a little bit more of a natural natural understanding of of the premise of quantization uh this is uh this is not published this is just some early work that we did just to try and go through and see if we could go the other direction instead of looking at to molecular chemistry could we potentially take a simplistic approach of looking at a wood saxon potential and derive a density field and a velocity field for the proton uh and so in the process of deriving a density field and a velocity field for the proton we actually have two models we looked at uh we can look at the uh the eigen frequency for this system and of course the frequency is where we want it to be and then the uh the as you see from the acoustic uh response here it&#x27;s got this uh you know obviously this interesting uh uh negative pressure uh that seems to have some qualitative similarities to some results that were published in literature using lattice quantum chromodynamics but again this is just an early assessment there&#x27;s a lot more work to go do just it was an interesting finding and so i&#x27;m sharing it with you guys uh you know the um i guess the question is so what right you know this is all interesting and fine and dandy but why would we really even care about this um in some ways it could be said i mean we derive the acoustic wave equation from schrodinger so we we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised uh that we found that the electron orbitals are acoustic resonances of some type of the system because we derive the acoustic wave equation from schrodinger&#x27;s so so what uh but i think the point is the acoustic oscillations right they require variation in some type of a medium to be able to be manifest they they have to have a densification or rarification both in space and time and so that means that whenever we try and find the eigen frequencies of the hydrogen atom we have to specify a density field and a velocity field to be able to to find those eigen frequencies so in some ways you know in my mind maybe this this is starting to establish the premise that the the concept of the the pilot wave approach versus the the copenhagen approach to quantum mechanics instead of just being this uh this this view of well that they they both represent the same thing right one person likes vanilla ice cream and another person likes strawberry ice cream you just they&#x27;re both ice cream you just pick whichever mathematical framework you want to work in but i think it may be a little bit more fundamental right that maybe copenhagen is is incomplete uh i know there&#x27;s probably some folks on this line that may say stuff a little bit stronger than that but that&#x27;s as that&#x27;s about as strong as i&#x27;m willing to go right now but you know i think maybe copenhagen is an incomplete and the pilot approach uh is is more fundamental right and it may be making uh predictions uh it may be possible for pilot wave approaches to make predictions the copenhagen a doesn&#x27;t uh doesn&#x27;t make and b in some cases won&#x27;t even allow right because i think it might be meaningless in in the copenhagen interpretation to ask what&#x27;s the density field around the hydrogen atom and i know we like the double double slit experiment bohmian trajectories are also something that copenhagen interpretation would not predict so this next part this is uh this is not published yet in a paper this is some work we did uh an extension of the work we did with the at the microscopic level we&#x27;ve long speculated that gravity is an emergent phenomena and so my analyst had been bugging me for quite some time while we were doing the work on the hydrogen atom and the molecular hydrogen can we derive a density field and a velocity field for the sun&#x27;s gravitational potential using the same technique we did for the other potentials and so i finally went to the trouble to do that just to you know just to satisfy him and i didn&#x27;t expect to to find any any type of correlation or anything interesting i i thought it would just be a fun exercise but there would be nothing that came out of it and so we we implemented a model in comsaw and unfortunately because the you know the size and the scale is it does take a lot of computational uh capability to do this like thousands of cpus um you know input a density field and a velocity field uh and then put in a perturbation for the system to find eigen frequencies uh i&#x27;m just kind of skimming through the model but when we when we look for the eigen frequencies uh that correlated to the the known planetary orbits uh we found eigen frequencies that correlated to uh all of the the planets uh in their in their slots including a series right uh in between mars and jupiter uh and so you know looking at the errors here right you can see we we found i mean i was surprised to find that we we really did not expect uh to find that uh correlation but what we speculate may be going on here is that um maybe gravity has uh if it is this if it is this emergent uh phenomena this uh this this alternate viewpoint of things uh maybe there is a soft quantization uh to the the concept of uh planetary orbits uh you know the frequency response curves you can see the frequency response curves that are there uh and so that would suggest that you know in a uh in a you know a stars dust disc that&#x27;s around it as the planets start to coalesce it would it would seem that maybe the potential has record grooves if you will very small sub-potentials if you will because of these frequency response curves that will statistically have a larger likelihood of coalescing a planet and so i think one of the things we&#x27;d really like to do is to take this approach and model uh you know go look at the exoplanet database we can look at the the different stars that have planets that they&#x27;ve found and then go through and do this type of analysis for those to see do we see some type of statistical correlation with what the the modeling approach that we&#x27;re taking relative to the the planets that have been found around the different stars and maybe if if we if we were able to show that this technique might be used in the process of trying to find future exoplanets right we could help investigators maybe narrow their their search to specific frequency bins uh if you will and maybe it&#x27;s something where there&#x27;s a 67 chance that they would find something i think the one additional thing that we we think that we need to understand with this is i think there&#x27;s also obviously uh planetary interaction so i think we&#x27;re trying to figure out how would we combine the frequency response curve so that if a planet is already in orbit how does it affect the other record groups that are around it right is it going to mute certain locations and increase certain locations where they have more appeal if you will in terms of the how does the the field communicate to you know want the presence of one planet affecting all the other record groups that are supposed to be around the star uh so again who cares right uh you know this is uh some interesting stuff uh actually i think this is just a repeat slide here sorry about that um again i think this is uh maybe building the argument that um uh pilot wave approaches are maybe more fundamental uh than than what people you know it&#x27;s not this uh ontological it&#x27;s uh fundamental so now i&#x27;m going to switch gears uh and talk a little bit about application uh you know we uh here at limitless space institute we do want to think about ways that we can try and leverage some fundamental physics in ways that maybe we can come up with some approaches that might be useful for for technological applications in our case within interest towards space but um currently the work that we&#x27;re doing uh to explore our physics model is uh how it applies to casmir cavities the dynamic vacuum model uh suggests that the uh the state of the negative vacuum energy density uh that&#x27;s predicted to exist in a casmir cavity it&#x27;s not this isotropic state there&#x27;s actually some special variation to it uh uh in between you know just a garden variety parallel plate uh casmir cavity uh there&#x27;s structure to the quantum vacuum that&#x27;s in between those two plates and uh that structure has the potential to you know generate a in this in like the picture on the left there may be a very small polarization field that we could uh detect uh with some very sensitive equipment maybe we can uh generate longitudinal waves in the quantum vacuum and maybe this might be something of value in the context of communications or sensors right so having some tapered cavities uh that&#x27;s another area we&#x27;re trying to explore and so this is a this is some direct application of the thought process to some technological devices that we&#x27;re we&#x27;re trying to to study and and model and manufacture because the dimensions of these things have to be very very small to generate magnitudes of signals that we we might have a chance of being able to detect in the laboratory now you see two different examples there on the left uh this is some nanofabrication that&#x27;s been done by some of our team members uh texas a m using a nanoscribe gt 3d printer and these the separation distance between that wall and the pin there is about two microns uh so the total gap is about uh six microns seven microns uh plate to plate uh we want to get smaller but we&#x27;re still trying to learn how to make these things uh and then we go through and we we plate this material with metal so everything gets metallized as well on the right hand side this is using a more uh sorry i&#x27;m moving my mouse on the wrong side on the right hand side this is using a standardized uh etching technique to go through an etch a silicon uh wafer uh to implement um uh you know plate pillar uh cavities if you will and this is just this is not meant to be a device that we&#x27;re gonna test this we&#x27;re still working out the um the manufacturing techniques to see if we can create the the features that were at the size we&#x27;re trying to make now in terms of the the approach that we&#x27;re taking to model the perturbation the quantum vacuum uh you know in the process of doing some literature research we we found a very uh useful technique that was pioneered by holger geiss in 2003 uh called the numeric world line approach to calculating the cashmere phenomena and this was interesting to us because this technique also predicts this spatial variation that we anticipate uh exists in a casper cavity based on some earlier work with the dynamic vacuum uh and so this this uses uh an effective action approach to calculate the energy density distribution the um if i could kind of articulate the muffin making recipe relatively simply uh the you know the algorithm generates an ensemble of unit loop uh world lines they&#x27;re representations of a massless scalar scalar field and so you have an ensemble of you know 500 loops thousand loops 1500 loops whatever your computational assets can support where more is better and it moves this unit loop ensemble to different points in the model and then expands those unit loops by uh scaling them with the proper time t so that makes them instead of just being unit loops and they get physio physical energy associated with them until such time as that scalar vacuum field fluctuation pierces two or more potentials uh in the model and then that allows us to go through and increase the calculate the contribution to the uh the energy density for that particular vacuum fluctuation and then we can do that across the whole ensemble and all the different points in the model and that&#x27;s what helps us understand what the predicted response of the quantum vacuum is to those potentials uh and so the the technique we use to generate the the scalar field vacuum fluctuations it&#x27;s a v-loop method again that was uh pioneered by uh holder geiss it&#x27;s a gaussian distributed closed unit loop uh again representative of a massless scalar field fluctuation uh and this is this is these are the pictures that kind of go with those words right where we&#x27;ve got this ensemble of scalar field vacuum fluctuations we move them to different points in the model here you see this is just like a parallel plate cavity we would move the vacuum fluctuations to a particular point in space and then we would scale them until such time as the collision algorithm detects that the the fluctuation pierces the potentials and then that actually makes a contribution at that point in the model based on the scale at which that fluctuation uh appears to potentials then we can go through we can calculate the predicted vacuum response to any arbitrary shape that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the real power of this technique is um i mean you can do it in 2d if your model is immutable to 2d but it&#x27;s very powerful from the standpoint it can do full 3d which is why we were we were kind of drawn to it uh not only does it do you know arbitrary shapes it handles uh you know edge effects right so a lot of times in the process of calculating the the cashmere phenomena you know you don&#x27;t you just assume infinite plates but this can deal with uh finite geometries and you can see how the the perturbation of the quantum vacuum expands into free space uh here you have the the sphere plate scenario where you&#x27;ve got this energy density distribution that expands out into free space and of course this model doesn&#x27;t care about uh you know edge effects so it can do a blade plate case so you can go through and see how the the even with an infinite curvature if you were with a sorry with a curvature of zero uh uh here the um and you can also see the evanescent fields how does the how does the field expand into the structure uh itself so we found this to be a very uh useful technique and so we&#x27;ve implemented it and validated against the stuff that was done in the literature to show that it correctly predicts the kasmir force for all the standard analytic models uh and so then we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve adapted the approach to model how the quantum vacuum responds uh for our our plate pillar plate cavities in this case i&#x27;m looking at the uh the parallel plate cavity you can see the predicted response of the quantum vacuum to the presence of these potentials and so we can go through and use this and come up with a prediction for the polarization field in the quantum vacuum to come up with a expectation of what the voltage potential might be even though it&#x27;s very small what the volt&#x27;s potential might be between the the pillar channel and the plate channel so in this case for the as built picture that i showed you this is predicting a a 50 micro volt uh potential between the the pillar and the wall and so that&#x27;s something we&#x27;re going to we&#x27;re going to try and see if we can&#x27;t study using an atomic force microscope to map out see if we can see the polarization field using the kelvin probe force microscopy approach and then maybe we can also try and directly measure the signal using some very sensitive electronics equipment now the the parallel plate cavities let me move this a little slower sorry the tapered plate approach we can go through and model the the response of the quantum vacuum to the tapered approach using this numeric world line technique and you can kind of see that this three-dimensional model shows the field expanding out into free space and we get this energy density distribution and you can also see evanescent fields that expand into the structure itself and so we can go through and this in this particular model this is four microns at the small end six microns at the big end and then these plates are basically 40 microns by 40 microns and so we can go through and calculate the energy density distribution and then we can import this into console and come up with a force distribution across the the bounding surfaces to go through and calculate the kasmir force and we can do that in in all three axes as well right there&#x27;s uh this is because these plates are tapered there&#x27;s also a casimir force in this direction as well uh but the the thing that we&#x27;re curious about right is um you know going thinking back to the to the logic that we established with the the hydrogen atom right that the this dynamic vacuum can support uh longitudinal waves so that means that the stuff that makes it up is capable of interacting and exchanging uh momentum and energy and so if we have this uh asymmetric uh energy density and pressure field uh established in the quantum vacuum in response to the presence of these two plates uh is there potentially some kind of a velocity field coupled to this uh the presence of this uh asymmetric uh density and pressure uh and so we can go through and we can import this data into comsol uh and then we can go through and establish the uh uh the appropriate boundary conditions and i just wanna say this is um this is this is we&#x27;re not this is not a new idea it&#x27;s been thought of before uh there&#x27;s another team that recently published a paper in science advances trying to model the uh the kasmir force for parallel plate cavities as being a result of uh isotropic turbulence in some kind of an underlying field that was some interesting work and i think paul stevenson&#x27;s you know documented a lot of stuff in the literature studying hydrodynamics of the vacuum uh thinking about things in that context and of course uh you know john bush and uh the stuff we heard yesterday on the hydrodynamic quantum uh field theory with uh yuval deon&#x27;s presentation uh so that&#x27;s you know i think this you can certainly see why why we&#x27;re very interested in in john&#x27;s work uh as well but when we go through and we establish the appropriate matter conditions uh for this system uh and then we run the analysis we we&#x27;ve run it in both the laminar flow module and the turbulent flow module just to see if there were differences if you will and so we model it where we have no slip on the cavity walls this is the that tapered cavity there&#x27;s a velocity field associated with that uh energy density distribution imported into comsaw this is where the streamlines you start them at the back of the control volume and work them forward and this is where you start the the flow lines the front of the control volume and work them backwards this this is the exact same case it&#x27;s just looking at the flow lines originating from one end of the box or the other end of the box now i think the other thing that was interesting is there&#x27;s this there&#x27;s this uh interesting peak in velocity well outside the mouth of the uh of the cavity itself but these and these velocities are very very small these are like micrometers per second this is not a a very fast flow if you will but it is non-zero uh based on uh you know importing this stuff into columns launch and it would be required to preserve this energy density distribution uh now when we look at it in the uh the turbulent mode uh there&#x27;s so this is the laminar flow on the left this is the turbulent flow on the right there&#x27;s not a drastic difference between the two but there is a difference um now you can see they both have that that interesting peak and velocity uh well outside the opening of the cavity i don&#x27;t know if that would mean maybe there could be some optical properties we could explore out i&#x27;m not sure but it&#x27;s just a at least from a analytic perspective it&#x27;s sorry a numerical analysis perspective it&#x27;s it&#x27;s interesting uh to us and this is just showing a slightly different coloration of the same system uh and then a zoom up of the um this weird focus point in front of the cavity you can kind of see some of the back and forth between the two plates there of the of the system this shows our lab here that we have we have a space act agreement with nasa so i have all my equipment from nasa and we did we did pick up an atomic force microscope the uh cypher s atomic force microscope it&#x27;s been used extensively in the process of studying the the casmir phenomena uh so it has a a lot of history with that and so we&#x27;re we&#x27;re partnered with some other folks that uh have this same atomic force microscope and and use it to measure the uh the cashmere force phenomena uh so we could we could uh we could measure the the forces directly by having say a colloidal probe that we would move around the opening of say like the parallel plate cavity if you will and we can use our numeric world line technique to come up with a prediction for the force to to show that that negative vacuum energy density that exists between the plate pillar plate and the spherical uh probe in close proximity uh to go and show that do we see this spatial variation in the energy density that we&#x27;re predicting we could go through maybe create a two-dimensional map of the forces at a particular location uh up from the opening of the cavity we could also use the kelvin probe force microscopy to go through and try and measure the polarization fields to see if they correlate with what we think may exist based on our analysis we have a very precise oscilloscope that can sample it 20 giga samples per second so we can potentially measure small in the small voltage a transient voltage signal that we think may exist alternately we could use a four point probes method to try and measure ineffective conductivity of the cavity if you will and so that would allow us to measure you know very very small voltage pulses and currents down to the nano amp level so maybe we could uh gang some of these together on a chip to try and get to a point where we could use that technique so with that that&#x27;s my talk i think i&#x27;m one minute and a half over i apologize</p>
