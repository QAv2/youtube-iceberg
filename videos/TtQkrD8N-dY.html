            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>And now from beyond our dimension, this is the Jeff Mara podcast. Here&#x27;s Jeff. My guest is Steve Basset, political activist, advocate for UFO Disclosure, executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, and the first UAP lobbyist in Washington. He returned today to talk about where we&#x27;re at with disclosure. And I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re here because recently, Steve, I saw on social media that disclosure is dead.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m hoping that you&#x27;ve been working behind the scenes and you can cheer us up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. There was a one [clears throat] individual who uh thinking was along that line. Um uh no, it is not.</p>
<p>Um and I can give you a pretty good idea why. We we are in a very tense time right now, but a lot of things have come together. Certainly the last seven years has been more productive in terms of getting the government to yield on this this embargo, this truth embargo. Um we&#x27;ve taken it to places it&#x27;s never been before. So, as we approach the end of 2025, the issue, the idea of non-human presence, uh, non-human technology, legacy programs fully classified is like fully in play.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s in play in Congress. Uh, it&#x27;s being view considered in the House and the Senate. There are quite a few members, I think quite a few. There have been about 11, 12, 13 members of the Congress that have spoken to this publicly, some very solidly. Uh, that&#x27;s unprecedented.</p>
<p>Uh, there&#x27;s plenty going on behind the scenes, though there&#x27;s other things competing for their attention without question. Um, where they can talk with each other, they can discuss legislation, they can they can privately interview witnesses and so forth. that&#x27;s been going on for a while now and we don&#x27;t see that but it&#x27;s there. Um we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve had extraordinary amount of media coverage the last seven years 8 9,000 articles that I have linked on my uh print media archive on my website which is the most in 8year period but I think it&#x27;s approaching like 10,000. It&#x27;s the most in an 8-year period.</p>
<p>Not nothing comes close to that. Um, we&#x27;ve had three full congressional hearings as we move forward. Uh, eight or nine congressional briefings, not under oath, but people were were in panel speaking to members of Congress. Unprecedented. We&#x27;ve had uh four 20 21 22 23.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve had three pieces of legislation passed. No, four pieces of legislation passed. Um, and the fourth one was pretty much cut in half, but has been resubmitted in full four times, three times, I think, and it&#x27;s still in play. We&#x27;ve had that, right? Um, and we&#x27;ve had witnesses come forward. Organizations in the last couple of years have formed that didn&#x27;t exist, but they&#x27;re robust.</p>
<p>They have substantial boards or substantial members um with uh [clears throat] resources to approach this issue in a number of ways. Some scientific, some political uh new the new paradigm institute uh uh the UFO or is it the disclosure foundation, right? A disclosure action fund, I believe. uh UAP rather foundation and the UAP action fund, the Enigma Labs and on and on and on. They just they&#x27;re happening and coming together. These are almost essentially mainstream entities.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re not UAP entities. They&#x27;re mainstream essentially. There&#x27;s not much difference, right? Except of course they&#x27;re engaging in this issue. Uh this is impressive. Uh and I could go on, right? Um, but it&#x27;s really starting to come to some sort of a uh a breakthrough point uh as we approach the end of the year.</p>
<p>And here is how I can describe it. First, the fourth hearing is certainly possible by the end of the year. Uh, Congressman Berles, I think, would like it. Congressman Luna wants it. U, they have talked to many witnesses.</p>
<p>though there&#x27;s a number that are reluctant because they&#x27;re a little concerned about the protection. Plus, we think that the truth embargo managers or whoever they are have been making some phone calls, chatting with some of these individuals completely in the private private sector and privacy and and uh whatever. But there are important witnesses ready to testify right away. And these witnesses have to do with the shutting down of our nuclear weapons, which is probably the most important thing we know about the ET involvement here. They&#x27;re ready to testify, firsthand witnesses.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s at least three, four, five, six, depending upon how you rate them. And and um they&#x27;re ready to go. Um so all of that is in play and possibly could happen. The UAP Disclosure Act, notice the name Disclosure Act, uh is in in play for the fourth time. This it was it was cut in half and then it&#x27;s being resubmitted the full thing.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s been resubmitted three more times uh because uh the backers of that bill in the Senate uh are determined that that&#x27;s the bill that&#x27;s going to get passed. It is what we need. It is the full legislation package that will allow for responsible disclosure to take place which is really not going to get underway until the president confirms uh what we know confirms this uh technologically advanced non-human presence. And so, uh, the bill right now, a lot of a lot of interesting things happening the end of this year, but the bill, it did not make it into the NDAA. um again, but it&#x27;s going to, according to my source, be introduced more than likely into the House directly by Eric Berles.</p>
<p>Uh which I think was attempted last year. Uh so this would go directly in the House as a standalone situation as its own bill. And the interesting thing about this basically fourth submission is that there is a significant change as I understand it in the bill from the previous uh bill. And that is this that the controversial presidential review board that is key to the UAP disclosure act that is a group of appointed people independent uh and uh bas hopefully non-political who make the decision about what comes forward now as opposed to a little later what&#x27;s held back for a while uh so that the process remains responsible But the process will certainly go on. Uh that has been changed to a a a legislative a congressional review board.</p>
<p>In other words, the Congress will pick these individuals, these very important individuals to review all of the evidence, all of the information that needs to ultimately come forward, which makes it more bipartisan. Um and that may help. Who knows, it may get passed. So that that&#x27;s in the works. Uh in addition to that we have a major new documentary which is breaking ground here new territory very important there have been a lot of documentaries over the last 60 70 years uh but not by the uh Hollywood group not by the top of the film industry no they would not go there only recently they did some streaming shows which were by major Hollywood players like JJ Robbins and and Steven Spielberg, but not a doc.</p>
<p>There have been good ones, but they weren&#x27;t going to get that kind of backing. Finally, we have one. By the way, it could have been James Fox&#x27;s uh documentary phenomena, I think, had a good chance to be that doc and that coh took away that opportunity, unfortunately. So, what is the doc? It&#x27;s called the age of disclosure. notable because the person who is the director, writer and the principal individual that has made it happen is an is a Hollywood top person uh Dan Farah who&#x27;s been involved in A-list projects.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s coming from the real industry in Hollywood. uh that top crew, top production values, all the things that you would expect. And it will be the first documentary on this subject to ever be eligible for Oscar nomination because it&#x27;s being planned to air or to show rather in uh the necessary number of theaters. Uh there is one in LA, one in New York, and one in Washington. That&#x27;s the one I&#x27;ll be going to on the 21st.</p>
<p>thus making it eligible for an Oscar nomination which it may get. And this is important because it gives the film a level of gravitas that the uh citizen docs created docs did did not achieve. So that&#x27;s going to go down on the 21st. It&#x27;s called the age of disclosure. Now again there&#x27;s that name the UAP Disclosure Act, right? the what was the other thing uh the disclosure well it&#x27;s it&#x27;s turn that the word disclosure is turning up all over the place these days which is wonderful and it&#x27;s being used in the context by and large that we mean it meaning that the UAP disclosure act is basically about getting the information out so it&#x27;s about small D disclosure but I think it&#x27;s understood that it&#x27;s tied directly to capital D disclosure from the president and so this thing is all again being coming together uh as we would hope.</p>
<p>And so you got the age of disclosure and what he did was not so much create some broadstroked complicated documentary that&#x27;s designed to just carry us away. Uh he&#x27;s not he&#x27;s he&#x27;s not trying to get information out that nobody has ever heard. We know nothing about. And so some people think, well, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the same thing, isn&#x27;t it? Uh well, yes and no. What he&#x27;s done is put together what I call a sledgehammer of a documentary designed to just come right down on the truth embargo.</p>
<p>Just crush it. How did he design it? Simple. Get 34 witnesses, not two, five, six, eight. 34 witnesses are are individuals in interviewees who have got substantial positions right up in including the secretary of state, right, and others. They&#x27;re basically they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re they&#x27;re mainstream people with very substantial uh past histories or current positions and what have you speaking to this issue clearly in a way that uh that demonstrates that they are acting from a conviction that it&#x27;s true.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s true. This is true. This has happened. This has happened. And we&#x27;re telling you what we know with respect to some aspect of it.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s just one after another after another. It&#x27;s a sledgehammer. So, and because it&#x27;s getting the kind of promotion that it needs, it&#x27;s going to be seen by a lot of people. Uh, and that is it is is going to air in the theaters and then it is going to be available immediately at the same time on Amazon for rent or for purchase worldwide. All right.</p>
<p>And who knows down the line at some point it&#x27;ll become a free streaming situation for uh whoever signed up for that that streamer but it&#x27;s going to get a tremendous amount of views and that helps make it a sledgehammer. But something else happened which I didn&#x27;t see coming which is non-trivial and that is that uh Dan was invited on the real time with Bill Mara Mar rather Mar show uh I think it was Mar&#x27;s decision he wanted him come on and he was the first leading guest for those that are familiar with the show and Dan Farah did a spectacular job just a solid, clean 10-minute interview. Bill treated it with complete seriousness. He he it seems that he&#x27;s kind of come around much more on this issue and actually brought up some very important questions himself, not the least of which was the shutdown of the nuclear weapons, which really shocked me. I&#x27;m going, whoa, he just put that in play big time.</p>
<p>Right. And which it&#x27;s in play. It&#x27;s been we&#x27;ve been hitting the hill with this for months and months and w the one of the nuke witnesses uh Bob Salas has been interviewed by a couple of the members of Congress pretty much I mean members of the committees. Uh the idea of the nuclear shutdown is well I think known now amongst both the House and Senate committee that are doing committees that are doing this setting them up possibly to be the next witnesses because they&#x27;re ready to testify. They have no obstacle at all.</p>
<p>So that comes up and that&#x27;s a very significant 10 minutes. Now why is that important? Because Bill Maher&#x27;s show airs on Netflix and it is the highest viewership program on Netflix in terms of the total comm I think the way they uh uh accumulate, right? um it&#x27;s going to be seen by millions of people as always, but then it drops a few days later on CNN, which tend tends to get up to towards a million views on CNN. So that means that going forward uh as you move towards the 21st, a lot of people are going to know about this film than otherwise wouldn&#x27;t. But it gets even better because at the end of the show they go on they do an online after show called u uh overtime. A lot of the shows do this now and this only is only going to be online.</p>
<p>You can watch it online and it stayed online and that&#x27;s on the YouTube channel real time with Bill Maher. When you go there and you look at the videos, the ones that have been up there for a while they&#x27;ve got 20 25 30 million views. So this dropped right after the show. It may have a million, two million views by the time again the movie hits. So you&#x27;ve got a very a building wave around this movie, The Age of Disclosure, heading forward in time right for the US Congress.</p>
<p>And a number of Congress people are going to see this movie. I guarantee it. Some have had already advanced screenings, but so it&#x27;s going to have an impact on the Congress and the members of these committees at a level that no one like me and I think even my colleagues could achieve and it could swing things around substantially. So that is happening right. Um also we have uh some of the organizations that have been formed in the last couple of years uh are coming out with new scientific work.</p>
<p>Well, that&#x27;s always been happening, but now they get some much more attention. These newer organizations are more robust. They&#x27;ve got pretty substantial people involved. They have some funding, but they&#x27;re still citizen organizations. Uh and so what just broke is Enigma Labs, one of these organizations, which I believe it was started by Alex Smith.</p>
<p>Uh there&#x27;s some other people involved. It&#x27;s essentially another node for collecting and organizing and studying sightings, right? But a little more advanced. Got the app for the phone, the whole nine yards. And what they announced is they&#x27;ve gotten something like 30,000 uh sightings that they have been working with and studying. And they announced that 9,000 of these are of submerged anomalous objects off the coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Coast of the United States. 9,000. That is very very interesting and important because the idea of unidentified uh submerged objects USOs has been out there for some time. It&#x27;s been discussed. It&#x27;s been in the hearings.</p>
<p>Um Ri Galedet talks about it. A number of witnesses have come forward. The idea that they&#x27;re able to operate underwater is well known. They&#x27;re actually transmedium space, air, water. And when they operate underwater, they may it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;re not typical 200 miles an hour and so forth.</p>
<p>And so this just gets announced 9,000. Very interesting. So that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s stimulating interest in media. And then another scientific thing dropped right now just recently, but this is out of Sweden, right? the Nordic Institute of Astrophysics and the scientist involved is a name is named Beatatric V Royale and they she created a project called Vasco that they&#x27;ve been studying for some time but they just announced their findings um in a broader way because they they they succeeded in getting a couple of peer reviews successful peer reviews which again this is coming from the not not the government but from in the private world research getting peer reviewed. This is this is also new and important and and where we&#x27;re going.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s called Vasco, which is vanishing and appearing. [laughter] I knew I&#x27;d never get it. Uh the old memory is not what it used to be. Let me let me just go and get this. I want to make sure I get it right.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got you here and then I&#x27;m going to go here. It&#x27;s right here. It is called uh Vasco, the vanishing and appearing sources during a century of observations. Uh and this work was done at the um uh the Nordic Institute of theoretical Physics in Sweden. Now, for those that haven&#x27;t learned about it, it&#x27;s it could get a Nobel Prize even though the science is not profoundly complicated.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not like a breakthrough in quantum physics uh or what we saw with relativity, but it&#x27;s elegant and the implications are enormous and sometimes that&#x27;s what gets you the Nobel and she&#x27;s the first one to do it. I&#x27;m pretty sure she and her group and so for that reason I think a candidate doesn&#x27;t hurt that she&#x27;s from Sweden which is one of the countries that gives out the Nobel and so what what did she do? something so obvious you think it would have already happened. She and her group went back and studied uh astrophotography plates images from pre-sputnik times before any satellite was orbiting the earth. Nothing of human origin was orbiting the earth. And they started going back and studying thousands of them.</p>
<p>And they were looking for situations where a piece of space was photographed and then after a time that exact same piece of space was photographed again. And what they found was there&#x27;d be something there, but then the next one it&#x27;s not there. It&#x27;s also the case they might have seen it in two sub subsequent uh photos and then the third one it&#x27;s not there. They found thousands of these cases, which is highly notable because while it&#x27;s possible to catch a still of a small asteroid or a small whatever moving across the screen and therefore when you video it later or photograph it later, it&#x27;s gone. The odds are low.</p>
<p>But for thousands of cases like this, okay, that&#x27;s very significant. But yet, it&#x27;s even better because all of these photographs, these astrophotographs were timestamped. So, they knew exactly when that photo was taken. And so, what they found is that at least 45% of all of these cases that they uncovered, they were able to associate with what was happening down on the Earth at the time and even the location because they know where the these photos are being taken of what piece of sky. And the 45% correlation was to nuclear weapons tests, which again is profound because we already have plenty of evidence that&#x27;s starting to come forward about the relationship between the uh UFO phenomena and nuclear weapons, including the shutting down of nukes many times in our country and and Russ and the Soviet Union and turning on as well.</p>
<p>In other words, a substantial and sightings, of course, actual sightings around these facilities going back all the way to the 40s. But now she&#x27;s got something else that because it&#x27;s priest butnik, it has to be non-human. If it&#x27;s not natural and it&#x27;s not human, then it&#x27;s non-human tech from somewhere. And that technically, if it&#x27;s absolutely validated and holds up, is absolute proof that there&#x27;s non-human civilizations out there capable of technology and that they were putting some of that tech in our air in our space uh in our space. Uh that&#x27;s a big deal.</p>
<p>So that just happened. The world is just catching up with that. This this is what I expected. As the truth embargo continued to hold off the inevitable, the the evidence and other things would just be building and building like an avalanche, like a wave, like a tsunami wave, you know, finally just crashes over it. And that&#x27;s kind of what&#x27;s happening as they&#x27;ve held off, continue to try to stall and push back, even knowing that probably it&#x27;s it&#x27;s um a um uh a losing game.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it is because they don&#x27;t want to deal with it. Meaning, I&#x27;d prefer to be retired maybe and off somewhere else or just not around before this happens. So, I don&#x27;t have to answer a lot of awkward questions. Could be. Who knows? A lot of it&#x27;s legitimate national security concern.</p>
<p>There are some people inside the government, I&#x27;m sure, that will never not believe that these ETs are anything but an existential threat. And so, that has happened. So, that just gives you a picture of and I and I have more, but I&#x27;ll stop here for a second. uh of of how things are forming as we approach just the last uh 2 and 1/2 months of um 2 and 1/2 months, one and a half months of uh 2025. &gt;&gt; Do you think that there are people that have been aware of this crash retrieval tech that are now getting up in age and they actually are wanting to jump sides and reveal this tech so they could take advantage of it before it&#x27;s too late? &gt;&gt; Well, they&#x27;re really of age.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not so much taking advantage of it. It&#x27;s just that they&#x27;d like perhaps to be able to talk about it, see it in the public arena. But some may be thinking, look, if we can get this out there, I have some great plans, uh, things I could do. But over these last 80 years, a lot of people have come of age. There have been a number of deathbed confessions uh and other things that have come out because somebody knows they&#x27;re a short time and so that&#x27;s going to continue though right now it&#x27;s you know very different situation than u say 40 or 50 years ago but yes uh at some point people have to decide do I take this secret to the grave or do I do something hopefully without breaking the law to uh to get this out to the public domain.</p>
<p>So what I want is to see disclosure happen so that everybody ultimately very and soon whatever their age who has important information will have an opportunity to present this under oath whatever uh to to researchers documentarists what have you so that we can get the fullest pictures possible of one of the most probably the most extraordinary 80 years in the history of the human race. Uh so yes that is a factor. Uh but deathbed confessions can do do have power in a court of law but not in the court of the UAP truth embargo. &gt;&gt; Do you think the initial disclosure will say yes we admit there are ETS out there and we&#x27;re aware of it but we&#x27;ll get back to you on it? &gt;&gt; No. No, that won&#x27;t be a luxury they&#x27;ll have.</p>
<p>Uh the way things are setting up we and I&#x27;ve said this a number of times. We we we have been for seven years trying to establish the infrastructure so the president could step forward whether the president knew that or not I think the president sort of knew uh well there&#x27;s two meaning that in order to have responsible disclosure which is what is meant when you hear control disclosure in the act or some of the insiders talking it&#x27;s responsible disclosure it&#x27;s not we&#x27;re going to control it manipulate it uh to death and and uh and fill it full of whatever in order to get what we want. No. Uh that&#x27;s not what you mean. Responsible disclosure is meaning the information comes out, the tech comes out in a way that is responsible uh and not uh capable of causing immediate issues and problems uh endangering national security, whatever.</p>
<p>There is a way to do it responsibly. Just dragging a bunch of stuff out in the White House lawn and have people go through it like a yard sale, that&#x27;s not responsible, right? So, um, we&#x27;re pretty much set up that now because of all that&#x27;s happened in the last seven years and in the last year for sure that if the president were to come out tomorrow and say, &quot;Yeah, I think it&#x27;s time for me to step in here. I&#x27;m aware.&quot; uh and confirming there&#x27;s a technologically advanced non-human presence and yes technology and programs and what have you and I&#x27;m confirming that to you today and you can expect a lot of things to immediately start happening that&#x27;s all the president has to do that&#x27;s disclosure nothing he doesn&#x27;t have to provide any specifics or anything just confirm it as the head of the commander-in-chief of the armed forces president of the United States um then most everything else will follow uh uh out of the congress uh and elsewhere. Uh the president can just step back. The UAP disclosure act would probably pass very quickly.</p>
<p>It would not be difficult. Would be maybe a little more responsible if they got the act done first and the president stepped out. But frankly, things are getting a little interesting now. So it might be advantageous to step out and it&#x27;ll be fine. the president will be fine.</p>
<p>Nothing grotesque is going to happen. It&#x27;s going to be received quite well. It&#x27;s not going to be a shock or a surprise. It&#x27;s not going to do any political damage. Might even do some uh very helpful politically.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;ve gotten to that point. That&#x27;s what all this has been about. And that&#x27;s one of the problems that people have had on this is because majority of just regular people that learn about this think that this is this is about getting all the information out that that they&#x27;re going to tell us something about it. We&#x27;re going to learn more in this hearing and more in that hearing and then eventually they&#x27;ll bring in the ETSs and they&#x27;ll testify or whatever. That&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s about.</p>
<p>That comes out post disclosure. What is happening now is appropriate things like hearings, media coverage, some witnesses coming forward and speaking in order to create the platform for it all to come out in a responsible way. A platform for the president to come forward and disclose capital D. And that&#x27;s why people are a little confused. They&#x27;re thinking, well, why why aren&#x27;t they telling this? Why aren&#x27;t they telling that? they&#x27;re doing what they have to do to set up the political action essentially it&#x27;s a political act from the president.</p>
<p>Um and so it it and it serves that agenda. Uh and it has pretty much succeeded all that has happened all the hearings all the briefings all the media coverage all the actual statements and podcasts by high level members of the government and so forth. All of that is pretty much set a normalized a situation for a responsible confirmation by the president. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on and that&#x27;s how to look at it. And on that basis, we&#x27;re we&#x27;re ready, right? We&#x27;re we&#x27;re pretty much ready.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, basically, will it happen? &gt;&gt; Basically, to me, what you&#x27;re saying is that it has to be made safe for the president to come out and make this announcement. Politically safe. &gt;&gt; No, not not not politically safe, though. Let me put it this way. If it&#x27;s done right, political safness follows.</p>
<p>Okay. But that&#x27;s not the the principal reason for creating that platform. You want to set a situation when the president comes forward, it will be viewed as um a little surprise, but yeah, I&#x27;m not too surprised. I kind of expected this. Uh there&#x27;s so much to immediately turn to and read about if you&#x27;re a little, you know, whoa, what what&#x27;s what&#x27;s this? Plenty of information.</p>
<p>You can even call up your your member of Congress, what have you. And so it really makes it safe for the public. They&#x27;re not going to get rattled. It&#x27;s not going to be awkward. And if it&#x27;s not going to be awkward, that&#x27;s good for the president just in general as commander-in-chief, not just a political uh partisan president, but rather as commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>So I would cast it more that way. In other words, this this by and large is is something this is a historical process that is remarkably nonpartisan and has remained so for reasons that are fairly straightforward. It&#x27;s not not uh rocket science to figure that out. Uh and it will hopefully stay that way and I think it will stay that way even if we get disclosure tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Well, how much do you really think Trump knows? Because it&#x27;s easy for them to still hide a lot of information from him.</p>
<p>Well, just about every president has had most of it, almost all of it hidden from them in a sense. In other words, they they had access. I think every president has been given the basic thing that yeah, this is this is real. I mean, presidents are fairly smart. They can go and read books on Roswell.</p>
<p>They It&#x27;s not hard to to study some of the highlights. Uh, and if you&#x27;re the president, there are plenty of people that want you to know. Uh, and because you are the president, you can know. In other words, anybody that comes in and tells the president something, it&#x27;s going to be very difficult to haul them before some tribunal and say, &quot;Oh, no, no, no. Uh, you you weren&#x27;t cleared to do that.&quot; Which might be true, but the president is cleared to hear it.</p>
<p>And so they&#x27;ve all known all the way from from uh Truman forward, but they&#x27;ve all chosen to stay back. Now, some knew more than others, but the fundamentals, is there a nonhuman presence, a technologically advanced non-human presence? Have we obtained some of that technology? I think that has been known by every single one. Carter did try to do something uh overt, but it was stopped pretty quickly. Clinton was encouraged to do something, lasted actually for a couple of years, but ultimately did not go anywhere uh too soon. That&#x27;s about it.</p>
<p>But every president knew. And again, one of the reasons that it did not get to this point is that during those presidencies, that platform was not established prior to well, in the in the the only other time it might have been pretty straightforward. It would have been right in the beginning. Truman could have done it. He could have told Remy, &quot;Stand down.</p>
<p>Uh, we&#x27;re going to take a week and then we&#x27;re going to step out on this.&quot; And at that time, people would have been shocked. Whoa. But, uh, we just went through World War II. We were doing fine. Uh, and it would have been another century.</p>
<p>The century would have been completely different. Eisenhower obviously knew and he could have he could have done it. Uh, wouldn&#x27;t have been too bad. I mean, you got a five-star general who helped win World War II, uh, highly esteemed, particularly by the the people who are of a national security bent. So, if Eisenhower comes out and says it, again, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27; have gone too badly.</p>
<p>instead he just hinted at it when he went out the door right uh before Kennedy took over with his famous speech regarding uh being concerned about the the power and undue influence of the military intelligence industrial complex um and then after that no uh Kennedy I think had some interest in going there but it wasn&#x27;t wellreceived I assure you uh and he did not have the kind of gravitas that Truman or certainly Eisenhower had and that&#x27;s it. And so we move forward. Now it&#x27;s just not going to happen. But we&#x27;ve come around 80 years and we&#x27;re now in a situation where so much has been done in the in the private world by thousands of people using their own money, their own time, uh operating in extremely difficult environment where the government says everything you&#x27;re doing is a waste of time. and they&#x27;ve built up a mass body of evidence.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve built up a media presence. They built up uh some political involvement. Uh they formed organizations had everything that you would do but uh with difficulty, right? That wasn&#x27;t necessary. But the truth embargo made it that way. And they finally got it to the point where the government could finally step in in the way it had to partially because of other things.</p>
<p>I mean there were plent the world is different than it was. It&#x27;s constantly changing. The tech has advanced to the point where the ability of of just regular citizens to engage subjects and spread the word all over the place and connect with each other is off the scale compared to 50, 60, 70 years ago. And so it all comes together right around now where if if a president was the kind of person that would challenge um the status quo uh the platform is pretty much there and if the president wanted to do it&#x27;s no problem. And but this is also true for the other heads of state.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s not out of the question that another head of state being informed about all that&#x27;s happening here in the United States looks at that and goes, &quot;Thank you for building that platform for me.&quot; And that head of state comes out, confirms the extraterrestrial presence. And then everyone else follows, including our president, which would be second or worse. And there&#x27;s no prize, zero prize for second or worse. And it will diminish the United States in various ways. That&#x27;ll all work out in time.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s worth noting anybody that&#x27;s managing the truth embargo that thinks that somehow they have some magical control over every other major head of state of the nuclear nations that somehow they&#x27;ve got them on some sort of blackmail list and they they would never do that. They&#x27;re living in La La Land. And so we are could easily become second on this at any time. And I like to mention that because that&#x27;s the kind of thing that can motivate people of the highest rank. Right.</p>
<p>Do you want to be first or do you want to be a sloppy second? &gt;&gt; When you say being second, are you saying that potentially Russia or China could be the first? &gt;&gt; Abs. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s stopping them now? Well, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s a question I&#x27;m asked all the time. There&#x27;s no clear answer. Only they know.</p>
<p>uh but there is one answer that has a certain uh common sense quality to it. It&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not some huge leap of logic and that is that are two major quote adversaries. Certainly the two nations with powerful nuclear weapons who are not exactly hanging out with this every Friday night to go get, you know, milkshakes at the local soda shop. um are ideological control states. Different versions of it but basically the same and they work.</p>
<p>They are able to function and do things and build economies uh based on the ability of the government to maintain very very tight control over the ideological expression of their citizens. In other words, there&#x27;s a lot of good things you can do here. You can make money, you can have careers, you can do this, you can that. But we don&#x27;t want to be hearing your thoughts about the philosophical underpinnings of your government. We don&#x27;t want any protest.</p>
<p>All right? Uh and because they know that if they they allowed their citizens to go where American citizens have gone and are, all hell would break loose. And they&#x27;re not going to allow that because I think in the United States we we we have a a very current lesson that freedom of speech. Uh and the range of actions that our constitution allows can be very helpful and very uh useful in in in maintaining a robust society. It could also create utter chaos and ideological states hate utter chaos. And so I think all of the leaders of China and Russia and the Soviet Union period 40s whatever China was in a very different place than the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So was a but they they they had plenty on their plate. I didn&#x27;t know what to deal with this that they they understood that announcing to the the all their citizens that there&#x27;s a non-human presence here that&#x27;s not a member of the communist party does has never read Male&#x27;s red book uh represents god knows what. Uh the universe is way more than we ever knew. Uh this is not good and they don&#x27;t want it. A perfect example of that is a while back.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s been about 15 years, maybe a little longer. Chinese government went absolutely nuts over a an exercise routine called fing gone. Uh people were being arrested for practicing it, right? It&#x27;s like arresting them for tai chi or something. Uh because somehow they saw that is taking them away from the ideological uh u uh thread that they they want them on. Now the ET issue would be a thousand times more than that.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the only answer I have. However, that&#x27;s been in the past. We are now in a different place and it&#x27;s a different world. I could and and these countries are pretty well developed, particularly China. Uh and they may not feel as concerned about telling their people, you&#x27;re not alone in this universe.</p>
<p>They actually may think it strengthens them, gives them more gravitas, particularly if they&#x27;re first. These are the kinds of things I would say if I was an advisory panel to the Pentagon or the White House, which you know, I think that I if the invites came, I missed them. They they they got tossed out in the mail. That&#x27;s the kind of thing I would say, but I can say it on podcast and who knows, it might get to them, slide in the back door, but it&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;m saying is radical. Uh if you think you can just wait to be first on this, you are living in a fantasy world and uh you are not going to be thanked if we end up going second or third or fourth on ending this era in the in the story of humans.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; If we had a million man march through Washington demanding disclosure, would that make a difference? &gt;&gt; It wouldn&#x27;t hurt, but it&#x27;ll never happen. Uh there are things people march for and there are things that they don&#x27;t march for. This is one of the things you do not march for. Uh and you may say what difference does it make? Marching is is a very visceral personal thing. It&#x27;s it takes a lot of time and effort and so forth.</p>
<p>Um and it&#x27;s the kind of thing people do when their well-being is threatened. when they&#x27;re actually experiencing harm when something is happening that is very upsetting negative people are capable of getting together in huge groups. Gen Zers have been gathering of late and overt topping governments around the world, burning down palaces because they&#x27;re not happy and they shouldn&#x27;t be. Cuz if you&#x27;re a Gen Z born between 1997 and 2012 based upon the assessment of my supercomput, you&#x27;re screwed. Your future is not good at all.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not good. It&#x27;s really bad. So, whatever you thought it was going to be, whatever you read in history books or online about how it used to be ain&#x27;t going to be that way for you, uh, and right now they&#x27;re the largest generation on the planet, over two billion. So, you got two billion people that are facing a future that like ain&#x27;t going to work out. The numbers are not there, and they&#x27;re really getting irritated.</p>
<p>Now, could that be addressed? Yeah, but it ain&#x27;t. And so, they&#x27;re starting to march and their numbers are huge. But again, for the kinds of things that people march for, trying to get the government to stop telling a lie or preventing the truth on a reality that is credible, non-human, out there, very likely, most likely, is not something that immediately impacts your your sense of of selfworth or comfort and safety or what have you. It it doesn&#x27;t. uh and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s something that can easily be ascribed to the government realm.</p>
<p>In other words, that&#x27;s your job. So, people are just not going to march. There have been a couple of attempts. They didn&#x27;t work and they never will. Uh now if this is this issue could change for instance if the if we got into open contacts with the ETSs post disclosure and the ETSs were saying uh you have to get rid of the nukes uh or we&#x27;re going to uh get rid of them for you or we&#x27;re going to do some things you don&#x27;t like because that&#x27;s been the whole reason why or major reason why we&#x27;ve been hanging out for 80 some years now and the governments refused to do it which means that they&#x27;re holding up something incredibly important.</p>
<p>and also scaring the hell out of people. Under a situation like that, millions of people could very well go to the streets and demanding that the government do what these ETs are suggesting. Sort of demanding, I don&#x27;t know, something like that, but it&#x27;s got to get to that kind of level. And that&#x27;s one of one of the hundreds of reasons why the truth embargo&#x27;s lasted 80 years. It&#x27;s not something we will really go to the wall on in that sense and march uh make up signs and so forth.</p>
<p>No. And that helped the embargo hang around for incredible long time. &gt;&gt; Well, my only rebuttal is, do you remember a couple years ago this guy did this thing online where he said, &quot;We&#x27;re all going to storm Area 51.&quot; &gt;&gt; And a lot of people signed up for that. I think millions of at least no million people signed up. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not who signs up.</p>
<p>Anybody can sign up. It&#x27;s how many people showed up in in uh in Area outside Area 51 in racial. It wasn&#x27;t many. Was a few hundreds. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t you think though that that was shut down so they all wouldn&#x27;t show up? &gt;&gt; Well, there were a number of things that emerged uh pointing out that it wasn&#x27;t a good idea. Uh, but I assure you that was as close to a quote march, but it it wasn&#x27;t so much a march. It was a when you know what a dance &gt;&gt; it was going to be a party, too. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It was like a Gen X party. It was a fun thing in a way.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It was it was a dance party. &gt;&gt; It was fun. That was kind of a prank. So So hey, it was interesting. It it generated some attention.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think it was a negative per se, but I knew nothing was going to go. We were we were just very thrilled that nobody got hurt. Nobody got carded off in the back of a truck uh van. Uh that&#x27;s as close as we come to what you were talking about. And I&#x27;m afraid that wasn&#x27;t going to change things much at all.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It did sell a lot of it. It sold a lot of burgers at the Alien Inn. &gt;&gt; That and t-shirts. &gt;&gt; And t-shirts. Yes.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t forget those. Did you see recently that Pope Leo said that if ETSs were going to show up, he would baptize them? &gt;&gt; You mean the current pope? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I was aware that he said that it was quite possible there was extraterrestrial life. I did not know that he had mentioned the baptizing. Another pope has done that.</p>
<p>I forget which one they said that. There have been a number of statements from various uh Vatican figures that are very favorable on this issue. But if he also said we&#x27;d baptize him, then he&#x27;s falling uh in line with a previous pope, he&#x27;s only been for a couple of months, u that he would go there so soon just reconfirms the commitment that the Catholic Church is going to be on the right side of this issue. They&#x27;re not standing in the way and they&#x27;re prepared to uh deal with their billion plus uh uh members of the of the church uh in a positive and constructive way as they learn that uh the universe is even more cool than uh we knew. &gt;&gt; I think if they rolled out all this tech, it would be a great way to stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, but rolling out the tech, in other words, the the tech I&#x27;m I think here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d characterize this aspect of the post-disclosure era, which can start again tomorrow. All it takes is the president to do something. Uh the tech will come out, but it will come out in an orderly way. Um and I believe the government has a time frame on that, meaning this many years to get that and whatever. And whatever their time frame is, cut it in half at least because it&#x27;s not going to it&#x27;s not going to take as long as you think because only once disclosure takes place and this process is underway, which could be almost immediately.</p>
<p>When that happens, the public is now fully on board. Not just Americans, but everyone, right? Well, every country is going to have a huge level of interest by the public. and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re not going to be leaning towards let&#x27;s take our time. They&#x27;re going to be saying, &quot;Uh, we&#x27;d like it yesterday if you don&#x27;t mind. Thank you very much.&quot; And there&#x27;s going to be huge pressure on the government to do it quicker, not slower.</p>
<p>And so, it will still come out in an orderly way, but on a faster time schedule than the government may think uh is likely now. And it will come out in a way that&#x27;s responsible. And as it comes forward, uh I believe a lot of very smart people are going to spend a lot of time and money trying to figure out how to take that technology and make a lot of money making a uh billions of people&#x27;s lives a lot better, which is what they have to do. If they thinking we&#x27;re going to keep things like the same but make even more money uh doing the same thing with better tech, uh they&#x27;re living in a dreamland cuz that&#x27;s not going to happen. The world is too on top of this.</p>
<p>Who are disclosures best friends in Congress or the government and should they be supported &gt;&gt; in Congress in government? &gt;&gt; Well, generally government officials like the Secretary of State and Luna and &gt;&gt; Well, we now know that the current vice president and the current Secretary of State are on board. Of course, Marco Rubio was on board when he was a senator. He he he put in some initial legislation. It was the first piece of legislation ever. But in the House, you&#x27;ve got Luna, Mace, Berles, Moscowitz.</p>
<p>Um, leaving plenty off. Um, sorry. In the Senate, you&#x27;ve got Schumer and Rounds and Gillibrand. Um, at least, right? These are the ones that are pretty much on record. Um, and there are others that are on record as well.</p>
<p>And so they are the front in a sense. Now for every one of those, there&#x27;s five or six members of Congress who are definitely aware but not ready to step forward yet. I think the age of disclosure is going to impact that. And so you&#x27;re going to see more members of Congress going public and saying things. In fact, the age of disclosure is going to impact everything.</p>
<p>The Age of Disclosure is going, the movie is going to impact hundreds, several hundred members of Congress who are holding back, but they know what&#x27;s going on and they decide they&#x27;ll come forward. So, it&#x27;s going to affect them. It&#x27;s going to affect the media because it&#x27;s going to generate a lot more press. All right? And most importantly, it&#x27;s going to affect witnesses. A lot of the witnesses that have been on the fence about whether they&#x27;re willing to testify, assuming they&#x27;re not going to be subpoenaed, u may decide, okay, I can do it now.</p>
<p>So, that&#x27;s huge. Uh it&#x27;s going to affect the media. It&#x27;s going to affect witnesses. It&#x27;s going to affect uh uh members of Congress, and that in and of itself uh is going to have a dramatic impact on this issue. aside from just the fundamental testimony that&#x27;s going to be uh given say testimony the information given in these interviews and so all of that is going to pile up and another reason why I&#x27;m thinking maybe we&#x27;re close to the end on this &gt;&gt; what is your take on threei Atlas &gt;&gt; well if you can get me a betting app I&#x27;ll load up a betting app that&#x27;s going I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re taking they&#x27;re taking bets on this they take bets on everything now uh it&#x27;s getting out hand.</p>
<p>Thank god I&#x27;m not like 25. Probably be totally hooked. Um, my wager is on this. I feel Yeah, I&#x27;m not going to get good odds on this. I&#x27;m pretty sure, you know, I&#x27;ll probably bet 100 to make 40, but this is a essentially a comet-like object from another solar system that&#x27;s been traveling for hundreds of thousands of years to get here.</p>
<p>Okay, which is irrelevant, right? uh unlike comets that are in our solar system that keep turning up because they&#x27;re going around the sun. This is not this is a transient object. Uh it&#x27;s coming out of the solar system. Well, so all solar systems are created by accretion discs that form stuff that forms goes round and round and round from the earliest uh matter post big bang and all the elements are the same but the distribution of elements the level of concentration is going to vary and so not every solar system is going to be constructed the same way and So something has turned up from another solar system that is not constructed quite like ours. And so the con the constituents constituency of this very large object is not the same as we are used to.</p>
<p>And so it&#x27;s giving off a phenomena in a number of ways that is intriguing and got our attention. And we&#x27;re going to watch it and we&#x27;re going to get a lot of photographs and it&#x27;s going to be a pretty cool scientific genre that&#x27;s going to be studied. uh and we&#x27;re going to learn more about aspects of another solar system. It only took hundreds of thousands of years to come give it to us and then it&#x27;s going to head right through and go. So that&#x27;s not particularly notable.</p>
<p>What is notable is because of where we are now in terms of the uh the uh uh the path to disclosure, how far along we are, how much it&#x27;s known worldwide. this the interest in this comment is off the charts. There&#x27;s been hundreds of artic I don&#x27;t even log them in. It&#x27;s I don&#x27;t consider it a UFO thing. I don&#x27;t consider it a disclosure matter.</p>
<p>But hundreds of articles I mean they can&#x27;t cover it enough because everybody is trying to find an ET connection. Okay, great. That&#x27;s good. In that sense, it&#x27;s very revealing and important. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s showing the political leaders and the religious leaders that you people are really into this ET stuff.</p>
<p>Okay. Right. And it could be ET, could be a craft, whatever. It may change course. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what it is. Just zel me my 40 bucks. &gt;&gt; Do you think even today ETSs would not permit us to have a nuclear war? &gt;&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t want to make that bet. You know, I would not want to make that bet. It&#x27;s like um you know, you go into a one of these safaris and and uh there&#x27;s a bunch of water buffalo over there.</p>
<p>and you&#x27;re saying uh and and the safari guy says, you know, you want to go over and just kind of get closer and you&#x27;re going because they they they don&#x27;t they&#x27;d ever charge people. Would you take that chance, right? No, you would not take that chance unless you were, you know, you shouldn&#x27;t take that chance, right? So the idea that one can theoretically make a case why they would turn our nukes off or not allow us to fulfill a nuclear our nuclear war obsession. That is not a bet you want to make. You don&#x27;t even want to think about it. And I don&#x27;t like it because anybody that gets there is is going to be less motivated to to uh if they intend to do anything support the truth embargo uh ending the truth embargo to put the time and effort and sacrifice into getting this done because it&#x27;s okay.</p>
<p>The ETSs are in other words the nuclear war threat is one of the number one reasons why disclosure must happen. At one time it was thought to be something that could launch a nuclear war. Well that was then. Now is now. And so, um, we need everybody on board.</p>
<p>So, somebody that&#x27;s just going to roll the dice and go, &quot;Ah, the nukes will be stopped by the ETSs.&quot; They&#x27;re not helping. Again, it&#x27;s not awful. It&#x27;s not terrible. I don&#x27;t blame it. It&#x27;s nice to have some hope.</p>
<p>And if you feel that ending the embargo is helpless, then that&#x27;s all you got. Because if we don&#x27;t end this embargo, we will have a nuclear war. If we, let me put it this way. If we end the embargo and get into the post-disclosure era, we could still have a nuclear war. But if we don&#x27;t, we definitely will have a nuclear war.</p>
<p>And the difference between the two is non-trivial. If I say nuclear war, we will have a nuclear event that could lead to war. A nuclear event postclosure is going to be viewed very differently. Particularly if it&#x27;s we have some time in that post-disclosure era, it&#x27;s going to be viewed differently and the outcome may be not so bad. But before disclosure, it&#x27;s going to be viewed exactly as we expected and all the all the gaming says game out say that uh it escalates, gets out of hand and it&#x27;s over.</p>
<p>So uh that&#x27;s how I view it. Um but do I person what what&#x27;s my bet on that? Would I bet that the ETSs would stop it? I would give it that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a good bet. I would say I could bet a hundred and probably win 500. Right. Right.</p>
<p>That the ET stock the weapons. I if that happened and I&#x27;d bet 100 on that, I&#x27;d make at least 500 bucks. Uh the odds are low. If disclosure took place tomorrow, would we ever end up in some sort of Star Trek one world society? And if so, how long would that take? &gt;&gt; Well, everybody&#x27;s worried about everybody. Everybody there&#x27;s a lot of speculation about a one world society happening.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a thread that&#x27;s part of a lot of uh theoretical assertions. Uh I&#x27;m not a big fan of it. Uh I think it it it reflects people&#x27;s frustrations uh and inability to to understand and and deal with this the world now that has become just way too complex, way too difficult. Shouldn&#x27;t be this difficult uh but doesn&#x27;t necessarily affect reality. Sci sci-fi has gone there.</p>
<p>I understand it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a reasonable sci-fi projection. Let&#x27;s just say that if we end up with what we would call a a planetary governing entity, a real one, right? Not just a a UN type thing, but one that&#x27;s got a lot of governing power. It will it will it will be down the line. It it it may take a 10020 years. Uh it&#x27;s not going to happen right away and it may not be like we expect.</p>
<p>I mean when you we think of one world government basically most people think okay what if the Nazis took over the world you know what what if the you know the communists took over the world or whatever what if the US took over the world but probably bad things would happen right the usual bad behavior would manifest in a global way however postclosure we&#x27;re going to go off in very interesting directions it&#x27;s going to be dramatic changes and so if we end up with a a global authority with substantial governing ability, it&#x27;ll probably not be so bad. Uh, and it won&#x27;t be unitary. In other words, they&#x27;ll still be subgovernances, right? Whether they&#x27;re broken up by countries or continent or whatever the hell, no single entity could run a planet. Uh, you though with supercomputers and AI, who the hell knows, but I I assure you anybody that&#x27;s that that should be the the least of one&#x27;s concern, right? There&#x27;s so many positives that are possibly right there. You know, getting worked up over, oh, it&#x27;s got to have a one world government by 2042.</p>
<p>No, not going to happen. &gt;&gt; What seems a little more realistic to me is what you see in Star Wars where you see this massive governing body and senators from all these planets all meeting just kind of like how it is today. Well, the sci-fi by sci-fi is obviously always anthropomorphic. There are some sci-fi writers that are so good, and I wish I had more time to read because some of these things are pretty amazing. There&#x27;s some sci-fi writers that are able to step [snorts] almost completely out of the anthrop anthropomorphic box and write about things that just don&#x27;t seem to have that human connection at all.</p>
<p>But it isn&#x27;t easy. And for just regular people, we cannot envision anything except from a human perspective. And so if you do a sci-fi movie, it&#x27;s going to reflect the human perspective, human behavior, belief structures, and so forth. And so basically, Star Wars was a a space cowboy movie with all the same stuff that we&#x27;ve always been doing on a cooler scale with cooler weapons, right? And similar similar beliefs, some of which are peace, structure, peace and uh and uh prosperity and so forth. and and and democracy and and what have you.</p>
<p>All all part of the political dynamic. Um and well, the it&#x27;s more complicated than that. And so the idea that we&#x27;re going to go out in space and we&#x27;re going to interact literally interact with numbers of other species that evolved on a completely different planet with different life structure, brain structure, and everything else. and we&#x27;re gonna end up with a cowboy western. Uh, I don&#x27;t think so.</p>
<p>[laughter] But I get it. It&#x27;s easier to understand. I mean, if you&#x27;re gonna go out in space and fly around one of those ships, uh, and do all that stuff, uh, it&#x27;s going to be easier to follow the damn thing if it&#x27;s kind of very anthropomorphic. All right. Um, so I have I don&#x27;t have much confidence that we we could ever end up in a Star Wars situation.</p>
<p>Uh I I think that I I think I I have more confidence that and a movie like Arrival tends to go there. If you watch Arrival, you get a little taste of this. if we actually were in a situation where we were in some kind of a communication with say a dozen species uh cuz the ones that are engaging us now I think have a genetic connection to the earth and so there is a little more of a compat compatibility and so forth and so that&#x27;s one level of interaction but there are species out there that have no connection to this planet and our life structure and are yet that are sensient and technological and if we were end up engaging them in some way we can&#x27;t even imagine how that would be can&#x27;t imagine I don&#x27;t know if a sci-fi writer could even approach it though probably a couple have taken a shot at it uh is it&#x27;s not a criticism of course a human is going to try to interpret the the uh the entire universe as an extension of their humanness and they&#x27;re going to do that it&#x27;s okay uh But if you want to, you know, get [clears throat] have a brain aneurysm or pull a muscle, uh, try not to try to start imagining the universe and take all the the human type stuff out of it and just try to view it from an alien planet where there&#x27;s not a human within light years and you&#x27;re you&#x27;re assessing what&#x27;s going on. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s how you where you got to go if you want to start projecting like that. Um, but I I will say this, the ones that are engaging us now, not surprisingly, we already have a certain ability to interact with them.</p>
<p>We kind of know what they look like and we know some about their behavior and it&#x27;s not too grotesque other than they&#x27;re telepathic, which is hardly that much of a stretch because I think we&#x27;re telepathic. We just haven&#x27;t figured out how to, you know, pull the switch. Uh, which is something that&#x27;s now in in play. research on that is now reaching a uh a very significant level. So that&#x27;s how I view it.</p>
<p>Uh I won&#x27;t live to see that that&#x27;s for sure. But uh some of the gen Z&#x27;s might. &gt;&gt; Where are you getting this information that they are telepathic from whistleblowers? &gt;&gt; The principal confirmation of ET telepathy comes from the hundreds of thousands of contactes that have bothered to write up their stories. um only a small fraction of uh contactee events have been researched, studied and put in books. Uh there have been a number of books I don&#x27;t know and how many you know couple hundred tops uh we we&#x27;ll say written up studied contact only a tiny fraction.</p>
<p>The vast majority of contact events have not been studied and put in books. However, uh since the 70s, uh and 80s with communion and movies and everything else, uh and just a general exposure on the issue, a lot of people have come to accept that they&#x27;re contact or maybe get regressed and find out they&#x27;re contacties or be willing to talk about it at all. And their numbers are large. And the reason we know that is that one of the things that [clears throat] the vast majority who don&#x27;t want to do who who choose not to do anything that that they do is very very human very very natural thing. They&#x27;ll they write up their story.</p>
<p>This is what happened to me, right? Sometimes in great detail and they mail it to a researcher or somebody that&#x27;s very prominent in the field. They they don&#x27;t want to be interviewed. They don&#x27;t want their name used. They may not even sign it, but I just want somebody to know, right? And there are hundreds of thousands of these. And one day they will they will get the an the examination that they deserve.</p>
<p>And those who have looked at these large numbers as well as those people that have been researched and written up in in books, telepathy is virtually universal. So, how many people have to say, &quot;Yeah, I was in process of an ET and he the ET was talking to me in my head.&quot; How many have to say that before you get it? And this has been known for some time. Plus, there was a there was an ET captured from the Roswell crash. Almost certainly was telepathic. So, the government knew about telepathy in 47 if not sooner.</p>
<p>Uh, and they knew about other things. Um, I think they also learned about the ability of the ETSs to integrate interact with machinery and or [clears throat] non living stuff mentally which we&#x27;re we&#x27;re closing at Neurolink only very advanced and so as a result of that our government you know we&#x27;re doing what it does realized that the capability of the human brain was was not as always suspected was a lot broader than uh your typical human does. And they realized that there were interesting u uh capabilities there. And so they they they threw a ton of money and started studying all of this in any way they could under deepest classification. And the reason they did it wasn&#x27;t because they were curious was because they could they felt they could weaponize it.</p>
<p>And this was back remember 47 and on. And so for years and years and years they were doing deep highly funded research to see if they could weaponize advanced brain capabilities which included telepathy eventually included remote viewing included even telekinesis and a few other things that we&#x27;ll probably learn about. And they they want first they wanted to weaponize it. Secondly they didn&#x27;t want this become a thing. Right now there was we got to be careful here.</p>
<p>If if somebody figures out how it&#x27;s done and puts it out on on Twitter or something, you could have in in a couple years, you could have millions of people that are telepathic and and if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re running a country, that is not something you want. You do not want a telepathic citizenry. I assure you. Okay? And so, but it&#x27;s coming out now and it&#x27;s one of many things that are happening now uh that I can&#x27;t even list them all that is really pushing the truth embargo into a corner. Uh and let me let me enlighten on that.</p>
<p>Another thing that&#x27;s happening at the end of the year that&#x27;s piling on is a brand not a brand new but a new significant conference is is about to uh take place next month December 14 to 17. Uh and it is called the state of the world forum website stateoftheorld.forum. There&#x27;s a lot of domains now. All right. And it is an unusual conference in many ways.</p>
<p>Um, but one of the reasons it&#x27;s happening is because of the ET issue, right? So, I&#x27;ll try to be short here. You there is plenty of on the website. There&#x27;s plenty of historical information, but you can find some things on the web, but not much because the original state of the forum uh conferences were held before the internet. And so after the Soviet Union collapsed the and the and the Berlin Wall came down, there was this era of hope that we could actually start going in a different direction that we couldn&#x27;t continue down the path we were on and now let&#x27;s try to envision a better a future. Let&#x27;s fix some things and not repeat these mistakes.</p>
<p>It was a cool time. One of the key players at that time was uh male Gorbachoff who was instrumental in ultimately bringing down or leaving behind uh communism, the communist party and the Soviet Union at least at the level it existed. He was uh beloved in by many people not so much uh in the in the Kremlin but certainly by people around the world. He teamed up with Jim Garrison who was a you know a brilliant uh activist involved in a range of issues back then. Uh uh and he he he he actually went in Moscow and ultimately they decided through the Gorbach Gorbachev Foundation which is in which Jim Garrison was the president to hold a state of the world forum and Jim is the president of that and the idea was simple.</p>
<p>there&#x27;s a potentially new future ahead. We want to bring together very well-known high level people uh to uh a major conference. I think it was in San Francisco. The first six I think were in the west coast to discuss the state of the world in this post uh cold war era and consider how we can move forward right and get it right. and it was big.</p>
<p>I think in one conference, one of the events they they some of the tickets were $5,000 a piece. Uh and so it&#x27;s very successful. Uh and there were six of them. Unfortunately, by the time the sixth one was held, those who didn&#x27;t really want to go in any different direction had pretty much already begun reinstating the Cold War, the nuclear arms race, the proxy war dynamic. Uh, and we were back in the soup headed to where we are now.</p>
<p>Uh, what can I say? Opportunity lost. So, what&#x27;s happened is Jim&#x27;s still around. He&#x27;s into the ET issue. Has been for a while. And as we got close to disclosure, he he he like you know almost everybody I deal with knows that disclosure of the exotto presence is a worldchanging event much more powerful than the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Believe me, way more powerful. It&#x27;s going to take us almost immediately to places we hadn&#x27;t even imagined before. And this was the time to set up another state of the world forum. And so they they are they brought together the team. They&#x27;re looking for ma they&#x27;re you know they&#x27;ve got a number of major funding things out there to hold six of them starting this year all the way through 2030.</p>
<p>And the idea is basically the same. We&#x27;re going to bring through a lot of very smart talented people to help us look at the world where it is right now and talk about how we can now get this right as we move forward. What do we need to do? What do we need to change? and so forth. But the world today, 30 years after, you know, that time has gotten the more exotic. And so they came up with an interesting approach to this which which fits the current reality.</p>
<p>And so the context in which these people are coming together to consider the state of the world and where to go is under the idea that of four intelligences. And each one of the 56 panelists pretty much by and large has is got a strong background in one of those intelligence, some more than one, but one of those intelligences. And so you&#x27;re going to have um representatives of each of the intelligence on a panel and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re discussing uh whatever issues are being discussed, but from the point of view of this area, which they&#x27;re pretty knowledgeable. Therefore, what are the what are the four intelligences that that uh are going to be the platform for this? Well, guess what? One of them is ET intelligence. That&#x27;s nobrainer, right? Um the second one is artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Nobrainer. Okay. The third one is I believe it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s cosmic intelligence but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s essentially earth intelligence or nature intelligence. there is an intelligence to the whole life structure to the planet and so forth and and I I think I&#x27;m going to work check on that and that&#x27;s represented there the intelligence of life itself uh in the the broader scale and then the last one is human intelligence only this time well as opposed to 30 years ago human intelligence includes everything that the human brain can do not just think, but telepathy, remote viewing, precognition, telekinesis, whatever, all of that comes under human intelligence. And that is the fourth of the four.</p>
<p>And so there are people representing every one of these areas and they&#x27;re going to be now this is online. It was going to be at a hotel, a very big deal, major hotel, but the circumstances going on made that not workable. So, it&#x27;s going to be online for 3 days, December 14th, 2017. And uh let me give you an example of speakers or or presenters. Uh we talked about her.</p>
<p>Beatatric Varel will be one of the the panelists and obviously she&#x27;s coming regarding her Vasco project and what may be the fundamental confirmation of non-human civilizations outside our planet because of the Vasco project. she&#x27;ll be there. Dian Hennessy Pal which is now one of the leaders in the study of telepathy because her work uh finally got to a point where it was extremely uh implicative and they if she was in the she&#x27;s in the process of ultimately creating a documentary uh documenting her investigations with autistic children who are telepathic and she put out the telepathy tapes which would have been the uh audio part of it and they they took off pretty quickly. And now they&#x27;re being uh listened to all over the world. Uh she&#x27;s done other demonstrations.</p>
<p>She was at a early conference. He&#x27;ll be in this. She&#x27;ll be one of the panelists. Uh and it&#x27;s another example. Bob Salace is going to be in the ET intelligence side.</p>
<p>Uh again, he&#x27;s the the lead lead person of the nuclear shutdown witnesses and he will be there. And so if you go to the site, you can look at the 56 presenters, their backgrounds. You can look at the schedule which shows who is going to be involved in which uh uh uh panel. Uh there&#x27;s like number of them over three days, two hours at a shot. It&#x27;s online.</p>
<p>Uh and decide if you want to be part of this. Uh I will I will add this that uh I am a collaborator PRG is a collaborator on this. Been working with them for a while now. And so if you&#x27;re listening to this and you think you&#x27;d like to uh have access to and a record of the first uh modern state of the world forum and you can get in touch with me by email or fax, phone, text, um all that information is on my website paradigmressarchgroup.org. I can provide you a uh a discount uh code that will take quite a bit off the uh the uh the registration.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s happening. So again, another platform. This is there&#x27;s this is going to be viewed all over the world. I mean there&#x27;s people there&#x27;s watch parties in many countries that are being put together. There&#x27;s a watch party function.</p>
<p>You can look into that. Uh and it&#x27;s going to continue to build. Now the the circumstances are pretty uh uh uh volatile right now. And so it it it I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to reach the kind of numbers they&#x27;d hope, but whatever. It&#x27;s going to land the plane and then next year it&#x27;s going to be another matter altogether.</p>
<p>uh if we get disclosure is going to be a huge matter altogether because again it will be the first state of the world post disclosure and I think we&#x27;re going to be able to bring in some extraordinary people to tell us the state of the world and discuss how in the hell we cannot make the mistake same mistake we made back in 2000 or the late 1990s and early 2000s when we squandered the best opportunity we&#x27;d had since the Hiroshima bomb to take this world in a direction It&#x27;s not going to be awful, if not existential. Uh, and and I don&#x27;t think we can afford to blow the second chance if we do, unless the ETSs, which I think will go into open contact with us. Um, and I think they will, right? Uh, which may help us avoid making the same mistake twice because I think open contact is an inevitable outcome of disclosure. I&#x27;ve said this many times. I have no special knowledge there.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not a contactee. It&#x27;s just common sense. Uh common sense, by the way, was not allowed in this issue from the beginning. The government basically said, uh there&#x27;s nothing here. You don&#x27;t see what you see and forget common sense.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not going to work. Uh leave us alone. I mean, and that and the and the and the and all the skeptics and the debunkers described on that. You know, it&#x27;s like uh uh common sense. There was no such thing as common sense.</p>
<p>Okay. So, if you just said the obvious, it was like, well, that&#x27;s ridiculous. And so we need to return to common sense on this issue because there&#x27;s a lot that you can understand if you just apply simple logic without the bias of a government embargo uh over your head and I&#x27;m happy to do it. &gt;&gt; Couple months ago there was a media splash about NASA potentially finding life on Mars although it seemed like not much came of it. They still need more research.</p>
<p>But did you happen to check that out? And what is your take on it? &gt;&gt; I noted it. We&#x27;ve been hopefully finding some molecular life or, you know, tiny bits of life on all kinds of places. Right. Apparently, they&#x27;re really looking. My thinking is that they really found it.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#x27;t tell you, but they&#x27;re happy to tell you that they almost found it or maybe found it. Uh, less so now. As you go back in time, finding anything that was non-human life anywhere was a problem for the truth embargo because it was going to really energize the uh disclosure movement, but it wasn&#x27;t called that. And so, by and large, that that had to be classified. And so, if NASA had found a civilization on Mars, I assure you, we would have never found out about it.</p>
<p>NASA would have been absolutely shut out of that immediately by law. And God knows what NASA has found. Post disclosure, we may find out and they&#x27;ll be embarrassed and we&#x27;ll go, but they had no choice. The law that created NASA made it clear, you&#x27;re not going to say anything to the public about stuff like that. That is national security.</p>
<p>So, God knows what&#x27;s in NASA&#x27;s files. But, uh, if they find the actual confirmation of either present or ancient life on Mars, that&#x27;s going to excite me about that much. Okay? because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost irrelevant in a sense. Uh uh it&#x27;s hard to get worked up about a couple of life pretending molecules or something on Mars when you know people are having visitations in their bedrooms at 2 in the morning with fully sensient entities that can float them up into a craft and give them an annual exam. So again, it&#x27;s hard to impress me with that stuff, but they do it and they dribble it out.</p>
<p>SETI has basically been a a front operation to sort of keep people sort of happy so they don&#x27;t press the government for the real stuff. Not really a fan of SETI. Um it&#x27;s done some things. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s helped radio the telescop radio radio teles telescopy but uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really been a propaganda front for the truth embargo whether they knew it or not. &gt;&gt; Well, the one last big question &gt;&gt; Oh boy.</p>
<p>And I know you have to speculate, but however speculate. &gt;&gt; When is when are we gonna finally get it? Disclosure. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ll get it when we get it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; We get it&#x27;s it&#x27;s again all I can do is is is like it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like horse racing, you know? I mean, there are people that that that can you can find advisers on how to bet on horses. You can&#x27;t, right? I mean, they&#x27;re very good.</p>
<p>They know what they&#x27;re doing. There&#x27;s a lot. It&#x27;s a very complicated thing. But even the best adviser, all he can do is give you a sense of that this it looks optimal for that horse, okay, on this day under those conditions. That&#x27;s the best you can do.</p>
<p>But the chances are somebody that&#x27;s really knows a lot about horses, he&#x27;s got a better chance of maybe getting it right or his the probability of it being higher. Uh and that&#x27;s what uh all the people in my field are doing. They&#x27;re bas I say in the field of this issue whether they&#x27;re researcher or documentist or whatever is that we know enough to be able to get a sense of when it&#x27;s more optimal than another time uh and say so and I there have been times when I think there was not a chance in hell and I said that too but overall I always lean toward optimism because optimism is the the lifeblood of activism without it you&#x27;ve got no chance and so uh all I can say is right Now things are very uh f ver b ver b ver b ver b ver b ver b ver b ver b ver b ver burdened. All right. Um it I could see a lot of reasons why something could break at any moment.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re in a we&#x27;re in a place that we weren&#x27;t in uh we we&#x27;ve not been in frankly uh ever though obviously things have gotten better since 2017 every year. But now we&#x27;re in a place that&#x27;s probably the most uh favorable that I have seen ever, but complicated as hell because of other surrounding issues. And yet in some case they may reinforce. Okay? Because right now the disclosure issue would be the ultimate uh distraction or diversion from other things that are not particularly pleasant. Also, it&#x27;s a a opportunity for um people who are facing some serious issues to achieve something very special which they will always have no matter what happens in other areas.</p>
<p>Uh in that sense there&#x27;s kind of an interlock. We&#x27;ll see how it goes. Uh but again, you know, uh Vance has come forward and spoke to this uh twice recently. He he he was on the B uh what is it? It&#x27;s called um podcast. Oh, there&#x27;s so many of these damn things.</p>
<p>Uh and and bragged about the fact that his good friend Rubio was into the issue and he&#x27;s into the issue and Luna has done it. Uh and Gabbard has done it. Uh and John Jr. has gotten into the issue. Bought Lewis Alzando and Koulthart on five days on his on his vetted triggered podcast just coincidentally 5 days before his father was inaugurated.</p>
<p>So all of these things they&#x27;ve not happened before. And so again, the situation is very very um how would you say pregnant? And so if uh the embargo breaks water here in the next day or two, I&#x27;m not going to be particularly shocked. &gt;&gt; You use the word verdant. Is that the same as saying things are very close? &gt;&gt; Well, verdant, vertile. Um it&#x27;s active, things are moving, and uh that&#x27;s what you expect to see as you get close.</p>
<p>Uh but I think pregnant is probably better. The tooth embargo is a baby that&#x27;s been uh I say it&#x27;s not the tr tooth embargo disclosure is a baby that that is we&#x27;ve been trying to get born for 80 years. the truth embargo managers and the government has been pregnant with his damn baby for 80 years and uh in labor &gt;&gt; in labor &gt;&gt; and all we&#x27;re trying to do is act like a u what do they call it uh epidermal needle right make it easier right for them to give birth to this thing it&#x27;s kind of like that and so yeah uh the birth the the disclosure will will trigger the birth of uh a new world. And then the question is, can we take it? A new world if we can take it, which is a paraphrase of something that supposedly was told to Philip Corso by an ET way back, right? Uh in uh in New Mexico. I forget exactly where he was.</p>
<p>I might have been White Sands. have been near Roswell. I don&#x27;t know, but probably White Sands. A new world if you can take it. If it&#x27;s true, and I&#x27;d like it to be true.</p>
<p>Boy, does it say a lot. Just there&#x27;s a lot in that phrase, right? If that was really an ET and he he wanted the radars to be shut down so they could leave because whatever reason their craft was affected by it and he wanted to know what&#x27;s in it for us and the ET supposedly told him. I mean this is he made a video about this for his granddaughter and that&#x27;s out there. It&#x27;s been a long time. Supposedly the ET tells him telepathic know world if you can take it.</p>
<p>Um and what does that mean? There&#x27;s a double meaning to that course we&#x27;re talking telepathy. I mean point take it means take it right. It&#x27;s there for you. Take it right or it&#x27;s going to happen. Can you withstand it? Right? Maybe it means both.</p>
<p>And if it does is an even cooler phrase. I hope that ET is still around. Still alive flying around somewhere. Maybe he&#x27;ll show up and say, &quot;Hey, I was the guy.&quot; That&#x27;s what I said to Corso. And you&#x27;ve done a great job.</p>
<p>Look at you. Right. Post disclosure. You&#x27;re getting the technology out. Now we&#x27;re talking to y&#x27;all.</p>
<p>Your future looks bright. That would be kind of cool. &gt;&gt; Steve, what&#x27;s your website again for people who want to check out more about what you&#x27;re up to? &gt;&gt; Paradigm Researchgroup.org. 501c3. Any donations go towards the next XC conference.</p>
<p>Hollywood.org. It&#x27;s also a site that I well I helped create with Dan Harrari. Well, he created it, but we are the co-founders of the Hollywood Disclosure Alliance. Interesting. Uh stateoftheorld.</p>
<p>Which is the uh coming conference. Beautiful website by the way. Absolutely gorgeous. I want to hire that person to to redo mine, which is okay. But uh uh New Paradigm Institute probably the leading activist organization in terms of disclosure really new paradigm institute.org um and oh you know I told you the conferences but there&#x27;s another one I&#x27;m going to be up in New York in just a few days &gt;&gt; this weekend November 1516 I&#x27;m speaking on the 15th at the uh New Life New Life Expo the New York version.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s one of the longest running events of its kind. Uh and uh it&#x27;s a good time. So uh New Life Expo should get get it to you. Google that. Um and uh come come join us.</p>
<p>Drop in. Say hello. New York this weekend, November 15th and 16th. &gt;&gt; Well, Steve, thank you for joining me again. And I hope the next time we speak, we&#x27;ll be in a post-disclosure world.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. But if uh you know if it&#x27;s taking too long, let&#x27;s let bring me back cuz I like floating around in space with you like that. It&#x27;s very calming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just kind of floating around.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like that movie Gravity just uh out there got the stars in the background and uh it&#x27;s very cool. Very calming. Right. So, uh I&#x27;m happy to do that. &gt;&gt; Um h happy Thanksgiving to you, sir.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you. Uh let&#x27;s hope that uh we have something truly profound to give thanks for. &gt;&gt; I agree. And either way, you&#x27;re always welcome. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sir.</p>
