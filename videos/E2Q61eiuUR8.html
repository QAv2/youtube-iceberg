            <p>okay um but this is uh this was the inspiration you know his work was suppressed a lot of his patents were yeah were taken sealed up by the US government uh for whatever reason I don&#x27;t know but this is some of the stuff that&#x27;s now being developed using his ideas plus some of the others um this is the man I&#x27;ve been talking to for the last seven years Malcolm bendal yes and uh again I don&#x27;t want to get into it today but like here&#x27;s an example of what they&#x27;re doing this is a generator that has no moving Parts it&#x27;s all based on Geometry pure geometry and the and the and here&#x27;s the basic idea is I think I understand it at this point resonance frequencies everything vibrates have you ever like if if we had a an electric razor we plugged it in turned it on set it on this table it&#x27;s going to move around isn&#x27;t it you ever seen that</p>
