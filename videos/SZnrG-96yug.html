            <p>in simple terms gravity is nothing but what goes up will come down gravity pulls the objects towards it according to the quantum field Theory every charged particle has its anti-particle for electrons there is positrons for quarks there&#x27;s anti-corks in theories of quantum gravity the gravity has its own particle called graviton but scientists haven&#x27;t discovered any particle like gravitons yet but if they do according to Quantum field Theory there should be anti-gravity there are many theories that exist about anti-gravity inspired by the experiment of floating a superconductor over a magnet which is called quantum levitation stay tuned for more science videos</p>
