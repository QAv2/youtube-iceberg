            <p>[Music] let&#x27;s talk about first the fact that they seem to be nosing around on whether first they ask like are we the only ones who ever see them is this just a uniquely american thing and the answer was no there have been reports from other countries including china and then there was a little bit more probing on that uh here is just a bit let me just for the audience it&#x27;s um representative brad wenstrup democrat from ohio questioning the witnesses about the potential of foreign adversary uh data on this subject listen there are other people besides uh the us that have had these experiences and reported them is that correct there are that&#x27;s correct uh is it uh all of our allies or is it allies in adversaries what have we learned publicly so some of that i think sir we&#x27;ll save for closed session well that goes my next question publicly have others sit made anything which would not have to be considered closed so i don&#x27;t want you to answer what they&#x27;ve said necessarily allies have uh have seen these china has established its own version of a uap task force so clearly a number of countries have observations of uh of things in the airspace that they can&#x27;t identify and uh do we share data with some with all are they sharing with us we share data with some and some share data with us but not necessarily all that have publicly reported something that&#x27;s correct my god it&#x27;s like pulling teeth just tell the story man yeah unfortunately um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a little more difficult than that i can tell you when i was running the ah program uh some years ago this is certainly nothing new uh a lot of times some officials are forced to dance around the topic i&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll tell you if i made megan um what i find so fascinating here along the lines of information sharing it&#x27;s now laws as most people probably know the the bill that was co-sponsored by senator jill labrand and senator marco rubio was pretty historic in itself truly a bipartisan bill that went forward and is now law and within that law it requires it enjoins the united states of america to work with its friends and allies international allies on this topic it&#x27;s not a choice we have to but here we go into some of the contradictory statements now that i mentioned earlier on if you listen to the hearing you have this impression that there&#x27;s this huge robust effort underway we&#x27;re working with our friends and our allies and we have analysts on board we&#x27;re working with the academic communities but in reality that&#x27;s not quite so accurate in fact a couple months ago the department of defense when asked how many people do you have working on this they said we have exactly two full-time people working on this topic so that&#x27;s problematic right there&#x27;s not a whole lot of analysis and information sharing you can do when you only have two people assigned yes they say all hands on deck but that&#x27;s only four hands that&#x27;s really not a whole lot um we really need to yeah we really need to leverage a lot more um furthermore there were some other very interesting things i noted for example they talk about one of the questions from the senators and by the way let me just say this this is the forgive me the congressman the reps uh not the senators the members of the house the committee members were very very prepared for this they obviously knew the right questions to ask and what they were trying to do in my opinion was establish a baseline or if you will paint a box around the department of defense uh for this particular hearing knowing that they can come back time and time again and say well you said this and now we are seeing this and hold them accountable um if i may i&#x27;d like to to bring your attention to to one of the points that i found interesting sure a question was asked where they they said well are you familiar with our nuclear assets being interfered with and what they&#x27;re referring to is the famous maelstrom uh incident where we had our an entire flight of our nuclear missiles deactivated by a ufo and in fact not only did you have the commander of that flight come out and and inform members of congress uh but there was actually intelligence information reports iirs that were written and submitted and have been released through hoya the mere fact that the task force members indicated that we have no idea about that and no we don&#x27;t have anything but anecdotal information is absolutely shocking to me because that&#x27;s extremely low hanging fruit anybody right now even with a computer can get into google and pull some of these what were formerly very very classified reports that have now been released to the public they&#x27;re there they exist so why isn&#x27;t this information being incorporated into the new what we call the aim office or aoimsg office um it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t seem very smart um you&#x27;re saying you&#x27;re doing this let me set this up because um we have a sound bite this is representative mike gallagher republican from wisconsin uh questioning one of the uh those testifying about maelstrom air force base in cascade county montana back in 1967 and there&#x27;s a description of what happened and then what we&#x27;ve gleaned from it here it is one such incident allegedly occurred uh at malmstrom air force base in which 10 of our nuclear icbms were rendered inoperable at the same time a glowing red orb was observed overhead i&#x27;m not commenting on the accuracy of this i&#x27;m simply asking you whether you&#x27;re aware of it and whether you have any comments on the accuracy of that report we passed that to mr brave you&#x27;ve been looking at the uap&#x27;s last three years that data is not uh within the holdings of the uap task force okay but are you aware of the the report or that the data exists somewhere i i have uh i have heard stories i have not seen the official data on that so you just seen informal stories no official assessment that you&#x27;ve done or exists within dod that you&#x27;re aware of uh regarding the malmstrom incident uh all i can speak to is you know what&#x27;s within my cognizance the uap task force and we have not looked at that intimate well i was i missed a pretty high profile incident uh i i don&#x27;t claim to be an expert on this but that&#x27;s out there in the ether you&#x27;re you&#x27;re the guy&#x27;s investigating it i mean who else is doing it if something was officially brought to our attention we would look at it uh there are many things that are out there and ethers that aren&#x27;t officially brought to our attention how would have to be officially brought to your community i&#x27;m bringing it to you this is pretty official sure so we&#x27;ll go back and take a look at it but generally there is some um authoritative figure that says there is an incident that occurred we&#x27;d like you to look at this but in terms of just tracking what may be in the media that says that something occurred at this time at this place there are probably a lot of leads that we would have to follow up on i don&#x27;t think we were resourced to do that right now some authority figure do i qualify please do it right and and you know something that he says that that comes out there through through you know the general public we&#x27;d have to look at no this actually you were the source of it the dod this is this happened to your assets and equities and you actually wrote an intelligence report and an assessment on this to say that it&#x27;s not part of the calculus is is it&#x27;s i it&#x27;s unconscionable i don&#x27;t understand how someone can can actually say that that it&#x27;s well yes what&#x27;s happening there what do you think is happening there well i think there&#x27;s some obfuscation if someone doesn&#x27;t think that that manipulating our nuclear assets and equities is an actual security imperative then you might need to find another job especially if you&#x27;re in the national security arena furthermore there&#x27;s some other interesting notes i picked up you know they they talk about blue force uh blue on blue and they said we&#x27;re sure this is not our technology which which by the way is probably a very accurate experience because because we don&#x27;t know what that is right now explain what blew up so so blue force is the way we say in the vernacular uh a friendly technology this is a blue force technology this is something we the united states or allies have developed and so the three main things you want to look at with the uap is that our technology secret technology that&#x27;s been maybe tested in a vacuum or in a bubble and we haven&#x27;t told everybody else about it is it foreign technology or adversarial technology russia china uh or is it something else now what i find very interesting during this testimony they they say for the record well this is not a blue force technology this isn&#x27;t our technology it&#x27;s not friendly technology but then they turn around they also say well we&#x27;re pretty sure it&#x27;s not adversarial technology well we know that because china and russia have their own uap programs too so if you&#x27;re telling me it&#x27;s not our technology and it&#x27;s not foreign or adversarial technology then what is it i mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s i think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a silly way to dance around the topic i understand social stigma and taboo but let&#x27;s let&#x27;s call it for what it is if you don&#x27;t know what it is then say you don&#x27;t know what it is um but let&#x27;s not try to confuse the topic with congress by by trying to explain away things as a drone or a quadcopter let&#x27;s face it a quadcopter can&#x27;t fly at supersonic speeds and at 35 000 feet and fly around and then hover over a warship for three hours we just don&#x27;t have that technology yet um these are some of the basic questions that need to be answered because these are some of the basic things we are actually encountering with our military forces um i&#x27;ll tell you another point how they&#x27;re how they i see them threading the needle on this very cleverly one of the questions was asked well you acknowledge a tip yes we acknowledge that the fact that a tip existed which was my program and then of course they acknowledged blue book project blue book which occurred back in the 70s and closed sometime in the 70s but there&#x27;s no mention of any programs in between and in fact when they asked the question i believe it was representative gallagher who said are you going back and looking at any of the data that may have been obtained through other programs and efforts the answer was no yeah they said no well yeah wait a minute aren&#x27;t you the department of defense and aren&#x27;t you in charge of looking back at all the data that we have in our history because what we do know for a fact everybody is aware of the tic tac event the nimitz event that occurred in 2004 involving two two f-18s that went to go do an intercept mission encountered this flying white tic tac what most people don&#x27;t know is that same flying white tic tac was also described in the 50s and 60s as a flying white throat lozenge or a flying white butane tank all doing the same thing flying as 13 000 miles and able to conduct right angle returns so this data is important uh what you want to do is collect as much historical data as you can and then compare and contrast that data to the information we have currently and see if we can identify trends and commonalities that should be order number one because we spent a lot of your taxpayer money looking at this it would be nice to know that we&#x27;re not going to try to reinvent the wheel here and at least pull up that data that you already paid for inflation is at its highest
