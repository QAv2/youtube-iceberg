            <p>so how do you explain that well let&#x27;s think very simply we either have to give up entirely the conservation of energy law because we now have creation of energy by The Source charge and source doole which means you&#x27;re violating humble law of 1848 that&#x27;s right we either have to give up the conservation of energy law which would be you know would be a thing to be do very reluctantly because there&#x27;s so much proof of it in other things so wide a variety of proofs or we have to say there&#x27;s an impel of energy that&#x27;s not observable that somehow is being changed into observable energy and poured out in three space then we say well where is this energy coming in from we can prove it&#x27;s not coming in in three space well there&#x27;s only one thing left if I&#x27;m working in manowski space four dimensions is coming in the time domain over in that fourth axis the only variable there is time so I&#x27;m having energy flow in in the time domain we find a solution because we look at the nature of spin spin is not just turning around like a ball or a top or something it&#x27;s a much more complicated concept but if I sort of think of it as spin it&#x27;s sort of like the spin spins 360° over in the complex plane then spins 360 degrees in three space real space well while it&#x27;s over spinning in the 360 over in the time domain it can absorb energy coming in in the fourth axis because the charge is looking over there and it&#x27;s open to the receip of energy from from that domain then when it starts to rotate so to speak in in three dimensions over in real space it&#x27;s already excited by this time energy the energy it received in the time domain so it is decaying now it is putting out the emitting the energy it absorbs in the time domain emits in the three space in fact it emits longitudinal waves now I can find very powerful support for that in two other areas one is particle physics and one is quantum field theory in Quantum field theory for example mandal and Shaw in their standard textbook Quantum field Theory while in 1984 chapter 5 they very strongly look at a very similar problem they look at the longitudinal Photon and the scalar Photon which is a Time polarized Photon the energies over there oscillating on the time axis okay so what we have is we have a very strong argument that neither the scalar Photon that is the time polarized Photon nor the longitudinal Photon which is over in three space are individually observable but if you somehow can combine the two they are observable as the instantaneous Quantum potential nice because if I go back to uh Whitaker 1903 as decomposition of the scal of potential in the bidirectional longitude of waves Whitaker made an era in his u in his U interpretation it&#x27;s a standard area made throughout most of you1 electrodynamics they interpret the wave after it&#x27;s interacted with the charge in other words what&#x27;s diverted from The Wave by the charge they don&#x27;t ever specify the wave in space or the proton in space or the energy in space they always do the thing after it interacts now if you go back before it interacts you had to have something causing this interaction that&#x27;s in the fourth space because you get three space after you have observation you have a partial with respect to te to tear off the time and leave your Frozen snapshot and that&#x27;s what you see effect anyway they argue very powerfully that this combination of these two give you the instantaneous uh Quantum potential and if I reinterpret Whitaker&#x27;s decomposition to straighten out the fact that he had two effects rather than a causeing effect his input phase conjugate wave actually is a Time polarized wave which means it now agrees with the same thing from Quantum field Theory from excuse me particle physics uh and and Quantum field Theory and particle physics we have the fact that with the award of the Nobel Prize any dipole is known to have uh to be a broken symmetry in the active exchange with the vacuum the very definition of broken symmetry means that some conservation law there in that exchange area has been violated that&#x27;s what broken symmetry means so what it means is if I have energy coming in in the time domain it means that it&#x27;s not flowing back out in the time domain and it&#x27;s flowing out in the uh space free space domain and that is exactly what&#x27;s happening over in the other ways of looking at it so we have an agreement between Quantum field Theory between my interpretation of uh reinterpretation I should say reinterpretation of Whitaker&#x27;s profound decomposition of the scalar potential in 1903 and uh Quantum field Theory we have an agreement between three major things that&#x27;s pretty solid so we can State now that all em energy in thre space first enters there on these Source ch es it first enters there from the time domain basically any three- space em energy we&#x27;re looking at we have converted a little time into that now how powerful is time energy let me give you a little experiment to think of in your head little thought experiment suppose uh that I have a I have some spatial energy electromagnetic energy in space and suppose I reach in here and I compress this by the factor c² I&#x27;m in three dimensions now I&#x27;ve compressed this down to very dense energy in three dimensions what can I do with this well I can leave it right where it is in which case it&#x27;s known as massal MC squ standard thing familiar to everybody no big problem everybody can get their mind a hold to that but I don&#x27;t have to leave it in three dimensions if I pick this thing up and I put it over in the time domain what I&#x27;ve really done is change the photon oscillations from U from uh lateral in three space to lateral over there along the time a AIS so I have a longitudinal wave in the time domain and it becomes what we call time so time itself is pure energy and it in fact has the same energy density as mass it&#x27;s very powerful energy if you want to deal with powerful energy in the photon you don&#x27;t deal with a spatial energy compound Delta e you deal with delta T because you got to multiply it by c² to find out how much spatial energy has been compressed into it so the highest energy Photon in the world are not the low frequency photons but the I mean the high frequency photons but are the low frequency photons they have less spatial energy but the amount of time goes up is exactly by the amount that you decrease the spatial energy and you multiply that by c² so by having the spatial energy you go up to 2 c^2 times uh the amount of energy you got compressed over there in the time you got a lot more energy gained in a in a low frequency Photon but carried as time and that&#x27;s really the reason that Tesla was always playing around with low lower frequencies a lot more energy the real high energy physics is in converting the time into energy which is always done to the source charge anyway just use that process Nature has given us which is an neg inpic process it&#x27;s an open system far from equilibrium it&#x27;s not your classical equilibrium thermodynamic system you&#x27;ve got to go to the thermodynamics like for example of the kind that Progene was given the Nobel Prize for contributions to in 1977 any open system far from equilibrium with an active environment is capable of doing five magic functions the U1 model prohibits it is capable of self-ordering the order comes out of nowhere don&#x27;t worry about it the system does it itself it&#x27;s capable of um self oscillation or self rotation don&#x27;t worry about it all the en you know the energy is coming from the external environment and it can oscillate back and forth coming in and out it can also output more energy than you have to put in there it can also output less energy than you have to put in there that you do put in there the other thing it can do it can you don&#x27;t have to put anything in it can power itself in the load I&#x27;ve been working on this from the power Viewpoint uh if you go curve the space time the other way it&#x27;ll take energy out and put it back into the time domain you&#x27;ll get time uh increase in amount of time but you will also get uh you&#x27;ll get cooling you get negative energy instead of positive energy all that is is instead of the energy being uh Divergent is convergent and it&#x27;s perfectly good Solutions when you got convergent energy versus diver one is cooling one is heating you don&#x27;t have to have eating and you got energy if you open up the model now if you go to U1 you&#x27;re you&#x27;re playing with fire because you&#x27;re just not going to get it that way uh and if you use classical equilibrium thermodynamics you can never tell you can never use that to determine how a non-equilibrium system is operating first of all it&#x27;s already the higher energy it&#x27;s already a exited State it&#x27;s not in equilibrium so that thermodynamics doesn&#x27;t fit you don&#x27;t have to worry about the second law that belongs to the old thermodynamic you have broken the second law because</p>
