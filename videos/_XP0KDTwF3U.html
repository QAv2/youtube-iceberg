            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[music] Happy new year everyone. Welcome to the good trouble show. Super glad everybody is here today and as my prompter decides to do its own thing. Uh anyway, super excited. Hope everyone had a a wonderful time uh during their holidays and a a very happy new year.</p>
<p>I know that uh I think everyone is hoping we have an even better 2026 uh in terms of the whole UAP disclosure effort and uh yeah so our guest today he is a professor of pathology at Stanford University School of Medicine. He earned his degrees in biology and genetics from Cornell and Stanford, trained with Nobel laurate David Baltimore, and has published over 350 scientific papers. I mean, you think about that in in in itself, it&#x27;s pretty impressive. He also happens to have over 50 patents, a leading immunologist and biotech entrepreneur. He invented powerful tools for studying cells, founded several successful companies, and has recently been analyzing unusual materials and biological effects linked to UAP sightings.</p>
<p>He is the co-founder of the Soul Foundation uh one of the places I absolutely love to go every year uh for their uh for their conferences. Please welcome Dr. Gary Nolan. Gary, how are you? We&#x27;re off to a rip roaring start. Great.</p>
<p>Well, hello everybody and happy new year uh as well and thanks for the invitation. &gt;&gt; Uh you&#x27;re you&#x27;re very very welcome. I think this is this is like your third or fourth time on the show, but uh how are your holidays and what kind of trouble did you get into on New Year&#x27;s Eve? &gt;&gt; Uh actually, [laughter] we were in bed by around 10:30. I&#x27;ve done I mean look, I&#x27;ve done all night raves, etc. Party boats, you name it.</p>
<p>Um, I uh, not that my party days are passed. I mean, geez, I went to Mkos to the big end of summer uh, party there with a bunch of friends and 5,000 guys. Uh, and that was a lot of fun. Um, so I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not beyond a good party, but uh, it was nice to just have uh, some time alone uh, with my husband and uh, friends. We went over to the next door neighbors uh, here uh, for a little bit of the evening.</p>
<p>So, it was nice. Very nice. &gt;&gt; Doc, excellent. Did you uh make any sort of good New Year&#x27;s Eve resolutions that you&#x27;ll be sticking to? &gt;&gt; Um my god, we&#x27;ll see. Uh well, there&#x27;s the same one every year.</p>
<p>Go back to the gym. Um which I do. Uh you know, I I think, you know, I mean, let&#x27;s just sort of circle immediately to the UAP thing. It&#x27;s double down on doing what&#x27;s important and not get distracted by what&#x27;s not by, you know, people or efforts attempting to distract uh because they feel that they need attention. Uh and so um because you never get anything done by not focusing.</p>
<p>Uh and so uh you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s important I think so that so that&#x27;s what it is for me at least. I mean, literally in 5 days, uh, I am, uh, 65 years old. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So, uh, I&#x27;m Yeah. So, uh, January 8.</p>
<p>So, you know, I the the clock begins to tick in your head. Uh, it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve accomplished things. [snorts] It&#x27;s more that um I still have things that I want to do. Uh, and it&#x27;s not just about me. It&#x27;s about what can I do for others to either pass on whatever I&#x27;ve learned personally or what I&#x27;ve learned from others &gt;&gt; uh that I think are worthy of uh consideration by the field at large.</p>
<p>Um and so uh and that&#x27;s you know for me frankly it&#x27;s just how to do science. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done for the last 40 years. &gt;&gt; And and we&#x27;re and we&#x27;re gonna get into it. I have I have to say probably my only New Year&#x27;s Eve resolution is to lose the lose the eight pounds that I gained over the holidays. So that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m starting.</p>
<p>Um but folks before we jump into it fully with Dr. Nolan, let&#x27;s talk about about the show. So uh he will be taking questions uh from all of us uh all of you watching right now. So just drop drop your questions into the chat. Uh but do it uh do it in all caps and our good trouble show moderators will uh they&#x27;ll compile the questions and we&#x27;ll hand them off to Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan. Uh and then also later in the program we have a surprise for the audience. Dr. Gary Nolan as you have never seen him before and uh it&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s going to be fun. Uh but first thing I want to jump into is is exactly always right is this whole narrative thing and when it comes to the UAP issue as everyone knows this topic has been labeled as fringe.</p>
<p>I mean really if you think about it from the very beginning and sort of purposefully labeled as fringe. Is the UAP narrative changing in both the general public realm and the scientific academic realm? And if if you think it has, why? &gt;&gt; Oh, I certainly think it has. Um, without doubt. I I mean, there&#x27;s a I mean, you know, it it began certainly or took off with uh Leslie Kaine&#x27;s and Lumenthal&#x27;s article in the New York Times, you know, subject to Lou Alzando and Chris Melon&#x27;s help getting the videos out the door. Um and of course the many brave uh pilots and whistleblowers such as David Grush as well who you know and who&#x27;ve come forward uh to talk about it.</p>
<p>Um you know and but I but I think it&#x27;s important for everybody to realize that uh unfortunately at this stage uh these are all still anecdotes. I mean well the videos are not anecdotes [laughter] of course. Um uh but many of the anecdotes such as what came out from Dan Farah&#x27;s age of disclosure uh and uh the story that James Fox has told about the events in Brazil and what I understand to be things that will be coming. Uh I don&#x27;t know anything more than what James has been saying publicly. Uh you know I I think those continue to uh keep my interest.</p>
<p>Uh and they keep the interest of the public. I mean just look at what Dan Farah&#x27;s film has done. It went to number one uh not just for a week for all time uh for uh you know a downloaded program. So um and of course we know that Steven Spielberg has something coming out. So the there&#x27;s a drum beat.</p>
<p>I I don&#x27;t think that proves anything. But what I think it proves is that there&#x27;s an acceptance for the matter uh that uh has changed I think the posture of those who were the what I&#x27;m just going to just term them pseudoskeepics. Uh they&#x27;re now the ones on the defensive. I mean they just seem to be screeching louder and louder. Um you&#x27;ve got the likes of the Wall Street Journal and the others and thank you very much for your efforts Matt uh sort of getting the news out that uh this uh you know attempt was was coming.</p>
<p>It certainly forewarned me uh and I was able to you know as the last couple of days I put up that uh notice that I had gotten from somebody at the Wall Street Journal asking for my help and I was like in no no uncertain terms will [laughter] I will I talk to you. Uh what I should have done was sent the analysis I had done of everything that was wrong with the last thing that they had done and said well when you when you write an article publicly disclaiming what you said before and admitting what you did wrong then maybe I&#x27;ll talk to you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you know I mean see what&#x27;s interesting is that they expect for instance me everything that I say or everything that Avi says or everything that Kevin New says or everything that Matt Sagalis or or many others say everything we say has to be right and we say anything one thing wrong then oh that just discredits everything &gt;&gt; but when they make a thousand mistakes they just change the subject right and and and they&#x27;re allowed to keep coming back so I think the posture has changed they&#x27;re the ones at least as far as I&#x27;m concerned I&#x27;m like they don&#x27;t matter I get stopped in airports now by people saying thank you very much uh I notice I notice people thanking me &gt;&gt; uh which is it&#x27;s all very nice &gt;&gt; um you know but even my scientific colleagues look I still get invited to give big talks I&#x27;m you know I&#x27;m I&#x27;m helping the National Cancer Institute design a new strategy forward for tumor immunology and actually using artificial intelligence uh I&#x27;m you know in you know I&#x27;m invited here or there I&#x27;m about to get a big award that&#x27;ll be announced soon Uh, and uh, you know, and and what people want to hear is not just the science, but then they always say, &quot;Hey, Gary, tell us a little bit about that other stuff that you&#x27;re that you&#x27;re known for.&quot; &gt;&gt; Of course, the fun stuff. &gt;&gt; I was invited to, you know, Richard Branson&#x27;s Island a few months back with a bunch of friends to talk about cancer and AI, but they wanted me part of it to talk about UAP. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; Uh, and and and Richard Branson was there in the audience.</p>
<p>Um, &gt;&gt; wow. And you know, and it was it was fun. And I I think I made a slight mistake in saying I can be bribed with martini if you really want to know what&#x27;s going on. [laughter] And for the next several days, uh at this, you know, very nice, uh place. Uh I was uh you know, showered with offers of martinis.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; It was I only I only drank a couple. Uh, of course I I want to jump back and and talk about evidence. And, you know, I&#x27;m not a scientist to be honest. I failed college physics and many other things.</p>
<p>I think I was too too busy chasing girls and drinking beer uh to pay attention in college, unfortunately. Um, but back in 2023, the former director of Arrow, Dr. Sean Kirkpatre stated, quote, Arrow has found no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity, off-world technology, or objects that defy the known laws of physics. Then in 2024, uh Dr. Sean Kirkpatre version two or who I like to call Dr.</p>
<p>John Kasloski stated, quote, &quot;Today, Arrow has not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology. What what do you say to that? And then do you think that the specific use of the word extraterrestrial is sort of um you know some some kind of cute uh wordsmanship? &gt;&gt; Well, I certainly think that there&#x27;s some very careful legalistic uh framing that&#x27;s going on. Susan Goff has done so. Uh, and I know, um, our friend, and I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m blanking, uh, Chris Sharp from, uh, the &gt;&gt; Liberation Times, &gt;&gt; Liberation Times has pointed out, uh, when he, I think, wrote to her asking for uh, you know, would you like to alter what it is that you have to say uh, about and her answer was, no, we&#x27;re going to keep it the same. So, you know, look, I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re doing that.</p>
<p>um you know because at the same time as they say we found no credible evidence uh I mean evidence is either evidence or not. I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like is is is the data credible not is the evidence credible. I mean because to say is evidence credible uh is to question the underlying data. uh evidence is only a truth or uh let&#x27;s say uh supportive of a hypothesis or a conclusion in the context of the conclusion of the of the hypothesis or a question. So um it it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s an interesting lack of understanding even on the part of arrow of what the terminology means.</p>
<p>Uh and so um I I think by doing that they unfortunately and and I&#x27; I&#x27;d love for them to be good about it. Uh they just discredit uh their own scientific underpinnings, but then at the same time uh they will publish a list of god knows how many things that they can&#x27;t explain. They&#x27;ll put out pictures of spheres uh moving around, you know, like the one in Mosul. uh and then openly state that we see many of these things. Uh Phillips gets out and says some pretty interesting things as well.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He&#x27;s a Star Trek fan, that&#x27;s for sure. &gt;&gt; And um you know, and he was involved deeply with Arrow, too. So, you know, it&#x27;s kind of they&#x27;re talking out of both sides of their mouths. And I and I think it&#x27;s an indication of the internal struggle uh that might be going on within inside the government uh as to you know what is it? Should we say when should we say it? Um look I would I would love for them just to truthfully tell me it&#x27;s all rubbish and then open the books so that I can validate that is all rubbish. Right.</p>
<p>But because they won&#x27;t open the books and because everything that they put out as um you know uh I think Greenwald of the Black Vault has shown it ends up getting redacted to hell. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I mean I I have my differences with Greenwald every once in a while. Uh &gt;&gt; me too. &gt;&gt; The you know but the truth of the matter he&#x27;s done uh a a you know an enormously positive job collecting data and making it available for everybody and hounding them.</p>
<p>Yes, &gt;&gt; with Freedom of Information Act uh request. So, you know, kudos to him. I mean, I I I I I don&#x27;t hold &gt;&gt; grudges uh except I guess on a couple of people, I guess. But, um you know, it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just not worth it. it it the because I I I think whether it&#x27;s somebody&#x27;s intention or not uh the divisions that happen within any community whether it&#x27;s UAP or or or anything are certainly not helpful and we should always be looking for commonalities uh of purpose and goal and and not personality and that&#x27;s just my opinion but &gt;&gt; sure.</p>
<p>Yeah. No, I I completely understand. What is your one of the things that we&#x27;ve had quite a few sources tell us is that Arrow has made limited offers to a couple three people to financially support their scientific work on the UAP issue and I think that these are probably folks that are uh would be safe to say are developing sensor technology, sensor fusion technology. Do you think that there is an inherent danger with getting into bed with Arrow if you are a scientific organization? And you know, and I&#x27;ll also say I I I look at anyone that were to take this offer, I would not look at it in a judgmental way. I mean, research takes money, running organizations takes money, nothing in life is free.</p>
<p>But what are the inherent risks of the scientists and other organizations partnering with Arrow? So I mean I agree with you that if they have the resources uh that should be attractive uh but there should be a legal framework set up around the use of the data. um you know if if they&#x27;re going to provide me with money for sensors let&#x27;s say uh then I will give them first choice to look at it but I will not give them the right to wantingly prevent me from using it in a publication unless it&#x27;s like well that&#x27;s obviously something of ours Gary and we don&#x27;t need anybody to know what it is but they can&#x27;t claim methods and approaches when it&#x27;s a technique that I developed, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; to look at something. Um, and so I, you know, I I I think you just have to look at it as a double-edged sword. Um, and not allow, you know, secrecy agreements uh to prevent you from uh doing things. Uh, you know, I mean, look, I I I I had a I I have, I guess, still a TS, uh, but it was never really used appropriately or enough.</p>
<p>Um, and so, um, I hold no I hold no deep dark secrets. Uh, frankly, all I hold are confidences and and and, uh, handshakes with with people as to information that I keep uh, private. And I would do that with anybody. You know, if some if I promise somebody I won&#x27;t say something, I won&#x27;t do I won&#x27;t say it. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, you know, the the the the the accusations that come against not just me about anybody in this field that somehow uh that we&#x27;re our hands are tied is just ridiculous. Anybody who knows me knows that I just, you know, it has to be a very good national security reason uh why I would agree to holding certain things in confidence. I mean certainly if I had signed I&#x27;d learned something under TS, it stays secret no matter what it is. Could be the the color of a rose.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter. I would keep it secret. Um but I I think yeah you you just got to be you got to be careful. Um you know I mean I I think in the early days TTSA uh uh you know tried this with um the so-called bismouth material &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; uh the magnesium bismouth material and um you know the the the piece disappeared into the DOE for a while. uh it was returned uh eventually.</p>
<p>It took some arm twisting I understand to get the the uh report back out of from them. Um I looked over the report. it was actually it actually it was pretty good in terms of the some of the basic science but it missed a few things uh or it I don&#x27;t know kind of glossed over a few things and and I&#x27;ve shown publicly you know uh even very recently some more work that we&#x27;ve been doing on it uh that shows I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s something interesting there I I don&#x27;t know what it is it&#x27;s it you know I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s Hal put off&#x27;s wave guide or or not but I I certainly know it&#x27;s interesting. Uh, and I&#x27;ve, you know, got a couple of, uh, guys over in the physics department here in applied physics who&#x27;ve looked at it with techniques that I didn&#x27;t even know existed that show that there&#x27;s just something interesting going on. &gt;&gt; Amazing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It it it does absorb in exactly the frequency that how suggested it would, the terraertz frequency. Now whe whether whether anything would or whether that&#x27;s just some artifact is yet to be determined. It doesn&#x27;t prove or disprove anything that uh Hal has has said in the in the past. Well, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s go back to Arrow because what I want to move into is the whole disclosure issue. So I think what is confusing about Arrow and and you kind of touched on that a bit.</p>
<p>You have Arrow saying there&#x27;s sort of nothing going on here yet there are these silver orbs floating around. Uh then you have Dr. Sean Kirkpatre going out after he left and and kind of uh insulting Congress and and doing some other things. Same thing with with Tim Phillips disparaging whistleblowers. Uh, and then I even get a an invitation on LinkedIn to apply for a job with Arrow with the Pentagon&#x27;s Arrow office and and the the written job requirement that they sent me actually it was on it wasn&#x27;t in the the DM that I got from the from the recruiter.</p>
<p>was on their website. But the job requirement uh or three of the job requirements on this position that they asked me to apply for were information operations, uh uh deception activities, and uh I&#x27;ve got a disinformation, something like that. It was like three three things that were clearly psychological warfare things that you would say, &quot;Okay, um why would they why would they want to hire somebody that has a background in in sewing disinformation?&quot; And at least let me let me play devil&#x27;s advocate to that just for a moment. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Maybe they were looking for somebody who could recognize deception and myth and disinformation.</p>
<p>Not that they wanted you to practice it. Just, you know, to be fair. &gt;&gt; Sure. Yeah. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case personally, but just, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, one of the things I run around screaming all the time is you&#x27;ll always make sure you offer the alternative explanation and all all options should be on the table.</p>
<p>So to to me that just occurred to me that you know maybe it was not about them wanting you to be such a thing but they were looking for somebody who could recognize such a thing. Of course. Yeah. And and that was actually one of my very first things that I thought. And I spoke to somebody who was a Pentagon program manager who actually used deception operations in a SAP that this individual ran and and he looked at it and he&#x27;s like, &quot;Yeah, they they were not altruistic reasons, but it is a fair point that that you bring up.&quot; But it it leads to this.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s, you know, if you back up and you look at all of the confusing messaging out of Arrow and what former Arrow leadership has has said once they&#x27;ve exited, it leads me to this question. Can we trust the government to be transparent on UAP or do we need to take things into our own hands? &gt;&gt; Well, I think after 80 years, somebody should have learned a lesson. Uh, and you know, I think we&#x27;re ever hopeful. Uh, and I think that, you know, let&#x27;s put it this way, maybe maybe this sounds so conspiratorial, maybe it&#x27;s allowed to be so near as an opportunity and then snatched away as a way to demoralize, you know, uh, you know, I I don&#x27;t know. Um, I I you know, I just don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Um but it it comes back again and again to this issue of when I don&#x27;t get let&#x27;s say what I want scientifically at least out of the techniques that are available to me today I invent a way around it. Um and so I think you have seen any of a number of organizations pop up uh with credible funding and credible abilities to go out and uh and do the research themselves. I actually wanted to reach out to somebody who has been posting quite a bit uh and get his permission to mention him, but since I forgot to do that, I won&#x27;t. Um, but you know, lots of just interesting videos that are popping up from credible people and certainly there&#x27;s the work of Avi and the Galileo project. Uh, that probably is the most um extensive and uh properly run academic effort that I&#x27;ve seen.</p>
<p>um almost all run uh through a volunteer operation uh within and of course the the instruments etc are are bought by uh by charitable donations and it&#x27;s considerable amount of money and effort um and so you know I think we just plug along but then there&#x27;s right who you know she didn&#x27;t need to invent anything she went back to data that had already been collected uh and showed that there was something interesting there. Now there&#x27;s evidence um and so you know that&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t scrub. Now you can question whether the statistics are sufficient to state anything or whether there are alternative explanations but she got it done right. She published it in a peer-reviewed nature journal. Wasn&#x27;t in nature.</p>
<p>was in one of the one of the many little family of journals that are all quite credible. Uh and um and then there&#x27;s of course uh there&#x27;s the work we did uh with Jacques. Uh there&#x27;s work of Robert Powell and Matt uh I always say his name right wrong. &gt;&gt; I mess it up. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Matt SDAL. Uh and I apologize Matt. Um he admitted to me that lots of people do his spell his name wrong. We had a a conversation just the other week. Um you know they&#x27;ve published papers.</p>
<p>Kevin New uh has published peer-reviewed papers. So this this notion that you can&#x27;t get it into a peer-reviewed journal is just wrong. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You it&#x27;s always about the framing. I mean I published in science nature cell at least in my area you know of biology. Those are the those are the the holy trinity uh that uh people aim for.</p>
<p>Um and it&#x27;s always about the framing uh and um and it because it it needs to tell a story. Uh it needs to be steeped in the kinds of methodologies that are acceptable uh in the field at the time. and uh and it needs to move the field forward either because you&#x27;re showing a new method or it&#x27;s a principle uh that you&#x27;re teaching or it&#x27;s an instance of a principle uh at least in biology. So sort of like this is how this particular kynise works or this is how kinases work globally or this is how now more recently circular RNA is important in cancer uh or or thing extra things that are basically secreted from cells you know things that are all that you can see the Nobel prizes coming &gt;&gt; from this kind of work uh because somebody noticed data off the curve uh and it was evidence that something interesting was going on. And so to to me that&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like okay so let&#x27;s refocus constantly.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re always having to refocus. Let&#x27;s refocus on what is the data that can be collected. what are the methods statistical and otherwise uh that we should be using to collate anecdotes uh and you know probably at least most of the feedback I&#x27;ve gotten from let&#x27;s call mainstream uh um statistitians is that the bizian approach the basian approach uh is the is the right way which is to use prior and etc I mean I published a paper in science using basian an inference for signaling diagrams. It was a full article in science years ago. So it&#x27;s like I I know of what I speak.</p>
<p>Um and so I&#x27;ve never I had never thought of using it. Uh but this colleague said, &quot;Hey, I could I could do this.&quot; Um so I I I think there are ways to do it, but again, it needs money. So, if Arrow wants to give me money to hire a couple of statisticians to look at the databases that are already out there, as long as I&#x27;m allowed to publish it, I take it. &gt;&gt; Sure. Do you think let&#x27;s say that we do not have government disclosure but um let&#x27;s say AI finds something or uh soul foundation finds something do you think that the world will believe it if it&#x27;s not coming from the white house whatever that discovery might be &gt;&gt; I mean sure I mean it&#x27;s you know nobody disbelieved uh Beatatric&#x27;s paper.</p>
<p>Um they might quibble with the, you know, interpretation or some of the statistical analysis around nuclear um uh weapons use. Uh you know, but none of the quibbles I heard were statistically sound &gt;&gt; and Beatus was able to bat them away quite effectively. Um did it change the narrative that much? No. uh but it&#x27;s yet another uh cornerstone um put in place uh that what it does is it brings in other people. You know, there was a couple of big-time astronomers who were, let&#x27;s just say, serious skeptics, not pseudoskeepics, serious skeptics, who actually came out publicly and said, &quot;Wow, this is interesting.&quot; And that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever wanted is just, as I always say, I just want another scientist to say, &quot;The data is interesting.&quot; &gt;&gt; Right? That doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re going to follow up on it.</p>
<p>But at least if I frame it as evidence for something uh then it&#x27;s uh then then that&#x27;s a step in the right direction. So to say that there let&#x27;s go back to Arrow that there is no credible evidence for extraterrestrials. I mean that just flies in the face of their own results. &gt;&gt; Right. Right.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no evidence that proves it conclusively, at least what they&#x27;ve let us know, but they&#x27;re absolutely wrong in the terminology that they used. And you know, if if that were a paper that they had submitted that they dare would submit to a journal, uh it would be it wouldn&#x27;t even make it past the editor&#x27;s desk. It wouldn&#x27;t even make it past the editor&#x27;s assistance desk. &gt;&gt; Okay? So, you know, come on, guys. &gt;&gt; Step up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Um, so we&#x27;re going to take a little bit of a break here. So, uh, we&#x27;ll get back to Dr. Nolan here in a second, but folks, over half of you watching right now are not subscribers. So, please hit the subscribe button and thumbs up button and leave a comment.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, those little things are the signals that YouTube uses to to decide whether they&#x27;re going to promote our show to other people. And uh we do not have sponsors, so we are completely reliant on all of you at home to pay for the studio space, all of that sort of thing. Uh you can support us on Patreon at www.patreon.comthegood troubleshow. Uh also super chats are open. We I&#x27;ve uh been seeing here we&#x27;ve had lots of generous uh generous donations for the super chats.</p>
<p>Uh all of that financial support allows us uh to bring you great guests like we have today with this gentleman, Dr. Gary Nolan, who we are so happy to be here and help us kick off 2026. Now, I don&#x27;t know about everyone at home watching, but I&#x27;ve often wondered what Dr. Nolan is like outside of science in UAP. And and what better way to show the audience that than a little uh little slideshow of some of some of your uh photos from back in the day.</p>
<p>So, what do you say? Let&#x27;s uh what do you think? That uh are we good to do that? &gt;&gt; Go for it. Yeah, [laughter] go for it. Okay, cool. So, uh yeah. So, we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll pop some stuff up and uh yeah, so what uh what are we what are we looking at there? &gt;&gt; Uh well, that&#x27;s me in uh at Cornell um in my fraternity room uh with a couple of my fraternity uh brothers at the time.</p>
<p>Uh so, yeah, the beard &gt;&gt; I I I actually I actually lost the beard for quite a while. Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh and then I I I regrrew it. uh sometime later. &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That that was actually my room. &gt;&gt; Oh, so there we have the beardless uh Gary Nolan. &gt;&gt; Right. So that&#x27;s me. I don&#x27;t know when it was at Stanford as a grad student.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um where was I? Trying to look at the back the back. I I don&#x27;t know where I was. I I I always have that smirk on my face. So I I don&#x27;t know what I was [laughter] doing. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what we love about you.</p>
<p>All right. Wow. That&#x27;s uh you&#x27;re quite dapper there. Uh so that was actually at um Rockefeller University. Uh so my boss David Baltimore had been at MIT.</p>
<p>Uh when I first joined his lab and then we uh moved to Rockefeller when he became the president of Rockefeller University. He later became the president of Caltech &gt;&gt; uh University. Um and uh this was a a a party at at his house. Um, so it was pretty it was pretty fun. &gt;&gt; I actually I have a funny I have a funny um quick story to tell about David.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So David was amazing. I mean you know truly one of the most amazing scientists I&#x27;ve ever known and such a kind and gentle man um brilliant absolutely brilliant um and uh he had multiple projects in the lab. had 30 postocs uh that um you know focused on his various projects. And so for his birthday um I went down to um the village in New York City because this was in Rockefeller and I I I bought a um cat of ninetails, you know, okay, from a from a a leather store. And I put the names of each of the nine projects uh on the end of it and a with a little tag.</p>
<p>And I was really worried about what he would think about that giving it to him as a gift for his birthday. But he just laughed out loud and he said, &quot;I&#x27;m putting this next to my Nobel.&quot; &gt;&gt; I love that. Okay, let&#x27;s uh let&#x27;s Oh, actually I want to ask you uh did you tie that bow tie or was that a clipon? &gt;&gt; No, I tied that. No, I learned how to tie a &gt;&gt; bow tie. I I certainly do not.</p>
<p>My hat is off to you for that. Uh, okay. So, this is what &gt;&gt; this is back to Cornell. That&#x27;s Rosy. Uh, that&#x27;s me in the back far.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s me &gt;&gt; on the right. &gt;&gt; On the right there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, doing a little collegial little uh reading there in college. &gt;&gt; This is actually uh MIT. This was when we were at MIT and that was my that was my apartment. Um I was actually I think I recognized that book. I think that&#x27;s a I have to go back and look.</p>
<p>I think I I still have it. Um nothing to do with UAP. I think it had to do with evolution. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Um anyway.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. Let&#x27;s say uh that&#x27;s what Cornell did. &gt;&gt; Cornell. &gt;&gt; Okay. So that was me.</p>
<p>That was me like removing the at least the beard and having a that was my porn stash days. [laughter] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh oh, what are we at in the 80s or No, probably 90s there, right? &gt;&gt; This is uh No, this is I think late grad school. This is at this is at my parents house. &gt;&gt; Ah, okay.</p>
<p>Well, that&#x27;s definitely 90s, I&#x27;d say. That&#x27;s Yeah, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s uh Yeah, that&#x27;s me at a friend&#x27;s wedding uh in Hawaii. And actually, the guy on the left was my one of my best friends in college. Uh he was not at Cornell, he was up at over at Ithaca. And uh that was his girlfriend there.</p>
<p>So, &gt;&gt; wow, you found a you you found proof. &gt;&gt; I finally found one. Yeah. There was a um there was a a small cancer meeting in upstate here in Marin at a winery and uh this was an art exhibit that the winery owner had, you know, next to the drinking room. And so, of course, I had to have a picture of it with me in it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I thought it was I thought it was hilarious. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, uh, you were working for the city animal, uh, control there, I [laughter] see. Were you like a dog catcher? Is that what was going on? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a big party, uh, on a ship, uh, that was a, uh, it was a gay cruise. Um, I&#x27;m quite openly out and that was me with a bunch of friends.</p>
<p>And the evening was, uh, the jungle and so we were supposedly animal control. I I had somewhere lost my hat, so [laughter] I didn&#x27;t have my animal control hat. Did Did you have a dog catcher net with you? &gt;&gt; We did actually have nets for a while, but they were just a little too uh cumbersome on the dance floor. &gt;&gt; Uh that&#x27;s me at another uh party. This one was actually out of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>First one was in the Caribbean. That&#x27;s me at another on another ship &gt;&gt; uh at at a party with actually the same group of friends. We we we traveled together quite a bit. It was a lot of fun. &gt;&gt; Love that.</p>
<p>And who is that handsome man with you there? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s my husband, Tim. Um, and uh, this was actually at the hotel, the Royal Stockholm Hotel, uh, for the Nobel ceremony for my friend, uh, Jim Allison. And this was one of the pre uh, Nobel parties uh, we were getting ready to go out to. The the actual parties themselves um, required full-on tux. There was there was an afterparty.</p>
<p>Uh we weren&#x27;t allowed to go to the to the big party with the king and queen. &gt;&gt; Um that was just for immediate family. Uh but Jim had invited about oh hundred guests which was more than anybody else had invited cuz he&#x27;s &gt;&gt; so loved in the community. &gt;&gt; Um and so anyway, that was that. Uh that&#x27;s uh me in Antarctica.</p>
<p>We had climbed up a small glacier. Uh this was Tim and I. Uh and uh that bay below was absolutely gorgeous and we later kayaked around it. &gt;&gt; Um and you can see in the background some of the uh some of the glaciers. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And they were constantly what they call cving off into the water. Um, and uh, in the they warned us many times, don&#x27;t get close to the the glacier sides because you might find yourself, you know, under a a wall of ice &gt;&gt; or the or the wave. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Both both wouldn&#x27;t be good. Uh, that is a a fancy looking machine.</p>
<p>What is that? &gt;&gt; Ah, that&#x27;s the Syto. That was one of the companies that um we eventually uh sold actually um for a modest fee. &gt;&gt; Wow. All right. &gt;&gt; Uh and uh it was co-developed with this guy at the University of Toronto, Scott Tanner, and a few others.</p>
<p>That that&#x27;s probably about the size of Arrow&#x27;s budget, I&#x27;m imagining &gt;&gt; monthly to hire to hire disinformers. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I don&#x27;t come cheap, that&#x27;s for sure.</p>
<p>But but this instrument was &gt;&gt; an outgrowth of um really work that I had done in Lennon Lee Hersenberg&#x27;s lab. They had in they had invented let&#x27;s call it the precursor to this instrument that had already revolutionized immunology at the cell level. It had limitations in the numbers of parameters that it could measure at a time. Uh and this instrument allowed us to leap forward uh in terms of the numbers of parameters. And so the work that came from this we eventually published in science and it also along it g it brought in so much data that we had to develop whole new algorithms to what&#x27;s called d-dimensionalize high parameter highdimensional data into something that was uh you know mortally understandable.</p>
<p>Um and so uh it led to something called pseudo time and uh novel kinds of clustering techniques uh that uh I mostly worked with with a colleague by the name of Donna Pierre who is the head of bioinformatics now at Sloan Kettering. Uh she had been in George Church&#x27;s lab if anybody knows him. Uh George is a is uh a colleague. uh I don&#x27;t see him often but he has started more companies than anybody I I I know but one of them is let&#x27;s let&#x27;s resurrect the the the Siberian mammoth &gt;&gt; right and and other animals. So uh he&#x27;s he&#x27;s quite a visionary.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But Donna had had trained with him and and she&#x27;s again she&#x27;s just an extraordinary woman. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, just make sure you you rewatch Jurassic Park. Things didn&#x27;t go too well [laughter] that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. Uh let&#x27;s see. Uh this is what a death ray that you&#x27;re working on there. &gt;&gt; This is um let&#x27;s call it the next generation of uh an imaging device that had been developed by two former postocs in my lab um Sean Bendle and Mike Angelo. uh they had we had published the first uh version of it let&#x27;s say in uh I think it was nature medicine and then when they left my lab and started their own labs at Stanford independent of mine uh they uh built this as a way to study tumors uh at the uh using the same kind of technology of that as that orange thing that I that you just saw &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; uh using metal tagged isotopes uh not radioactive but sorry metal tagged antibodies.</p>
<p>So we developed a chemistry uh that allowed us to attach them to antibodies. Antibodies recognize proteins or and or RNA and uh they had this bright idea uh that you know rather than shooting the cells one at a time into a 7500 degree Kelvin flame uh that they would shoot a beam of ions at the sample to to read uh tumors. And so this was the start of let&#x27;s call it the tumor imanology solid state work that my lab had done. So when people say Gary doesn&#x27;t know anything about metals and isotopes and how to do them. &gt;&gt; Uh okay well there you go.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There you go. Yeah. And you and you do clearly understand the scientific method. &gt;&gt; I understand. I think.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I kind of figured &gt;&gt; always willing to learn more. &gt;&gt; Of course. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just not from certain people.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. [laughter] Yeah. That&#x27;s right. Uh okay. Let&#x27;s see.</p>
<p>Got one more picture here. What the is that? &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh god. That&#x27;s a friend. Were you in G in San Francisco? This [laughter] some Where did you get that one? Um, so [laughter] that was uh you know, we were about to go swimming.</p>
<p>That was in San Francisco Bay. I wish I still looked like that. &gt;&gt; I I I I certainly don&#x27;t. And uh let&#x27;s see. Uh last one.</p>
<p>I think I love this shirt. uh may not be as normal as I first appear. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that was a probably let&#x27;s see that was the house I&#x27;d already gotten tenure. It was up in San Francisco. That was my house in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Love that. Yeah. Well, anyway, I appreciate you. Uh let&#x27;s see here. Go back to the right right thing.</p>
<p>I appreciate you showing these these uh photos. So, I want to talk a bit about the the the whole disinformation thing like with you said the Wall Street Journal reached out to you uh and and is what do we do to fight that kind of stuff uh these these mainstream media articles that are clearly meant to debunk and discourage Congress from looking into UAP? &gt;&gt; Well, I think the first thing you do is look at the history of the writer. Um, if they have no history, then maybe you talk to them. Um, but you do try to get them to tell you what it is that the article is going to be about. But one of the things I found is that they can tell you whatever they want, but then they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll end up doing whatever they want with what you say.</p>
<p>Uh, and what you say is not always context in the way that you meant it. I mean, I&#x27;ve been recontext recontexted many, many times. Um, you know, so when when uh President Trump says fake news, I understand what he means. Uh, and I thoroughly agree with when he says that that, you know, that, you know, that information can be slanted. And so it&#x27;s, you know, the mainstream media is looking for opinions.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re unlike in the sciences where your where your opinion at the end of the article is about what you think the data means still has to be supported by the data which has to have the methods. And so unfortunately that&#x27;s just not how the news operates. And I I I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re ever going to get around that. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Um, so at this point, my, you know, my leanings are just don&#x27;t talk to them, &gt;&gt; right? right? You know, I I I I don&#x27;t see what the I don&#x27;t see what any additional value it is for to put another piece out about this matter when all that you&#x27;re going to do is give somebody else who doesn&#x27;t have any credibility equal standing as yourself because they&#x27;re mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>So I can say blah blah blah, you know, in the Wall Street Journal and then and then they&#x27;ll say, &quot;But this garage experimentter says otherwise, right?&quot; Yeah. And and I want I want to talk about that now. So I understand you were contacted by the folks at at CBS News regarding this appearance on the program 48 hours. Uh tell us a bit about what happened with that. Well, so I was intrigued uh at the beginning because they were very she was very nice um in in her original ask in the email.</p>
<p>So I called them up and I said, &quot;Well, what&#x27;s this about?&quot; And they said, &quot;Well, we want to I mean,&quot; they said, &quot;We want to have a debate.&quot; And my red flags went up. &gt;&gt; Uh and I said, &quot;A debate about what?&quot; And they said, &quot;About UAP.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, what about them?&quot; And he says, &quot;You know, whether they&#x27;re whether you know the I said, &quot;And with whom?&quot; And she said, &quot;Mick West.&quot; And I&#x27;m like, &quot;Are you come on is I mean, no.&quot; I said, &quot;Right away.&quot; And she said, &quot;Oh, he said you&#x27;d say that.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, well,&quot; I said, &quot;At least he&#x27;s right about something.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Right. Um, so you know, look, I I I I appreciate I am a skeptic.</p>
<p>I I I don&#x27;t need to sit across from a debunker who claims to be a skeptic, you know? I mean, let&#x27;s go back a little bit almost 15 years now when I it came when the Ottakama Mummy thing came out and people said that I had debunked it as an alien. That actually got me mad &gt;&gt; because I didn&#x27;t enter the conversation with Steven Greer to purposefully debunk anything. I entered it to understand it. And I even remember a couple of times driving around in a in the car when we when some of the initial data was coming in, I didn&#x27;t understand what the genetic sequences meant, thinking this this might be real. Um, but then you know the scientists in the back of my head said, &quot;You better go check this out before you say anything.&quot; Of course, I sent I sent emails updating Stephen as to where my thought process was.</p>
<p>Um, you know, so I went and got the necessary experts, which is what you do as a scientist. We&#x27;re not we&#x27;re not all good at everything. Um so you bring in additional people who said well no here&#x27;s the reason why this can&#x27;t be you know unassignable or is like novel gen because it&#x27;s because the data is you know collected from uh degraded material and this and this and this can happen and you need this many overreads to be able to be sure etc etc. Um, and so, you know, when the when the paper finally came out and people were calling me saying I was a debunker, it actually angered me because I didn&#x27;t set out to prove or disprove anything. Um, and I would love if somebody were to go back and redo it and say, &quot;Hey, Gary, you&#x27;re wrong.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s what you missed.&quot; I would love that. But for now, you know, four Stanford professors, 15ish um postocs and grad students, a very large um diagnostics company, RO Diagnostics to whom I had sold the genomics technology that allowed to do some of the analysis and they it became RO&#x27;s, you know, the core bioinformatics team uh had all worked on it together. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh and you know put our best efforts with the data that we had and the material that we had and came to a reason and just basically put the data out and if you read the paper you read it&#x27;s full of caveats. I mean but the but what we could say was there&#x27;s nothing that says that this is anything other than human and here are some mutations that might explain how it looks what it looks like.</p>
<p>End of story, &gt;&gt; right? But of course, you know, the newspapers were all Stanford scientist sequences alien baby. &gt;&gt; Of course. Yeah, exactly. So, so you you turned down this CBS thing and I think there&#x27;s probably a very high probability that Mick West is watching this show right now. He was in the chat last.</p>
<p>I wish I wish you well, Mick. Find someone. Well, I have said, why don&#x27;t you go on with Susan Gerbage and you can have a conversation with Susan about all the wiki articles that you&#x27;ve uh edited &gt;&gt; or that she [clears throat] edits or that gorilla skeptics edit and why they do it. And I mean that would be a fascinate MC West on stage if Mick&#x27;s watching right now and you were to talk to Mick. uh you know what would the deal look like? What would you say, Mick, you got to do this for me to to uh do this thing? &gt;&gt; Well, I think uh I would have to have the gorilla skeptics um delete all of their editing accounts.</p>
<p>Uh openly admit what they&#x27;ve been doing. Uh admit who their funders are. Mick should admit who his funders are. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Um pro I mean they have a pretty decent budget.</p>
<p>Maybe they should uh donate to a whistleblowers charity. &gt;&gt; Um, you know, a significant amount. One or two million. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I think would be would be good. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, publish a peer-reviewed paper in a tier one journal on any of the work that you&#x27;ve done. Gimbal, &gt;&gt; you supposedly done a lot of work on gimbal &gt;&gt; supposedly. I think Merrick should be I think Merrick should be the uh the one of the reviewers &gt;&gt; or publish it with &gt;&gt; publish it with Merrick. See if you could put a paper together with him. &gt;&gt; Collaborate rather than collude against.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean I think that&#x27;s what it is. I mean, [laughter] you know, I I I mean, it&#x27;s funny because I I I I basically put this in a Twitter post somewhere about how I think the whole gorilla skeptics thing is um unethical. uh and made a number of other sort of statements about what I thought would be appropriate. Um and Mick did ask in the thread somewhere, uh well, I&#x27;ll have a conversation with you. I I said because I&#x27;ll only have a conversation.</p>
<p>But he conveniently left out all the other terms that I done, which seems to be his MO. &gt;&gt; Yes. uh which is I&#x27;m going to pick the thing that I want to talk about, but I&#x27;m going to forget about all the data that uh is necessary from for the contextualization. Um and so it&#x27;s just not someone whether he&#x27;s doing it purposefully or not, it just doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s not some I I don&#x27;t need to have a conversation with him.</p>
<p>He needs me. I don&#x27;t need him. you know, so they&#x27;re desperate. It&#x27;s like, why? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To just why don&#x27;t you just publish a whole bunch of things that you&#x27;ve already done? Uh, you know, point to and rename Metabunk.</p>
<p>You know, &gt;&gt; what would you name it? &gt;&gt; Skeptics&#x27;s folly. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know. I I just Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hey, that works.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s because the term debunking implies you&#x27;re coming to the table with a a pre-ordained conclusion. That&#x27;s not what a skeptic is. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m my own skeptic. I mean, I offered the CBS uh person, I said, &quot;Put me on stage with another scientist to and and we could play devil&#x27;s advocate against each other. I&#x27;m more than happy to take the side of This is all rubbish and and argue that against somebody who wants to say that the data is real cuz I can do that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I do it every day in my own lab. I just did it with you with that, you know, um &gt;&gt; job post &gt;&gt; thing &gt;&gt; is, you know, I can be my own skeptic. I don&#x27;t I I don&#x27;t need to. People like that can&#x27;t teach me how to question my own thought processes. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, he he could probably teach you how to make a pretty badass balsa wood model. I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll uh &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m sure I I love him. I mean, you know, look, I I you know you know, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s play acting on Twitter. Um I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m glad that there&#x27;s a voice out there like him. Um because frankly if I mean if that&#x27;s the best there is then I think the narrative has changed.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I completely agree that then that goes back to where we started on on the program. Uh so I know we only have you I think for like 15 more minutes. We have a a just boat but boatload of questions. I&#x27;d like to try and get through as many as uh as we can from the audience. This is from Cool Guy.</p>
<p>Uh, thank you very much for the super chat. If the NHI would have monitored alien reproduction vehicles research, just like nukes to prevent blowing up the planet, is the safety argument against disclosure and and for amnesty really valid? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s interesting. And I think that one through what the meaning is. Um so is the meaning I mean I know the person&#x27;s not there to answer this is the is the meaning that if we have already reverse engineered something &gt;&gt; um is the threat narrative still operable was that what it &gt;&gt; I think so I think that&#x27;s how I would interpret that. Um, well, I think it&#x27;s less operable, but just because just because I figured out what a wheel is and how to make a bicycle doesn&#x27;t mean I have, you know, a uh, you know, a super duper Honda motorbike.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Right. I mean, um, figuring out the basics of something, all it all it says is one of the things that I&#x27;ve been talking about openly is that if there is something here, it is very likely it&#x27;s been here a very long time. I mean it, you know, because you you you don&#x27;t just show up flying around in stuff like what people allege overnight. You probably developed it quite a long time ago, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Um before likely humans had even crawled out of the caves.</p>
<p>Um, and so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re if something like this is real, um, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re a real threat to them, but they probably have enough foresight to realize that we might be a threat to somebody. I mean, you know, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s another civilization in a star system 100 or 200 lighty years away. that isn&#x27;t a hundred million years old is maybe only a few tens of thousand years beyond us. But the elders might know that people like us will soon be able to get a 100 light years away or 200 or whatever. And so we might become a threat to other civilizations that are perhaps at near parody with us or behind us.</p>
<p>Um and so maybe they want to keep an eye on us. I mean, it&#x27;s just I&#x27;m just making stuff up as I go along. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s there&#x27;s nothing there&#x27;s nothing there&#x27;s no truth to this. It&#x27;s just you have to war game out these ideas, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Um and to try to figure out well what what might be the reasoning. I frankly don&#x27;t I I frankly don&#x27;t think even if the government confirmed that there was that there was something here &gt;&gt; that we would ever know what the true intent is and we can barely understand what other human&#x27;s intents are.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; never mind alien intent. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s Yeah, that&#x27;s true. Orange man comes to mind. Uh okay, this is from Adam Martinez. Thank you very much for the super chat.</p>
<p>How significant could the data collected by Skywatcher be to the disclosure movement given your insider knowledge of their operations and how close are they to releasing that data? Um I just shouldn&#x27;t say anything. Uh I it&#x27;s not because there&#x27;s like something imminent. Uh I just think that uh there is some decent preliminary data. Uh we&#x27;ve learned a lot of things about how data needs to be collected. Um and uh that&#x27;s is really as far as I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to go.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Understood. Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh next one actually just compliments, not just a compliment. It&#x27;s from the great science Bob Maguire.</p>
<p>This is a needed interview. Thanks Matt and Gary. Thank you Bob for the uh the super chat. Uh let&#x27;s see here. going back uh through um from Jean Stiko uh disclosure won&#x27;t come from stories or demands.</p>
<p>It will come when we act like organized commu uh community applying science so publicly and persistently that the government can no longer ignore that. I think it&#x27;s a really &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s exactly I mean thank you. Yes, that sums it up perfectly. Um, you know, I mean, look, we we we we can&#x27;t even agree that I mean, I don&#x27;t know if climate change is the right word or whatever. The climate is changing.</p>
<p>The climate always changes. That&#x27;s certainly true. Uh, whether it&#x27;s anthropogenic, I mean, the correlation is certainly there and we know CO2 uh, you know, traps heat. Um and there&#x27;s a clear line going on and uh you know whether humans did it or not is irrelevant to the fact that you know something is is happening. So but people just want to get in arguments about that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So um you know it&#x27;s people still think the earth is flat. Uh, so I I I I don&#x27;t know what to do about that except be certain of your own data and your own your own proof. I mean, we would like daddy and mommy government to come out and validate it, but if daddy and mommy government, and I&#x27;m not taking any uh sides here, I mean, I&#x27;m recently actually registered now as an independent. um changed my party affiliation. Uh if daddy and mommy government are going to change every four years how they approach the world and how they approach truths, um then waiting for the government to say one thing, this administration is only going to change next administration.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, coming out and saying, &quot;Oh, aliens are real.&quot; It&#x27;s not like you can take that back. Uh but um so uh yeah, I I yes, I I think it&#x27;s just got to come locally. But I mean, again, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s an incredible incredible amount of evidence. Anybody says there&#x27;s no evidence is just like just doesn&#x27;t understand science, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s there&#x27;s not proof uh that the kind and but then you have to ask what is your standard of proof? Um, you know, I I said this last night on Twitter. I was busy running some AI projects and while they were running, I was, you know, messing around on Twitter late into the night.</p>
<p>Um, it&#x27;s, you know, it has it has met my standard of this is really interesting. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh it has not met my standard of proof. But if it were a research grant and I was writing something about let&#x27;s say cancer, I have far less evidence for some of the things that I do in the grants than the evidence is already sitting out there about UAP. Um, but because people believe in signaling biology and cancer and all of the rest that the preliminary data that I have fits into uh the mold of what people already understand about the system so they say, &quot;Okay, yeah, this is a credible idea.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go ahead and do it.&quot; Um, and so, you know, if anything needs to happen, uh, if it ever does, is, you know, for the NSF, for NASA or somebody or an independent foundation of considerable means to come forward and say, &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re going to fund this uh, independently.&quot; Uh, and then hopefully it would make it to the level of a national laboratory. uh you know where you could have some kind of semi at least reasonably transparent uh analysis of um you know either the flatsom and jetum that seems to drop off some of these things that that I have access to public materials &gt;&gt; um or if somebody could release claimed materials. &gt;&gt; I mean I&#x27;ve always I&#x27;ve been very open about this. Sure. It&#x27;s like if there&#x27;s stuff that&#x27;s available and there&#x27;s technology to be learned, that&#x27;s what I want.</p>
<p>I frankly could almost care less about what they are and what their &gt;&gt; intent is. The Brothers of Light or Galactic Love, etc. I mean, sure, great. If that&#x27;s the case, um, I&#x27;m interested in what they do. Well, I&#x27;m not a technologist.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a tinkerer. I, you know, because I see it as being able to help mankind. Yes, it will be used for war every, you know, uh at some level or at least used as a defense of or a threat. Uh and um but I&#x27;m interested in progress. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And so I don&#x27;t like the idea that progress might be hindered because something is held back. &gt;&gt; I would completely agree with that. Uh here&#x27;s another really interesting question from MAD uh Mad SQ295. Uh question to Gary. Would you support disclosure if the whole truth would cause immediate havoc around the world? If not, would you support a partial disclosure that confirms intelligent alien visitors? So if everything were to go go to hell in a hand basket, &gt;&gt; I I do I I don&#x27;t want anybody hurt.</p>
<p>I I just don&#x27;t want anybody hurt at all. &gt;&gt; I mean, just that&#x27;s just the end of the story. Um, &gt;&gt; if it meant absolute social disruption, um, no. Now, I mean, I think there&#x27;s plenty of partial truths that society can handle. Uh, and um, so yeah, certainly the latter.</p>
<p>Okay, this is from &gt;&gt; but but but but how put off and and others were on a committee and the Rand Corporation has put out very similar studies very detailed over the decades uh which at various points of time supposedly having had access to the real data have said that whatever is known right now shouldn&#x27;t be let out. So I have to trust I I despite some of the things I say I do actually trust the government mostly to do the right thing. Um I have to trust at some level. Uh and um that decisions are being made in the right way. But what I don&#x27;t like is that if there is a decision that it shouldn&#x27;t be released that people should be hurt to prevent the information.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Or like what happened with David Grush and having his medical records released by that scoundrel of a reporter uh who it was then found out later he openly admitted stupidly on a TV show that CIA operatives had given him the the information. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And is now and is now the subject of a of a court case. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I hope he gets his ass sued off. Uh this is another question from Miss Mississippian.</p>
<p>Has Dr. uh Gary Nolan tried psionics? &gt;&gt; Personally, no. I mean, I&#x27;ve sat in my backyard sometimes and looked in the sky and said, &quot;Okay, guys, are you guys going to show up for me?&quot; But I can&#x27;t concentrate more than 30 seconds on that. I mean, I did actually once there was a guy who somebody told me about who lived way up here in the Santa Cruz Mountains. He would he used to be a doctor at Stanford who uh claimed interactions.</p>
<p>And I drove up to his place which was way up in the woods in the Seoia uh forest in the woods and down this windy road and we sat in his backyard and he claimed that he was interacting with something on another place. Uh, and um, you know, we I did see a couple of things move in strange ways. And I said, &quot;What are you interacting with?&quot; And he said, &quot;Well, you know, I&#x27;m interacting with this alien or whatever that lives by itself off in a hut.&quot; And I said, &quot;Sounds like you&#x27;re interacting with yourself. I mean, you you live out here in the middle of nowhere.&quot; &gt;&gt; Um, so I don&#x27;t know. That was fun.</p>
<p>That was interesting. Um, but no, I I haven&#x27;t done so. I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve been present when people have tried it. I&#x27;ve seen the commotion, but I didn&#x27;t see anything personally. So, I just again I just it&#x27;s kind of going back to what John Mack uh said is that I people experience andor see things that I I believe that they believe that they experienced or saw it.</p>
<p>And we look I&#x27;ve also been very open. I I saw things when I was a kid. I mean quite clearly and that motivates my conviction but it&#x27;s not a proof I can hand to somebody else. &gt;&gt; Right. So, um, you know, it&#x27;s just just another story, but you know, I know what I saw.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t that the title of a movie? &gt;&gt; That one about the uh the Phoenix Lights. &gt;&gt; I think so. Oh, yeah. Exactly. &gt;&gt; I know what I saw, you know, and so maybe, you know, maybe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s necessary.</p>
<p>Maybe they need to fly over again and fly over Mick West House and [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. D drop drop drop a few uh a few signals from the helicopter. &gt;&gt; Didn&#x27;t Mick say that he wasn&#x27;t Wasn&#x27;t part of his thing that he he he was scared of some like was it ghosts or something? &gt;&gt; I Yeah, some I think he had like hallucinations as a kid crawling up the wall. Yeah, something&#x27;s going on there. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Well, no. And that&#x27;s and that&#x27;s serious and that&#x27;s real and I don&#x27;t discount it and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a negative whatsoever. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you know, I mean, we all have traumas. Um, but I don&#x27;t think that we should pass the trauma on by traumatizing other people&#x27;s to make ourselves feel better &gt;&gt; about it. &gt;&gt; I mean, putting somebody else down to make yourself feel better uh is just passing on historical violence to me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m with you on that. Uh, okay. Here, uh, just a couple more. We know we have just a few more minutes with you. Thank you, Matt and Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan. This is from the the guy for for Tado. Thank you for the super chat. Uh question. How can society instigate sci scientific thinking on the layman&#x27;s level and promote a healthy factual curiosity? Well, you know, I think frankly one of the best datadriven books that I&#x27;ve read is uh Swords and Powell&#x27;s book UFOs and Government.</p>
<p>Um it&#x27;s just choa block with data and instances and I&#x27;ve given it or pointed many of my colleagues at it and those who&#x27;ve read it and said they&#x27;ve read it says, &quot;Wow, I didn&#x27;t even know that this kind of data existed.&quot; Um, and so, you know, I mean, certainly nobody&#x27;s going to read you. You you know, it&#x27;s a tome. I mean, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s but it&#x27;s so well researched and so well done. Um, you need sort of a I I wouldn&#x27;t I hate to use the thing, a chat GPT version of it. You you you you need a um a lighter version of that that can be gotten out that is, you know, more timely.</p>
<p>Uh, and it can still have all of the all of the older stories, but it needs to be sort of repackaged into the media expectations of today. Um, and uh, you know, but we have some great producers and cinematographers in the, you know, in the way of, frankly, you know, Spielberg and his many organizations that do this regularly. I mean, they&#x27;re a little bit more entertainment obviously. Um, but then you have Dan Ferrris. Incredible work.</p>
<p>uh James Fox uh and several others and I apologize. I&#x27;ve had been on your things and I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m just terrible at names. &gt;&gt; Me, too. &gt;&gt; Uh you know, I think we we we have people and it&#x27;s just you just need to have the drum beat. Um, and you know, if if anything, Dan&#x27;s movie caught the world by surprise and even Netflix.</p>
<p>So, you can bet because you you live in Hollywood, you you know what it&#x27;s like. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A win causes clones &gt;&gt; to happen. &gt;&gt; And so, &gt;&gt; you know, they they they know that it sells. C CBS knows it sells.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s why they&#x27;re called me up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I I can I can &gt;&gt; and I wish them well. I really do. I mean, I&#x27;m not disparaging them at all.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just I&#x27;m just saying uh that&#x27;s not the approach and the venue within which I want to talk about this kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m with you on that. Well, Dr. Nolan, thank you so much for joining us. How can folks at home follow your work and support the Soul Foundation? Um well you can go to the Soul Foundation website certainly uh and uh there are uh donations there.</p>
<p>Um I&#x27;ve personally donated quite a bit of money myself to my to the Soul Foundation. So people who say that I&#x27;m making money on this if they knew how much money I&#x27;ve spent on it uh you know they&#x27;d say otherwise. People think that I get money for speaking tours. I&#x27;ve never been paid a penny &gt;&gt; about this thing. Even for my own cancer research, I might get a $100 check from the graduate students at, you know, Harvard to pay for my meal and and they&#x27;ll pay for my flight.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s about it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Um, so certainly that uh you know, I mean, I&#x27;m just I&#x27;ll say it. If there&#x27;s anybody out there who is interested in supporting cancer research, you can donate to Stanford uh and my laboratory uh and we&#x27;ll put it to very good use around artificial intelligence. If you want to uh pro if you want to donate to Stanford for my uh UAP research, there is a fund set up and I&#x27;ve had about almost $1.2 million donated to my lab uh for the work that I&#x27;ve done for the UAP. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Amazing.</p>
<p>Um and Stanford&#x27;s quite, you know, open to it. Um, so you know, but the but donating for my cancer research means I have to write fewer grants so I can maybe spend more time on UAP. There you go. Hey, it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a win-win. I love that.</p>
<p>Well, uh, Gary, thank you so much for joining us and thank you for helping us kick off uh, our premiere episode on here in 2026. Thank you for doing all of the the work you do to really make this world a better place. And uh, &gt;&gt; and thank you, Matt. I mean, I really following you. I um I And again, thank you for &gt;&gt; uh sort of being uh &gt;&gt; the the canary in the coal mine, let&#x27;s call it that, for uh some of the efforts uh recently especially, but um I I think your dedication is momentous.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I appreciate that that that uh that uh you made my day. I really appreciate that. Uh that&#x27;s uh yeah, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m speechless. Well, Gary, thank you so much for joining us. Uh, have a great weekend and hopefully I&#x27;ll uh maybe making it up your to your neck of the woods here in a couple weeks and we can meet for lunch or or whatever.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Be great. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Awesome. Okay. Gary Nolan, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Um, yeah. What what a just a fantastic um he&#x27;s Gary much much like Avi is is a scientist that walks the walk and he he has this scientific curiosity that frankly a large portion of the scientific community just does not have. Uh he you know he looks for the outliers in data. He he he looks for the things that are not expected and that piqus his curiosity and that that in my opinion and I&#x27;m not a scientist like you said I wasn&#x27;t the best college student but we need more people like that that that are frankly brave they you know they have courage to stand up to their their academic colleagues who might laugh or or uh administrations at a at a university. That&#x27;s real courage.</p>
<p>Speaking your truth, not giving a damn what other people say about you. Uh that and I venture to guess that that has served Gary, Dr. Nolan very well in his life and that is probably why he has been so wildly successful that that fearlessness that that he has. And and I remember when we had Dr. Avi lobe he he made some comment that he he looks at science in in the same way that with the same level of curiosity as as he looked at life as as a young kid when you don&#x27;t have all of this baggage that um the media tries to put on you or uh other debunkers uh uh people that that are trying to really interfere with people&#x27;s efforts to to find the truth.</p>
<p>And really that at the end of the day, that&#x27;s what this is about. We&#x27;re not saying, at least I know I&#x27;m not saying that, you know, we know where this stuff is from or what it is or or or what it wants. um we&#x27;re walking into this and letting the the data lead us where it where you know where it leads us rather than walking into something with a a sort of predetermined um conclusion and I think Dr. Dr. Nolan really kind of touched on that, the difference between being a healthy skeptic versus being a being a debunker.</p>
<p>And you know, and I completely agree and support Dr. Nolan&#x27;s decision not to participate in this CBS show. Um, I know that there were other people that were approached by CBS with this thing. And actually, I I had heard that uh Mick and these debunkers were up to something with a major news network. It was probably around 6 to9 months ago, although at the time I didn&#x27;t have the didn&#x27;t have the details, but um, you know, but this this was going on.</p>
<p>And I think that when you have when you&#x27;re it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not a fair debate when you are debating with someone that is going to leave out evidence or misrepresent evidence uh all for the purpose seemingly to to come to a particular uh conclusion. uh sort of uh it just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like gaming gaming the system. And if I were to if I didn&#x27;t know anything about the UAP topic, I would certainly trust Dr. Gary Nolan over Mick West or some of these other uh folks uh because it&#x27;d be clear to me that that Dr. Nolan is all about the data.</p>
<p>He is not about an agenda or forcing a a conclusion without the scientific evidence to back it up. He&#x27;s all about the data and seeing where the going where the data leads rather than operating from an agenda which is I think where one of the where all of these u debunkers particularly uh MC uh MC West uh uh operates from which is why in my opinion you really can&#x27;t trust uh much of uh what what comes out of these folks. Um but I want to talk about something else here. Uh, and this is really pretty serious. The the UAP Disclosure Act, which was, I think, the third time around that that this was attempted to get pushed through or or or become federal law in the National Defense Authorization Act.</p>
<p>We know that once again it failed. This act which from a cost perspective was virtually minimal compared to some of the other programs that that legislation pays for but was absolutely minuscule. All this thing was about was transparency on the UAP issue with the American public to the extent that it did not harm national security. It talked used the phrase non-human intelligence I think like 20 20 uh 20some times and and one of the other important elements of it was it had this eminent domain clause that mandated defense contractors in possession of vehicles of non-human origin or biological materials of non-human origin to be returned back to the government. this got derailed.</p>
<p>Uh you had this legislation written by Senator uh Senator Schumer, Senator Mike Rounds, and Senator Kirstston Gillibrand. So, you have to ask yourself, how the hell did that happen? How the hell did this legislation by three of the most powerful United States senators not go through? Now, you&#x27;ve heard me speak on the on the program extensively, really for the life of this of the Good Trouble Show about the UAP gatekeepers, the 50-ish or so senior executive service level people spread throughout different nodes of government who protect the program, protect the the legacy program. These are the people that are paying for the disinformation and the debunking and the gorilla skeptics of the world and the Wall Street Journals of the world world. Uh these folks in conjunction with the intelligence community are in many ways the bad actors at least a a um a sort of a section of it. You know all all organizations are multifaceted.</p>
<p>you have uh uh factions so to speak, but these are the folks really from the inception of of the security infrastructure and creation of the legacy program that are gatekeeping this. But there is a there are gatekeepers that I have not spoken about on this program. And these gatekeepers are really in many ways probably the most important. And these gatekeepers are some of the congressional staffers. Uh Chris Sharp put out an article in the Liberation Times.</p>
<p>And actually this this was uh I had no idea that he had put this article out, but essentially it said that uh Senator Mitch McConnell&#x27;s office was the one that killed the National Defense Authorization Act for 2027. And in his article, he stated that uh that uh chief of staff Terry Carmarmac, Senator uh Senator Mitch McConnell&#x27;s chief of staff, Terry Carmarmac, was the guy that killed the UAP Disclosure Act. Uh I actually received this same bit of information from a source earlier yesterday. Uh and um and I&#x27;m going to read uh just a uh let&#x27;s see if I can find it here. But um this this is not how you operate a democracy when you have United States senators uh that are are being undercut by their own staffers.</p>
<p>You know, it really makes you wonder, well, who who&#x27;s really running things? Um, I&#x27;m going to read read this. Uh, sources identify Terry Carmarmac, McConnell&#x27;s chief of staff, as the staffer uh who pressed to have the UAP Disclosure Act stripped from the National Defense Authorization Act after Eric Berles had submitted it as an amendment. Uh the uh the source said uh that Mitch really wielded his lease like a cudgel. And the response was yes, it was true. It was Carmarmac.</p>
<p>Uh Carmarmac is not the only powerful staffer involved as agents of Senator McConn McConnell. Uh Senator uh Senator McConnell chairs the powerful Senate defense appropriation subcommittee. His staff director was also involved. So, here you have the chief of staff of Senator Mitch McConnell and the staff director uh killing this stuff. And I have to tell you, I&#x27;ve heard this from other sources as well that some, not all, some of these congressional staffers, they&#x27;re the ones that get harassed.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re the ones that are offered sweetheart uh deals uh working for lobbying firms or or whoever. Uh they&#x27;re the ones that the legacy programs approach and say, &quot;Hey, we need you to uh kind of tamp this thing down.&quot; So my question to the speaker speaker of the house Mike Johnson and the Senate majority leader who I&#x27;m blanking on uh his name for for a second. You know what what is going on in your house? What is going on on Capitol Hill? We would have this UAP Disclosure Act if Speaker Mike Johnson had done his damn job. We would have the UAP Disclosure Act if Mitch McConnell&#x27;s chief of staff and uh apparently a staff director, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m guessing from one of the committees had not blocked this legislation. Who elected these congressional staffers to make those kinds of decisions? Who elected these congressional staffers to go against the will of the American people? Who elected these congressional staffers to undercut the very people that they are working for? By that I mean Congress uh members of Congress or members of uh of the House and the Senate.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s frankly something that we all need to be asking about because if certain congressional staffers are tanking legislation that their bosses actually want, what else are they doing? What else are they blocking? And again, and I have relationships with uh with staffers and members of Congress. This is not a a uh an all or nothing thing. Just like just like anything, uh you&#x27;ve got good actors and bad actors. And and I would say the ones that I&#x27;ve interacted with fall into the good actor category. But this is this is something that we really need to be talking about.</p>
<p>We really need to be talking about why Speaker of the House Mike Johnson did not uh seems to be avoiding this topic and why the Senate majority leader who is no longer Mitch McConnell, why this guy, his chief of staff and uh and this staff director killed the legislation. I don&#x27;t know. I you know I&#x27;d never heard of these guys prior to this whole thing. But it&#x27;s gota it&#x27;s got to stop. As I&#x27;ve said time and time again, members of Congress, the people that we elect to represent us cannot do their jobs when they are not given the information.</p>
<p>when they are uh you know when they&#x27;re they&#x27;re when they go to the Pentagon or the intelligence community and a a door gets slammed in their face. You&#x27;ve heard that from Congresswoman Anna Pelina Luna and Eric Berles and and Tim Bett. the the literal literal backflips that the Pentagon and the intelligence community and the Department of Energy do to keep this from lawmakers, to keep this from the people that we sent to Washington to represent all of us. And then to find out that at least uh in Senator Chuck Schumer&#x27;s uh uh orbit, he&#x27;s got a chief of staff that is killing legislation that three of of the most powerful senators in the United States uh Senate are have put forth, have spent their own political capital on. And here you&#x27;ve got this staffer gatekeeping.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got Senator Mitch McConnell&#x27;s chief of staff gatekeeping. Terry Carmarmac. People should uh look up Terry Carmarmac. Uh these emails are very easy to find for staffers on Congress. You just need to do a little little digging, but uh these exist in in databases on uh on on the internet.</p>
<p>But people need to be reaching out to these to these congressional offices. Call Senator Mitch McConnell&#x27;s office and ask why in the hell Terry Carmarmac and whatever staff director went in and torpedoed this legislation. Dr. Nolan spoke about this earlier. is probably well over 75% of the public want to know what the hell is going on and also what is not going on.</p>
<p>But because the government continues to lie to all of you, all of us, we have no idea what&#x27;s going on. when you have uh former leadership of the Pentagon&#x27;s UFO office uh insulting members of Congress while while still on the taxpayers&#x27;s dime. And you&#x27;ve got another guy, former director of a Tim Phillips, going on podcasts seemingly spilling classified information. You know, you just you got to wonder what the hell is going on. And nothing is going to change if we all just lie down and take it.</p>
<p>If you want things to change, you got to make the phone calls. You&#x27;ve got to go to protests, make your voice heard, call, email. But you&#x27;ve got these gatekeepers out of the legacy program and the folks that are three layers down from uh let&#x27;s say the secretary of defense, the the deputy under secretaries and all of that who are doing the gatekeeping, the people that are there for life. But then you&#x27;ve also got these members, these uh certain congressional staffers who are it all up. And it&#x27;s unamerican.</p>
<p>We did not send these staffers in there to undermine their bosses, to undermine the people that we voted in, Republicans and Democrats. And trust me, this this corruption goes on both sides of the aisle. But we we can&#x27;t just sit back and let this happen again and again and again. Who who are these staffers that are blocking this stuff? Why is there not a an investigation? Why is there not a um why, you know, why why is there not a DOJ investigation into what is what are insider threats in Congress cuz that&#x27;s what it is. These are insider threats.</p>
<p>These are people who are doing damage to this democracy. Where is the Department of Justice? Why is there no attorney general investigation into which congressional staffers are compromised? Where is that? Where is an investigation from the Department of Justice, from the Attorney General into which congressional staffers uh are compromised, who which congressional staffers are taking backroom deals from defense contractors and backroom deals with the legacy program? Why is there no investigation into what is being promised? What carrots are being dangled to these congressional staffers to shut this down? Because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on. Money talks, walks. And unfortunately, there are some folks operating in Congress who are not doing it for love of of God and country. They&#x27;re doing it for themselves.</p>
<p>and whether they&#x27;re being bribed by the intelligence community or a defense contractor, uh, the legacy program or whoever when whatever non-government organization, the fact is you&#x27;ve got people in there that are compromised and they are affecting federal law. We can&#x27;t just let this lie. So when you hear about gatekeeping, gatekeepers, it&#x27;s not just in the intelligence community. It&#x27;s not just in the Department of War or Pentagon. It&#x27;s not just in the legacy program.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got gatekeeping going on right now in the offices of members of Congress by some of these staffers. It&#x27;s um it is no wonder that people do not trust the government. It is no wonder that people do not trust the mainstream media. I used to make fun of Trump and his deep state stuff cuz well I&#x27;m about to switch to independent. But you know what? Trump was right.</p>
<p>There is a deep state. This deep state is all over the damn place. And it it undermines things that they do not want to happen. It undermines presidents. I&#x27;m not a Trump fan, don&#x27;t get me wrong there.</p>
<p>But it it undermines presidents. It undermines legislation. It undermines you at home knowing the truth about things. And these are folks we didn&#x27;t elect. These are folks that we uh are operating in congressional offices that are gatekeeping the UAP issue.</p>
<p>You know, these these members of Congress, they got a lot on their plate. They rely extensively on their staffers and there are good staffers and there are staffers that are there for serving the country and doing the right thing. But then you&#x27;ve got this small subset that unfortunately is very powerful that is controlling everything. They are part of this this machine, this deep state machine or whatever you want to call if you don&#x27;t want to call it deep state uh I don&#x27;t know whatever you want to call it but it&#x27;s a machine a cancer that continues to grow and grow and grow on this republic. So we need the Senate majority leader to do his damn job.</p>
<p>We need Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to do his job and they need to hold investigations. Hold these staffers in that are dealing with uh chief of staffs and and national security staffers. Put them under polygraph. Find out who is compromised and get them the hell out if they are. You know, this this country is in a bad place.</p>
<p>And when you have congressional staffers gatekeeping and obfuscating and essentially lying to their bosses, it&#x27;s no wonder this whole thing is a  show right now in this country. It&#x27;s no wonder that Washington is dysfunctional. And again, that dysfunction exists on the left and the right. There is no doubt about that. But the DOJ needs to hold investigations on congressional staffers.</p>
<p>Who is compromised? Who is paid off? Who is being promised things? what congressional staffers are interfering with legislation and in particular legislation with on the uh on the UAP issue. Uh you know, we just this this can&#x27;t this can&#x27;t we can&#x27;t keep doing what we&#x27;re doing here. Um that is uh that is for sure. Um, I want to thank everybody for the super chats and um, yeah, I I hope uh, everyone had a really great really great holiday and I know I did got a chance to visit go out of town, visit visit family. Um, but you know, we&#x27;re in a new year.</p>
<p>This is 2026. Just because uh, we had the chief of staff of Senator Mitch McConnell tank uh, the UAP Disclosure Act does not mean we give up. you keep fighting for what&#x27;s right. They want these uh these gatekeepers and in Congress and the Legacy Program and the IC, they want all of you right now that are watching this show to pack up and move on. That is what they want.</p>
<p>And you can&#x27;t give it to them. Then they win. then we all fail. Then we lose what this country uh should be. And it is it is uh damn time that we get this country back on track and and get it uh back to uh the America that that this needs to be.</p>
<p>And all of that starts with rooting out this corruption. And there is no better demonstration of this cor corruption than in the legacy UAP program and the tentacles that it has everywhere. Uh there needs to be investigations. People need to be held accountable. There are some people that need to go to federal jail.</p>
<p>It it needs to happen because the longer we sit back and let all this keep, you know, growing this cancer on our on our country, on this republic, some point you reach a point where there&#x27;s just no return, no point of return. You have to hold people accountable. And once again, you cannot expect the members of Congress that we elect, they cannot do their job or make the right decisions for this country when you have congressional staffers cutting them off at the knee like Mitch McConnell&#x27;s chief of staff. It&#x27;s unfair. It&#x27;s unfair to their bosses.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s unfair to all of you watching. It&#x27;s unfair to every American and every uh person in the world that wants to know where their true place is in the universe. That decision is not Mitch McConnell&#x27;s chief of staff to make. It&#x27;s not. And frankly, uh Senator Mitch McConnell&#x27;s chief of staff should be goddamn embarrassed and ashamed for what he did.</p>
<p>But, you know, I&#x27;m sure this guy&#x27;s laughing all the way to the bank would be my my personal guess. But call Senator Mitch McConnell&#x27;s office, email his chief of staff and say, you know, what are you doing? What are you doing, man? This uh you know, as Americans, we deserve better. Anyway, folks, if you enjoyed this show, please tell all of your friends about us. Again, hit that like and subscribe. All of that stuff really helps us out.</p>
<p>And uh again, we are completely funded by people like yourself. We have rent to pay for this studio, uh various other expenses. So, uh we we really appreciate when people support us on on Patreon or on YouTube by becoming a sub a uh a member of uh of the show uh joining us in that way. and the super chats of course all of that really really helps us out. You know at the end of the day the reason I&#x27;m doing this it&#x27;s not about fame or making a bunch of money which we certainly aren&#x27;t doing that.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about getting to the truth of whatever the hell this is and holding people to account because I don&#x27;t know about you but I&#x27;m tired of being lied to. I&#x27;m tired of the government treating us all like a bunch of kids. We are Americans. We can handle difficult things. We We rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>But when you&#x27;ve got a a government that treats you treats all of us like a bunch of children, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not the country I want to live in. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s not a a democracy. That is not a government by the people and for the people. It is an abomination of democracy. with uh what is going on in particular with the with the UAP issue.</p>
<p>There is no good reason why they cannot tell us to some extent exactly what has been going on. But it&#x27;s not going to happen as long as we have these congressional staffers and other gatekeepers spread out through government chopping everything off at the knees. It&#x27;s not going to happen. Anyway, thanks again for joining us. Uh we will have another great show coming up this weekend.</p>
<p>And again, tell your friends about us, hit the like and subscribe, all that good stuff. And we certainly appreciate everyone&#x27;s support. And everyone have a great week. Uh we will see you next week on the good trouble</p>
