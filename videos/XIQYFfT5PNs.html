            <p>TONIGHT TO NEWLY-RELEASED  PIECES OF ALLEGED U.S.  MILITARY FOOTAGE ARE SPARKING  A LOT OF FRESH QUESTIONS ABOUT  UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT IN THE  SKY. SO THE VIDEOS WERE SAID  TO BE OBTAINED FROM MILITARY  ARCHIVES AND RELEASED TO THE  PUBLIC BY INVESTIGATIVE  JOURNALIST JEREMY CORBELL AND  GEORGE KNAPP. THEY SAY BOTH  RECORDINGS SHOW GOVERNMENT  FILMED OBJECTS THAT WERE  OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED AS PEAS,  UNIDENTIFIED ANOMALOUS  PHENOMENA AND THEY WEREN&#x27;T  MEANT TO BE SEEN BY THE  PUBLIC. NOW, BOTH VIDEOS  RECORDED BY END 2, 9, REAPER  DRONES AND BOATS SHOW MAKING  MOVEMENTS.</p>
<p>THAT CORBELL SAYS  THE 5 BASIC PHYSICS, THE FIRST  VIDEO DATES BACK TO AUGUST OF  2012. IT&#x27;S RECORDED OVER THE  PERSIAN GULF USING INFRARED  SENSORS. IT SHOWS 3 OBJECTS  MOVING AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE  A TRIANGULAR FORMATION. AT ONE  POINT, ONE OF THE OBJECTS  FALLS BACK AND IT&#x27;S SUDDENLY  ACCELERATES FORWARD AGAIN,  KIND OF LIKE SLINGSHOT MOTION  TO REJOIN THE OTHER 2 WEIRD.  THE SECOND VIDEO, MORE RECENT  2021 RECORDED DURING A U.S.</p>
<p> DRONE MISSION OVER SOUTHERN  SYRIAN. IN THIS FOOTAGE, YOU  HAVE A SINGLE OBJECT THAT&#x27;S  TRACKED BY A WEAPONS GRADE  TARGETING SYSTEM NOW MOVES  STEADILY AT FIRST. THEN  SUDDENLY CHANGES DIRECTION,  ACCELERATE OUT OF FRAME AND  WHAT ANALYSTS DESCRIBED AS  EXTREME SPEED. THERE&#x27;S NO  VISIBLE PROPULSION NEWS NATION  IS NOT INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED  THE AUTHENTICITY OF THESE  VIDEOS. THE PENTAGON HAS NOT  CONFIRMED THEM OR EVEN  COMMENTED.</p>
<p>BUT WHAT ARE WE  ACTUALLY SEEING IN THESE  VIDEOS, NIC POPE&#x27;S HERE  INVESTIGATING YOU A PIECE FOR  THE UK MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.  NICK, GOOD TO SEE. ARE THESE  THE REAL DEAL?  &gt;&gt; YES, I THINK SIR JEREMY AND  GEORGE, THE GENERAL CONCERNED,  HAVE A PROVEN TRACK OF GETTING  FAN. TAKE PENTAGON FOOTAGE  INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. YEAH,  THAT YEAR WHEN YOU SEE SORTS  OF THINGS JUST MOVE IN A  STRAIGHT LINE OF THE CONSTANTS  PAID SHAW.</p>
<p>YOU CAN SAY  BALLOONS BUT BUT AS YOU SAID  IN YOUR INTRO, THE PENTAGON  ITSELF PUT THIS INTO AP  CATEGORY, UNIDENTIFIED  ANOMALOUS PHENOMENA. AND  THAT&#x27;S WHAT WE&#x27;RE LOOKING AT.  &gt;&gt; OKAY, LET ME ASK YOU THE  MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION. IS  THIS A PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY,  ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY? I MEAN,  WE&#x27;RE TALKING ABOUT TALK ABOUT  2021.  &gt;&gt; OR  &gt;&gt; IS THIS SOMETHING ELSE? IS  THIS FROM? HOW DO YOU KNOW  EXTRATERRESTRIAL? AS MUCH AS  I&#x27;D LOVE TO BELIEVE THAT IT  WAS EXTRATERRESTRIAL.</p>
<p>YOU  KNOW, ALL COMES RAISES STATES  THAT THE SIMPLEST AND MOST  LIKELY EXPLANATION IS USUALLY  THE CORRECT ONE.  &gt;&gt; THESE MIDDLE EAST VIDEOS IN  ONE OF THE MOST CROWDED AREAS  OF SKY WHEN IT COMES TO  COUNTING A JARROD SPACE  TECHNOLOGY AND CROFT DRONES.  THE UNITED STATES HAS A LOT  THAT BECAUSE THE U.S. IS THAT  CHINA RUSH ARE PROBABLY SPYING  ON THEM. IRAN IS THAT TOO? SO  MY ESTIMATE HAS GOT TO BE THIS  IS OUR OWN REST.</p>
<p>REAL TECH.  &gt;&gt; WELL, I MEAN, THEY ARE  SENSITI MILITARY REGIONS  COULD BE OF INTEREST IF IT  WASN&#x27;T HUMAN-MADE. I MEAN, BUT  THAT&#x27;S THE QUESTION.  &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU SEEN TECHNOLOGY  LIKE THIS? THINK THEY COULD DO  SOMETHING LIKE THIS? NO  PROPULSIION.  &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, AND WE WE  CAN&#x27;T TELL THAT MUCH JUST BY  LOOKING AT THE VIDEOS  THEMSELVES, YOU KNOW, BEHIND  THE SCENES, THERE&#x27;S PROBABLY  MORE ANALYSIS THAT&#x27;S BEEN DONE  BY INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY  IMAGERY ANALYSTS, AND PROBABLY  CLASSIFIED.</p>
<p>I BUT YOU KNOW,  THE THINGS FLYING OUT TTHERE  AND THAT WILL NOT BE PUBLIC  KNOWLEDGE FOR 10, 15, 20 IS  OFF TO THE EVENT. SO SO  THERE&#x27;S A LOT  SPOOKY STUFF  FLYING RIGHT NOW. A GOOD THING  THOSE UPON, BUT I LIKE THAT.  BUT DILLON HAS YOUR QUESTION.  DO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS IT  WASN&#x27;T MEANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO  SAY IT WAS IT NOT MEANT FOR  THE PUBLIC TO SEE BECAUSE OF  THE SENSITIVE MILITARY  TECHNOLOGY MEAN JEREMY CORBELL  SAYS THE FOOTAGE CAME FROM  INTELLIGENCE ARCHIVES.</p>
<p>YOU  TELL ME IS THAT WHAT WE&#x27;RE  DEALING WITH THAT THEY WERE  CONCERNED THIS COULD  COMPROMISE US. WELL, I THINK  JEREMY IN GEORGIA ARE BOTH  VERY CALF WILL THAT THEY  FOLLOW THE LAW RUN. THIS HAS  ALL THE PEOPLE CONCERNED WHO  GAVE HIM THE VIDEOS. THAT  BEING SAID, I KNOW A LOT OF  PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY WHO SEE  THESE SORTS OF THINGS AND ARE  AWARE OF THEM. I&#x27;M VERY  FRUSTRATED AT WHAT THEY SEE AS  THE SLOW PACE.</p>
<p>ALL OF US FOE  YOU, AP DISCLOSURE, I&#x27;M SO YOU  KNOW, YOU, JEREMY AND GEORGE  OFTEN, KIND OF TONE TO IT FOR  GETTING THIS MATERIAL OUT. SO  IT&#x27;S HAVE A WIND, A DEBATE  ABOUT IT. LET&#x27;S GET CONGRESS  LOOKING AT IT. LET&#x27;S GET ALL  MEDIA AROUND. THAT&#x27;S LOOKING  AT IT.</p>
<p>LET&#x27;S LET&#x27;S GET A KIND  OF BRAINS TRUST BANKS, PETS.  &gt;&gt; TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT  WE CAN HIT.  &gt;&gt; NICK, YOUARE BRILLIANT. I  LOVE HAVING YOU ON, BUT I WILL  TELL YOU, STILL NOT. I STILL  THINK THAT THIS COULD BE  SOMETHING ELSE.</p>
<p>THAT&#x27;S JUST MY  TAK</p>
