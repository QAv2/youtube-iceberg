            <p>DLo meaning the bell in German is the name of an  alleged top secret Nazi technological device that   is among the most notable of ss General Hans  camer Ultra secret arsenal of Wonder Weapons   AKA vunder vafa ever since the conclusion of  the second world war an increasing number of   Revelations have surfaced regarding various  outlandish and even occult based scientific and   technological experiments being conducted by the </p>
<p>Nazis throughout the duration of the Third Reich   D glocki has been considered to be among the most  mysterious and intriguing of these Revelations as   the potential explanations surrounding the actual  purpose of the device range from anti-gravity to   interdimensional time travel the first known  mention of D glocki came by way of a Polish   Aerospace researcher and historian named eigor  witowski witowski claimed that he had become pris   to a collection of classified documents regarding </p>
<p>Digi in 1997 by way of an anonymous polish   intelligence official who reportedly had access to  Top Secret polish government documents addressing   the existence of Nazi secret weapons wowski also  claimed that he was permitted to transcribe the   classified documents but was forbidden from  making any copies Wow&#x27;s statements were never   independently verified but they did manage  to gain popularity once they were recounted   in a 2001 book by Nick cook entitled the hunt or </p>
<p>zero point the classified documents that wowski   reportedly viewed included transcripts from a  series of interrogations of former high-ranking   Nazi SS official yakob schornberg who was captured  by British forces and subsequently handed over to   the polls sparen buug was reportedly in charge  of a special SS evacuation unit related to the   testing site for doloi this testing site was  located close to the Wes loss mine near the   Czech border and was nickname deri the Giant </p>
<p>in sporbert to being personally responsible   for ordering the slaughter of 60 Nazi scientists  and researchers that worked on the top secret Bell   project evidently the Nazis considered the Bell  to be so important that they had already made   plans to eliminate any evidence of the Project&#x27;s  existence should the location of the experiment   be discovered D glocki is described as being  comprised of a dense heavy metal and having   a bell like shape the dimensions of the device </p>
<p>were roughly 9 ft wide by 12 to 15 ft in height   and it was encased in a ceramic cover according to  Cook&#x27;s writings the Bell housed a central Axis or   core around which rotated two cylindrical devices  that moved in opposite rotation one clockwise and   one counterclockwise during the experiments  these two cylinders were filled with a violet   colored substance that had properties similar to  Mercury this mysterious metallic liquid carried   the code name serum 525 various theories have </p>
<p>been offered as to what substance this serum   525 may have actually been some have speculated  that it was some type of radioactive isotope of   mercury the most common explanation was that it  was Mercury and tomate oxide otherwise known as   red mercury which allegedly has the capability  to produce fision explosions equivalent to the   power of 1,000 tons of TNT once the Bell was  activated by a high voltage current the liquid   inside would begin to Glow brightly and the </p>
<p>entire device would emit a strong and heavy   radiation that produced adverse effects even  leading to the death of several Nazi scientists   before their deaths the scientists reportedly  suffered from various ailments such as nerve   spasms loss of balance and a metallic taste  in the mouth dozens of plant and animal test   subjects were also killed by radiation exposure  during various experiments so what exactly was the   purpose of the Bell according to scharenberg&#x27;s own </p>
<p>testimony D glocki was associated with magnetic   fields separation and Vortex compression wowski  asserts that each of these physical principles had   become commonly associated with anti-gravity  research According to some physicists if you   have a device that can generate a torsion field  of extremely high intensity it is theoretically   possible to bend space around the device  consequently by bending space you also Bend   time time could it be possible that the Nazis </p>
<p>were utilizing the Bell to conduct scientific   experiments in time travel interestingly enough  it is important to note that the project was camed   Kronos which means time wowski also claimed that  an industrial complex located near the wus lost   mine became one of the primary testing sites for  Digi the ruins of a mysterious concrete framework   known as the henge stands there today and many  have speculated that the henge was designed to   be a type of suspension rig for use when testing </p>
<p>the propulsion capabilities of the Bell Skeptics   have dismissed this Theory claiming that the  henge is actually nothing more than the remains   of an industrial cooling tower the fate of daki  has been the subject of much speculation some   have claimed that once the Der test site was  evacuated near the end of the second World War   the Bell was not destroyed but rather was  transported to an undisclosed location wowski   asserts that daoki now resides in a Nazi friendly </p>
<p>South American country while cook postulates that   it was transported to the United States as  part of an agreement made with General Hans   commer the high-ranking SS official who supervised  several large Nazi construction and Engineering   projects incidentally General camer mysteriously  disappeared after after the war and to this day   his whereabouts are unknown one intriguing theory  about the fate of daki was put forth by American   Author Joseph P farel who claimed that the Bell </p>
<p>was recovered during the 1965 kbur UFO incident   during this incident a large Fireball was seen  streaking across the sky over six US states as   well as Ontario Canada thousands of witnesses  saw the mysterious Fireball and some reported   hearing a Sonic boom as well the strange phenomena  was first regarded as a meteor but then several   eyewitnesses in kbur Pennsylvania claimed that  some type of aircraft had crashed in the woods   the local fire department claimed that they </p>
<p>found an object that was shaped like an acorn   and roughly the size of a compact car several  witnesses claim to have seen inscriptions similar   to Egyptian hieroglyphics decorating the base of  the object according to several eyewitness reports   the US Army quickly secured the crash site ordered  civilians to leave and then carried the mysterious   object away on a flatbed truck strangely enough  military officials later reported that they found   absolutely nothing in the woods perhaps one of </p>
<p>the more spectacular theories that have surfaced   regarding Digi is that General Hans kler used the  Bell to escape being captured by Allied Forces   and then traveled through time to crash land in  kbur or he subsequently integrated into society   although conjectures and conspiracy theories  abound a common conclusion that can be drawn is   that the Nazis definitely had their hand in some  bizarre scientific experiments during World War   II whether they were able to make substantial </p>
<p>scientific or technological progress is for   the most part unknown but the Enigma of top secret  projects like d glocki remains with us to this day   with so many conspiracy theories out there it&#x27;s  hard to keep track of them all welcome to what   we know where we try to uncover the histories and  Mysteries of the World by presenting all different   theories out there and the only narrative we push  is this here&#x27;s what we know make up your own mind   if you enjoy this video and want to see more like </p>
