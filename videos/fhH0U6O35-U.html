            <p>hey everybody Dr G here I&#x27;m a licensed clinical psychologist and Body Language expert and today we&#x27;re going to be analyzing the Congressional hearing on UFOs or more precisely uaps you may have seen my previous video on the interview from news Nation with David grush today we&#x27;re going to be getting a much better Baseline we&#x27;re going to be watching a lot more footage of Mr grush as well as two other individuals providing testimony I do want to say before we get started normally I cover true crime videos so this is a couple of days late because it&#x27;s been a very busy week for True Crime hopefully you learned something from this video I&#x27;ll be really interested to get your feedback I&#x27;ve read all the comments from my last video and I&#x27;m going to incorporate explaining some things people had questions about over the course of this video last thing before we get started I do want to remind you to like And subscribe if you want to see more content just like this alright let&#x27;s go today we&#x27;re analyzing the testimony of three different individuals Lieutenant Ryan Graves former senior intelligence officer David grush and retired Commander David fraver so part of the goal of this video is to identify if there are any overt signs of lying and deception one thing to keep in mind is they are under oath this is no joke these individuals could be in serious trouble if they are in fact lying or being deceptive so I do take what we&#x27;re talking about today very very seriously let&#x27;s go ahead and listen to some of Lieutenant Graves testimony chairman grothman ranking member Garcia distinguished members of the House oversight subcommittee on National Security representative burchett and Luna my name is Ryan fob&#x27;s Graves and I&#x27;m a former F-18 pilot with a decade of service in the U.S Navy including two deployments in operation enduring freedom and operation inherent resolve so the first thing we&#x27;re going to notice as we develop a baseline for lieutenant Graves is that he is sitting with his hands open so his body is open oftentimes we associate when people leave their body open that they are being vulnerable because if the head and the chest are vital parts of the body if you get injured there you&#x27;re in trouble so when people sit with their bodies open we see that as a positive side towards truthfulness let&#x27;s keep going I have experience Advanced UAP firsthand and I&#x27;m here to voice the concerns of more than 30 commercial air crew and military veterans who have confided their similar encounters with me so another aspect of his Baseline that we need to pay a lot of attention to is the fact that he does not move much but do understand that when he moves it&#x27;s significant because he&#x27;s somebody that doesn&#x27;t move a lot which is very different than someone like David grush who moves a lot so as Lieutenant Graves continues to provide information we&#x27;re going to be looking for subtle body language we&#x27;re going to be looking for smaller movements that are probably going to mean more than they might from somebody else let&#x27;s keep watching today I would like to highlight three critical issues that demand our action as we convene here UAP are in our airspace but they are grossly under-reported these sightings are not rare or isolated they are routine military air crew and commercial pilots trained observers whose lives depend on accurate identification are frequently witnessing these phenomena now this is interesting he when he said frequently observing these phenomena I&#x27;m going to go back and show it to you again he raised his eyebrows there&#x27;s several things that eyebrow raises can mean one it can mean surprise because when we&#x27;re surprised we raise our eyebrows that is when that that emotion is connected to that facial expression another thing it can do is to draw attention to us so if he&#x27;s doing that it either means that he&#x27;s surprised by the information he&#x27;s providing or that it&#x27;s something he wants to emphasize greatly and that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s raising his eyebrows let&#x27;s watch him say that again observers whose lives depend on accurate identification are frequently witnessing these phenomena so the emphasis unfrequently makes me think that that is a sign of surprise and that means that he is surprised by the idea that people are frequently observing this during a training mission in morning area whiskey 72 10 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach two F-18 Super Hornets were split by UAP the object now that was once again a look of surprise watch this watch his eyebrows as he&#x27;s talking about what happened goes to Virginia Beach two F-18 Super Hornets were split by UAP the idea that super Hornets were swept by a UAP I think that&#x27;s what he said it was hard to understand but the idea that the super Hornets were cut off by a UAP or whatever happened that was surprising to him so it&#x27;s very interesting these are real natural reactions because the more involuntary a reaction is the more genuine it is that&#x27;s the whole point of reading body language we can also see when someone is overtly trying to manipulate we haven&#x27;t seen anything like that so far now let&#x27;s watch a little bit of Mr grush we&#x27;re going to be going back and forth between all three of them but now we&#x27;re going to introduce his testimony Mr chairman ranking members and congressmen thank you I&#x27;m happy to be here this is an important issue and I&#x27;m grateful for your time all right he&#x27;s already moved probably more than Lieutenant Graves did during his entire opening statements one thing I want you to notice about David grush and obviously I did analysis on him previously so as you can see his Baseline body language is a little bit different he&#x27;s got his hands crossed or his hands interlocked sometimes but when he talks he opens up his hands for emphasis once again while slightly different that&#x27;s similar in terms of we&#x27;re seeing that somebody is allowing himself to be vulnerable when he speaks with his hands open and he&#x27;s talking with two hands we see that as a genuine attempted emphasis one hand we tend to think is a little less committed but when David Rush talks this time he&#x27;s speaking with both hands very strongly let&#x27;s watch that again and then we&#x27;ll keep going Mr chairman ranking members and congressmen thank you I&#x27;m happy to be here this is an important issue and I&#x27;m grateful for your time my name is David Charles grush I was an intelligence officer for 14 years in the both in the U.S Air Force both active Okay so him opening his body repeatedly is something he&#x27;s doing consistently he&#x27;s going to do this fairly consistently throughout the hearing now you&#x27;ll notice his eyebrows is a little bit different his eyebrows are consistently raised now this doesn&#x27;t look of surprise I think this is a look of emphasis to draw attention to what he&#x27;s talking about he&#x27;s somebody that I think feels very strongly he moves his hands a lot he&#x27;s very emphatic he has a lot of inflection in his voice he doesn&#x27;t seem to be trying to hide any of how he feels Duty Air National Guard and Reserve at the rank of major and most recently from 2021 to 2025 or excuse me 2023 uh that was kind of funny so he said 2025 I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s actually a time traveler but I do think that we can make natural mistakes I do not think that that implies in any way that he&#x27;s being deceptive I think that&#x27;s a normal slip of the tongue so let&#x27;s watch it again regardless from 2021 to 2025 or excuse me 2023 at the National geospatial Intelligence Agency NGA at the gs-15 civilian level which is the military equivalent of a full bird colonel at the time due to my extensive executive level intelligence support duties I was cleared to literally all uh relevant compartments okay so when he says literally all and he really opens his body up that&#x27;s an emphasis that I think is likely true so he was really opened up to many things and that&#x27;s something that he wants people to know he wants to provide emphasis on that and as I&#x27;ve said before these are involuntary behaviors that didn&#x27;t look like an emphasis that he was trying to do that looked like it just sort of came out because of what he&#x27;s feeling right there and so when we&#x27;re looking for trustworthy body language that&#x27;s exactly what we look for and in a position of extreme trust both in my military and civilian capacities I want to first thank you for the invitation to speak to the committee on the UAP topic this has been in the news for the past six years and seems to be continuing to gain momentum so I&#x27;ve had somebody ask me about this hand position that he has he&#x27;s sort of holding his thumb I think that&#x27;s just a way that we manage anxiety when we&#x27;re in situations like that I&#x27;m not saying he&#x27;s necessarily strongly feeling anxiety I mean being a commander or retired Commander I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s been in some stressful situations as you know my name is David fraver I&#x27;m retired commander in the United States Navy in 2004 I was a commanding officer of Strike Fighter Squadron 41 the world famous Black Aces if you&#x27;re attached to carrier 11 station on board the USS Nimitz so you&#x27;re seeing his eyebrows go up and down it could just be because he he&#x27;s doing that when he looks up to speak to people it could also just be that He is wanting people to pay attention to what he&#x27;s saying because he knows it&#x27;s important so I don&#x27;t think of those on him as looking like he&#x27;s surprised when he&#x27;s talking about these things at least not in this context and because surprise and emphasis can look so similar it can be difficult to tell them apart but sometimes given the involuntary nature of it we can point out things that do genuinely look more like surprise and emphasis let&#x27;s keep going it&#x27;s going to be gone a two-month work up cycle off the coast of California on this day we were scheduled for a 2v2 aired air training with the USS Princeton as our control as we proceeded to the West the air controller was counting down the range to an object that we&#x27;re going to and we&#x27;re unaware of what we were going to see when we arrived so I talk about head nods and head shakes sometimes which I know drives people a little bit nuts but he emphasizes the right parts when he was shaking his head no we listened to this part again well it was counting down the range to an object that we were going to and we were unaware of what we were going to see when we arrived so they were I believe that they were genuinely unaware of what they were going to see when they arrived I think he was emphasizing that in a way that seemed very natural there okay but talking about this appears to cause him a little bit of stress you see that that grab of the chin I don&#x27;t want to over emphasize too many things but it is important that everything has some kind of meaning and talking about this in a public setting in front of Congress and the world as everyone is watching is bound to be stressful so as we see a pacifying behavior like that I don&#x27;t think of that as meaning lying or deception particularly given this context to me that just says this is something that&#x27;s very important to him or this is something that has a lot of significance let&#x27;s watch that again what we&#x27;re going to see when we arrived their uh the controller told us that these objects had been observed for over two weeks coming down from over 80 000 feet rapidly descending to 20 000 feet hanging out for hours and then going straight back up for those who don&#x27;t realize above 80 000 feet is space we arrived at the location at approximately twenty thousand feet you see the the him touching his neck like that or reaching for it very briefly once again that&#x27;s a way to feel calm when we&#x27;re talking about something if you&#x27;ve been through something like this and you remember it and you&#x27;re thinking back on it and at the time your heart was pounding because it was something that was wild it&#x27;s not surprising that he would actually reach back to touch his neck when talking about something like this he&#x27;s not doing it consistently he&#x27;s probably trying to reduce the adrenaline load that&#x27;s happening as he&#x27;s talking about this even if he remembers some of it so that&#x27;s interesting being a controller called merge plot which means that our radar blip is now in the same resolution cell as the contact we proceeded around the circle about 90 degrees from the start of our descent and the object object suddenly shifted its longitudinal axis now see it&#x27;s interesting because this story is so visceral to him that he actually moves his hand while he&#x27;s talking about it as I said emotions are connected to our bodies when we think or feel something sometimes we act it out and it was interesting that as he talked about that he emphasized it with his hand watch him talk about this again of our descent and object suddenly shifted its longitudinal axis aligned it with my aircraft and began to climb so that is so connected to emotion that he had to move his hand when talking about it and that&#x27;s interesting because he does have a prepared statement he doesn&#x27;t have to give any color to what&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing but there is so much feeling tied to it he automatically does I think that&#x27;s really interesting we continue down another 270 degrees nose low that we&#x27;re detecting these objects off the Eastern Seaboard they were further correlating that information with the other onboard sensors now that was our personal first firsthand experience at the time since then as I&#x27;ve engaged this topic uh others have reached out to me they share their experiences both now he sat back he moved his hands which is unusual for him because his Baseline tends to be so still that&#x27;s a point that he really wants to emphasize what had happened before and what we&#x27;re doing since watch this these objects now that was our personal first firsthand experience at the time since then as I&#x27;ve engaged this topic others have reached out to me that share their experiences both on the military side as well as the commercial Aviation side so he finds this to be an incredibly important point in his testimony because I believe that&#x27;s genuinely the first time we&#x27;ve really seen him move so far and so whenever there&#x27;s that much energy that needs to be a point that&#x27;s emphasized that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s very important to him actually then accelerate to supersonic speeds 1.1 1.2 Mach and they would do so in very erratic and quick behaviors that we don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an explanation for okay and so you saw him close his eyes when he said that I don&#x27;t have an explanation for it that is distressing to him oftentimes we close our eyes when we think or hear things that we don&#x27;t like so the idea that he can&#x27;t explain something that something could go that fast and he&#x27;s not able to explain why that is is distressing to him understandably given what he does but watch this part again so we then accelerate to supersonic speeds 1.1 1.2 Mach and they would do so in very erratic and quick behaviors that we don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an explanation for on these lines yeah uh I have to be careful what I say in detail because there is an open uh whistleblower reprisal investigation on my behalf and I don&#x27;t want to compromise that investigation by providing anything that may uh what we&#x27;re seeing now is an actual sign of fear let me go back and show you this he&#x27;s talking about there being the open investigation on the reprisal and all of that it sounds like he&#x27;s saying that there have been consequences for him coming forward watch the corners of his mouth right before this they&#x27;re going to go down like this because when you think about fear people&#x27;s eyebrows raise up their mouth goes back that is a look of fear so just watch this and I don&#x27;t want to compromise that investigation by providing anything that may uh help provide somebody information but it was very brutal and I didn&#x27;t really make anything of that brief laugh that&#x27;s just some a pretty normal way to communicate I&#x27;m not making too much of that and uh very unfortunate some of the tactics they used to hurt me both professionally and and personally to be quite Frank yeah and for me it was it was special because I recognized the voices on the video I recognized the video itself I had seen it when it was taken I seen it when it was debriefed um and so that was kind of shook me because I realized that this problem was So for anybody who&#x27;s concerned that he might be making up a story around this once again he&#x27;s not somebody that moves a lot his Baseline is very still so when he talks about that it shook him and he opens his body up particularly when he&#x27;s talking about something a real emotion of feeling uncomfortable and he&#x27;s opening his body up which is a vulnerable act that&#x27;s really something that you can trust so I genuinely do believe that when he saw and I think he&#x27;s referring to when there was something in the New York Times a few years ago about uaps did that really genuinely had an effect on him watch him do this again um and so that was kind of shook me because I realized that this problem was still ongoing and so I reached out to colleagues back on the East Coast dark gray or black cubes inside of a clear sphere I&#x27;m sorry dark gray or black cubes yes inside of a clear sphere where the Apex or tips of the cube were touching the inside of that sphere and now I want to show this also and I hate to keep going back to the fact that he&#x27;s moving his hands or he&#x27;s opening his body because I don&#x27;t want it to feel too repetitive but I think this is important because this is a more Sensational description right it&#x27;s he&#x27;s talking about cubes inside of a sphere and that&#x27;s a little bit stranger but that&#x27;s when he&#x27;s allowing himself to open up so once again those are the areas where I&#x27;m really looking for signs of deception where I&#x27;m looking for times that he would be trying to close his body trying to pacify himself that he&#x27;s feeling uncomfortable if he&#x27;s telling something that&#x27;s not true but he very much seems to believe exactly what he&#x27;s saying and that was primarily what was being reported when we were able to gain a visual tally of these objects that occurred over almost eight years and as far as I know it&#x27;s still occurring colleagues of mind that if you know privately messaged me and and I do appreciate that uh but I I do have knowledge of um active planned reprisal activity against myself and other colleagues and it&#x27;s very very upsetting to me now once again I talked a lot about head shakes and head nods as you can see he was nodding his head as he was talking about this and when he did this to me once again that was emphasis that was different than what I observed last time just to be clear and reprisal activity against myself and other colleagues and it&#x27;s very very upsetting to me coming from where there were certain colleagues of mine that were brutally administratively attacked and it you know actually makes me very upset as a leader to see that happen to other co-workers and actually so when he said that actually makes me feel very upset like I talked about when people touch their neck of their face that helps them calm down that sign shows that he really is genuinely feeling upset about it he&#x27;s not actually going through with touching himself to feel to feel pacified but it&#x27;s a genuine reaction superiors of mine over the last three years do you have knowledge or do you have reason to believe that there are programs in the advanced Tech space that are unsanctioned uh yes I do okay that&#x27;s a pretty strong statement so you know I take all of this very seriously with what he&#x27;s saying I think the weight of this Congressional hearing is very different than his news Nation interview he&#x27;s making some very strong accusations at this point let&#x27;s keep going yeah and and when you say that they&#x27;re above congressional oversight what do you mean Congressional reporting however the gang of Aid is at least supposed to be notified if a you know waived or wave bigoted I&#x27;d acknowledged sap is created and that&#x27;s Public Law well so that how does I mean I don&#x27;t want to cut you off but once again you&#x27;ll see his mouth does this afterward this is something that he feels fear about as he&#x27;s talking about it watch this however the gang of eight is at least supposed to be notified if a you know waived or wave bigoted I&#x27;d acknowledged sap is created and that&#x27;s Public Law well so that how does I mean I don&#x27;t want to cut you off but how does a program like that get funded I will give you generalities I can get very specific in a closed session uh but a misappropriation of funds and once again there&#x27;s that fear and understandably he&#x27;s talking about some very heavy very significant things particularly if he said he has paid a personal and professional price for this so this is very interesting to see his body language in this setting I&#x27;ve seen multiple cases some of which to my understanding and of course I left NG in April so that&#x27;s my information cut off date uh but I personally now this is also a sign that we see related to honesty he&#x27;s putting his hands up and we see this if somebody&#x27;s been accused of doing something and they say I didn&#x27;t do it we associate that with being more likely to be true obviously nobody language is universal the idea is that we&#x27;re observing body language that is unconscious so if somebody was to ask him this question and he was behaving in a way intentionally and putting his hands up that&#x27;s very different than an immediate reaction and what he appears to be doing is an immediate and involuntary reaction and of course I left NG in April so that&#x27;s my information cut off date but I personally um reviewed both uh what we call Overhead collection and from others it also to The Whistleblower protection act in the ndaa there are multiple Witnesses coming forward to say so as you can see he reached back and is holding on to his thumb again you know and this could just be for Comfort which is fine it says no I&#x27;m not saying this in a critical way but I think that as he&#x27;s talking about The Whistleblower act when he&#x27;s talking about the repercussions for talking and discussing these things I think that&#x27;s a point of anxiety as it would be for anybody in this situation I don&#x27;t see the way he&#x27;s doing that as he&#x27;s uncomfortable because he&#x27;s being deceptive I think he&#x27;s uncomfortable because he&#x27;s talking about the repercussions of doing this basically hey uh that have firsthand knowledge and and Mr grush just covered that what concerns me is that there&#x27;s no oversight from our elected officials on anything associated with our government processing or working on Craft and so basically calling out of the government officials and saying that there&#x27;s no oversight talking about this publicly has got to be anxiety provoking so I I attribute his the way he&#x27;s doing his hands right now to that very thing okay you&#x27;ve said that the government is in possession of potentially non-human spacecraft based on your experience and extensive conversations with experts do you believe our government has made contact with intelligent extraterrestrials something I can&#x27;t discuss in public setting so as we see the lit person I&#x27;ve talked before about how that stress or how it means not wanting to say something doesn&#x27;t imply deception in this situation necessarily but he is not going to say anything right now and he&#x27;s showing you that um okay and I can&#x27;t ask when you think this occurs if you believe we have crashed craft uh stated earlier do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft as I&#x27;ve stated publicly already in my news Nation interview biologics came with some of these recoveries yeah so that was interesting that&#x27;s contrasted with the way that I had talked about it last time when we saw the news Nation interview I didn&#x27;t think that his body language was naturally connected to what he was saying demonstrating truthfulness this time it very much was it&#x27;s very interesting to contrast the way he was last time versus this time were they I guess human or non-human biologics non-human and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program and was this documentary references video photos eyewitness like how would that be determined the specific documentation I would have to talk to you in a skiff about gotcha so I could go through and analyze the entire Congressional hearing and if there really is interest out there I can do that but based on what we&#x27;ve seen the body language is very consistent in the other areas because I have watched this entire thing there&#x27;s no overt signs of lying and deception this is an analysis of the Body Language by the way if you think that they are being truthful or not truthful based on the content of what is being said that&#x27;s really not what I&#x27;m analyzing I&#x27;m not analyzing whether or not I think that what they&#x27;re saying is possible or true or any of those things I&#x27;m trying to analyze if their body language suggests truthfulness and based on this testimony all three of them are demonstrating truthful Body Language they showed anxiety and stress at times but not anxiety and stress that was consistent with manipulation and deceit or lying so my conclusions that they weren&#x27;t showing any signs of lying and deception may surprise you because after the news Nation interview I wasn&#x27;t convinced now I&#x27;m not saying one way or the other whether I&#x27;m convinced about what they&#x27;re talking about but I would say that their body language showed no signs of lying and deception if you guys want me to analyze more or if there&#x27;s other people you want me to analyze I&#x27;m happy to do so please let me know in the comments below what you think and if there are other people that you&#x27;d like me to analyze or if you want me to analyze more of this so I and I do want to remind you it&#x27;s possible that they are not telling the truth and not showing it or it&#x27;s possible that they believe what they&#x27;re saying and they&#x27;re mistaken there&#x27;s a lot of different possibilities for what&#x27;s happening but I will say that we didn&#x27;t see any overt signs of lying deception or manipulation and their body language today during this hearing I hope you&#x27;ve enjoyed this video
