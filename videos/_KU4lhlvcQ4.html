            <p>[Music] Why are electrogravitics anti-gravity claims so controversial? Imagine a device that could make objects flow or even fly without engines or fuel. Sounds like science fiction, right? Well, some inventors have claimed that certain electrical setups can do just that. But why do these ideas spark so much debate? Let&#x27;s find out. Electrogravitics is a term used for a concept where applying high voltage to special asymmetric capacitors supposedly creates a force that lifts objects as if gravity itself is being manipulated. The idea gained attention in the early 1900s when Thomas Townsend Brown experimented with devices called asymmetrical capacitors.</p>
<p>He believed that high voltage could produce a force that defied gravity. But here&#x27;s the catch. Most scientists say what Brown observed is just an ionic wind. That means charged particles in the air move and push against air molecules, creating a small lift. It&#x27;s a well understood electrical effect, not a new force that can cancel gravity.</p>
<p>The controversy deepens because experiments trying to prove anti-gravity effects in vacuum chambers have failed. When there is no air, these devices do not produce any lift. If the lift was truly anti-gravity, it should work in a vacuum, but it does not. This suggests the observed effects are just ionized air particles pushing against the device, not a new gravitational force. Another issue is that mainstream physics does not support the idea that electric fields can directly influence gravity.</p>
<p>Gravity is an extremely weak force compared to electromagnetism. There is no verified scientific mechanism that links high voltage electric fields to gravity shielding or propulsion. Many claims of anti-gravity devices come from inventors who say they have found a way to control gravity with electricity. But these claims often lack independent tests or are based on measurements that could be mistaken. Some of these inventions are linked to secret government projects or conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>People talk about advanced crafts using electrokinetic or electrogravitic propulsion, but there is no solid proof these technologies exist outside of speculation. Devices like ionocraftrafts or lifters can lift small objects in the air, but they do so by pushing against air molecules, not by reversing gravity. In fact, these devices are called asymmetric capacitors or ACTs. They can produce thrust in the air without moving parts or fuel, but it&#x27;s all due to ion wind. They do not violate gravity or make objects float in space.</p>
<p>They are just pushing air molecules downward, which makes the device go up. So, the reason why claims about electrogravitics are so controversial is because the effects can be explained by known electrical phenomena. They do not work in a vacuum and they do not align with current scientific understanding of gravity. Still, the idea of controlling gravity with electricity continues to fascinate many, fueling experiments and stories about future space travel. It&#x27;s a curious mix of science, speculation, and imagination that keeps the debate alive.</p>
