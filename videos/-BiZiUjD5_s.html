            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p> THOMAS: If we were to come in  and dig again, would we get any response? Where you dig makes a difference. -(rattling) -(engine stops) It&#x27;s got a dead battery.</p>
<p>ERIK: What the actual hell is this? -You got to get those people out of there. -Okay. BRYANT:</p>
<p>There was a spike at 3400. Everybody out of here, now. Erik, are you doing something at 1.6? I&#x27;m not broadcasting. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a communication signal or something. This is out of the carriage house.  BRYANT:</p>
<p> What the hell is that? You captured a UAP on camera.  NARRATOR:  There is a ranch  in Northern Utah.  It is considered the epicenter  of the strangest and most</p>
<p> disturbing phenomena on Earth:  animal mutilations,  bizarre UFO sightings  and unusual energies that have  proven harmful to humans.  For 20 years,  the federal government  tried to find answers  and failed.</p>
<p> Now a new team  of dedicated scientists,  researchers and experts  has taken over.  They are determined to solve  the mystery and reveal...</p>
<p>...The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch. How&#x27;s it going, Chris? -Hey, Kaleb. How&#x27;s it going? -Good, good.</p>
<p> TRAVIS: To help us  with our ongoing investigation  of Skinwalker Ranch, we&#x27;ve been trying to engage as many people as possible who took part in the previous operations over the last two decades. What&#x27;s it like coming back? It&#x27;s pretty surreal, actually,</p>
<p>you know. It&#x27;s kind of like being back home a little bit, you know.  TRAVIS: Chris Bartel</p>
<p> is a former military officer  who was contracted  by Robert Bigelow  and the Defense  Intelligence Agency  when they were  investigating Skinwalker Ranch  several years ago. We used to have trouble</p>
<p>getting guys like him to share anything about what they&#x27;ve seen out here. Well, it&#x27;s an &quot;it&quot; that&#x27;s in control. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>But after last week&#x27;s visit by another former Bigelow employee,  Colonel John Alexander,  and the federal government&#x27;s  report last year  acknowledging  the existence of UAPs,  it&#x27;s like the floodgates  have finally opened up.</p>
<p>I know, a couple years ago, I was worried about, you know, maybe possibly losing a clearance talking about some of the experiences I had here on the property. Losing a clearance as far as? -Like a security clearance?</p>
<p>-Right, it was a concern &#x27;cause, you know, I&#x27;m still active in the federal department, I&#x27;m still operating and, uh, now it&#x27;s more of a mainstream topic, it seems like.  I was  a BAASS Security Investigator  for Bigelow Aerospace</p>
<p> for Skinwalker Ranch  from the years 2010 to 2016.  BAASS stands for  Bigelow Aerospace  Advanced Space Studies.  It was the organization  to study UFO phenomena.</p>
<p>This is also during the time of the federal contract, AAWSAP.  AAWSAP stands for  Advanced Aerospace  Weapon Systems  Applications Program.</p>
<p> I was one of  the lead members out here. I spent lots of time exploring, documenting data and also safekeeping and protecting the property.</p>
<p>I have a lot of experiences out here. You know, I lived and breathed this property for six years. I would love to show you guys some of the things</p>
<p>that I went through and important aspects of the property. THOMAS: Well, I&#x27;m eager to do that. I think we throw you</p>
<p>in the UTV right here, and let&#x27;s start across, because I-I want to hear -everything that happened. -That sounds, that sounds good. -Okay. -I appreciate it.</p>
<p> THOMAS:  We have this 20-year gap  where Mr. Bigelow  owned the ranch  for which we know very little. I think somebody</p>
<p>that spent six years here, and spent a lot of time during that six years, is critical and could be crucial to helping us solve some of the mysteries that are here on the ranch.  CHRIS:</p>
<p> Yeah. Right here. This is the spot. Let&#x27;s park here, then. I find it interesting</p>
<p>that you, uh, stop us here. This is by a place we call the triangle. Been a place we&#x27;ve done a lot of experiments and research and had a lot of</p>
<p>interesting data. So, I&#x27;m curious, tell me about what you experienced here. So, October of 2010, we had a pretty good routine where one guy would do</p>
<p>a normal run through the property to get kind of eyes on what&#x27;s going on. That day, the other officer came back, and he was like, &quot;Hey, I found some big prints on top of the mesa.&quot; And I&#x27;m like, &quot;Okay,</p>
<p>let&#x27;s go take a look at them.&quot; We get to the top of here, and we find these gi-- these pretty good-sized canine prints. I have photos of those, if you&#x27;d like to see them.</p>
<p>-Yeah, I&#x27;d love to see those. -CHRIS: Sure. Here. Take a look at this. You can see here...</p>
<p>Look at those, look how deep those go down. -KALEB: Look at that. -THOMAS: Oh, my gosh.  So, that&#x27;s about three feet</p>
<p> between step?  CHRIS:  Mm-hmm.  And then, we had  a couple labs with us.  You can see here in the top</p>
<p> corner, the labs&#x27; prints.  KALEB:  That thing&#x27;s like four times  the size of those. That&#x27;s a very big canine.</p>
<p> KALEB:  Seeing this picture, you could tell by both the size and the stride that we&#x27;re talking about a very large animal.  It makes me think about</p>
<p> the legend of the skinwalker. The legend of the skinwalker is  that it&#x27;s an entity  that can shape-shift.  Often, the lore is having it  go from a wolf to a man.</p>
<p> For whatever reason,  this piece of ground was cursed with the skinwalker. I was here, the other officer was right there, and the dogs were kind of in between us.</p>
<p>And the other officer says, &quot;Chris, stop. I hear something.&quot; And I&#x27;ll-I&#x27;ll never forget this, because it has been replaying in my mind forever since this day.</p>
<p>Out of that ditch, I hear a God-awful, guttural, howl growl. And I was, like, frozen for a second. So was the other officer</p>
<p>and the dogs were all alerting. The animal jumps out of the ravine over the berm and travels west. This thing was probably the size of a donkey, black.</p>
<p>Instinctively, the dogs chase after it. I run after the dogs. We get around that corner there. It&#x27;s-it&#x27;s gone.</p>
<p>THOMAS: Wow.  I can understand why  Chris was hesitant to share  some of these stories.  If I had heard this</p>
<p> on day one of the ranch,  I would have dismissed Chris. But after spending five years here on the ranch, uh... I-I find myself believing his story.</p>
<p>Did you come back and look for tracks the next day, I imagine? CHRIS: The next day we came back. We followed the ditch. We really didn&#x27;t find</p>
<p>any tracks. But there was an area I found on this mesa slope, and it led to this open cavity. Uh, it looked like a cave. So, I jumped down into it.</p>
<p>I look around, and it&#x27;s a, uh, a decent-size open cavity, but inside the cavern, I pulled out  two old canine traps. So, anytime somebody says the word &quot;cave&quot; or &quot;cavern&quot; here, -it catches our attention. -Right.</p>
<p>-You think it&#x27;s still there? -Yeah. -You mind taking us there to it? -Absolutely, let&#x27;s go. All right.</p>
<p> TRAVIS: I find it interesting  that this DJ said they were picking up some kind of weird signal. Yeah, that&#x27;s the part that got my attention.</p>
<p>You know, normally when you think about a radio station, you think of them broadcasting but not receiving anything, so I&#x27;m surprised that they&#x27;re vigilant to any incoming signals. Well, I can&#x27;t wait to hear</p>
<p>what they say.  Ranch caretakers  Tom Lewis and Kandus Linde  let me and Erik know that  a local radio station nearby  reached out to them about  a really strange frequency  interference  that&#x27;s been jamming</p>
<p> their system and it sounds just like what we experienced last week on Skinwalker Ranch. Hey! hey, hey, hey, hey, it&#x27;s here. We&#x27;ve got that 1.6 thing.</p>
<p> During a lot of  the experiments we&#x27;ve done  to stimulate different  phenomena, including UAPs,  Erik has detected a huge  radio frequency energy spike  of 1.6 gigahertz  on the spectrum analyzer.</p>
<p> And last week, we detected it  after launching a rocket  out by Homestead Two. -(radio static) -1.60000. But this time a mysterious sound</p>
<p>came through with it. -You want to try and listen to it? -ERIK: Yeah. (radio static, faint squealing) I swear that sounds</p>
<p>like a communication signal. So, here we are.  So, when we heard that  a potentially similar signal  was occurring  at a radio station  ten miles away in Roosevelt,  we definitely wanted to meet</p>
<p> with the station manager  and DJ, Jenn Rook. -Hi! -Hey, I&#x27;m Travis. -Hi, I&#x27;m Jenn. -Nice to meet you, Jenn.</p>
<p>You, too.  We wanted to see  if it could be related to the strange communication signal we&#x27;ve detected on Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
<p>So, we hear you&#x27;ve been having some weird signals or interference with your radio station. Some interference for sure and just some other weird anomalies that happen.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re talking about interferences, is it keeping you from being able to operate at certain times, or...? -I livestream online, and it keeps it from operating. -TRAVIS: Really? Like, the online stream was</p>
<p>just absolute fuzz. It was just cutting out everything. It was just such an interruption.</p>
<p>-You couldn&#x27;t hear the radio station online. -Wow. So, if I was listening to your station, and I hear, uh,</p>
<p>some kind of a problem, -JENN: Mm-hmm. -I would expect to hear what? Static? Strange tones? Signals that don&#x27;t belong in your signal stream? What would I hear? Uh, I mean, you could probably hear any of that. -Wow.</p>
<p>-You know, we&#x27;ve heard some weird stuff, and we see weird signals at the ranch that we can&#x27;t figure out where they&#x27;re coming from, and we&#x27;ve found this one that seems to be repeating around here all the time,</p>
<p>near 1.6 gigahertz. Travis, can you bring that up and play it? Yeah. I believe it&#x27;s this one right here.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. (static, squealing) You know, I&#x27;ve heard something similar to this along with all of the fuzz that I get that I know is interference. -Really?</p>
<p>-JENN: Yeah. There&#x27;s something not right, and I&#x27;ve had people look at it and try to fix it, -but it&#x27;s a signal that is not supposed to be there. -Wow.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  After we verified  that Jenn believed that the 1.6 gigahertz communication signal from the ranch was very similar to the one that&#x27;s been coming through the radio station, it made both</p>
<p>Erik and I think that maybe we could use it to try to communicate back to whoever sent it in the first place. Uh, we couldn&#x27;t, by any chance, talk you into maybe broadcasting this strange signal</p>
<p>that we&#x27;ve picked up? -Uh... -And see if we&#x27;ll detect something with our instruments when you do. Are we poking a bear here,</p>
<p>or...? -(laughs) -Well-well, the expression that I use is one my grandmother taught me and it&#x27;s &quot;poking the hornets&#x27; nest.&quot; -And-and so... -Okay, let&#x27;s do it.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s poke that hornets&#x27; nest. Let&#x27;s see if any hornets fly out, right? All right, let&#x27;s do it. So, we have some equipment outside, in the car, we&#x27;ll run out,give us</p>
<p>we&#x27;ll get it set up, -and running. -Okay. Yeah, let&#x27;s do it. So we&#x27;ll got set up the equipment.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll be right back and tell you when we&#x27;re ready. -All right, sounds good. -All right. Thank you.</p>
<p> After Jenn Rook, the station manager at Jack FM,  told us that the 1.6 gigahertz  communication signal  that we&#x27;ve detected  on Skinwalker Ranch sounded similar to what&#x27;s been interfering with her station&#x27;s broadcasts, we convinced her to let us run an experiment.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to go ahead and start the Jeep -and tune in to the radio station. -Perfect.  TARVIS: The idea was to play</p>
<p> the 1.6 gigahertz signal  over her airwaves... All right. I got the radio station up.  ...while Erik and I set up  an antenna  with our spectrum analyzer</p>
<p> in the parking lot  so we could monitor  the broadcast  for anything strange  that might happen in response. All right, I think that&#x27;s good right there.</p>
<p>All right.  I&#x27;m interested in  watching the RF spectrum  through our spectrum analyzer. I got really high hopes that we&#x27;re going to see something unusual.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m-a go in and tell her we&#x27;re ready. All right. Hey, Jenn. Yeah,</p>
<p>we&#x27;ve got our equipment set up in the parking lot, so whenever you&#x27;re okay to broadcast the signal, we&#x27;re watching. -All right. Ready.</p>
<p>-All right. Cool. Thanks. All right, Erik. She&#x27;s about to broadcast it.</p>
<p>-All right.  -JENN: Hey there, everybody. Just a little interruption in the music right now. We&#x27;re doing a few tests</p>
<p>here at the studios, and, uh, you know what? I&#x27;m going to play something here. And if you&#x27;ve heard this, you can always give me a call here at the studios  (over radio):  and let me know.</p>
<p>This is just a test, everybody. (static, crackling) (frequency crackling) ♪ ♪ There it is. Wow. It really changed the waveform big time.</p>
<p>Look at how the waveforms are reacting to it there. You see that? Watch right here.  When a FM radio station</p>
<p> broadcasts music or anything  over the airwaves,  the frequency always has  a constant  and uniform pattern.  You shouldn&#x27;t see  any deviation in it  no matter what the sound is.</p>
<p> But as soon as Jenn  started broadcasting the sound  from our 1.6 gigahertz signal,  the station&#x27;s frequency  began showing strange,  sporadic spikes. Now, that shouldn&#x27;t be possible. So, it really made us wonder if our experiment</p>
<p>might stimulate something strange out here in the Basin community. And, if so, would it be anything like the phenomena we&#x27;ve seen on Skinwalker Ranch? This has just been a test,</p>
<p>everybody. Thanks for listening. I&#x27;ll put you back to the music now. I&#x27;m Jenn Rook.</p>
<p>All right, well, I say we go tell her what we saw. Yeah. Let&#x27;s go follow up. I wonder what the locals thought</p>
<p>that was listening to -the radio station. -Oh, my gosh. (Erik chuckles) TRAVIS: Wow. That was pretty cool.</p>
<p>Thank you for that. Yeah, we, uh, were watching the spectrum all around your signal and when you were broadcasting, the, uh, the waveform actually changed.</p>
<p>Normally it has a certain shape, -Mm-hmm. -and when you started that signal, it changed to something completely different. -Hmm.</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: It was really odd. Now, the interesting question is... -if there&#x27;s any kind of response...</p>
<p>-Oh, yeah. ...what form will it take and how will we find out about it? Yeah, if anybody calls you and says, &quot;Hey, what was that weird thing?&quot; Or &quot;I had a headache</p>
<p>when that was going,&quot; -you know, or whatever. -JENN: Yeah. -Okay. -TRAVIS: Especially if someone happens to see a UFO or UAP,</p>
<p>or something strange in the sky, anything at all, please let us know. -Okay. -You may be able to provide some information that&#x27;s very helpful to</p>
<p>our research going on, -so thank you for accommodating us today. -All right. -Oh, yeah, anytime. -It was great to meet you.</p>
<p>-You, too. -Yeah. Thank you very much.  JENN:  Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>CHRIS: So, it&#x27;s gonna be in this little area right here, where I was walking down from the top of the mesa and I found a cave.  THOMAS:  Over the years that</p>
<p> I have been here on the ranch,  there&#x27;s been rampant rumors  about underground bases,  of tunnels, all kinds of  underground things  here at the ranch. If there are some, we definitely want to find them.</p>
<p>I just happened to notice it from on top. Then I-I suggest maybe we just all climb up there -and see if we can find it. -CHRIS: Yeah.</p>
<p>♪ ♪ Hey, I found what looks like to be a cavern. CHRIS: Let me take a look. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is it, or it-it looks like it. THOMAS: You can tell that at one time it was a lot larger.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s collapsed down in on itself. CHRIS: You can tell that this whole area  looks like a sunken-in area.</p>
<p>-THOMAS: Like it caved in. Yeah. -CHRIS: Yeah. It&#x27;s so strange.  THOMAS:</p>
<p> If this is the opening  to that cave that Chris found, did it collapse? Is it still there? Does it continue back, and it&#x27;s just covered by rocks? Definitely a lot of unanswered questions.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s been one consistent thing I&#x27;ve heard since I&#x27;ve been here on the ranch for the last five years and that&#x27;s there is a system of tunnels that goes throughout the ranch. We&#x27;ve got reports of</p>
<p>UFO flying into the mesa, that we have people that think that there&#x27;s underground bases here. We&#x27;ve yet to find it. Who knows? Maybe this is the entrance or maybe this is a way in, and, uh, I&#x27;m all</p>
<p>for figuring out a safe way to explore this more. Well, I&#x27;m ready to head down if you guys are. -I appreciate you showing us, Chris.</p>
<p>-Hey, no problem, man.  There&#x27;s multiple layers  to this property.  I think what&#x27;s going on here  is bigger than any of us here.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s bigger than a science experiment. It&#x27;s bigger than a government contract. It&#x27;s bigger than all of us.</p>
<p> How else can I explain  some of this stuff  throughout all those years? THOMAS: Okay, we got our GPS data. We know where it&#x27;s at.  Let&#x27;s get out of here.</p>
<p>Hey, there&#x27;s Jim. -Hello, guys. -ERIK and TRAVIS: Hey, Jim. -What&#x27;s going on? -JIM: Good to see you.</p>
<p>The day after Erik and I conducted our experiment at Jack FM, ranch manager Jim Morse showed up to share something pretty crazy with us. Been doing a little outreach.</p>
<p>I had a guy that, uh, sent me some videos. -TRAVIS: This is local? -This is local. -Oh.</p>
<p>-Yeah, so, maybe I can show you these, and you can make heads or tails out of them. What are we looking at here? -I guess it&#x27;s these lights right here.</p>
<p>-JIM: Mm-hmm. (indistinct chatter) TRAVIS: Where did this come from? Is this from the community nearby? JIM: Yeah, this is from the community</p>
<p>out here in the basin. -TRAVIS: Uh-huh. -JIM: Um... I mean, there was people from Moon Lake, -miles away,</p>
<p>that saw the lights. -Really? Well, you know, looking at that, first I thought it was stars, -but look, look, they&#x27;re moving. -Yeah. TARVIS: Look at that.</p>
<p>ERIK: Wow. Jim, when was this video taken? Last night, about 8:00 p.m. TRAVIS: Really? That&#x27;s just a few hours after we played</p>
<p>that sound on the radio, Erik. No kidding. It definitely stirred up a lot of interest out here. Look, and in the next video, they&#x27;re in completely different kind of...</p>
<p>-They&#x27;ve moved a bunch. -JIM: Yeah. TRAVIS: And there&#x27;s a bunch. There&#x27;s, like,</p>
<p>four or five of them. -ERIK: Wow. -TRAVIS: Well, that is interesting. It&#x27;s like some kind of formation of the lights,</p>
<p>they&#x27;re doing something.  Now, if we actually stimulated  these UAP to appear  by broadcasting the sound from our 1.6 gigahertz signal out to Roosevelt, that&#x27;s incredible.</p>
<p>They definitely didn&#x27;t look like any conventional aircraft I&#x27;ve ever seen. -It looks like five lights. -Mm-hmm. What on earth? They&#x27;re clearly moving.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re flying, and I don&#x27;t see any airplane navigation lights. JIM: No, I didn&#x27;t either. I didn&#x27;t either.</p>
<p>-ERIK: I couldn&#x27;t see a single blink. -TRAVIS: Yeah. -I don&#x27;t know what that is. -JIM: Yeah.</p>
<p>I got to tell you, though, it&#x27;s intriguing. Yeah, I-I want to pick this apart frame by frame. -Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>-Let me take a look at this. I&#x27;ve never seen a pattern of this many mysterious lights in the sky, after any of our activities. -You know, usually we see one. -One.</p>
<p>Maybe two. But that&#x27;s pretty... That&#x27;s pretty exciting. I don&#x27;t know what that means. JIM:</p>
<p>Yeah. That&#x27;s more than a coincidence.  TRAVIS:  Seeing these videos</p>
<p> was incredible,  because it wasn&#x27;t just  multiple UAPs that appeared at the same time.  They also seemed  to be maneuvering  in a coordinated formation. -(static)</p>
<p>-There it is. Wow.  When we broadcasted our signal  at the radio station,  we could see a very definite  frequency register on the spectrum analyzer,</p>
<p>as if something was responding. What I want to know is if these UAP were also stimulated by our experiment. Clearly,</p>
<p>we now have an investigation that goes beyond the boundaries of Skinwalker Ranch. Well, if you get any stuff like this, -absolutely let us see it. -Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah. Thank you. Especially, you know, getting the date and the time with it also, that&#x27;s great. You guys really stirred</p>
<p>the old, uh, hornets&#x27; nest up. Yeah. Okay, well, if I can borrow this -long enough to get the video off...</p>
<p>-JIM: Yep, absolutely. Absolutely. And I&#x27;m gonna tear it apart frame by frame. -(laughs)</p>
<p>-Yeah, yeah, yeah. -I&#x27;ll get back to the neighbor, okay. -All right. -Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>-Thanks so much. -I&#x27;ll get this back to you soon. -Thank you. -See you later, Jim. -Thank you.</p>
<p>THOMAS: All right. -Well... -BRYANT: Yup. This is the area</p>
<p>we&#x27;re looking at.  THOMAS: After our meeting  with Chris Bartel,  we brought Jake Huffman out, who has spent his career building oil well sites and as part of that, uh, has used a lot of explosives and done a lot of blasting.</p>
<p> We wanted to get  his eyes on the mesa  and see if he could tell  if this was a natural cave-in  or a purposeful one,  and what the best method  for getting into the mesa  would be.</p>
<p>Well, about a quarter of the way down from the top, there&#x27;s an opening where that little clay slough-off is. We had a former guard from Bigelow&#x27;s era that told us about</p>
<p>this large opening he&#x27;d climbed down in, there were some traps and stuff, but it appeared like it had collapsed in. And the whole time we&#x27;ve been here, we&#x27;ve heard reports of</p>
<p>these large tunnels that people can walk clear, clear back in. -Really? -Uh-huh. Some underground bases</p>
<p>and, I mean, you name it. We&#x27;ve heard all kinds of crazy things about this hill. And we&#x27;ve searched and searched and haven&#x27;t found anything that resembles that until we got to this spot, and it does appear</p>
<p>like there could have been a large opening that went back and it caved in. ♪ ♪ JAKE: I&#x27;d like to take a closer look, see if maybe we can see some signs -of any drilling activity.</p>
<p>-THOMAS: Okay. Go ahead. We&#x27;re just gonna go right up here to the base. Looking at it,</p>
<p>do you see anything that would indicate to you that this was collapsed on purpose? JAKE: Actually, yeah. Usually, if you have a slough, then you&#x27;re gonna have material that&#x27;s built up somewhere, you know, and I&#x27;m not seeing</p>
<p>anywhere where... softer material or mud or anything -pushed out from underneath it. -That was pushed out? That&#x27;s a good point. -Hmm.</p>
<p>-JAKE: That tells me this was done for a purpose. I don&#x27;t know what that purpose would be. I can&#x27;t see the rock having a value as landscaping rocks, or...</p>
<p>I believe at some point there was blasting done, and perhaps that was done to hide something.  THOMAS:  Jake suggests that blasting</p>
<p> has occurred in this area, that perhaps the face of this mesa has been collapsed in, and if so, it makes me wonder, why did they collapse it in? Was it for safety, to keep people out of these, uh, tunnels or mines, or whatever they were, or were they trying</p>
<p>to hide something? We got to talk to Erik and Travis about all this and see what they think. THOMAS: We definitely need to investigate it a lot more.</p>
<p>-Yep. -So... We appreciate your expertise. I can only imagine we&#x27;ll have you back out here again.</p>
<p>Whatever I can do to help. -Okay. -Okay. We appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
<p> THOMAS: We had an interesting  visit with Chris Bartel. Chris shared some experiences that he had while he was here on the ranch. One of them,</p>
<p>he was going across the mesa. He was following some very, very large tracks. The stride of this animal is like three feet.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a big animal. He used the term canine, but those tracks looked like a very large wolf. And as he came down, he found this cavern.</p>
<p>It was pretty large, and there were large traps that had been set down inside of this. The interesting thing was, is that when you look down in it, you can tell that</p>
<p>the rocks have collapsed down. Wait, wait, so you&#x27;ve actually seen it? Yes, and I have a solid GPS coordinate for the actual opening. So, if you provide</p>
<p>the coordinates, I can actually bring it up on the screen.  TRAVIS:  Ever since I joined the team  two years ago, I&#x27;ve wanted to investigate</p>
<p>the stories about caves and supposed underground caverns, but we just couldn&#x27;t find any. -I say we pull this up on the screen and look at it. -OTHERS: Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&#x27;s do that.  So, when Thomas said that  former Bigelow team member  Chris Bartel showed them where  one was possibly covered over,  I couldn&#x27;t wait to learn more. THOMAS:</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about three-quarters of the way up the mesa, and it looks like there potentially could have been a much larger cavern that the whole thing has just kind of sunk in and collapsed. Is this close to</p>
<p>where we&#x27;re starting to see some of the GPS anomalies where they vanished into the mesa? Now, that is a great question. Actually, it&#x27;s the opposite. In some of our exercises, we&#x27;ve seen things seem to emerge from about that part of the mesa.</p>
<p>-Hmm. -Really? ♪ ♪ -TRAVIS: Package away.  -Earlier this summer,  we conducted two different  aerial experiments  over the triangle area,  using GPS sensors...</p>
<p>ERIK: I&#x27;m getting something, yeah.  ...trying to pinpoint  the location where we keep detecting high-energy spikes about a mile above the ranch.</p>
<p>These blue cubes represent the position of the GPS payloads. It looks like you smashed into the mesa. You popped out on this side</p>
<p>right there.  TRAVIS:  But in both cases,  the GPS data we collected  inexplicably showed  that our aircrafts  flew down below the mesa.</p>
<p>Look at that. That&#x27;s about that location right there.  And now it looks like  the exit point corresponds  with this spot</p>
<p> where Chris Bartel says  a cave entrance used to exist. I don&#x27;t know yet, but maybe that&#x27;s where our answers about the triangle area are hidden. After seeing this, we brought Jake out here and had him look at it.</p>
<p>He had a feeling that it looked like there had been some demolition work there. Did Bigelow&#x27;s team discover something that we have yet to discover? If there really is a cave there and it was covered up, that had to be done during Bigelow&#x27;s</p>
<p>ownership of the ranch, since he&#x27;s the one that Brandon bought it from.  So, given that  Bigelow was funded in part  by the federal government  for his research,  what could they have found</p>
<p> that needed to be kept hidden? It&#x27;d be good to get Pete Kelsey to fly over it with the infrared camera and see if there&#x27;s any temperature differences that might suggest there&#x27;s an airflow or a pocket or something. Absolutely.</p>
<p>I-I&#x27;ve been really impressed by his work in the past, and to be able to have him bring out even more equipment that&#x27;s more technologically advanced would be awesome. ERIK: It sounds like we got a plan.</p>
<p>The more detail we can get about this part of the property the better. -We&#x27;ll get right to it. -Okay, sounds good. ♪ ♪  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Right in here somewhere? THOMAS: Right up on the edge up there.  TRAVIS:  To help us figure out  if this really is  a covered entrance  to something in the mesa,  technologist</p>
<p> Pete Kelsey has brought out a drone with a thermal imaging camera that&#x27;ll be able to identify any signs of voids or caverns below the rubble. PETE: This looks great.</p>
<p>-Thank you, sir. -Uh-huh.  PETE:  The guys have asked me  to look for caves  here on the property.</p>
<p> The thermal camera could be  a really good fit there, because typically caves, tunnels,  the air inside is much cooler  than the air outside.  If it shows cold air,  that could mean  that there&#x27;s a network.</p>
<p>All right, I got all green lights here. Ready when you are. Where&#x27;s the hole, Thomas? It&#x27;s, uh, basically right... right up there.</p>
<p>You can only see it from the top down. You can&#x27;t see it looking up. So, I&#x27;m gonna just go up there so that you have an easy point of reference</p>
<p>as you&#x27;re trying to locate where this opening is at. I think it will be a lot easier if I&#x27;m up there -standing close to it, so... -Okay. Okay, I&#x27;m gonna get started.</p>
<p>-Be careful. -Yup. ♪ ♪  In my years on the ranch,  there&#x27;s been rampant rumors  about underground tunnels,  underground bases, and really, with the technology</p>
<p>that we&#x27;re deploying now, the hopes is to either find it or-or finally put it to bed once and for all. -Right here. -There? -Yup. -Spinning up.</p>
<p>(whirring) (beeping steadily) TRAVIS: So, you&#x27;re flying the thermal camera first? PETE: Yeah, so the fancy term is this is a radiometric thermal camera, which means it will give me</p>
<p>the temperature. But it also can do just video. -ERIK: Very cool. -Heading for Thomas. ♪ ♪ ERIK:</p>
<p>There he is. PETE: I will zoom in on him a bit. So, the hole must be that thing right in front of him.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Is that hole really the coldest thing within the field of view? -Yes. It&#x27;s black. -Okay.</p>
<p>PETE: It&#x27;s 64 degrees. Whereas on the rock surfaces you are at... Yeah, out in the sun,</p>
<p>it just went to a 102. A 40-degree difference? I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and take one of those smoke bombs up there. So you guys keep an eye out down here and see if you see smoke</p>
<p>coming out. That is a great idea. ♪ ♪  TRAVIS:  In addition to  Pete&#x27;s high-tech drone,  we also brought along</p>
<p> some low-tech smoke bombs, to look for evidence of holes or possible entry points.  Once we drop the bombs,  if the smoke starts emitting  back out of the mesa  from different points  then where we dropped them,  it would be a sign</p>
<p> that there really is  a covered-up cave  or tunnel system  -under all these boulders.  -BRYANT (over walkie): Hey,  Travis. We&#x27;re ready for you to pop</p>
<p>that smoke bomb. All right, we&#x27;re gonna pop a smoke.  Three... two, one...</p>
<p> Popping smoke, popping smoke. -ERIK: You see any effect? -PETE: No. There, it&#x27;s starting to come out.</p>
<p>Look at that. Blue smoke. Yeah, so I&#x27;m getting no love on the thermal. So, I&#x27;ll switch to RGB.</p>
<p>THOMAS: Oh, it&#x27;s coming out down here. TRAVIS: Oh, look. Look behind you.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s coming out everywhere. Ooh, that makes my day. TRAVIS: Wow, look at that. THOMAS:</p>
<p>Little wasps of it down here. ERIK: If there&#x27;s a connection between these larger openings, -perhaps that cave we&#x27;re talking about.</p>
<p>-PETE: Yeah. There was a cave at one time. Thomas and I have found a couple of holes up here. I think we&#x27;re gonna throw</p>
<p>our smoke grenades in there.  So, keep an eye out,  see if you see it coming out  -anywhere on the mesa. -Copy that, thanks. Right here.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Let it get smoking good. Oh, that&#x27;s good, orange smoke, orange smoke. Oh, I&#x27;m gonna step back.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely, we got smoke.  PETE:  A little bit.  ERIK:  Yeah.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: There should be a lot more smoke coming out. Actually, look, look, it&#x27;s getting sucked in.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Yeah, the smoke&#x27;s going down. THOMAS: Oh, look, it&#x27;s completely gone. We should be seeing smoke</p>
<p>everywhere. -There&#x27;s no smoke. -There is nothing here. No smoke? BRYANT: I don&#x27;t see anything.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  Where did it go?  BRYANT:  Where&#x27;d the smoke go? Where&#x27;d it go? Actually, look, look. It&#x27;s getting sucked in. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>Yeah, the smoke&#x27;s going down. The wind&#x27;s blowing the smoke down, Dragon. Really?  THOMAS:  When we dropped smoke bombs</p>
<p> down this opening, the smoke started to come out, and then it was as if somebody turned on a vacuum, and the smoke just disappeared and sucked down in the hole. Yeah, something&#x27;s sucking the smoke into the cave or the hole.</p>
<p>THOMAS: Nothing. There&#x27;s no smoke at all! That is really strange. PETE: Yeah, it&#x27;s inhaling.</p>
<p>ERIK: Yeah, it&#x27;s inhaling all right. So, if that&#x27;s an inhale, the question is, where are the lungs? TRAVIS (over walkie): Hey, Erik, you copy? Yeah, go ahead, Travis.</p>
<p>You guys don&#x27;t see any smoke down there? Travis, I could only see the smoke at the beginning. It disappeared just like you reported.</p>
<p>No trace. I don&#x27;t see it coming out of anywhere. -You going up top? -Yeah.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  Thomas is going up top.  Look up there and see  if you can see any smoke  with the drone. Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, panning up. ♪ ♪ -You see any effect? -No. -TRAVIS: Anything, Thomas? -No.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  For the smoke to be getting  pulled down into the mesa, that means that there&#x27;s some kind of cavern or void sucking the smoke back underground like a vacuum.</p>
<p>Is it something natural or could there be some artificial object or device causing that? Hey, guys, I got one more. Do we want to try and repeat that? I say we do.</p>
<p>What do you think? -Yeah. -Heck, yeah. -Okay, I&#x27;ll bring it up. -Okay.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Erik, be advised,  Dragon has  one more smoke grenade.  He&#x27;s gonna bring it up  and we&#x27;re gonna drop it  in the hole for a repeat. Copy that.</p>
<p>You want to do it, Dragon, or... Sure, I can. All right, well, look. We&#x27;re getting ready to pop smoke again, so keep an eye out.</p>
<p>Three, two, one... Yeah, that&#x27;s probably good enough. -PETE: Purple smoke. -ERIK: Yeah.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s just a little bit coming out, but that-- N-No. BRYANT: Look at it. -It&#x27;s pulling it back down.</p>
<p>-Yeah, it is, look at it. TRAVIS: Yeah, look, it&#x27;s pulling it down right here. That first little bit</p>
<p>kind of filtered out, the rest is getting sucked back down.  THOMAS:  There should be  a lot more smoke than that.</p>
<p> TARVIS:  Those smoke grenades last  a while. -It&#x27;s gone. -It&#x27;s gone, look.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s just weird. Hey, Erik, same thing happened. A little bit of smoke came out then it all just kind of went away.</p>
<p> Did y&#x27;all see any smoke  come out of anywhere? Not down here, Travis. Did Thomas see anything on the back side? -I don&#x27;t see anything up here. -TRAVIS: Yeah? I even walked back there</p>
<p>up on the ridge a little bit. I don&#x27;t see anything. We&#x27;ve got a lot of data suggesting that there&#x27;s something interesting going on in this area.</p>
<p> With all the stories  that we&#x27;ve heard of tunnels  and caverns and underground  bases here in the mesa, I finally feel like we&#x27;re starting to make some progress. Well, it means there&#x27;s got</p>
<p>to be some sort of an opening, if it&#x27;s pulling that much smoke and none of it&#x27;s leaking out. We&#x27;re out of smoke bombs, I guess just head down. All right, I&#x27;m landing.</p>
<p> ERIK:  As I like to say,  &quot;We are led by the data.&quot; And all of the data are pointing to the existence of a large void,  somewhere inside of  the face of this mesa.</p>
<p> I would love to get eyes on  what&#x27;s in there. -Welcome back to earth. -OTHERS: Yeah. So you did find something? Uh, we did find something.</p>
<p>Sure weird, from what I saw from the air. It was, it was like the mesa just took a deep breath. Yep, you could literally see it</p>
<p>being sucked down into the hole. And the hole, it seems like it just went forever. It was just like a vacuum cleaner turned on and it sucked</p>
<p>all that smoke down -and then it was gone. -Yeah, it was gone. So, it went somewhere. That hole goes deeper than we think.</p>
<p>Well, I think we got to figure some things out before we do the next thing. We really want to do this right.  The experiment  definitely confirmed  that there is something</p>
<p> that we need to explore  deep inside the mesa. But we&#x27;re gonna have to move some earth, and that means digging or drilling to find out what it is. So, we need to have</p>
<p>a serious meeting with Brandon and get his blessing,  &#x27;cause we&#x27;ve seen in the past,  it&#x27;s always risky to dig  on Skinwalker Ranch, but I don&#x27;t see another choice. Great work, as always, Pete. -Thank you very much,</p>
<p>appreciate it. -Oh, my pleasure. All right. We&#x27;ll load up, head back.  ERIK:</p>
<p> Oh, well, here they are. TRAVIS: Now that we&#x27;ve found what may be a purposely covered up system of caverns, or who knows what,  in the mesa...  ...we need to explain it</p>
<p> to Brandon  and have  a serious discussion about  what he&#x27;s willing  to allow us to do to get inside and see what the heck could be there. Well, Brandon, as usual, we have some intriguing things</p>
<p>to report. We&#x27;ve taken a lot of data with the GPS experiments, with the helicopter, with the airplane, and we&#x27;ve seemed to find there&#x27;s an anomaly that&#x27;s just a little bit west of the, uh, triangle that&#x27;s</p>
<p>causing it to look like... actually, that Cameron&#x27;s helicopter flew us into the mesa, and then out of the mesa on top somehow or other. -Okay.</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: That&#x27;s kind of in the same location that we&#x27;ve had an eyewitness suggest that there was a cave there in the past. Really? Oh.</p>
<p>Wow. Chris Bartel, uh, one of the former guards for Mr. Bigelow, he came out here and visited with us, and he showed us this cavern.</p>
<p>Thomas and I had one of his associates come out who&#x27;s done a lot of blasting and drilling. Well, he-he just looked at it, and he said it does have the appearance that it could have been</p>
<p>blasted and collapsed. Chris Bartel showing us this cavern led us to explore further in that area to see if we could find other clues or maybe other entrances.</p>
<p>-Mm-hmm. -And we actually did find some other holes, uh, which we dropped smoke bombs down into. The smoke started to come up</p>
<p>out of the hole and then it was as if somebody turned on a vacuum, and the smoke sucked down into the hole, and we never saw another trace of it. -Wow.</p>
<p>-That was really strange. Yeah, it was-- it was odd. It really suggests that there is some sort of opening, uh, network underneath the rocks, underneath the mesa.</p>
<p>The fact that the-the smoke experiment showed that there&#x27;s some void, there&#x27;s something that is pulling that material into the mesa, I mean, that&#x27;s-that&#x27;s a key clue.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was the most bizarre thing. There&#x27;s an airflow somewhere going into something, a void somewhere or whatever. Since it never came out lower,</p>
<p>that suggests there&#x27;s an opening underneath, underneath the mesa out there. -Yeah. -As we&#x27;ve discussed before, this is an area attended by GPS receivers behaving anomalously</p>
<p>in that part of the ranch. What&#x27;s doing it? What&#x27;s interfering with them? -And what may have been covered up in the past? -ERIK: Yeah.</p>
<p>BRANDON: What were they hiding in that mesa? That&#x27;s the big question, right? What were they hiding and why would they deliberately cover up their tracks? I think Thomas has found</p>
<p>the ideal solution. What would you propose? Well, I have a, I have a good friend that is a driller. Now, he&#x27;s a horizontal driller. This drill is special in</p>
<p>the fact that it&#x27;s directional, and it allows him to steer the bit around. -Wow. -And so, we could set it up at the base of the mesa and drill horizontally</p>
<p>into the mesa, and we can steer it around. And so, it would allow us to explore and see if we might be able to punch into one of these voids. That is a perfect match</p>
<p>for our problem set, Thomas. I&#x27;m very curious to find out what may be hidden in that chamber or at least in that area. You have my approval to proceed,</p>
<p>but proceed with care. I want to minimize the amount of disruption over in that area, and I want to make sure that safety is paramount. -You got it, Brandon.</p>
<p>-BRYANT: Let&#x27;s go.  TARVIS:  You can&#x27;t really  take this ranch  as a serious  scientific investigation  if you don&#x27;t take in mind  all of the lore and mythology</p>
<p> that comes with it.  We&#x27;ve heard so many stories  about what&#x27;s  underneath this mesa.  We&#x27;ve heard myths of caves  that have portals in them,  even a military base.</p>
<p>Any information we could get that tells us there&#x27;s some type of void or even a structure, that would be amazing information.  BRANDON:</p>
<p> I believe as we move forward,  the mesa holds secrets  that have yet to be revealed.  We have to always be aware  that anytime we begin digging  or disturbing the earth,  we stand to experience harm and there&#x27;s a risk involved.  However, I can tell you</p>
<p> we are onto something.  This is the time  to put our foot on the gas  and to charge forward,  so we can hopefully  catch a glimpse  of what is really at work  at Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
<p> THOMAS:  We&#x27;re hoping that we can go  drill through the mesa and see if we hit any voids. BRYANT: That looks like</p>
<p>a big chunk of something. What is that? It definitely looks metallic.  BRYANT:  Let&#x27;s run a snake camera</p>
<p> down in the mesa. There it is. What is that? This thing is broadcasting. This thing shouldn&#x27;t be broadcasting anything.</p>
<p>-Hey. Are you okay? -No.  BRYANT:  Tom just blacked out.</p>
