            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>foreign this is need to know real talk about the  reality of unidentified aerial phenomenon   from Australia Ross coltart  from the U.S Bryce zabel well I guess we&#x27;re going to be talking about  anniversaries today I mean it&#x27;s been around   a month since October 31st report on UAP was  supposed to come out and we&#x27;re still waiting   but more than that it&#x27;s been almost five years </p>
<p>since that classic New York Times reporting   sort of ushered in a new age of UAP I mean happy  anniversary Ross nice to have it it&#x27;s one hell of   an anniversary Bryce frankly I don&#x27;t know what to  say I am being besieged with people demanding to   know what I know about why there&#x27;s been this  delay in the Congress and my best spin on it   mate is that frankly the office that&#x27;s supposedly  meant to be doing this report is so chronically   under-resourced understaffed under focused on by </p>
<p>the Pentagon that it hasn&#x27;t been able to get the   report completed on time people are telling me  there will eventually be a report but they&#x27;re   saying don&#x27;t get too worked up about it this  isn&#x27;t unusual in the in the Washington DC scheme   of events but but frankly I&#x27;ll be honest with you  mate it it doesn&#x27;t send a very good message what   it indicates to me at all I I got to tell you  I&#x27;m not happy I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not willing to cut that   slack I mean if you recall there was supposed to </p>
<p>be and we&#x27;ll be talking about this more later but   there was a report that was due on June 25th  2021 and it came out on June 25th 2021. this   one I was saying well if it comes out on October  31st that&#x27;ll be you know eight days before the   election I thought it would be even a part of  the election instead it&#x27;s just gone away and   there&#x27;s no accountability I I mean people aren&#x27;t </p>
<p>you know raising their voices and and being upset   about this thing and that I think is a little  strange uh to have something this important and   not have any follow-up I mean I I think about okay  there&#x27;s uh Senators that have been involved uh   Rubio and gillibrand for example why aren&#x27;t they  saying anything why haven&#x27;t they called the news   conference that&#x27;s what worries me about because  at the moment when I&#x27;m talking to people I know my   friend Leslie Keynes talking to people there are </p>
<p>people all over America who are debating whether   or not they should come forward as whistleblowers  to talk about what they know and what they want to   hear most of all is a statement of political will  from the from the Congress they know that there is   legislation in place the gillibrand amendment  that was put in place in the National Defense   authorization act last year and they know that  there are more Provisions hopefully coming from   the house later this year hopefully when the </p>
<p>ndaa and the intelligence authorization acts   are passed by both houses of Congress but what  they&#x27;re looking for most of all is a statement of   clear intent from the people who have championed  this so publicly and mate it ain&#x27;t happening we&#x27;re   not I mean the thing I find most conspicuous is  that despite the fact that a report is late by 1   to the Congress there&#x27;s not been a peep from any  of the chairpersons or the deputy chairpersons   of any of the congressional committees it&#x27;s like </p>
<p>nobody gives a hoot or they they do give a hoot   and because of that they&#x27;re not talking I don&#x27;t  know it just is irritating because what we are   asking for is pretty simple okay a report is out  due out on October 31st it doesn&#x27;t show up so you   ought to be able to get a straight answer and  if the straight answer was something as simple   as yeah we we were under resourced we&#x27;re working  on it now we expect to have it out on you know   December 15th instead that would at least be an </p>
<p>answer it would have some something behind it we   don&#x27;t get that and it&#x27;s the same issue I got to  tell you that bothers me over and over about the   whole UAP UFO issue which is I&#x27;m not necessarily  expecting the government or anyone else to say   oh by the way here&#x27;s a briefing here&#x27;s exactly  what&#x27;s been going on for the last 80 years or   so but I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the people in the know  could simply put out a declarative statement that   says yeah these things aren&#x27;t ours we&#x27;re not </p>
<p>alone that would be just a great start so the   whole issue of UFO UAP disclosure or investigation  or whatever we want to call it has been plagued   by this sense that if we don&#x27;t talk about it if we  just ignore it then it&#x27;ll go away but I think what   you and I have been doing for 25 podcasts now by  the way happy anniversary for our 25th podcast too   um what we&#x27;ve been doing is saying you know if  you&#x27;re not going to talk about it we&#x27;re going   to talk about it so I guess we have to talk </p>
<p>about it we have to explain what&#x27;s going on   and also the only thing that has appeared in  mainstream media and it&#x27;s coming up for an   anniversary on that story now is Julian Barnes  apologia for the Pentagon where he wrote In The   New York Times how many military UFO reports  are just foreign spying or Airborne trash and   that was the story that I think set the scene for  the growing despondency that we&#x27;re seeing at the   moment where people are questioning whether </p>
<p>or not there really is a serious commitment   by the Pentagon I mean it was a shameful story  it was just a complete joke a classic piece of   um quiet little briefing in a quiet room to a  reporter who was obviously trusted to do the right   thing and and peddle out the usual lines there  was not one questioning moment in the article   which really put them on the spot basically  American officials supposedly familiar with the   findings of the Pentagon and intelligence agencies </p>
<p>investigations of these incidents reassuringly   stated don&#x27;t you worry your tiny little heads you  little folk out there as great and illustrious   Pentagon we&#x27;re going to tell you how most of this  stuff is just weather balloons Airborne clutter   or surveillance operations by other countries  don&#x27;t you worry yourself all&#x27;s fine and I guess   what that story did was set the scene for the  impression that what we&#x27;re seeing is a pushback a   hose done and I am being impressed upon privately </p>
<p>by people who are passionately committed to The   Whistleblower disclosures before Congress I&#x27;m  being told I&#x27;m too negative and that what we&#x27;re   seeing uh happening is not a reflection of what&#x27;s  actually happening that behind the scenes there   are already people giving evidence to Congress but  the big question in my mind is Congress might get   to hear about it some of the provisions in the  um in the legislation allow even the individual   chairperson of the various committees to be </p>
<p>briefed about it but will the public get to   know about it that&#x27;s the big question I&#x27;m sorry  I am not appeased I&#x27;m just not um because the   the things that you&#x27;re telling me that people are  willing to speak to you about behind the scenes   I&#x27;m experiencing the same thing myself I&#x27;m saying  these are not huge Revelations it ought not to   be a problem to say uh we&#x27;re having uh behind the  scenes we&#x27;re having closed-door meetings on it and   we&#x27;re we&#x27;re talking to whistleblowers okay well </p>
<p>okay that&#x27;s not briefing you on the the actual   content it&#x27;s just acknowledging where we stand  in the process if if the people in Washington   cannot tell us where we stand in the process I am  not amused now you were talking about how people   have talked to you I&#x27;m going to read something  from an email I got from someone who knows   things okay I&#x27;m not going to tell you who it is  because they&#x27;ve asked me not to but I hear from   that person the process is on track and moving </p>
<p>ahead smartly so that&#x27;s basically what you&#x27;re   saying we&#x27;re being reassured you know don&#x27;t  worry behind the scenes we got this handled and   again you know I&#x27;m not amused the person then said  perhaps we&#x27;re moving faster than the rate at which   Collective conscious can process and internalize  emerging facts and data well that that probably is   is true I&#x27;d have to probably explain that but they  say the great majority seem to love the UAP issue   as a theoretical proposition and flocked alien </p>
<p>and Sci-Fi movies but the prospect of confronting   the reality of another complex and potentially  destabilizing existential issue and on and on   they&#x27;re saying that&#x27;s the the reason it&#x27;s just  too big an issue well for crying out loud Ross   it&#x27;s been too big an issue since at least 1947. at  some point we have to say I&#x27;ve run out of patience   and and again I don&#x27;t want to be look I you know </p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want the government knocking on my door to   shut me up from you know being a activist fire  brand or anything I&#x27;m not actively campaigning   for anybody to say things they&#x27;re not supposed to  say that would violate National Security but I am   actively campaigning that at least let&#x27;s have we  started out with what looked like a transparent   process and if this pushback means we&#x27;re trying to  put it back in the Box all I can tell you is from   my perspective it won&#x27;t wash not only will you </p>
<p>and I not accept it I don&#x27;t think the public will   call this the I&#x27;m as mad as hell and I&#x27;m not  gonna take this anymore episode what do you reckon   I like it you know I&#x27;d be happy to throw my window  open and yell that except I live about a hundred   yards for my next neighbor so I don&#x27;t even think  they&#x27;d hear me uh but but I think we are mad as   hell but we&#x27;re not mad as hell about everything  we&#x27;re just mad that the process that we&#x27;re   pursuing needs to be one that is transparent and </p>
<p>is discussed and and hopefully gets the mainstream   media to start covering this like a real national  security issue which at minimum it is and uh that   is something that has not happened yet and uh  again when we when we talk about what&#x27;s happened   in the last five years that&#x27;s one of the stories  behind it well as you know Bryce I I&#x27;ve given   up having any faith in the mainstream media&#x27;s  ability to even take an interest in this subjects and I I&#x27;ve basically decided that the only reason </p>
<p>why shows like us are so important is because   we&#x27;re filling a gap I mean I know it sounds  pompous and self-important but we really are   we&#x27;re filling a gap in what should be objective  analytical coverage of the news of uaps this is   potentially the biggest story ever frankly that&#x27;s  what I think I mean let&#x27;s just I I think what we   could usefully do today uh seeing it&#x27;s the  anniversary of what I think is a momentous   moment the October 20 sorry December 2017 um uh </p>
<p>story of the New York Times where essentially it   was essentially admitted that the Pentagon had  been secretly investigating UFOs maybe we should   take stock maybe it&#x27;s time for us to take stock  and consider what has been achieved in the last   five years because I think it&#x27;s very easy for  us to look now and get despondent about the   fact that the pentagon&#x27;s perhaps not responding  as quickly as we would like with the report that   it&#x27;s obliged to provide to Congress but really </p>
<p>if you look back at five years ago when I first   to be honest started getting very interested in  this subject matter as a reporter for Australia   60 minutes and I saw the New York Times  December 2017 story that was a momentous   moment for many people including myself all  over the world not just in America it was   a moment where I realized that the official  narrative is not the correct one that we&#x27;re   not being given the full story and indeed even </p>
<p>before that date in October of 2017 there was   an organization launched called to the Stars  Academy which basically put Jim simivan xcia   Hal put off X just about every three million  agency Steve Justice X Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Skunk   Works Chris melon next defense department and  Louis zondo ex-odni and National Intelligence   it was an incredible moment to see those people  on stage talking about their willingness to   discuss something that has been so ridiculed and </p>
<p>so stigmatized for much of the last seven decades well you know Ross all of that is very  true and uh just for the record it was   December 17th of 2017 when the New York Times  front page article appeared and it was quite a   radical thing now I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s going  to stand up as a day that lives on like the JFK   assassination or 911 I think uh the the it&#x27;s  doubtful um but it was an important time and   and we all have those memories where we say I </p>
<p>remember what I was doing when I heard about   that and that&#x27;s usually what is a sign that  we&#x27;re dealing with something now Ross I&#x27;ve   got an actual story about how I learned about  this on 2017 but before I tell it I want to   know how did you first tip to this story when  did you first lay eyes on that that article   I I got told about it by people in the U.S who  basically said to me you know you need to look   at this story it&#x27;s amazing and they were some of </p>
<p>the people that I&#x27;d been meeting who were Pentagon   people who who told me privately that I should  be taking this seriously and I think they knew   it was coming basically uh as soon as I clicked  onto that website and saw glowing auras and black   money the pentagon&#x27;s mysterious UFO program Leslie  Kane Ralph Blumenthal Helene Cooper I knew the   world was about to be tipped upside down to see an  admission in black and white on the front page of   the New York Times that the Pentagon had secretly </p>
<p>been investigating UFOs and indeed paranormal   phenomena at Skinwalker Ranch through a program  that they said was called atip but was actually   orsap a a wsap that was an amazing moment and it  actually dropped in in terms of what had actually   dropped it wasn&#x27;t a huge storm Story I mean merely  the fact that the Pentagon was investigating UFOs   was was the Revelation but there were so many  little nuggets in that story that later bore fruit   the the fact that it mentioned Bob Bigelow who&#x27;d </p>
<p>previously only very recently at that time told   60 Minutes in the U.S that he was convinced that  aliens were real and it was also back then very   important that it mentioned James lacatsky A dia  official it didn&#x27;t name him by name but it talked   about a Dia official who&#x27;d gone to the Skinwalker  Ranch to investigate phenomena and he he&#x27;d done   this by going through Harry Reid Senator Harry  Reid who was at the time the House Majority Leader   and and significantly I think now in light of what </p>
<p>we&#x27;re seeing with NASA&#x27;s investigation into UFOs   it also mentioned how Astronaut John Glenn had  told Senator Harry Reid that he thought that there   should be investigations into uaps particularly  interviewing Pilots who&#x27;d seen objects and we   now know five years on that&#x27;s happening and I  think what&#x27;s significant is that that New York   Times story was the beginning of five years of  rolling Revelations and truly I actually want to   pay tribute here I I think we should acknowledge </p>
<p>the incredible work that&#x27;s been done by people   like Chris Mellon Hal put off Louis zondo Eric  Davis all these people behind the scenes who&#x27;ve   been gently pushing and doing a lot more work  particularly melon behind the scenes to actually   get the Congress to be receptive to something that  was so stigmatized and so ridiculed I think we&#x27;ve   achieved a lot in five years well I agree and you  just blew past 50 percent of my notes my friends   so um I was still waiting for Ross to say gee </p>
<p>Bryce why don&#x27;t you tell us your story about what   happened and how you learned about it so I&#x27;ll just  wait oh okay chief Russ why don&#x27;t you tell me your   story about what you learned clearly oh my God  Rick Ross I&#x27;m so taken aback that you would ask   um okay well um I&#x27;d love to do that on December  uh 17th of 2017 I literally was on vacation in   New Orleans I was doing research at the World War  Two Two Museum there beautiful and and substantial   Museum on the topic um and I was doing research </p>
<p>and I came out of uh the film that Tom Hanks   narrated I believe and my phone said you have  a phone message a voice message so I played it   and uh this is how I found out it was a message  from Dan Aykroyd of course the actor who is also   well known in UFO circles and he and I had been  talking about the Betty and Barney Hill movie that   um that I&#x27;m still trying to get produced and  this is the message he left I&#x27;m not going to read   all of it but it&#x27;s a part of it he goes uh yeah </p>
<p>front page December 17th New York Times real UFOs   Pentagon unit tried to know Ralph Blumenthal wrote  it he wrote that great piece in Vanity Fair about   Betty and Barney do you know Ralph he&#x27;s great  just great you should get to know him if you don&#x27;t   love seeing the idea of captured don&#x27;t know why  Spielberg wouldn&#x27;t want to produce that big time   if you&#x27;ve got the rights you&#x27;re very wise there  and then he ends by going he says it&#x27;s acroyd   here of course which of course I knew because I </p>
<p>know the guy&#x27;s uh voice and I loved him talking   about he wants to be in a movie that I want to do  but this is how he ended he goes but here we are   December 17 2017. it&#x27;s uh just wait what&#x27;s coming  man just wait what&#x27;s coming to this planet boy all   right have fun sir talk to you soon and next time  we see each other again I&#x27;ll tell you about the   car they made disappear in front of me bye okay </p>
<p>well um I&#x27;d love to do that on December uh 17th of   2017 I literally was on vacation in New Orleans  um I was doing research at the World War II 2   Museum there beautiful and and substantial Museum  on the topic um and I was doing research and I   came out of uh the film that Tom Hanks narrated I  believe and my phone said you have a phone message   a voice message so I played it and uh this  is how I found out it was a message from Dan   Aykroyd of course the actor who is also well known </p>
<p>in UFO circles and he and I had been talking about   uh the Betty and Barney Hill movie that um that  I&#x27;m still trying to get produced and uh this is   the message he left I&#x27;m not going to read all  of it but it&#x27;s a part of it he goes uh yeah   front page December 17th New York Times real UFOs  Pentagon unit tried to know Ralph Blumenthal wrote   it he wrote that great piece in Vanity Fair about  Betty and Barney do you know Ralph he&#x27;s great just   is great you should get to know them if you don&#x27;t </p>
<p>love seeing the idea of captured don&#x27;t know why   Spielberg wouldn&#x27;t want to produce that big time  if you&#x27;ve got the rights you&#x27;re very wise there   and then he ends by going he says it&#x27;s acroyd  here of course which of course I knew because   I know the guy&#x27;s voice and I loved him talking  about he wants to be in a movie that I want to do   but this is how he ended he goes but here we are  December 17 2017.</p>
<p>it&#x27;s uh just wait what&#x27;s coming   man just wait what&#x27;s coming to this planet boy  all right have fun sir talk to you soon and next   time we see each other again I&#x27;ll tell you about  the car they may disappear in front of me bye it&#x27;s about the car that disappeared in front  of you I have heard that story uh I I wouldn&#x27;t   presume to tell it but uh because it was a  first person experience of this but anyway   so of course the first thing I did is say </p>
<p>to my family okay you guys go look at the   damn Museum I&#x27;ve got to sit down and and read  an article so I sat down at the World War II   Museum in New Orleans and read that article  and I will say this I felt like as I read it   well we&#x27;re never going to see the world the same  way now I don&#x27;t want to pick up on one thing you   said though you said that that was almost the  trigger for you saying I&#x27;m gonna I&#x27;m gonna pay   attention to this which led to your fantastic </p>
<p>book in plain sight that came out last year   for me it was a different experience I&#x27;d been  stuck in UFO world for almost three decades   uh two and a half decades I think at that point  so for me I had given up if you will on the the   thought that people would sort of start with the  period of transparency and we might actually get   to the place where we were going to be honest  uh with ourselves about this thing because I&#x27;d   lived through my entire life where you you hoped </p>
<p>something would break but nothing ever did right   so when I read that it was transformative for  one reason none of us are getting any younger   and that applies to me and when I read it I  was giving up on the Opera opportunity or the   chance that I might see some form of admission  confirmation disclosure in my own Lifetime and   what it did for me is it gave me hope to pursue  this in a more aggressive way such as the podcast   we&#x27;re doing because I thought you know what </p>
<p>this might just now happen in my lifetime and   and I&#x27;m I I believe that is absolutely true so  yeah it was a game changer for me for you for   different reasons and I&#x27;m sure uh just like if  you went through the JFK assassination and asked   people where were you if you were even alive  of course uh everybody has a different story   and I&#x27;m sure a lot of the people listening to us  have their own stories so yeah big big day and   and just as a point of uh uh you know to to lay </p>
<p>the clarity out on this thing the the meeting the   press conference you were talking about with  Tom Delong and all those that list of great   people that you mentioned uh from the to the Stars  Academy that preceded the New York Times article when we I remember seeing that and going well I  don&#x27;t know if this is going I it was interesting   to listen to but I thought what&#x27;s Tom Delong going  to do you know I don&#x27;t know how he got these guys   to appear with him but hopefully so I had said </p>
<p>that it was a December 2017 New York Times story   that twigged my interest but to be honest with  you when I was working for 60 Minutes Australia   I&#x27;d already been talking to people in Washington  and so I&#x27;m sending out the idea of me writing a   book on uaps UFOs and my interest had been drawn  to Tom delong&#x27;s conversations with Alejandro Rojas   right through 2015 2016. and then I saw the </p>
<p>foundation press conference of ttsa the to the   Stars Academy in October of 2017 which was a few  months prior of course to the New York Times story   and that I thought was an incredibly important  moment because you had on stage Elizondo a former   counter-intelligence agents for odni Chris melon  a former deputy assistant Secretary of Defense   um Jim semivan from the CIA Steve Justice  from Lockheed Martin it was extraordinary   and the promise of course was intense but I I </p>
<p>think it&#x27;s also what came out in that period   following the New York Times story that really  got me going because not only did you have Louis   zondo protesting in the New York Times and also  in his ttsa interviews about the excessive secrecy   and ridicule and stigma are associated with UFOs  uaps he also made that extraordinary statement on   CNN that I think will be regarded in the future as  one of the Great Moments in history where Elizondo   leans forward to the mic and tells CNN&#x27;s </p>
<p>reporter my personal belief is that there is very   compelling evidence that we we may not be alone  whatever that means I I think I think that is the   boom moment that was when I sort of went holy heck  and it was interesting because it was around about   then I put a bid in from Australia&#x27;s 60 minutes  program to get Chris Miller and I approached him   and he very kindly agreed to an interview and this  is a reflection of the media stigma my TV program   at the time channel channel nines 60 Minutes </p>
<p>it said yep yep we&#x27;ll let you do the interview   with Chris Mellon and I was booked on a flight to  Washington I think in January the following year   and then all of a sudden my executive producer  pulled the pin citing their concern about the   ridicule and the stigma associated with UFOs  which I thought was very telling that that even   when you had a front page story in the New York  Times basically saying look you know UFOs are   real they&#x27;re being investigated by the Pentagon </p>
<p>you&#x27;ve got a former deputy assistant Secretary of   Defense who&#x27;s basically prepared to talk to you  about it and I&#x27;d lined up the interview and the   great frustration for me as a mainstream reporter  was that the pin was pulled and I realized I think   at that point that the only way that we can cover  this issue is by acknowledging that the mainstream   media is hamstrung it&#x27;s it&#x27;s so hampered by this  stigma this ridicule that that&#x27;s why shows like   ours matter yeah you know I just want to point </p>
<p>out one thing though when you&#x27;re talking about   the boom moment uh when Elizondo said we may not  be alone it was a boom moment for you hearing   Elizondo say it but he wasn&#x27;t saying it in that  widespread uh way that a New York Times front page   article was which was the you know sort of the  boom moment for the average person if they were   waking up to it and that leads me to want to just  uh make one thing clear about our podcast need to   know we&#x27;re trying to have our cake and eat it </p>
<p>too we&#x27;re trying to have it both ways we want   to have a podcast a weekly briefing if you will  or not weekly a bi-weekly briefing where people   can come in and uh if you already know a lot  about the topic uh you know some of it may be a   redundant but we&#x27;ll try to give it some context  and an analysis and even commentary but we also   want to make it friendly for people who are just  now waking up to the fact after these five years   that wow something real is going on about this </p>
<p>and maybe I want to to know a little bit more   that&#x27;s also who need to know is for so one of the  things if we&#x27;re going to talk about the five-year   anniversary of this New York Times article  and how things have changed I think that&#x27;s   a two-part discussion uh Ross and and part one is  I think we should tell people what the world was   like prior to that and then talk about some of the  things that have happened in the world after that   so let me take a a crack at UFO history prior to </p>
<p>2017. for now some most of you already know this   not everyone does the thing really broke open  in the United States over 75 years ago in 1947   in the summer of 1947. there was a sighting by  a pilot Kenneth Arnold in Washington state that   got the whole world buzzing uh Roswell happened </p>
<p>in that same summer in July and was announced   in a newspaper and then retracted the day later  which took us into a period in the 40s and the 50s   where the government was taking UFO&#x27;s very very  seriously they were looking usually Roswell just   to explain to the novice Roswell was ostensively  even though this is furiously denied by the U.S   Air Force it was ostensibly the crash Believe  It or Not of an alien spacecraft absolutely of   course it&#x27;s something that is adamantly rejected </p>
<p>by the U.S Air Force even to this day even though   they&#x27;ve given four completely contradictory  explanations for what they said actually   was so you know and we&#x27;ve even done a show on  Roswell which I encourage people to listen to   uh and and you know I I think Roswell was I think  the government made a Mist you know accidentally   told the truth uh when they when they allowed that  uh article to come out on the front page of the   Roswell Daily Record so anyway what what happened </p>
<p>though is uh the world of UFOs and the National   Security establishment kind of intermixed in the  40s and 50s when the government was furiously   looking into this and at the same time taking a  posture in public that there was nothing to see   here and frankly going out of their way to make  sure that people who did talk about flying saucers   were marginalized uh and in fact as you point out  it created the stigma so we went into the 60s and   70s where the people who were studying it were </p>
<p>were frankly appalled at what was they thought it   looked like was really happening and yet nobody  was really talking about it when they did talk   about it they made it seem like the something that  you should joke about and yet there are case after   cases going on in the 60s and 70s including some  fantastic cases where they over flew uh nuclear   weapons installations and turned off some missiles  so I think that&#x27;s the thing I think that&#x27;s the   thing that sticks out to me the the thing that </p>
<p>sticks out to me is that the disconnect between   the historical record what we now know courtesy  largely of President Clinton the declassification   of a lot of the CIA and defense department files  which show that whilst they were ridiculing and   stigmatizing the subject all through the late  50s 60s and early 70s frankly they were taking it   very seriously this is this is a subject that was  being investigated and still is being investigated   and the public was fed this line that that we </p>
<p>we were basically disinterested in government   in the subject of UFO UF UFOs uaps that they  were something to be stigmatized and ridiculed   where in fact as you and I both know even though  the um the Robertson panel uh ostensively was a   public investigation set up in 1952 to properly  investigate UFOs its sole purpose in its stated   private purpose was to essentially cover it  up and suppress public awareness of the issue   I think we need to give a tip of the microphone </p>
<p>to the Freedom of Information Act uh here in the   United States which uh came about due to certain  CIA revelations in the 70s and this legislation   allowed it easier for citizens to get at uh old  memos and have them Declassified and or redacted   and released so what we learned thanks to foia  and we are still learning today thanks to foia   we learned that while the government was saying  one thing it was doing another because I encourage   people who say well we really don&#x27;t have any </p>
<p>evidence or whatever you know some of these   documents make it very clear that there was lots  of evidence and when people say you know uh show   me a great photo and then maybe I&#x27;ll come around  let&#x27;s face it Ross coltard and Bryce Abel do not   have great photos sitting on our computers that  we can release or we would the people who have   the great photos are the have essentially  in the past always been the people that   collect them because they had military interior </p>
<p>aircraft in the air so if we&#x27;re going to bridge   from history to sort of the world of 2017 what  2017 did as a demarcation line is it said okay   um these things that people have been talking  about and that we&#x27;ve said we don&#x27;t care about   then because in 1969 the Air Force said we&#x27;re not  going to look into UFOs anymore because they&#x27;re   not a national security threat in 2017 uh that  that New York Times article said that wasn&#x27;t true   that there was a national security aspect to it </p>
<p>and that there were excellent cases that came out   of that and in fact the New York Times article  introduced an entirely new case to the world   which was the Nimitz case of 2004 which has become  almost synonymous with the modern day of ufology   I&#x27;ll let you take that one Ross you do a great  job with Nimitz well actually before we get to   Nimitz if we&#x27;re doing a timeline from the end of  the second world war I&#x27;m having a bit of Mischief   here but if we look at the leaked Wikileaks DNC </p>
<p>emails that that show the um exchanges between   Tom Delong and John podesta referring to his  alleged conversations with a person he called   the general uh and people from Lockheed Martin  there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a date at the end of the Cold   War let&#x27;s call it say 1989. and the key moment  is in those emails where irrefutably Tom Delong   who&#x27;s had definitely conversations with two very </p>
<p>senior generals probably General Neil mccasland   and general Michael Kerry sometime around 2015  2016. he tells Tom Delong in these leaked emails   a life form was discovered that a general  told him a life form was discovered   and it&#x27;s funny I hack on about these uh leaked  DNC emails but a lot of people out there often   criticizes for going just on people who make </p>
<p>wacky claims on online and and people who come   out and say they&#x27;re part of secret space programs  and stuff like that and you and I don&#x27;t give that   any currency what we try and look for is sourced  material and this is sourced material this is a   leaked series of emails between Tom Delong who for  some incredible reason was having extraordinary   conversations around about 2015 2016 with a group  of people from the Pentagon in the intelligence   Community who were willing to discuss with him </p>
<p>the potential for disclosure of things relating to   uaps UFOs and they told him there were recovered  craft and there was a recovered life form and for   the life of me that to me is one of the stepping  stones in the lead up to the 2017 revelations in   the New York Times the fact that we now know  all of this was going on but as we were just   being discussed we were talking about the Tic Tac  incident which is the videos that were released   that at the time that the New York Times Did its </p>
<p>Story the ttsa organization began the progressive   release of three videos the Tic Tac the go fast  and the Gimbal and the earliest of those incidents   was the 2004 tick Tech incident involving the USS  Nimitz battle carrier battle group just off the   um Baja California Mexico Coast about a hundred  and something miles out to sea and basically   they saw crazy things on their spy one Aegis  radar system objects doing things that are   still to this day technically Impossible on known </p>
<p>human technology and despite what the debunkers   say everybody leaps at the videos and does these  exhaustive analysis of these videos and basically   says the gimbal wasn&#x27;t rotating the Tic Tac wasn&#x27;t  really going very fast the simple fact is they&#x27;re   ignoring all the data and what they wrestle with  what what was fantastic about the New York Times   stories that were progressively released from 2017  is that they pulled together the data you had a   data stream you had the the reference from people </p>
<p>who&#x27;d worked the radar systems on board the USS   Princeton who said that these objects one in  particular was seen to descend from eighty   thousand feet or twenty thousand feet to the  ocean surface in 0.78 of a second and there&#x27;s a   study that&#x27;s done by our friends at the scientific  Coalition for the study of UAP that says that on   that estimate given by the radar operators the  objects were moving at least tens of thousands   of miles an hour possibly a hundred and five </p>
<p>thousand miles an hour an acceleration force of 12   000 G forces and if it really was going from  a stationary position at above 80 000 feet to   essentially out of sight within a second as as I  think the Tic Tac was seen at twenty five thousand   feet and then it zoomed off at a peak velocity  they&#x27;ve estimated that that velocity was 453 000 kilometers an hour it&#x27;s 281 miles an hour  281 000 miles an hour Ross I I of course am an   American who don&#x27;t understand kilometers but </p>
<p>even an American knows that&#x27;s pretty damn fast   now that&#x27;s fast enough in all cases folks to  if Ross and I had been inside that Tic Tac we   would have been splattered all over the inside  of it um so yeah that&#x27;s fast I I think that   I think we&#x27;ve lost sight of the fact I really  think we&#x27;ve lost sight of the fact that those   Revelations to this day despite the noble  efforts of Mick West and Meadowbank and all of   the debunkers and Skeptics I still haven&#x27;t in My </p>
<p>Views satisfactorily resolved the fact that there   is a data stream that comes from that incident and  all of the other incidents where Witnesses who are   technical experts are saying they saw things  that are known human technology are impossible   craft intelligently controlled doing impossible  things right so so let me try to put in context   the history to the the the sort of the fifth  anniversary thing uh back in 1947 after those   events there was a general Nathan Twining who was </p>
<p>asked to look into this and he wrote a report a   memo that went up the chain of command and it was  not shared with the public in the 40s or 50s but   Twining said in his memo uh the the phenomenon  is not is something real and is not Visionary or   fictitious so we just plain out said it&#x27;s real now  we didn&#x27;t learn about that until it was released   I think it was foia but it might have been  another way it came out but that memo came out   decades later all right and so the government was </p>
<p>perfectly happy to be getting reports through the   chain of command in the Pentagon but they weren&#x27;t  sharing it with anybody what what happened that   is so different the reason that that December 17th  is that dividing line is in those years since the   government itself well let me just back up when  we investigate a Project Blue Book from 1952 to   1969 that was the Air Force investigation and  their their basic premise was okay okay folks   we&#x27;ll look into this even though don&#x27;t worry about </p>
<p>it it&#x27;s not a national security issue and we don&#x27;t   even know if they&#x27;re real even though they did  know they were real okay what&#x27;s happened in that   dividing line is now that July or June 25th 19  2021 report that came out just last year basically   came out and said this is real same thing that  Twining said back in 47 75 years earlier so they   were admitting finally that it&#x27;s real and that  these things are in many cases got to be physical   that they&#x27;re intelligently controlled and they </p>
<p>don&#x27;t think we make them or that China or Russia   makes them and they&#x27;re not drones all right so we  have made massive progress in that we&#x27;re at least   admitting uh what the reality of the situation  is now I happen to believe that anyone who has   studied this for 75 years like the U.S government  and our military with the billions and trillions   of dollars they&#x27;ve had across the board given  that this was real they&#x27;ve spent quite a large   amount of money and time investigating they just </p>
<p>haven&#x27;t shared their work with us but that seems   to be the motivating factor for why Congress is  upset and passing legislation these days to get   to the answers because I believe it seems like  concert Congress has said we&#x27;re not happy that   we have not been constitutionally briefed on a  matter of this uh magnitude and so now they&#x27;re   demanding it to me that is if I had to say what  is the change that makes the most uh difference   that&#x27;s it that now we&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re real out </p>
<p>loud and the argument isn&#x27;t about reality it&#x27;s   about trying to Define what it is and I think  that&#x27;s a big change there are so many moments   that I think Mark the progress of Admissions  and Stepping Stones uh both before and since   that epocal 2017 New York Times story I think one  for me was the series of intelligence officials   government officials who made and I think these  have kind of been overlooked quite extraordinary   comments James Clapper the former dni Defense </p>
<p>Director of National Intelligence um I think it&#x27;s   really important he said that whenever we witness  such phenomena that it&#x27;s recorded and documented   could there be life out there sure um I don&#x27;t know  why we haven&#x27;t been more transparent about it in   the past former Director of National Intelligence  John Ratcliffe there are a lot more sightings than   have been made public we&#x27;re talking about objects  that frankly engage in actions that are different   difficult to explain movements that are hard to </p>
<p>replicate that we don&#x27;t have the technology for   traveling at speeds that exceed the sound barrier  without a sonic boom sometimes we wonder whether   our adversaries have technologies that are  a little bit further down the road than we   realized it&#x27;s not just a pilot or just a satellite  or some intelligence collection we have multiple   sensors that are picking up these things and  then one of my personal favorites which I noticed   just recently people are trying to play Down the </p>
<p>current director of National Intelligence for the   United States the intelligence tsar of the United  States Avril Haynes the main issues she says that   Congress and others have been concerned about is  safety of flight concerns and counterintelligence   issues always there&#x27;s the question of is there  something else that we simply do not understand   which might come extra terrestrially yeah  now I noticed recently the debunkers have   basically tried to say oh she was just talking </p>
<p>about stuff from outer space not necessarily   aliens we&#x27;re not talking about aliens but she&#x27;s  suggesting the Director of National Intelligence   for the United States is overtly suggesting it  might be extraterrestrial and just to round up   my friend because you quoted from a beautiful  quote from 1947 my quote from that era that I   love he&#x27;s one of my heroes the first director  of the CIA Roscoe hillenkotter Admiral Roscoe   hillenkotta Roscoe said way back then he said it </p>
<p>is time for the truth to be brought out behind   the scenes high-ranking Air Force officers are  soberly concerned about UFOs but through official   secrecy and ridicule many citizens are led to  believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense   and that was 70 years ago 70 years ago he said  that and they&#x27;ve all been saying the same thing   these people it&#x27;s time we knew what they knew just  I believe Helen Carter said that in 1960 after he   left office and was working with nycap so I don&#x27;t </p>
<p>know what my math is but it might be right yeah   um yeah you&#x27;re right you know because we sort  of promised we were going to go down memory   lane on this uh on what has happened in the last  five years I thought also because I&#x27;m looking at   the time and I know we&#x27;re long and we&#x27;ve got to  start thinking about wrapping up so why don&#x27;t we   each take a crack at just some of our Memory Lane  moments of the last five years I will put 1947 in   the 50s and 60s aside um I&#x27;ll go first with just </p>
<p>some of the thoughts from from those years the   to the Stars Academy big deal Tom Delong turned  out to be not just a crazy rock star the report   of June 25th 2021 called the preliminary  report on unidentified aerial phenomena big   deal a congressional hearing on May 17 2022 this  year uh where of course it wasn&#x27;t the greatest   Congressional hearing but it was the first in  some 50 years the fact that we&#x27;re supposed to   get another one coming up and they&#x27;re supposed to </p>
<p>be delivering a report to US every year on October   31st here&#x27;s some other just moments that happened  uh in those five years 60 Minutes broke its own   self-imposed embargo on covering the UFO story and  did a major story on UAP where Elizondo and melon   and others were interviewed Harry Reid after the  article came out and was more outspoken than ever   before but in addition to a Senator Harry Reid  talking about that he gave way to other Senators   like Jola Brandon and Rubio who have talked </p>
<p>about it and even Romney who is very specific   we&#x27;ve heard from a pilot uh David fraver Alex  Dietrich um and and many others uh an incredible   film came out the phenomenon by James Fox which  I recommend for anyone who wants to tell their   friends just watch this give it two hours and then  we&#x27;ll talk um all the people that you talked about   Ross uh that that have spoken who are uh in the  Intel Community a personal uh one for me is I&#x27;m   so glad to see that NASA NASA has actually said </p>
<p>they&#x27;re going to look into this and they&#x27;re going   to get back to us in nine months now I don&#x27;t know  whether they&#x27;re going to write the most revealing   report ever written or not but for years and years  NASA has said we don&#x27;t do UFOs we don&#x27;t do that we   don&#x27;t talk about that and now of course they&#x27;ve  got a leader who is saying that we do talk about   it so these things are happening there&#x27;s there&#x27;s  meetings all over the world going on they just had   a meeting in France uh they they&#x27;ve had a big one </p>
<p>in in Italy recently I mean let&#x27;s face it um this   is not a a slow-moving train anymore it&#x27;s a faster  moving train and I know some people are frustrated   like myself that it hasn&#x27;t got to its destination  yet but there&#x27;s no question to me that that train   is moving and it seems to be moving in the right  direction the fact that they&#x27;re going to throw a   few things on the tracks to stop it or slow it  down well I expect that but I I think the train   will still make it to the state there you go Bryce </p>
<p>you&#x27;re like my therapist you&#x27;ve cheered me up   there I was getting all despondent about whether  or not we&#x27;re actually going to see anything from   the Congress and you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve made me optimistic  again now there&#x27;s a few I agreed I agreed with   your summary there of the key moments there&#x27;s  a few more I&#x27;d like to add because they&#x27;re just   fun my favorite that I think we&#x27;re going to see a  lot more of is slide nine this is the slide that   a lot of people have overlooked but I I think it&#x27;s </p>
<p>incredibly important which was obtained from Chris   melon&#x27;s website it was essentially a document that  I suspect he&#x27;d put on his website for somebody to   download and he&#x27;d forgotten to take it down and  it basically says the science exists for an enemy   of the United States to manipulate both physical  and cognitive environments in order to penetrate   U.S facilities influence decision makers and  compromise National Security it talked about   psychotronic Weaponry penetration of Solid </p>
<p>Surfaces instantaneous sensor disassembly   alteration and manipulation of biological  organisms anomalies in the space-time construct   whatever it is slide 9 is referring to something  that the defense department of the United States   is taking extremely seriously indeed and the  government&#x27;s Silence about the implications   of this document is deafening the other  thing that I wanted to point to my friend is   one of my favorite quotes from one of your former </p>
<p>presidents Barrack Obama and Barack Obama actually   admitted on television what is true and I&#x27;m  actually being serious here is that there are   there&#x27;s footage and records of objects in the  skies that we don&#x27;t know exactly what they are   we can&#x27;t explain how they moved their trajectory  they did not have an easily explainable pattern   and so you know I think that people still  take seriously trying to investigate what   that is it&#x27;s very very important concession from </p>
<p>a former president who as you know gets briefed   private briefings he&#x27;s entitled to be given the  very very secret top secret SCI briefings that   a president gets and he&#x27;s getting them and so  is Bill Clinton and as Bill Clinton said if we   were visited one day I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised  I just hope it&#x27;s not like Independence Day well as I think we can all uh agree with the  Clinton I mean a lot there are half the people in   the country that don&#x27;t like Bill Clinton but you </p>
<p>got to agree he&#x27;s right we all hope at a hundred   percent that it&#x27;s not like Independence Day uh  yeah but the Barack Obama thing is fascinating   because you know in every other instance he&#x27;d ever  been asked about it he seemed to make light of it   he he was dismissed particularly when he was in  office but even after he got out of office and   something changed this year this year is when  Barack Obama said I&#x27;m going to start talking   about the real thing um I got something I just </p>
<p>want to float here it&#x27;s so out of left field   are we sort of done with our summation can I throw  something out yeah yeah okay I reckon we&#x27;ve given   ourselves enough room for optimism my friend I  think so um and by the way I just want to point   one other thing out I was reading some of the  comments on some of our past shows and because   our last one was like two and a half weeks ago  some people were saying uh you know where are   these guys did somebody shut them down and a </p>
<p>couple of people were saying you know uh we&#x27;ve   been silenced because we were speaking too openly  no we&#x27;re we haven&#x27;t been silenced we&#x27;re just busy   and and we we you know we we&#x27;re we&#x27;re committed  to every two weeks kind of podcast occasionally   it slips a few days but we have not I&#x27;ve not  been silenced have you been silenced no sir I&#x27;m   still waiting for those Men In Black to come in  and tell me not to do it but uh no look frankly   both you and I to be honest we were waiting for </p>
<p>the 31st of October report and the report that   never came that I suspect may never come oh it&#x27;s  got it correctly it&#x27;s gonna come it&#x27;s gonna come   and I I absolutely think it&#x27;s coming and I also  um I have the October 31st report is what leads   me to my crazy idea I&#x27;m just going to float it  out there and see if anybody uh can respond to it   um what I thought was going to happen is that they  were going to deliver the October 31st report on   the day that they said they would and and that </p>
<p>that was eight days before the election and I   thought if you put out a report about National  Security that says there are the things flying   around and put a little more meat on the bones  than the previous report that might actually get   into the election uh because let&#x27;s face it the  one thing that hasn&#x27;t really happened is UFOs   don&#x27;t get talked about in a political sense so  here&#x27;s my idea somebody should in the next year   decide they&#x27;re going to run for president and they </p>
<p>it&#x27;d be great if gillibrand or Rubio did on this   topic but they probably won&#x27;t but somebody should  go to New Hampshire and Iowa when these are going   to be the states that are the first voting States  and all you have to do if I&#x27;m not mistaken in New   Hampshire is get five percent in the polls uh  in order to be included in the debates I think   someone of some credibility they don&#x27;t have to  be you know they&#x27;re not going to get elected   president but they could get five percent in the </p>
<p>polls in New Hampshire and they could get included   in those presidential debates and they could  talk about this topic with other candidates and   forced the election to start talking about this so  that&#x27;s my idea whoever&#x27;s out there listening to us   who&#x27;s got the wherewithal to run for president  moved to New Hampshire in the next six months   and start campaigning and then we&#x27;ll get this  into debates and we&#x27;ll move this topic ahead   oh my God I I want to conclude my </p>
<p>friend with what I am hearing which is   there are hearings already happening on the  hill there are congressional briefings that   are happening that have been happening for  some of these very sensitive committees in   Skiffs uh you know secure compartmentalized  information facilities where people can give   evidence knowing that they&#x27;re not being bugged  monitored and also I think we need to acknowledge   that there is momentous legislation coming </p>
<p>in both the National Defense authorization   act bill that&#x27;s before the Congress and also  the intelligence authorization act and it put   together if these two pieces of legislation  go through the house as does appear likely   I think the revelations about uaps are almost  inevitable my one concern about the legislation   is it&#x27;s very focused on briefing Congress quite  properly it&#x27;s very focused on making sure that   the proper form the proper transparency has been </p>
<p>shown to those congressional oversight committees   like the house intelligence committee or the  in the armed services committee but it&#x27;s not   stipulating categorically that the public will be  informed now that&#x27;s one of the reasons why we call   this show need to know because the public needs  to know and I hope Congress doesn&#x27;t forget that   I listen here&#x27;s the thing Congress um I have I  don&#x27;t begrudge Congress having secret meetings   to talk about National Security issues right um </p>
<p>I think that what the body politic would like to   see happen though is an acknowledgment that they  are doing that and and for us to at least be told   imagine this disclosure as I&#x27;ve often said is not  like we&#x27;re going to give a gigabyte Drive full   of photos and videos to every reporter that&#x27;s not  going to happen that disclosure but I don&#x27;t think   it&#x27;s wrong to on an issue of this magnitude that  needs to come out because it&#x27;s been buried for so   long to Simply acknowledge the reality of it </p>
<p>and say they&#x27;re not ours and uh it&#x27;s another   intelligence that&#x27;s that we&#x27;re not 100 sure  where it&#x27;s from and we&#x27;re looking into it that&#x27;s   what I expect my government to do I expect your  government to do the same thing I expect World   governments if we are being visited or there is  a non-human intelligence that&#x27;s operating in our   skies and seas I expect the governments of the  world to look into it to do prudent things and I   don&#x27;t necessarily expect to be briefed on every </p>
<p>single aspect of what planes are seeing what at   what time but I&#x27;d like a couple of things I would  like you to admit that that this is real and you   are looking into it and I would like a couple  of good photos and a video that would make me   happy I would call that the Christmas present of  all time and I would have a wonderful holiday I   don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to happen but it ought to  happen oh look I&#x27;ve got faith in the capacity of   Congress to leak I mean even the incredible Church </p>
<p>committee hearings that took place a lot of them   in secret in the 1970s investigating the alleged  Crimes of the CIA after Watergate a lot of that   information eventually leaked even though it was  disclosed in confidence in some of the Committees   a lot of it was done in public but there were  some really embarrassing stuff that finally made   it out into the public Arena what I understand is  happening is if there is recovered technology if   it really is the case that the United States as </p>
<p>we&#x27;ve been led to believe is sitting on recovered   technology as by the way the New York Times  reported in 2020 the world&#x27;s you know the the   nation&#x27;s most illustrious newspaper has put it on  record that there are people saying that the U.S   has recovered alien craft which was another big  event in the in the history that we overlooked   if that&#x27;s the case I can understand why there&#x27;s  a willingness to suppress that knowledge because   frankly if you can Master the technology behind </p>
<p>those craft if you can if you can find out how to   derive awesome energy if you can find out how to  develop extraordinary propulsion systems weapons   you would want to keep that secret but I don&#x27;t  think that the American government is being honest   with the people if it continues to try to suppress  its knowledge of what it does know about the UAP   mystery so let&#x27;s wrap up with it one thought you  brought it up just now crash wreckage when I was   a kid I I read stories about crashed saucers and I </p>
<p>remember uh thinking well that&#x27;s insane but that&#x27;s   sure fun to read about but it couldn&#x27;t possibly  be happening right uh now we&#x27;re hearing from very   credible people uh both you and I and many other  people have heard it that crash and luellizondo   has said it that crash wreckage is definitely on  the table so probably in the next year or two or   three uh crash wreckages out there we&#x27;re going to  be looking into it and uh let&#x27;s face it that&#x27;s not   a Smoking Gun that&#x27;s a smoking Howitzer and uh </p>
<p>it&#x27;ll be fascinating when that happens but like   I said hasn&#x27;t happened yet it&#x27;s going to happen in  the future which is why Ross you and I are going   to have to keep doing the show absolutely well I  don&#x27;t want to stop it&#x27;s fun I mean the thing that   really astonishes me about this is here I am I&#x27;m a  mainstream news reporter television public affairs   reporter and it just amazes me because I&#x27;ve been  given the privilege by the network I do work for   in Australia to be able to do some digging into </p>
<p>the UAP issue and I just look over my shoulder   all the time and go where&#x27;s the rest of the media  why aren&#x27;t they chasing the story it&#x27;s the biggest   story ever as I said at the head of the program  and we are looking at momentous legislation coming   down the track with the defense authorization act  I mean we are we are seeing an accounting of all   UAP activity the legislation wants information on  all UAP logged outside the last year as well they   want a full accounting to the Congress formal </p>
<p>analyzes of those account of those encounters   signals intelligence geospatial intelligence  human intelligence signals intelligence it&#x27;s   actually quite quite amazing as Billy Cox wrote  in a brilliant column recently you know The   Gatekeepers might start vomiting in their Skiffs  over the next provision which is that Congress   is demanding an enumeration of any instances in  which data relating to UFOs was not provided to   the odni because of classification restrictions </p>
<p>on that data this is on the record if it goes   through this legislation is momentous and there  are grounds for optimism and full credit frankly   to the people who&#x27;ve pushed for this legislation  to come through like Louis zondo Chris Mellon no   matter what people choose to say about them and  disparage them online they&#x27;re following through   with what they pledged they were going to do  you know Ross I think a good place to leave this   is with the Moment of Zen that you have just </p>
<p>laid out for us so folks if you&#x27;re listening   Ross just said it here&#x27;s your Moment of Zen  I want you to think about this for a moment   Gatekeepers vomiting in their Skiffs I mean  wow Gatekeepers vomit that&#x27;s the title of my   next screenplay by the way Ross it&#x27;s going to  be called Gatekeepers vomiting in their skips   I think it&#x27;ll be a big hit uh listen folks uh if  it&#x27;s been always fun to do this Ross uh you&#x27;re my   you&#x27;re my uh furthest away best friend I really </p>
<p>love doing this and for you folks at home I I   end as I always do and I say we can handle the  truth People Get Ready because we need to know okay</p>
