            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the deep dive. This is where we take dense information, roll up our sleeves, and uh really help you get informed quickly. Exactly. And we&#x27;re continuing our big exploration of the manual of patent examining procedure, the MPP, right? The MPP, that official guide to well, basically how the USPTO works. Yep.</p>
<p>This whole series, it&#x27;s really designed to help you understand the structure, the rules, the specific procedures that guide patent examination right here in the US. And today specifically, we&#x27;re diving into chapter 700 that covers the examination of applications. And we&#x27;re zeroing in on one particular section, MP section 724. Okay. Section 724.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the focus there? It tackles a really um a fascinating and often quite tricky situation. What happens when you have information that&#x27;s absolutely critical for your patent application? Maybe it prove your invention works or it helps define what&#x27;s new. But and here&#x27;s the catch, that information is also highly sensitive. Ah, sensitive like trade secrets. Exactly.</p>
<p>Trade secrets, proprietary data, maybe documents covered by protective orders, that kind of stuff. Okay. I see the tension immediately because on one hand, the whole patent system is built on disclosure, right? Transparency. Generally, anything you submit eventually becomes public record, right? That&#x27;s the default. But then you&#x27;ve got this totally legitimate need to keep certain business information confidential.</p>
<p>It feels like a direct conflict. It really is. an MPP section 724. Well, it lays out the specific procedural framework the USPTO uses to try and navigate that exact tension. So, it&#x27;s about balancing things.</p>
<p>Yeah. Balancing the public&#x27;s eventual right to understand why a patent was granted with an applicant&#x27;s need to protect sensitive information during the examination process, at least for a time. Gotcha. So our mission for this deep dive is to really understand how the MPP says you handle that sensitive info, what happens to it inside the USPTO and crucially when that confidentiality might uh give way to public access. Sounds good.</p>
<p>And let&#x27;s start with the foundation, the principle that really underpins everything in this section which is the duty of disclosure. Ah yes. Yeah. The bedrock principle as they say. What does that duty actually require? Well, under the rules, think 37 CFR 1.56 to 1.555 inventors, their attorneys, anyone really involved substantively in the application process.</p>
<p>They have a duty to disclose all information they know about that is material to patentability. All information. Yeah. Okay. But what if that information is a secret? Is there like a carveout? Can you say, &quot;Sorry, USPTO.</p>
<p>This is our secret sauce. Can&#x27;t show you.&quot; Absolutely not. And this is the critical point. The MPP hammers home. The duty to disclose material information applies regardless of its confidential or proprietary nature.</p>
<p>Regardless, wow. You simply cannot withhold information just because it&#x27;s a trade secret if it&#x27;s material to whether or not your invention can be patented. And if you did withhold it, big problems. Failing to disclose material information, even if it&#x27;s confidential, can seriously compromise the integrity of the whole examination. It could even potentially invalidate any pattern that comes out of it.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&#x27;s crystal clear. The duty to disclose material info is non-negotiable. You have to hand over the secret if it&#x27;s relevant. That puts inventors in a bit of a tough spot though, doesn&#x27;t it? If you have this critical confidential piece of information, Yeah. and you submit it without just, you know, tossing it onto the public pile immediately.</p>
<p>Right. And that&#x27;s exactly where MP section 724 steps in. It provides a specific procedural path designed precisely for this scenario. It acknowledges the sensitivity by giving you a specific mechanism for submission. A mechanism.</p>
<p>Okay. How does that work? What do you actually do? The MPP says you should submit these sensitive materials in sealed envelopes. Sealed envelopes. Really? In like the age of electronic filing. That sounds almost quaint.</p>
<p>It might seem that way, but it&#x27;s the specified procedure to immediately flag the sensitive nature of the contents. And these aren&#x27;t just any old envelopes. They need special handling. They need appropriate labels. labels that clearly identify the content.</p>
<p>The MPP even gives examples, label them trade, secret, proprietary, or subject to protective order. So, you&#x27;re not trying to hide it within the application. You&#x27;re explicitly flagging it as sensitive right on the outside. Precisely. And there&#x27;s more.</p>
<p>You also need to include a transmitt letter, a cover letter. Yeah. Basically, a transmitt letter that specifically identifies the sensitive material inside that sealed envelope. It tells the office exactly what&#x27;s in there and why it&#x27;s being submitted this way. And the label on the envelope itself, does it need other details? Yes, good point.</p>
<p>Specific examples mentioned for labeling the envelope include clearly marking it with the application number and the title of the invention. You know, the basics to make sure it gets correctly matched up with the right file right from the start. Okay. So, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve done all that. You&#x27;ve got your sealed envelope properly labeled with the transmitt letter.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve submitted this sensitive potentially material information. What happens next inside the USPTO? Does it just get locked away in a vault? Well, first the materials may be temporarily sealed when they&#x27;re received. The mail room staff or whoever handles initial processing, they&#x27;re alerted by those labels. Then the USPAO, usually the examiner, will review the materials. The main goal of this review to determine their relevance, specifically their materiality to patentability.</p>
<p>And this is the crucial step, isn&#x27;t it? That materiality determination that decides what happens to it. This is where it gets really interesting, and it&#x27;s probably the most critical takeaway from section 724. If the materials are deemed material to patentability, meaning the examiner relied on them or they influence the decision. Exactly. If they were material, then that information becomes part of the public record once the patent is allowed to issue or publishes.</p>
<p>Ah, so the ceiling is temporary. It protects the information during the examination phase. But if it&#x27;s actually critical to getting the patent grant, that info has to eventually become public knowledge. That&#x27;s the fundamental bargain of the patent system. Really, the public needs to be able to understand the basis on which the patent was granted.</p>
<p>Makes sense. But you mentioned an alternative path. What if the materials are reviewed and they&#x27;re found not to be material, right? So, if the examiner looks at it and decides, okay, this is sensitive, but it wasn&#x27;t actually necessary for deciding patentability, then the secret can stay secret. Potentially, yes. If the materials are deemed non-material and this is important and you the applicant filed a timely petition requesting expungement.</p>
<p>Expunement like removing it. Yes. Asking for it to be removed from the record. That petition is under 37 CFR 1.59 and you have to pay the associated fee. If you did all that and the info is found non-material, then the materials may be permanently removed from the application file.</p>
<p>Okay. So expungement isn&#x27;t automatic and it&#x27;s mainly for stuff that in the end turned out not to be essential for the patentability decision. That&#x27;s the gist of it. It provides a way out for sensitive but ultimately non-material information. And uh just a procedural side note, the MPP mentions for petitions to expunge papers specifically in re-examination and supplemental examination proceedings.</p>
<p>Those petitions get decided over in the central re-examination unit. Good detail for those specific cases. Okay. So, even with the sealed envelope procedure, there are definitely limits on keeping things confidential. When do you know for sure that sensitive info is going public? The MPP is pretty clear on this.</p>
<p>If you explicitly use the sensitive materials as part of your arguments for patentability, like in your response to the examiner. Exactly. Or in amendments you make to the claims or in affidavits or declarations you submit to overcome rejections. If you use it offensively, so to speak, to argue for the patent, then it&#x27;s going public. Then it will be made public regardless of its sensitive nature.</p>
<p>Because by using it to actively support your patent claim, you&#x27;ve essentially made it part of the official justification for the patent itself. Precisely. The need for the public record to fully show the basis on which a patent was granted takes priority. If you lean on that secret data to convince the examiner, that data becomes part of the public file history. No way around it.</p>
<p>What about redacting? Can you like blank out just the super secret parts but leave the rest? The MPP does mention scenarios for potentially redacting or partially disclosing materials, but uh it&#x27;s quite limited. This is typically only allowed for non-material portions of the document, only the non-material bits, right? Sensitive data that doesn&#x27;t actually impact the patentability question. The part you leave visible must still satisfy whatever disclosure obligation you had. You absolutely cannot redact the material parts, the information the examiner needs or relies on. Okay, that clarifies things.</p>
<p>Protect the non-essential secrets if you can, but the secrets that actually prove your invention works or justify the patent claims, those have to be visible if they were material to the decision. Exactly. And it&#x27;s useful maybe to see how this specific process under section 724 fits into the bigger picture of US PTO confidentiality rules. Right. How does this differ from say the general rule that patent applications are kept secret before they publish? Good question.</p>
<p>So the general rule that&#x27;s under 35 USC 122A and 37 CFR 1.14. It basically says the entire unpublished application is kept in confidence. That&#x27;s like a blanket protection for the whole file before publication or issuance. Okay. MPP section 724 is different.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about specific sensitive information or documents submitted within an application. It focuses on how those pieces are handled based on their sensitive nature and their materiality, even if the application itself might eventually become public anyway. Got it. And what about filing a non-publication request that keeps the whole application secret longer? Yeah. Also different.</p>
<p>A non-publication request under 35USC12B is a way to prevent the whole application from automatically publishing 18 months after filing, usually because you haven&#x27;t filed abroad. All right. MPP section 724 isn&#x27;t about when the application publishes. It&#x27;s about handling specific content that you are required to submit because it&#x27;s material regardless of the application&#x27;s publication status. Are there other confidentiality rules this is separate from? Oh, sure.</p>
<p>For instance, think about national security stuff. Secrecy orders under 35 USC 181. That&#x27;s a whole different ballgame involving different procedures, different authorities, and it applies when an invention might be, you know, detrimental to national security. MPE section 724 is squarely focused on commercially sensitive information within a standard patent or re-examination process. And does the submission method matter? You mentioned sealed envelopes, which sounds like paper, but most filing is electronic now.</p>
<p>Yeah. While the sealed envelope language definitely points to physical submission, the underlying principles of section 724 apply regardless meaning the duty to disclose material information, the special handling procedures for flagged sensitive content and the outcome being determined by materiality. Those concepts hold true whether you submit electronically or on paper or even on say an optical disc for sequence data. The core rules about disclosure and public access based on materiality remain constant. The sealed envelope is just the specified procedural mechanism for handling physically delivered sensitive documents.</p>
<p>Okay. So, let&#x27;s circle back and sort of summarize. What does this all mean for you, the listener, if you&#x27;re navigating the patent system? Well, I think it brings up a really significant strategic consideration. If you have information that is material to patentability, but it&#x27;s also confidential. You face a very clear choice and the MPP enforces it.</p>
<p>And that choice is you absolutely cannot just withhold that material information. The duty of disclosure is paramount. Full stop. But the MPP does give you a formal way to handle it under section 724. The sealed envelope, the labels, the transmitt letter.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a procedure to submit the material while formally telling the office, hey, this is sensitive. Exactly. It gives you a channel and it buys you some, let&#x27;s call it temporary protection during the examination phase itself. Right. But the key takeaway, the thing you absolutely have to remember is the critical takeaway is that if that confidential information is ultimately found to be material, if it influenced the decision to grant your patent, it will become part of the public record when the patent issues.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the deal. And expungement. Expungement is a possibility, but remember, it&#x27;s primarily for information that turned out not to be material. And even then, you have to proactively petition for it and pay a fee. It&#x27;s not a guaranteed estate patch for material secrets.</p>
<p>It really does highlight that inherent tension, doesn&#x27;t it? That balancing act within the patent system. It wants to encourage innovation by offering patent protection. But it demands a complete and accurate public record in return, especially for the very information that just survives granting that powerful monopoly right. Yeah. Which sort of leaves you, the listener, with a pretty profound question to ponder, doesn&#x27;t it? I think so.</p>
<p>Knowing that your material confidential information, maybe your core trade secret, might have to become public knowledge as part of getting a patent, how does that risk fundamentally shape the decision inventors and companies make? Do you go for the patent and risk disclosure or do you try to keep it purely as a trade secret and forego patent protection altogether? That&#x27;s a big one. A very big strategic decision. Well, this has been incredibly helpful. And before we wrap up, a big thanks to Mike Shepard, our creative director, who&#x27;s been organizing this entire audio series covering the MPE. Absolutely.</p>
<p>And uh just the necessary reminder for everyone listening, this summary of the MPE was generated using AI tools. It might contain errors or emissions. It&#x27;s really just for general educational andformational purposes. Right? It is definitely not legal advice or a substitute for formal instruction. For the authoritative guidance, you always need to consult the official MPE document itself, talk to a qualified instructor, or speak with a registered patent practitioner.</p>
<p>Please do. Thanks for joining us for this deep dive into MPP section 724. We&#x27;ll catch you on the next one.</p>
