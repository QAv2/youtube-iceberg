            <p>The jogan Experience one of the things that I want to talk to you about is the JFK files and one of the things that you said was that if they showed you what they showed me this was your quote you wouldn&#x27;t want people to know it either um so I I opened them up partially I was met with from good people I mean you know look at me good people people that were well-meaning M Pompeo was one of them he&#x27;s a good person uh they called me they said sir would rather have you not after and I did open them but I was asked by some people not to open them there&#x27;s a Martin Luther King file too by the way that they&#x27;d like to see I don&#x27;t know if you know but there is that but but JFK in particular so they call me a lot of good people called me people that I you know that you would find reasonable people and they asked me not to do it so I said well we&#x27;ll close it for another time but if I win I&#x27;m going to open them up I&#x27;m just going to open enough time why didn&#x27;t you open it up the first time a lot of was the hesitation though uh addresses people that are still living there are people that are affected um and there could be some National Security reason that for you know that I don&#x27;t have to necessarily know about but some very good talented people asked me not to do it uh I opened it up and then they said would it be possible for us to do that a different day what how much of it did you read into uh uh I think it&#x27;s going to be just fine to open it let me put it that way I think it&#x27;s fine it&#x27;s going to be time it&#x27;s a cleansing you know it&#x27;s really a cleansing so I&#x27;m going to do it I&#x27;m going to do it immediately almost immediately upon entering office well the thing when people look at it from the outside and you sort of imagine what could be a reason why they would not release those files it would be there&#x27;s people that were implicated the assassination yeah well when there are living people you generally tend not to want to do it when people are still living living people that formerly work for the government for the government and living people that were somehow involved in it and you tend not to do that but it&#x27;s time to open them um I can&#x27;t tell you whether or not uh they&#x27;re going to find anything of interest and I did partially open I think I I&#x27;ve opened 50% but I was asked not to do it and I I I thought that was a reasonable ask but now I&#x27;m going to do it I&#x27;m going to do it very soon there&#x27;s a lot of interest in it one of the things that there&#x27;s a lot of interest in the the uh people coming from space you know yes and I know you&#x27;re interested in that oh I&#x27;m very interested in that how much did they tell you about that a lot really yeah what&#x27; they tell you how much can you tell so I how&#x27;s that work is it like super top secret tell you know well based on Hunter Biden I can say whatever hell I want right but no but I interviewed a few people it&#x27;s never been my thing I have to be be honest I I have never been a Believer I have people that area 51 or whatever it is I think it&#x27;s the number one tourist attraction in the whole country or something Area 51 at do you know that right sure I know what it is so anyway but it&#x27;s a big tourist thing so I interviewed jet Pilots that say they saw something if you saw them you&#x27;d love to have them as you I&#x27;ve had a couple in here Commander David fraver I had him in who had that sighting in 2004 very very compelling visual video evidence radar evidence I inter Brian graes I don&#x27;t believe his name but I I interviewed jet Pilots that uh were solid people the perfect I mean great Pilots great everything and they said we saw things sir that were were very strange like a round ball but it wasn&#x27;t a comet or a meteor it was something and it was going four times faster than an F-22 which is a very fast plan you know and it was round um which isn&#x27;t in theory a great shape so when you were talking to these people was was this something that you were compelled to have conversations about was this your personal interest a little bit it it&#x27;s not a great interest for me but it&#x27;s a little interest I get that question as much as almost any question do you think that we have aliens coming you know flying around or whatever what do you think there&#x27;s no reason not to I mean there&#x27;s no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don&#x27;t have life you know because well Mars we&#x27;ve had probes there and Rovers I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any life there well maybe it&#x27;s life that we don&#x27;t know but maybe well maybe there was life there at one point in time this is the speculation about Mars that Mars had an atmosphere at one point in time a long time ago that could support life it ALS also had large bodies of water but we&#x27;ve had no evidence of even bacterial life that exists on Mars but the universe is big thing for me I mean when I looked at what China did to this ad they would have never done it with me where they put the balloon up and a lot of people thought and a lot of people thought for a little while that that was one of these things well that&#x27;s a lot of the speculation too that some of these drones that hover over battleships that these are Chinese drones and that they&#x27;re not UFOs could be also there&#x27;s some super sophistic I did interview a let&#x27;s say three or four guys that and without tremendous interest if you had them as I said you&#x27;d love to have them as your children solid beautiful people they said sir there&#x27;s something there you know they&#x27; there&#x27;s something they said it yeah yeah I&#x27;ve talked to quite a few of them they&#x27;re not conspiracy guys well I mean the just the commander David fraver thing in 2004 off the coast of San Diego they clocked that thing going from 50,000 ft above sea level to 50 in a second yeah they don&#x27;t know what it is that&#x27;s tough to beat yeah they they saw something in the water it was hovering over that something that was making a disturbance in the water they got video evidence of this thing the two different fighter jets with pilots in them saw it there&#x27;s you know Visual Evidence photographic evidence video evidence radar evidence whatever the hell it is it moves in a way that would turn a human being into Jello if they inside of it the GeForce no one would survive so like what is that and we don&#x27;t they it doesn&#x27;t have a heat signature they don&#x27;t know what their propulsion system was but when you fly in some of these jets these Pilots have to be in great shape oh yeah I flew with the Blue Angels once yeah I got to fly I guess and those are older machines and they&#x27;re crazy when you when you fly in some of these things amazing yeah but imagine you got to be special</p>
