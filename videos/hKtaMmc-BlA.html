            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Hey everyone listening in Deer Park, Leaport, and Pasadena. Thanks for joining us for another deep dive here on Think and Act Locally. You know, we&#x27;re all about giving you the info you need to make a difference right here in our community. That&#x27;s right. And today, well, we&#x27;re going down a rabbit hole asking a pretty wild question.</p>
<p>What if the answers to some of our biggest problems like energy are already solved? What if they&#x27;re just hidden away? Yeah. It&#x27;s like, are we missing out on something big? Exactly. So, we stumbled across this YouTube video, right, from Value Tamement called Invention Secrecy Act of 1951. Exposed. Why are they hiding 6,000 patents from you? Catchy title, right? Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>It definitely grabs your attention. 6,000 patents though. Makes you wonder what&#x27;s in there. For sure. And that&#x27;s kind of our mission today, you know, to unpack this video, see what jumps out of us, what questions it raises for you, especially about how we innovate, how we move forward right here in Southeast Houston.</p>
<p>Sounds good. Where do we start? Well, the video starts by laying out the scale of the energy industry, right? Like in 2022, oil and gas was worth, get this, $5 trillion. Five trillion. That&#x27;s huge. It&#x27;s mindblowing.</p>
<p>And then boom, they hit you with the projected cost of going green, like reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Bloomberg says 196 trillion. McKenzie says 275 trillion. Some Swiss group even says 23 trillion every single year. Whoa.</p>
<p>That puts things in perspective, right? And then they ask, &quot;What if the tech to do this cheaper, easier, already exists?&quot; Right? Like maybe the system&#x27;s so big, so entrenched that it&#x27;s blocking real change. Interesting point. Like, are we stuck in our ways? Could be. And here&#x27;s where it hits home for us, right? The video breaks down energy costs in the US. In 2021, we spent 1.3 trillion on energy, like nationwide.</p>
<p>So, that&#x27;s a lot of money. A ton. Yeah. And per person, it&#x27;s almost 4,000 bucks a year. Then you add in average utility bills like close to seven grand plus another 2,000 or so on gas for the car.</p>
<p>Yeah, that adds up quick. And you know, average salary is about 59,000. So energy is a big chunk of anyone&#x27;s budget. No kidding. Plus, the video says the biggest investments needed for this green shift, they&#x27;re happening like right now, this decade.</p>
<p>So these hidden technologies, if they&#x27;re real, they could really matter to our wallets like today. Makes sense. So, who are some of these inventors with these hidden technologies? Well, the video dives into this guy, Stanley Meyer, who claimed he built a car that ran on water. On water? Really? Yeah. This documentary on Amazon, The Lost Century, says Meer thought he could drive coast to coast on like 22 gallons of water.</p>
<p>Wow. That&#x27;s uh hard to believe. I know, right? And it gets weirder. The documentary says Meyer thought he was poisoned at a dinner with some investors and then bam, he died. Officially, it was a brain aneurysm, but h suspicious, right? The video also mentions another invention of his, one that supposedly broke the second law of thermodynamics, like created energy from nothing.</p>
<p>Pretty much it supposedly ran on nothing. The video even talks about how something like that would be impossible to sell, you know, because it wouldn&#x27;t use up any resources. Yeah. Who to pay for something that ran on nothing? Exactly. So Meyer had this electromagnetic device shaped like a donut and the government slapped a national security order on it.</p>
<p>The video suggests that Meyer messed with his patent application on purpose to keep people from stealing it or classifying it, you know, from his past experiences. So he didn&#x27;t trust anyone. Sounds like it. And this leads to the whole idea of zero energy devices which tap into this omnipresent energy. The video even quotes Nicola Tesla.</p>
<p>If you want to find the secret of the universe, think energy, frequency, and vibration. Deep stuff. Yeah, for sure. But what happened to Meyer and his inventions in the end? Well, that&#x27;s the big question, isn&#x27;t it? The video kind of leaves you hanging, wondering if there&#x27;s more to the story. There&#x27;s always more to the story.</p>
<p>Definitely. So, going back in time a bit, the video talks about some early inventors whose technologies might have been suppressed. One is a guy named Stubblefield from way back in 1898. He patented something called an Earth Battery. An earth battery.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s that? Basically, it was this coil you put in the ground. And it supposedly pulled extra power from the earth itself to help power whatever it was hooked up to. Like free energy from the ground. Exactly. And get this, it also worked as the power source and the ground for early wireless telephones.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s pretty innovative for the 1800s, right? It&#x27;s like a lost piece of tech history. So, what about Tesla? Did he have any potentially suppressed inventions? Oh, yeah. The video brings him up again. this time with his Pierce Aero electric car from 1921. Supposedly, it ran on something he called pure etheric electricity and could recharge itself.</p>
<p>A self-charging car, that would change everything, right? The video points out that if you have a car that never needs gas or plugging in, the whole business model of selling fuel, it just crumbles. Makes sense. So, was this just a theory or was there any proof it worked? Well, the video mentions a newspaper article from Phoenix in 1921 talking about a car running on electricity pulled from the air. So maybe not so far-fetched back then. Interesting.</p>
<p>And we all know about Tesla&#x27;s obsession with wireless power. Wasn&#x27;t JP Morgan involved in that? Yeah. He initially funded Tesla to build a global wireless communication system. Yeah. But Tesla being Tesla, he wanted to transmit energy wirelessly, too.</p>
<p>Ambitious guy. No kidding. And in 1932, he announced he&#x27;d figured out how to use cosmic rays to create power. The idea was to ionize the air, release energy, and use that to power a motor, like constantly without needing batteries for storage, unlike solar or wind. So unlimited clean energy everywhere.</p>
<p>Exactly. And the video suggests this is where things went south. When Tesla asked for more money to develop this, JP Morgan backed out. Why would we do that? Well, the video implies that Morgan had a lot invested in traditional energy. you know, companies like GE, AT&amp;T, even copper mines.</p>
<p>Tesla&#x27;s free energy would have been bad for business. So Morgan shut him down. The video says he even discouraged other investors and that led to Tesla losing his Warden Cliff Tower. You know, that big lab of his. It paints this picture of powerful people like Morgan, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt protecting their interests in the old energy system.</p>
<p>Makes you think it does. And then to add to the mystery, when Tesla died, a lot of his documents vanished. Out of 80 boxes of research, they only found 60. And the FBI, get this, they ordered all his stuff to be given to the Department of Defense. Seriously, that&#x27;s like straight out of a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>I know, right? It just fuels the idea that there was something big being hidden. Definitely. So, what about these other inventors mentioned in the video? Oh, yeah. There&#x27;s a bunch. Like this guy, Charles Pogue, in the 1930s, he made a carburetor that was tested on a Ford V8 and supposedly it got something crazy like 26 mp gallon on just one pint of gas.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s like over 200 miles per gallon. Exactly. And the video says Ford and Canadian automotive magazines even reported similar numbers like 200 to 218 millipoggrams. And guess what? Oil company stocks supposedly dropped when this news came out. Hm.</p>
<p>I bet they didn&#x27;t like that. Probably not. And then guess what else? Pog&#x27;s workshop was robbed and later he ended up working for, you guessed it, an oil company. Wow. What are the chances, right? It&#x27;s like a pattern.</p>
<p>promising tech, then it disappears. So, who else is on this list? Well, there&#x27;s Thomas Morray from the 1940s. He claimed to have built a device that could make 50 kW of power, but with no energy input. He said it tapped into this 0 point field, which is like this theoretical energy that&#x27;s everywhere in space. Free energy again.</p>
<p>Yep. But Moray&#x27;s story is wild. The video says he was almost kidnapped by Russians. His lab was attacked. Someone tried to kill him.</p>
<p>His assistant sabotaged him. and he died poor with his tech lost. That&#x27;s pretty intense. Yeah, like something out of a movie. And then there&#x27;s the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951.</p>
<p>This law lets the government keep inventions secret if they think it&#x27;s a threat to national security or the economy. And guess how many patents are currently secret? Hundreds. Thousands. Over 6,000. 6,000.</p>
<p>Seriously, that&#x27;s crazy. I know. It makes you wonder what they&#x27;re hiding. And the video points out if you break this secrecy order, you can go to jail. It&#x27;s serious stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, no kidding. So, what kinds of things get hidden under this act? Well, the video mentions a list from 1971 that said patents for solar panels over 20% efficient and energy conversion systems over 70 or 80% efficient, they could be restricted. So, basically, anything that&#x27;s too good. Kind of seems like it. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re limiting how efficient our energy can be.</p>
<p>Makes you think. So, who else is on this list of potentially suppressed inventors? There&#x27;s this guy Tom Ogle from the 70s. He supposedly built an engine that ran on its own fumes. The video says he drove 205 mi on two gallons of gas in 1977 and engineers checked. No hidden fuel tanks or tricks.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s incredible, right? And he even got a $25 million offer from Shell Oil to buy him out, but he said no. Why would he say no to that? Who knows? Maybe he wanted to share his invention with the world. Maybe. But did he? Unfortunately, no. His story takes a dark turn.</p>
<p>He got in trouble with the SEC and IRS, had personal problems, got shot in 78, and later died from what they called an accidental overdose. Accidental overdose. That&#x27;s the official story. But some people think it wasn&#x27;t an accident, you know, another cover up. So, another invention lost.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s a sad pattern. Oh, and there&#x27;s one more guy, Floyd Sparky from the8s. He claimed to have built a machine that could turn 3 watts of power into a whopping 224,000 watts. That&#x27;s some serious power amplification, right? But his story gets scary. The video says he was threatened at a grocery store, got tons of threatening calls, his lab was robbed, and then he suddenly died supposedly from a heart attack.</p>
<p>Sounds fishy. It does, right? Especially since the FBI took all this research within a day of his death. And get this, some army officers and a nuclear physicist named Tom Bearden said they saw his machine do anti-gravity stuff, like make things 90% lighter. Wow, that&#x27;s mind-blowing. So, what does all of this mean for us here in Deer Park, Leaport, and Pasadena? Well, that&#x27;s the question, isn&#x27;t it? We&#x27;re all about think and act locally about empowering you guys to make a difference in our community.</p>
<p>So, thinking about all these inventors, all these potentially suppressed technologies, what does it mean for innovation right here in Southeast Houston? Yeah, good point. Like, are we missing out on local inventions because of these bigger forces at play? Exactly. We live in the heart of the energy industry. So, are there people right here with brilliant ideas that are getting stifled? It&#x27;s definitely something to consider. It is.</p>
<p>Now, we got to remember this video, it&#x27;s just one source and it presents a lot of controversial stuff, but knowing that thousands of patents are being kept secret, it makes you wonder, doesn&#x27;t it? It does. Like, what else is out there that we don&#x27;t know about? Exactly. So, here&#x27;s a final thought for you, our listeners in Deer Park, Leaport, and Pasadena. What questions does all of this raise for you about how technology is developing, especially in areas that affect our lives, our community right here, right now?
