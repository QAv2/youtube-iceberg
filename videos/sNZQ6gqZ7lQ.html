            <p>UFO whistleblower David grush has doubled down on some bombshell claims maybe the most explosive being that the US government has killed people who tried to go public with stories about non-human spacecraft telling news nation&#x27;s Elizabeth Vargas last night let&#x27;s watch you recently did an interview with Joe Rogan um on his podcast U and you said something that really took me a back you said that you believed that the United States government has killed people for trying to go public with a story really those are concerns that a certain scientists on the program that are known to me you know presented that to myself but I did direct them uh to the appropriate Authorities on that that&#x27;s something that I don&#x27;t know firsthand that&#x27;s something they exposed but because of the serious nature of that you know I directed them to the appropriate authorities such as the inspector general staff uh and law enforcement so I can&#x27;t speak to that because that&#x27;s something that they exposed and I directed them to the right authorities other people were worried about that not you I had some unique things happened in my personal life that you know were some of the causal factors for me to file a complaint some things that my wife and I had noticed uh some intimidation I can&#x27;t get into the exact nature I I did provide that information to the Inspector General and and hopefully they referred it to appropriate federal law enforcements and Counter Intelligence Personnel but I can&#x27;t discuss that public because of the sensitive nature of that for my own protection and for the Integrity of the investigation yeah cuz if if you really believe that the government has done that in the past with people who&#x27;ve tried to expose this UFO program why are you still alive you&#x27;ve done more to expose it than anyone else well that&#x27;s one of the reasons why I went public and certainly I was shown that you know they can touch me at any time and and that&#x27;s what led me uh to not only contact my former agencies you know Counter Intelligence folks um with uh you know what I witnessed and I provided evidence to that fact but filed the complaint and uh certainly going public was the appropriate move for me for my own protection Tucker Carlson recently spoke with redacted co-host Clayton Morris saying he hasn&#x27;t even told his wife that he&#x27;s what he&#x27;s learned on this elusive subject let&#x27;s watch the second thing that bothers me is the UFO story and you know the more you dig into that and talk to people with with actual knowledge of it again that&#x27;s another story there are some you know fanciful ideas floating around that are just you know there&#x27;s no evidence that they&#x27;re true but if you talk to people who you know have actual knowledge of it that they gathered themselves there are parts of that story I do not understand at all that are really really really dark it&#x27;s so dark that I you know haven&#x27;t told my wife about it I mean I I haven&#x27;t verified any of this but this is not just stuff that I read on the internet I know you all are very very grounded in that story so I think I know you know what I&#x27;m talking about but there&#x27;s some stuff there that that&#x27;s just like man I I&#x27;m not even sure what that means there&#x27;s a spiritual component there that I I don&#x27;t fully understand um so yes that story bothers me and I think last thing I&#x27;ll say that one of the reasons that we&#x27;ve had all the these disclosures and all these what 10 whistleblowers at this point and it hasn&#x27;t really become Front Page News part of it suppression you know parts of the government don&#x27;t want you to know about it but part of it is the public can&#x27;t deal with it it&#x27;s too far out the Imp but some are critical of this particular exchange saying Morris and Carlson never provide evidence sources or a reason for withholding that information all right uh so let&#x27;s maybe go with the grush stuff uh right so so grush is saying that he knows people who felt threatened for trying to come forward with information or even that people were killed yes for doing so and then and Elizabeth Vargas said okay but that&#x27;s not necessarily based on your experience and then grush said well obviously he hasn&#x27;t been killed he&#x27;s alive he&#x27;s testifying but he did fear he had fears for his um for safety or for some kind of harassment based on on what he&#x27;s doing but based on what he&#x27;s experienced he said they&#x27;ve shown me they can touch me they can they&#x27;ve shown me that they know how to touch me in my life well he now he might be referencing um the fact that there was a lot of negative reporting about him actually that The Intercept did we talked to Ken klippstein about it it was Ken&#x27;s reporting um on his history of uh of I think it was substance abuse that kind of thing um so he he might mean that they you know they tried to delegitimize me they tried to smear my reputation for speaking up which is not all that&#x27;s the same I mean that&#x27;s I don&#x27;t not at all to minimize the kind of coercive power of doing something like that and certainly the government has demonstrated St has tremendous Co yes and the government has shown its willingness to do that in a million different ways sending threatening letters to Martin Luther King wi tab him all that that sort of thing so I I I credit that at the same time that wasn&#x27;t exactly the question right what but Vargas was pushing him on is this idea that his life has been threatened and that other people&#x27;s lives have been threatened to the point of actually killing them who&#x27;s doing the threatening and who&#x27;s doing the killing and where and and who is it that has been apparently killed by the government that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a very serious charge I mean we&#x27;re we up until this point have been talking about a hunt for potential alien spacecraft and alien B should this be a man hunt for human beings that have been killed because of knowing too much about I want to know what agencies are responsible and then we need to hold them accountable if is the case or we need to investigate them and find out it&#x27;s BS and he says you know I I I pointed to them to the proper authorities but but but if but the authorities are the ones doing this you&#x27;re saying so what isn&#x27;t the proper Authority public sunlight disinfectant we need to know at at some point you&#x27;re you&#x27;re going to be you&#x27;re not say they&#x27;re already out from your perspective your claim they&#x27;re already out to get you and your people for having this information isn&#x27;t you need to get it out there yes and he says that about himself again when Vargas ask him what about your safety he says well that&#x27;s part of why I came forward so there does seem to be a little bit of a gap some threatening you you&#x27;re not safe like you&#x27;re you&#x27;re not as long as I satisfy them you&#x27;re already you know what I mean fur comp is the safety and he says that about himself my I came forward just there in that interview I came forward in part because I felt threatened and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m less exposed and something happens to me now it would seem suspicious so why is that good for the goose but not good for the gander yeah that&#x27;s a fair question um now going on to the interview the Tucker Carlson interview there was a lot of insinuation a lot of and raised eyebrows and deep swallows you know gulps of trepidation is it misleading to have those kinds of interviews as a journalist uh you know without more they they both basically said in the clip that we watched they they personally have knowledge of more much like Gish they personally know more is it that Tucker Carlson feels threatened he says it just feel he said he characterized it as too out there to talk about he didn&#x27;t want to talk to about it to his wife because it was too out there what does that mean yeah I don&#x27;t know I I I thought perhaps maybe he was just referencing you know the um the videos of unidentified aerial objects um or maybe seen some of them that we have the Public&#x27;s not seen or that maybe people like his guest have have shared with him obviously I that are that are too much to discuss with your wife I don&#x27;t know um like he said there&#x27;s a spiritual he did a spiritual component I Don&#x27;t Know Me Maybe seen something maybe seen something there are people who think that there&#x27;s a conflict between the idea that there is a God um in any kind of traditional sense and aliens um what does that do to theological practice if we are not God&#x27;s only people the aliens have a different God is our God local um is he really omnicient these are the kinds of I think uh the theological questions that aliens raise and I I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s alluding to well that depends on what your religion is maybe I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s a conflict with um I don&#x27;t think aliens necessarily conflict with the Catholic perspective which was the religion in which I wased I don&#x27;t think so cuz they could just be other sentient life could have been created by God as well or something like the the Bible&#x27;s just for Catholics the Bible is a is not is not the like Divine word of God it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s kind of like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s Inspire it&#x27;s inspirational stories for lessons it&#x27;s not the hope is the center of the is the is the authority on religious truth and the debates around things like Evolution and dinosaur bones those aren&#x27;t implicated in Catholicism the way they are in some other religions interesting all right well let us know what you think about this one how are you reading that Tucker Carlson interview and some of the insinuations and what do you think is really holding grush back we want to know and you sort my plan to just figure out where the facility is where the I&#x27;m going to do I&#x27;m going to do a January 6 on that facility this hiding the alien crafts we&#x27;re going to we&#x27;re going to March we&#x27;re going to take back our country
