            <p>the United States finally got the war they wanted they&#x27;ve been wanting to have a great military presence in the Middle East for many years they&#x27;ve been wanting to keep down and squash any government that might become too powerful and cause a threat to Israel or be able to attract a mergence of Arab nationalism and U have one strong Arab leader emerge and so and also all the other reasons we&#x27;ve talked about about how the United States needs the war to keep the industrial military-industrial complex going and to deflect American public opinion from all the economic ills at home so it looks like if you believe in power politics and the old makavelian way of doing it the United States just really set the whole thing up and it worked perfectly from their point of view you&#x27;re watching alternative views information which you don&#x27;t get from The Establishment media now some stories from the alternative press the in inslaw case which you&#x27;ve talked about on alternative views is one of those little things that kind of little window to the real world of Espionage and murder and intelligence activities and cronyism The Establishment is trying to cover it up as fast as they can if you read The Washington Post on the New York Times well what was the inslaw case well it seems like the there was a small computer company which developed some software which was able to track uh Personnel activities and people and the intelligence people wanted this for their operations not only here in the United States but also in other countries well the inslaw people had a contract with the justice department to develop this and the justice department the government was supposed to pay the ins slau people just a man and his wife were the owners um several millions of dollars well it also happens that friends of attorney former Attorney General Edmund me he was attorney general at the time he tried to buy out inslaw and give the goodies to a friend of his Dr Earl Brian who is part of Reagan&#x27;s kitchen cabinet cabinet in California well the people who owned inslaw refused and so the justice department through various ways forced them out of business and took the software anyway now what is happening is that between 1986 and8 9 nearly 30 people have either died or disappeared under mysterious circumstances all of whom stood to reveal some crucial pieces of information on the insa case and justice department there have been different lot of Articles written uh a lot of them in the Spotlight by Harry Martin who&#x27;s the uh uh editor of the and publisher of the Napa Sentinel also in the guardian there&#x27;s a good article this time there most immediate U story that you&#x27;ve been reading perhaps if you&#x27;ve been following the case is the death of Danny casalero he was an investigator who was working on a book to show that the inslaw case is just a part of an operation which he called The Octopus was tied to uh the BCCI that notorious bank it&#x27;s tied to the October surprise all these people in the intelligence community that have been doing all their nefarious activities over the past several years well he wound up dead and the authorities are claiming it was suicide and the New York Times And The Washington Post have mainly just been trying to blacken the name of casala but all of his papers were stolen and he was also people say he was not the type of person who would commit suicide well other people have died too um there was Dennis Eisman who was an attorney he was going to make a trip to the West Coast to talk to a person who had information and had made an aid affidavit uh on the inslaw case and he had he was going to be able to back up what casera was saying and what the inlaws were saying and he also had some information about some of the intelligence aspects of the case well Dennis Eisman was found dead once again ruled Su suicide another man called Anon Ang was found dead a month before cleer and he was working for the financial times of London and he was in Guatemala and he was attempting to interview a key witness in a case that was related to the inslaw case so there are several others of these that and they&#x27;re continuing to go on uh where people who know too much about the inslaw case are finding their they&#x27;re winding up dead this man U who was supposed to get control of the inlaw software and marketed around the world Dr Earl Brian has been involved or implicated in the October surprise in Iran Contra because he has had some meetings in various places around the world where he was the contact man and apparently effectuated some of the agreements so this little inslaw company is uh just a tiny little window which we can open up and we can see the whole nefarious world of horrible things are going on and what happens when people try to bring the truth out they are killed</p>
