            <p>hello it&#x27;s Matt Cook here and welcome back to my YouTube channel if you&#x27;re finding me for the first time I&#x27;m a manifestation coach who helps people from all around the world consciously manifest their reality now in this particular video one that continues to blow my mind we&#x27;re diving deep into quantum mechanics specifically collapse of the wave function and the observer effect so if you&#x27;re interested in understanding how your own observation dictates the reality that you&#x27;re living in and how you can consciously manifest your life then you&#x27;ll want to listen to this video now the one thing that I teach the one thing that I talk about on my social media channels is the fact that manifestation isn&#x27;t Magic in fact my role here as a researcher and a coach is to break down for anyone around the world to understand the Simplicity of manifestation and how it&#x27;s not magic it is the fact that we are ourselves creators and my goal my mission is to help you become a conscious Creator and consciously understand how a combination of visualizing feeling and acting can actually ultimately create a new future whereas unconsciously the majority of people are unconsciously unaware of how they are unconsciously thinking acting and feeling and therefore unconsciously continuing to create a future that is not serving them so with that said let&#x27;s dive into today&#x27;s topic which is quantum mechanics collapse of the wave function and the observer effect so firstly let&#x27;s start with quantum mechanics the one thing that fascinates me about this subject is that on a very small micro level beyond the fabric of our knowns and what we can see with our five senses is the Quantum world and the quantum World continues to blow my mind because it doesn&#x27;t behave in the same way that let&#x27;s say Newtonian physics once understood and this is where when we understand this on a deeper level we truly understand that we are these creators and we all have this innate power within to actually create our own reality now if you follow me on the likes of Instagram and Tick Tock you&#x27;ll know that I&#x27;m slightly obsessed with something called the quantum field and the quantum field is a really interesting subject to me because it basically dictates that on a Quantum level there is a field around us that I call Pure Consciousness it&#x27;s a field of energy that bounds and unifies everything in our existence in fact on a Quantum level this field called the quantum field is truly infinite in fact there is an infinite amount of energy that exists there now if we think about it all energy moves and oscillates at different frequencies right and frequency carries information so if you tune into let&#x27;s say a specific frequency on a radio you&#x27;re going to pick up that information which of course is hearing whatever&#x27;s being played on that radio so therefore that means if you can tune into a specific frequency in the quantum field you&#x27;re going to pick up that information now it&#x27;s important to understand that you yourself are just an energetic being and the way you&#x27;re thinking acting and feeling at all times in the present moment is creating your own unique signature vibration which is therefore releasing an information and that information is the life of you your personal reality so if you&#x27;re unconsciously thinking feeling and acting for most of your life then you&#x27;re unconsciously aware of the vibration that you&#x27;re in and therefore you&#x27;re unconscious of the fact that you&#x27;re just picking up the same information right so in order to manifest we have to firstly be conscious of how we&#x27;re thinking acting and feeling and then very consciously change the vibration that we&#x27;re on to pick up new information now think about this if in the quantum field there&#x27;s an infinite amount of energy that&#x27;s moving your different frequencies and all frequency carries information that means then that there is an infinite amount of future potentials called your life so whatever it is that you seek to manifest I want you to understand already exists right now as a potential of energy in the quantum field and the question then is how can you consciously draw that energy to you in your life and see that manifestation actually appear well that&#x27;s where we dive into collapse of the wave function now before we get there I just want to explain something to you the fabric of our known and perceived reality all around us let&#x27;s take the human body for example we perceive to be physical when in actual fact if we were to break it down from a scientific point of view we have skin on the surface level and then we have bone flesh molecule cell and if we keep going deeper and deeper then eventually we&#x27;ll get to something called an atom and in fact the interesting thing about the atom is if you break down anything physical in your world in fact even thoughts feelings and energy you get down to atoms so it&#x27;s very well known then the atoms are the building blocks of all things physical in our reality and what I want to use for that example is just this bouncy ball that I have here right now I want you to imagine that&#x27;s the atom but of course the atom you can&#x27;t see with your naked eye now the atom behaves in the same way as you and I it moves through space and you see the atom moving through space just like you if you were to move around you would see yourself moving through space now it&#x27;s important to understand that time is created through how physical objects move through space so if the atom moves through space it experiences time and the longer the space the longer the time so if the atom wanted to move from one hand here to this hand here it might take a second because of the Gap and as it travels there&#x27;s the second if I increase the length and it takes a little bit longer and that&#x27;s called space time reality so in order to experience time the atom moves through space and the atom itself is the building block of you but when we dive even deeper I started wanting to understand what the atom itself was made from and the atom is made from something even smaller such as electrons or photons and I want us just to keep it simple with the word subatomic particles sub the atom particles okay let&#x27;s say particles and what we&#x27;re going to use in this little analogy is a bit of blue tap that I have here we&#x27;re going to imagine that that is the subatomic particle so there&#x27;s the atom there&#x27;s the subatomic particle so the way to remember it is that below the atom what makes the atom is the subatomic particle now what&#x27;s interesting about the subatomic particle is it doesn&#x27;t move in the same way as the atom it doesn&#x27;t move through space to experience time it doesn&#x27;t do that it doesn&#x27;t move through space it appears in one state and then it simply disappears and when scientists were first looking at this something truly amazing happened and this is where collapse of the wave function and the observer effect first came in through a very interesting topic an experiment called the double slit experiment and what scientists were able to see was that wherever they placed their observation whether that was themselves looking or any equipment would dictate where this subatomic particle appeared so if they were looking here the subotype particle would be here the moment they moved their observation the particle disappeared but what was interesting about it is it was disappearing back into an infinite amount of potentials and wherever the scientists observation moved to would dictate where that particle reappeared so as they look somewhere else the particle appeared as they move their observation it would reappear so it was almost not it was definitely not traveling through space it was disappearing and then out of nowhere reappearing just based on observation right so what you have to realize is that everything around us is a wave the wave is energy the wave is the Quantum field in fact we are the wave the quantum field creates us so as the scientists observation changed the wave here of energy would collapse into form would collapse into the particle and then the particle remember is the building block of the atom and the atom is the building block of you and I and everything else so then when I started looking at this and started to understand it on a deeper level I started to realize something that when I first started helping my clients manifest I kept seeing them manifest out of nowhere and they would say to me Matt my manifestations are appearing out of nowhere and I realized something that what my clients were doing is they were changing their observation because for years five years ten years unconsciously they were looking this way defining their life on the past their trauma their problems and of course just by observation the wave was collapsing into the particle into the atom and then of course manifesting the same life that they&#x27;ve been used to so what changed then of course was when I got my clients to start meditating and visualizing and they would simply change their observation from here to all of a sudden now being defined by a new future and as they were being defined by a new future mentally rehearsing every day out of nowhere this wave would collapse into a particle into an atom and then of course they would say Matt the most amazing things happened Matt you&#x27;re not going to believe it I&#x27;ve had this Serendipity this synchronicity this opportunity out of nowhere why simply down to conscious observation the moment they change their observation was the moment they saw these particles collapsing from wave to atom to manifestation so really is that simple we don&#x27;t need to dive into it any more than that through your own observation dictates where the wave turns to the particle and then turns to the atom and then turns into everything known in your life so in order to start with manifestation don&#x27;t want don&#x27;t hope look Within look at your own thoughts and feelings and change your observation from here to here first become aware of the thoughts and feelings that are no longer serving you be the master and then every day mentally rehearse because if I said to you do you believe that your thoughts have some sort of an impact on your future and I&#x27;d like to think you&#x27;d say yes now after watching this video then you&#x27;d definitely not be defined by that instead you would wake up every single day in meditation and you would be mentally defined by a future potential and every time you did that you are collapsing a wave of energy a wave of infinite potentials into a particle a subatomic particle which is matter and then trust me if you keep on doing this out of nowhere you are going to see the most amazing opportunities in your life so I hope you&#x27;ve enjoyed this video If you read the description below if
