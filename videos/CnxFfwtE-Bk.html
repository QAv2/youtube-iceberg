            <p>all right how&#x27;s everybody doing out there I&#x27;m Thomas welcome to my channel I do um educational videos on many different topics most of them are uh things you haven&#x27;t heard about too much uh and uh we are in the middle of covering the reciprocal system of theory which is a theory of everything first uh profit by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century middle middle to late 20th century he died back in 1990 and since then the theory has been updated uh quite a little bit by uh people that are calling it reciprocal system two and uh right now we are in the middle of looking at um an address that Larson gave to uh the the society that works to um you know spread out broadcast Larson&#x27;s work the international Society for a unified science and uh in 1986 he gave a talk there about the deductive development of the reciprocal system now the basics of the reciprocal system are more or less that um you know where the ancient Greeks believed that the Universe was made out of matter and the smallest parts were atoms and then uh you know 2500 years later uh Einstein comes along and says equals mc squared so it looks like matter is the fundamental thing in the universe but it&#x27;s really energy and matter can be converted one to the other and uh then a couple decades later Larson comes along and says if equals m c squared and matter can be converted into energy and vice versa that means that neither one of those things can be the most fundamental thing in the universe and the most fundamental thing is really the c squared part the speed of light speed speed is one of the kinds of motion so Larson eventually says that the universe is made out of motion motion is uh that is something that some other people have come up with in the past I think Thomas Hobbes possibly Renee Descartes uh have both um tried to construct their Universe out of motion but they didn&#x27;t kind of redefine motion and the way that Larson did that allowed him to move on with this Theory to move forward with it and to make make a whole universe out of it is that motion in Larson sense motion is the relationship between space and time um so if you have speed speed is 10 miles per hour the car is moving 10 miles per hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time space over time that is speed but speed is only one of many many different kinds of motion all of the kinds of motion are relationships between space and time but it can be the other way around as well relationships between time and space it took me 10 minutes to move that pile 10 feet that&#x27;s 10 or 5 feet we&#x27;ll say that&#x27;s 10 minutes of time per 10 feet or 5 feet of space that is energy time time over space and it turns out uh that every single physical quantity that we can think of is a relationship between space and time and that happens because space and time are both multi-dimensional because space and time are identical to each other except that they are reciprocals so every quality that space has time also has and every quality that time has space also has the major quality that we know about time is that time is always progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later and later in the same way space is also progressing things are always getting farther and farther and farther and farther apart there&#x27;s more space between them and we see this in the recession of the distant galaxies the only reason that we only see it in that recession of the distant galaxies is because the distant galaxies are the only things that are far apart to nullify uh the gravitational force that pulls things closer together so there is a progression uh that moves things apart and gravitation that moves them together those are both um forms of motion they are three-dimensionals and that&#x27;s the other thing about space and time is that the thing that we recognize about space is that space is three-dimensional or you could at least say multi-dimensional because there are some geometries out there that have you know more than three dimensions but three or more dimensions but in Larson&#x27;s case he says three and therefore time also has three dimensions even though those time dimensions are not they&#x27;re not like space dimensions you can&#x27;t you know conceive of them as being space uh they&#x27;re not made out of space they are time Dimensions but there are three dimensions of them and uh so that&#x27;s kind of the basic start of it um the main idea you know it&#x27;s called the reciprocal system of theory um the universe is made out of motion motion is a relationship relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other and uh so he goes from there and so he basically starts out with that postulate and another postulate that is less essential that has to do with the universe conforms to commutative mathematics and it conforms to euclidean Geometry which has been contested by the rs2 people and it basically nullified by the rs2 people so but that&#x27;s not really needed for the theory basically just goes with this one postulate and he defines an entire universe out of that and that&#x27;s kind of what&#x27;s going on here if then if this then that if this then that and we are not at number 60 seven from a paragraph or uh statement 58 we find that there that where the vibrational displacement is negative the net total rotational displacement must be positive number 68 where a one unit rotate a positive rotational displacement is applied to a one unit negative vibration the net total speed displacement is zero as a scalar quantity this combination of motions has no effective deviation from unit speed which is the physical datum and therefore has no observed physical properties we will call it the rotational base of the material system a similar combination with positive vibration and negative rotation is the rotational base of the cosmic system okay this rotational base is an important concept that Larson uses uh basically saying that okay we have the progression of the natural reference system it&#x27;s moving everything apart from each other but then uh that&#x27;s the positive um and then you have this vibration that&#x27;s put on it uh which is the photon um and then you have this rotation and the rotation nullifies the vibration uh as a scalar matter they add up to zero and so this rotation he calls it the rotational equivalent of nothing so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just a it&#x27;s kind of like a uh uh what he calls it a rotational base this is where you you build atoms from this base it doesn&#x27;t have any qualities of itself but it is necessary for you to start building atoms now paret had uh some problems with this concept which I&#x27;m guessing that we&#x27;ll get into here pretty soon once he starts putting in some footnotes so number 69. for convenience we will represent the different motion combinations of this type of sets of numbers representing the speed displacements in the three scalar dimensions we will specify only the effective magnitudes of the displacements and we will use the letters m and C to indicate whether the combination belongs to the material or the cosmic system now again uh when we&#x27;re splitting the material in the cosmic system basically the material system is uh what we&#x27;re familiar with and this is uh everything that is moving less than less than Unity or the speed of light like an Einstein system he&#x27;s saying Einstein is saying that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson says that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe the neutral point where half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light and half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light and the half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light is called The Cosmic sector or in this case the cosmic system so there are uh at both sides of the equation are identical but it&#x27;s just that time and space are switched around so in the material sector you&#x27;ve got a more space over time relationships in the cosmic sector you have more time over space relationships um and the material sector corresponds the material atoms are the atoms that we&#x27;re familiar with whereas the cosmic atoms are something different uh that has a more um uh I would say more related to consciousness um okay now uh the back to we&#x27;re still in the middle of number 69 here the displacement magnitudes will be expressed in the form m material and then a dash B Dash C like so three numbers where A and B are the effective displacements of the two-dimensional rotation which we&#x27;ll call the magnetic rotation and C is the effective displacement of the one-dimensional or electric rotation negative spatial displacements will be enclosed in parentheses on this basis uh in his notation so on this basis the material rotational base is m 0-0-0 and the cosmic rotational base is C 0 Dash zero Dash is zero now another another Point here is that in Larson&#x27;s system uh you&#x27;ve got this magnetic uh these magnetic quantities and you have these electric quantities uh he doesn&#x27;t state it here yet but magnetic and electric quantities can be both charged and uncharged but this is particularly true with the electric uh the electron in Larson system the electron is uncharged it can be charged there is such a thing as a Charged electron but the the most basic form of the electron is uncharged Larson says that the electron is a rotating unit of space um okay now we&#x27;ll get into that obviously all this stuff we&#x27;ll get into later we&#x27;re trying to just lay this out so that we can unpack it at a later time so don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t really understand everything just let it wash over you and try to pick up what you can and you know grasp on to what you can but uh we will be able to unpack all this stuff um one at a time slowly but surely um this is not something that you&#x27;re going to learn in one 20-minute video but you might pick up a few things and uh it all will add up but in order to learn the reciprocal system just like learning the tree of life you have to put a little bit of time and effort into it okay number 70. to the material rotational base mean we may add a unit of positive Electric rotational displacement that is one unit of effective one-dimensional scalar rotation producing M 0-0-1 which we identify as the positron or we may add a unit of negative electric displacement producing M 0 Dash zero Dash negative one which we identify as the electron these are the first members of a series of combinations that we identify as the subatomic particles of the material system number 71 addition of a magnetic or two-dimensional displacement unit to the material rotational base produces m one half one half one half dash one half Dash zero there are no half units but a material unit occupies both dimensions and we therefore credit half to each we identify this combination as the muon neutrino okay this is sticky here you know because Larson starts off way back at the beginning of this with his discrete unit postulate everything is in units there are no half units but here he comes right out and he&#x27;s saying that the addition of a two dimensional okay so that&#x27;s the magnetic is the two dimensional and the electric is the one-dimensional addition of a magnetic displacement unit to the material rotational base produces M one-half dash one half Dash zero the next sentence is there are no half units but a magnetic unit occupies both dimensions okay so a magnetic unit occupies both dimensions and so it basically splits the one unit into two because it&#x27;s occupying two we identify this as the muon neutrino and uh there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a footnote here uh from paret and he says the muon neutrino was called a massless neutron in Larson&#x27;s earlier works so uh he eventually began to call it the muon neutrino but at the beginning he was calling it the massless neutron um okay now number 72 at the unit level the magnetic and electric displacement units are numerically equal that is one to the second power equals one so both magnetic and electric units are numerically equal because one is one dimensional one is two dimensional but one to the second power equals one addition of a unit of negative electric displacement to the muon neutrino therefore produces a combination with a net total rotational displacement of zero so we identified this combination m one half dash one half Dash negative one okay so meaning that each you know one half dash one half that&#x27;s negative one so one positive and one negative the the positive is in the magnetic dimensions and the negative is in the electric Dimensions they cancel each other out so you still have a kind of a nothingness there he identifies this as the electron neutrino uh which eventually he just refers to as the neutrino even though he just recently identified the Mulan neutrino um and the footnote here says because of the electron neutrinos net displacement of zero it can pass through empty any structure without interference okay number 73 geometrical considerations indicate that two photons in different scalar Dimensions can rotate around the same Central Point without interference as long as the rotational speeds are the same thus forming a double structure any rotational combination with more with two or more net units of rotational displacement can take the double structure number 74 this uh introduces okay number 74 is quite long so we&#x27;re going to stop there with number 73 basically he&#x27;s saying that uh two photons can occupy the same space and rotate around the same Central Point without interference um as long as the rotational speeds are the same uh so there&#x27;s a it forms a double structure so uh any rotational motion with two or more net units can take the double structure okay we&#x27;ll stop there for now um just uh thanks for tuning in uh if you want to buy any of my books just uh send me an email and um you know I&#x27;ve got a book on tree of life I got a book on some jazz musicians um and uh I take donations by venmo and cash app um and uh otherwise just thanks for tuning in keep uh keep uh posted I&#x27;ll be doing videos like this every day until we get through this and I know it&#x27;s tough going but uh hang in there the reward will be worth it down the line and have a great day we&#x27;ll see you soon</p>
