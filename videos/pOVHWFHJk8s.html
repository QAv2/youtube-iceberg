            <p>all right hello everyone I&#x27;m Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational uh excuse me educational videos on many different subjects um most of them are uh almost unknown subjects uh but things I think are important that we should learn about things that have been um not not necessarily censored uh but uh ignored and uh shoved to the side and uh we are going through uh the reciprocal system of theory and that is a theory developed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century and updated by many other people in the 21st century but unfortunately it is not uh in widespread uh parlance people don&#x27;t know anything about the reciprocal system I actually I&#x27;ve been studying a reciprocal system for over 20 years and I have never once met a person in person who has ever heard of the reciprocal system of theory so but there are you know a handful uh a handful of dozens of people out there who care about this and I&#x27;m hoping that I can turn that into maybe a handful of hundreds or something like that um it&#x27;s a great Theory especially for leveling the playing playing field we no longer have to rely on the experts to figure out what&#x27;s going on in the scientific field or any other fields um because we have this system at our our disposal and the way the system works is that if you understand how it works then you can derive anything from the system you can figure out how everything works but you really have to be very fluent with the system I can&#x27;t do that I&#x27;m a historian and so I would love to figure out how to apply the reciprocal system of theory to history and uh I have a few ideas and a few footholds but I haven&#x27;t gotten to the level of fluency with the system to be able to to really do that but anyway the way that the system works and it took Larson about 20 years to get to this point is that uh he believed uh he eventually came to the uh conclusion through inductive research that um he developed these two postulates and the first postulate is really the main one uh the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so uh that&#x27;s it so the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it is made out of motion and motion uh exists in three dimensions or I would say three or more dimensions uh and it&#x27;s in discrete units meaning there is a quantum of motion um and then there are you know there&#x27;s one you know unit of motion and that everything else is a um it&#x27;s all in discrete units there&#x27;s no like decimals um you either have one or you don&#x27;t have one you and then if you have more than one you either have two or you still have one and then there are two the main part is there are two reciprocal aspects space and time so motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are identical to each other except that there are reciprocals both of them have three dimensions both of them progress um what goes on in space also goes on in time you know and vice versa uh so that&#x27;s where he starts from then he develops his deductive Universe his theoretical Universe from those that simple postulate and the other one which is um you know it&#x27;s the physical Universe conforms to the relationships relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean some of the people that have come up later have um nitpicked with this uh this particular postulate it&#x27;s not really that important it&#x27;s really uh you know just pretty straightforward you know if you&#x27;re gonna be a scientist then you have to use math uh you know that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re going to be an appear in empiricist then you have to use measurements so but uh the euclidean geometry is is touchy and Larson admitted as much but he didn&#x27;t want to mess with the euclidean geometry part because you thought it would just get even more complicated for the reader and that&#x27;s really what Larson&#x27;s problem is is communicating this because it&#x27;s so um all-encompassing he has to come up with a completely new language to describe some of these things and he he really he he comes up with a theoretical universe but he has to give labels to the things that pop out of that theoretical universe and he Compares his theoretical Universe with the actual universe that the scientists have come up with and so if something pops out of his his system out of his deductive development he&#x27;s like what is this well um you know this looks pretty much exactly the same as what the scientists say an electron looks like or a photon looks like and so I&#x27;m going to call this a photon um and but sometimes he develops things that aren&#x27;t part of the actual scientific uh vernacular so he um he has to come up with uh you know he would he put it he gave himself a Herculean task and he&#x27;s largely succeeded but there was a lot of a lot of failures and a lot of areas that need to be further developed it&#x27;s just he&#x27;s just one guy just think of how many thousands of people are in the scientific community and you got this one guy that&#x27;s almost trying to compete with them you know and uh not only that but the scientific Community is criticizes him for um you know not being able to compete with him and it&#x27;s like well this is one guy with you know a slide rule and you know a budget of a thousand dollars going up against hundreds of thousands of scientists uh with almost unlimited budgets um you know and he&#x27;s and he&#x27;s still in the conversation uh they have to censor him to keep him to keep him from beating them so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very impressive what he&#x27;s done but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s going to be easy so anyway we are right now looking at his final book which is called beyond space and time and beyond space and time uh came out after he died in 1995 and it is a departure because most of his books are on uh scientific matters uh chemistry astronomy and physics uh um and some other things and but this uh book here is on metaphysics it&#x27;s on philosophy religion um it&#x27;s on um uh there&#x27;s another uh philosophy religion and psychology mainly and uh we are looking at chapter eight right now and um we just got done with chapter seven chapter eight is called communication local and chapter nine is called communication General and uh he&#x27;s really talking about communication of Life units now in chapters five six and seven we looked at his derivation of where life comes from and you know we looked at uh you know the speed of light for Larson where the the if the universe is made entirely of motion um then that means that kind of like where nothing is going on there&#x27;s still motion we just really don&#x27;t detect it like so the for where whereas for uh Einstein the universe maximum speed is the speed of light for Larson the the speed of light is the midpoint or the null point of the universe the speed of light is where you feel nothing and everything that goes slower than that is in fact in the material sector meaning that&#x27;s where we are that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re located and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re accustomed to so we recognize this physical universe as going slower than the speed of light but there&#x27;s also this other half of the Universe on the other side of the boundary that is called The Cosmic Universe where everything is moving faster than the speed of light and that&#x27;s where he claims that all of these uh metaphysical phenomena come from life and intelligence um and that that those those other aspects um they interpenetrate or they they uh mingle with the material aspects so this this uh he calls a control unit from the metaphysical sector life is a situation where the material sector the atoms molecules the inanimate matter is taken over and controlled by a cosmic unit uh a metaphysical unit or Cosmic unit faster than light unit um and now in this chapter chapter eight and nine he&#x27;s looking at how um how these different um sectors are really communicating with each other so I&#x27;m just going to read the first paragraph and then and then maybe uh pick and choose a little bit more one of the essential requirements for the development of multicellular organisms is the existence of some means of transmitting information from one cell to another where the cells that need to communicate are in direct contract contact as is true in the most primitive of these organisms the actual mechanism of the transmission presents no particular problems since it is possible to pass substances containing the information from cell to cell through the walls that are in contact um the development of an appropriate language attaching a particular meaning to each of these uh information carrying substances and adaptation of the cells to a recognition of that meaning is a more difficult task and in no doubt took a long time to accomplish uh so-called evolution once such a communication system was established it lent itself readily to expansion and in the more complex organisms chemical Messengers carry a great variety of information and instructions from place to place within the organism however this chemical messenger system is too slow and too Limited in capacity to take care of all of the requirements and a more sophisticated system of internal communication utilizing electrical impulses has therefore been developed between this electrical system and the chemical Messengers the internal needs of the organism are adequately met okay so he&#x27;s saying that there&#x27;s you know three different kinds of communication that the cells are using to become multicellular organisms you know there&#x27;s like this osmosis where these things are in direct contact uh there is chemical Messengers um passing chemicals from one side to the other in order to communicate which he says is limited and then there is electrical impulses and the electrical impulses are more sophisticated [Music] um and so uh you know he kind of goes on here um and talks about the different forms of of systems that are developed and then he um so it&#x27;s the question then arises can the life units communicate directly with each other through sector two channels without the necessity of transmitting this information by material means okay so our our life units able to communicate directly through this [Music] um through these same kind of means but in sector two and he says as the cosmic sector of the universe is identical with the material sector except for the reversal of space and time it follows that there are cosmic living organisms which communicate with each other by The Cosmic equivalence of sight sound Etc this of course suggests the possibility that the cosmic units present in the living organisms of the material sector may also be able to use these Cosmic communication channels however uh he eventually concludes that this is not possible the life units being physical entities are limited to using physical facilities and the physical facility is peculiar to the cosmic sector do not exist in the local environment the cosmic equivalent of sound for example cannot be used for communication in the material sector because we live in a cosmic equivalent in the cosmic equivalent of a vacuum so all communication must take place in the utilize the facilities of the material sector so Cosmic units may be able to communicate with each other but only really in the cosmic sector and only through these Cosmic means but that doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with life uh multicellular organisms and so on uh sector two communication signals even though non-material are physical phenomena and if present could be detected by our physical instruments since no physical trace of such communication has ever been found the physical evidence corroborates our theoretical conclusions now turning to level three we again find that the normal method of communication utilizes physical facilities ethical man uh you know the sector three uh component the sector three is like the boundary uh at least according to me um and this is you know the life unit is where the Cosmic unit takes control of the material unit um and then so you have a life unit but once life and that only happens once the material unit has evolved to its maximum complexity which is DNA so the physical the physical unit has to evolve all the way to DNA it&#x27;s most complex form and then only then is is it capable even of um handling a cosmic unit and that Cosmic unit takes control and that is life but then life has to evolve to the its most complex level and that is like the advanced intelligence of a human or humanoid or some type of complex uh some kind of complex intelligence and then once it gets to that point it can be taken control over by a uh sector 3 unit uh what you would call ethical unit um and so that is where ethical development or what is really Spiritual Development uh takes control over the overall life unit so now he&#x27;s talking about can this sector 3 this ethical unit communicate how does it communicate uh so that it can control the overall life unit ethical man under control of sector 3 communicates with his neighbors in exactly the same manner as a human being who is completely under the domination of sector two but when we examine the possibility of communication through other than normal channels we find that the situation in level three is quite different from that in level two the purely biological level the control unit is non-physical the control unit of sector 3 is non-physical and while it so it has no physical analogs whereas the cosmic sector is physical it&#x27;s just a kind of unobservable um the only way that we can figure out what&#x27;s going on in here is to take the reversal reverse the roles of time and space and then we can extrapolate from the actual physical so this SEC sector 2 is physical but it&#x27;s just kind of beyond our instruments to measure whereas the sector 3 unit is not even physical um we find that the situation in level three is quite different than level two uh the purely biological level the control unit is non-physical and while it can and usually does utilize the biological mechanisms over which it exercises direction as tools by which to communicate through physical channels it is not limited to these physical means of communication the significant Point here is that the control unit exists in a physical location by virtue of its association with the biological organism and also in a non-physical location a location in existence as a whole the general metaphysical region as we have called it by virtue of its own inherent nature we may compare The Coincidence of these two locations to the point of intersection of two lines such a point is located on both lines and if these lines of communication uh uh telephone lines for example communication via either line is feasible we have no direct knowledge of the means of communication that exists in secular three but in view of the multiplicity of communication media that are available there is an apple basis from which to extrapolate the existence of communication facilities to the metaphysical region in short Larson is basically laying the ground groundwork for things such as telepathy uh Clairvoyance and uh so on by saying that the sector 3 unit isn&#x27;t um constricted to these material uses we will get into that starting tomorrow okay have a great day and we&#x27;ll see you later</p>
