            <p>[Music] hi and welcome to PostScript nice to have you with us today I&#x27;m John Peterson from the Arlington Institute and we get together like this about once a month and it&#x27;s usually associated with our program that we do locally call transition talks the Arlington Institute for almost 30 years now has sponsored a speaker series where we bring marvelous provocative interesting speakers from all over the world to come and talk about the extraordinary change that&#x27;s going on in the world today we&#x27;re in the middle of annek an amazing kind of transition from one ERA to a new one and the new world is going to be populated by new humans that operate in different ways and have different characteristics and the new world is going to have a whole new set of values and other such things it&#x27;s a literally a paradigm shift and so we&#x27;re happy to have our old friend dr. Harold put off with us here today how it&#x27;s nice to have you with us thanks I&#x27;m good to be your you and I go back quite a ways yes many hours many towns other play all around the world kind of doing on one thing or another for our for our viewers you&#x27;re a quantum physicist by education beauty and I guess you&#x27;re best known for being in their early seventies starting the remote-viewing program at SR I which was that Stanford Research Institute I&#x27;m and were use psychics to essentially for those governments to spy on us for the CIA and yeah yeah yeah tell us quickly about that and then we&#x27;ll talk about some other kind of things well I was a straight physicist got my PhD at Stanford had just published quantum electronics book graduate level published in English French and Russian and one of the things that kind of bugged me was well what about consciousness is that can you account for that in our physics and so on so I was kind of searching around for ways to look into that kind of thing and so just on a lark I didn&#x27;t experiment with a famous psychic who perturbed some well-shielded quantum chips and yeah Ingo Swann yeah and I circulated that around and so suddenly the CIA landed on my doorstep and said oh we&#x27;ve been looking for you you know the Russians and East Bloc countries are spending millions of dollars a year on quote ESP and no scientists in America even believes there is such they had and turns out I am I my my background aside from my physics has been an intelligence community I was a naval intelligence officer spent several years at NSA National Security Agency so he lived into my background asked me since he&#x27;s so I had all the clearances and everything well since you&#x27;re willing to do this experiment kind of on a lark would you be willing to look at this field for us of course their idea was you know I&#x27;m hoping you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s all nonsense but anyway they grew into a 23 year program working for many parts of the government top secret programs and so on and training army intelligence officers and yeah that kind of thing but at some point I wanted to get back to my physics so I had accepted a position to be director of these two Advanced Studies in Austin and took it thinking okay well that&#x27;s the end of my work with the government and that&#x27;s good there&#x27;s only a few years later and the government I was looking into how to deal with the UFO problem as you would say mm-hmm we say UAP unidentified aerial phenomena and so I&#x27;m gonna look into something weird like that who you gonna call right well so I got involved in that program that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be speaking to your audience today about yeah when we&#x27;re really looking forward to that and you and I have always had this ongoing conversation for a better part of thirty years almost know about whether there was life somewhere else and how it all worked and we&#x27;ve been involved in a couple interesting little projects where we tried to anticipate what kind of the disclosure or if alien life showed up you know how how what would the implications be how it had changed the world and so on it yeah those are some of the most interesting sort of projects yeah are involved in now but now you&#x27;re involved in something that from my point of view is really quite profound for years for decades it was kind of known and presumed that there was some kind of interaction with UFOs you AP&#x27;s this alien life I mean there&#x27;s reports thousands if not millions of reports all over the world for years and years that something was going on and systematically over time then different other countries started to declassify their reports and their their history and these kinds of things but the United States always was the kind of doled out you know and and so you had all this other stuff going on and the u.s. always said oh well no we don&#x27;t have anything about any of that and there&#x27;s a truth the matter is in the deep background there was a continuous study yeah from the 40s onward and but most of it we thought we&#x27;d never see the light of day and then suddenly December 2017 New York Times had a front-page story on having dug out the existence of this program and so up till then the media sort of treated this was sort of a tinfoil hat crowd thing our Friday afternoon if you didn&#x27;t have any other news or whatever but now suddenly you have people coming forward like senators and pilots from f-18 jets carriers and people in the intelligence and government communities starting to come forth so that was really sort of a gate gate changer game changer well as I&#x27;ve told you I think it&#x27;s kind of the watershed then when you and some of your associates and friends who were involved in some of these programs and came forward and all stood on the stage I mean really class act serious kind of people and said this is very real and we ought to do something about it and we&#x27;ve got hundreds of case studies and videos and all kinds of things and suddenly it became the defect of the United States has been decided that that that they&#x27;re going to come out or or begin the process of disclosure I guess that&#x27;s right recently the number of videos of taken by f-18 pilots have been released and so took a bit a time but finally the Navy came out and announced that in fact these are not faith or whatever these are real things and we don&#x27;t understand what they are and so they admitted for the first time actually first time the government to say yes we have evidence of unidentified aerial phenomena that we simply can&#x27;t identify and we know it&#x27;s important and so finally they actually issued orders for pilots f-18 pilots typically off of carriers and so on to report their sightings it turns out sightings men have been going on for well over decades but the pilots didn&#x27;t want to report them because yeah they&#x27;re gonna think I&#x27;m drunker Sobers okay and I&#x27;ll lose my flight status now the Navy has issued a requirement that pilots must report any sightings because they&#x27;ve had some encounters where it involve possible safety concerns yeah flying right between a couple of jets that are on a mission and suddenly something comes through and so so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a new era with in the government&#x27;s view and the military&#x27;s view toward at least admitting something&#x27;s going on yeah what do you think is going on actually I&#x27;m not sure we have lots of data lots of it unexplained good data to work with good pilot reports but generally speaking exactly what&#x27;s going on let&#x27;s go back a little bit in you know historically there&#x27;s some kind of iconic events that everybody knows about Roswell and so on where these craft crashed what do you think about that I mean is that all real or not or what well I don&#x27;t specifically know about Roswell because my involvement has been looking at at recent data there may have been some crashes oh my god there are claims and people coming forward with pieces of material right and they came claim came from crashes yeah yeah so we&#x27;re at least taking it seriously enough to examine material like that that it provided to us see if there&#x27;s anything we can learn from it yeah do you have any sense for instance from your background weather why are they coming or where these vehicles are coming from yeah I&#x27;m being as a scientist and it&#x27;s my role to do this I&#x27;m being very careful to not try to speculate so in fact I&#x27;ve got a whole model called the ultra terrestrial model which names every possibility of you know what could this be other domain is it your mother and it&#x27;s another solar systems is there some secret say corporate America aerospace yeah yeah or some stranded people from elsewhere I mean until we actually have the data I&#x27;m really staying away well an actual my colleagues generally are staying away from it&#x27;s a good position as a matter of fact you and I have an old friend Jacques belli who has built a very compelling and profound kind of career around suggesting that these things are not at all the kind of the physical phenomena that we think of them are or at least that&#x27;s not the origins of what it is and so there&#x27;s all spectrum of possibilities here in the and obviously there&#x27;s enough effort to try to convince you that it&#x27;s all physical or manifest into this dimension or whatever it turns out to be but it could be yeah it could be something else entirely that just presents itself as its physical so they&#x27;re they&#x27;re more unknowns and many questions to try to answer than there are unknowns well we&#x27;ve had people here in in the speaker series of transition talks to talked about archons and jinn and other dimensional kind of entities who all can manifest themselves and do shape-shifting and come in and so on and I&#x27;ve literally sat here across from somebody as closely as you a friend of mine and had him say well yeah I watched this black helicopter that turned into a crow and then turned into an hour no I mean yeah God what in the world how does this all work yeah you mentioned John Cole a he&#x27;s first why&#x27;s this wonderful book called wonders in the sky where he traced really it was a quality approach all the way back to you know thousands of years ago and then on up through the centuries of these kinds of kinds of observations and as part of his presentation he and my colleague Eric Davis put together a seven layer kind of model for what could be happening ranging all the way from purely physical through interdimensional things up to spiritual manifestations so it&#x27;s when when we switch to the concept of unidentified aerial phenomenon that that&#x27;s really a good label yeah well you&#x27;re involved now with to the Stars Academy and talk to us a little bit about what you&#x27;re trying to do because I guess from in Europe you&#x27;re probably the most substantial kind of entity or organization that&#x27;s focused on this area and and working in multiple kind of dimensions to try to generate more awareness about it and under my becoming part of founding to the Stars Academy of Arts and Science interesting history many of us that were working in the program that they got revealed by New York Times and other people senators coming out and talking about it nonetheless in the government it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a tough row to hoe it&#x27;s not exactly career enhancing yeah in charge of the UFO issue and so a lot of data that could be shared for example the videos that are now all over the internet and on TV were just languishing in Pentagon servers and but they could be Declassified and released and so on and so a number of us that were involved in the program decided you know that there should be an open group of people who know a lot about what&#x27;s going on and we need to bring what be shared out out into the public and get a conversation going and so several of us got together and formed to the stars Academy of Arts and Science interestingly enough the fellow who got it started was Tom DeLonge of blink-182 a rock star yeah but it turned out that in the background he&#x27;s always been interested in UFOs and ESP and that kind of thing and he had a lot of good connections into people and aerospace corporations in the government and said you know there should be an organization that the degree we can be discussing this in the open seriously you know we should do that so he decided to form to the stars and so some of the people we have associated with with our group are for example Lou Elizondo who in fact Rand the program in the Pentagon and left to come in our he is part of to the stars we have Kristen Ellen who was a former Undersecretary of defense for intelligence and so he&#x27;s part of our operation Steve justice yes ran black programs with billion dollar budgets for Lockheed Martin skunk works he&#x27;s part of our new Jim simav an who I knew four years from cia&#x27;s actually a true James Bond kind of guy worked in the Director of Operations and so he&#x27;s joined our group and then we pulled together some scientists to how to work with and so on and so our activities have ranged all over the place from behind the scenes we do end up talking to congressional committees and Senators and so on i briefed congressional committees twice on yeah on the program and then in the science area and aerospace area we&#x27;re trying to raise funds to do some some really forward-looking look into the best of what we know scientifically to try to explain how such craft if they&#x27;re physical could operate mm-hmm and and then the general science group that says you know there are a lot of taboo subjects you AP&#x27;s UFO maybe SETI all that psychokinesis whatever these should not be throwing babies out with bathwater we should we should take a good look at them and so and we&#x27;re forming good relationships with corporate entities with government entities to do serious kind of thing and T TSA for example last season had a series of episodes on the History Channel called unidentified and it wasn&#x27;t your usual UFO Hunters or something like that instead that was primarily Lou Elizondo actually interviewing the f-18 pilots interviewing the radar operator involved with tracking all this stuff and so actually getting facts out instead of fiction yeah and so that&#x27;s that that edge an educational aspect we think is important so it&#x27;s kind of like educational and entertainment and research and you kind of evolved across the whole across the board yeah and again there are many people in the what in the UFO space but that there&#x27;s a substance and there&#x27;s a kind of a critical mass about what you&#x27;ve let you go brought together that it is really quite encouraging and appealing I&#x27;ve suggested to you that I believe that a decade from now this whole subject matter will have been opened up so much and will have turned into something quite different than what it is right now and potentially even ongoing conversations with alien life or on extraterrestrial life or whatever and and the world will be so different then you&#x27;ll be able to point back and say to folks like you and your your associates at ETS a that was the watershed that was when the window opened right and that began to legitimate and one of the things that was going to emerge from this is that there are other countries of course who also have their sighting their archives and at least claim to have some pieces of craft and that kind of thing but they learned early on that sharing it with the US government was not such a great idea because it disappears into a black hole and yeah I never learn anything so once we set up to the Stars Academy we&#x27;ve gone back and made connections with these leaders in foreign countries we&#x27;ve talked to generals from Brazil and whatever and so we&#x27;ve said you know look this is a public benefit corporation we&#x27;re going to share data that we Payne so if you come up with stuff that you think we should be looking at whether the videos or interviews with your pilot&#x27;s or pieces of materials that seem exotic whatever collaborate with us yes and we&#x27;ll see this sees the light of day and so we have many conversations going on with people in other countries and so that&#x27;s going to be a big game changer movement it&#x27;s a public benefit corporation by the way public benefit corporation it&#x27;s sort of kind of lies halfway between just money raising kind of thing like crowdfunding or an IP corporation or whatever you know it&#x27;s kind of in the middle it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a new category where people can buy shares they&#x27;re not yet to be traded right on in in the market but it&#x27;s an SEC corporation eventually if they if we have an IP they&#x27;ll be able to convert their shares and trade them on the market but meanwhile it&#x27;s a big piece of the public benefit corporation that whatever you&#x27;re doing you have to show that you&#x27;re benefiting the public independent of sharing shares with individual so that&#x27;s why providing information with these TV interviews and so on is as part of that you know as would be natural I guess there&#x27;s a lot of criticism or people that are sniping about TTS a-about oh you guys are all still the front for the CIA and in in things like that and and obviously you all have relationships continuing the relationships with the government or you can&#x27;t forget what you knew and the and the people that you knew but the but there&#x27;s something a lot kind of bigger here and by that I mean that the government and and potentially particularly the people of your associates come out of the defense in the intelligence community and they&#x27;re already entered toward toward threats I mean that is the business that&#x27;s the business it&#x27;s a mindset and so I&#x27;ve listened to any of a number of interviews where people were all critical of Lou Elizondo who or who else a bit saying that all they want to do is look at threats entered well that&#x27;s their business that&#x27;s where they came from I mean I&#x27;ve been in that business in the past and so I understand about it but on the other hand there&#x27;s the whole business of this emergence in the of a new era in terms of the evolution of humanity that is the that&#x27;s I&#x27;m particularly interested in it can you talk at all about that and have you thought much about that kind of aspect of where the species is going and how that&#x27;s opening up to new ideas and a larger sense of reality I think I can let me start with the the concern that the critics have said that were just some front for the CIA or whatever although many of us come out of intelligence and defense came out and so on believe me we are not a front for them they would just assume that we went away because if anything the fact that there&#x27;s so much more discussion and conversation and in the public media at this that makes problems for them because routing and foi a request and so on so so no no we&#x27;re we&#x27;re a group of people who have sort of our thinking as you say have been concerned about threat in the past that that&#x27;s just the way it is but we think that there&#x27;s a bigger issue here and bigger issue here involved and you know if it should eventually lead to let&#x27;s say contact with aliens or multi-dimensional creatures or you know who knows what I mean obviously that&#x27;s gonna make a big difference and so from my own background starting out as a really straight arrow physicist and then getting drawn into the remote viewing program the CIA and dia and then finding out oh my gosh there are people who just sitting in their armchairs at home can with a little bit of training a little bit of instruction really see events elsewhere and so on so that opens up a whole new window that yeah there&#x27;s a lot gary already you know what you ordinarily think it is and then finally getting into the UFO area and seeing the complexities there and it&#x27;s unbelievably complex so the main take-home message is our usual sort of ordinary view of reality is really really a small element and I mean there are all kinds of things I mean like healing healers and that yeah yeah as also fellow the Fetzer Institute did we look at some shaman healing in China and that kind of theme and there&#x27;s some amazing things going on so so I think that each of these are all pushes and new directions to say the human being is much more right and but ordinarily our educational system tells us it is and so so they&#x27;ve always been in these quote fringe groups that pursue these elements but doesn&#x27;t become part of the mainstream but I think now that we have many elements coming forth with better and better documentation I might say for example in the UFO area or the UAP area we now have military platforms that are so technically exquisite you can no longer say well maybe it was just the flare oh yeah I know you&#x27;ve got great detailed data and in the alternative medicine area we now have excellent investigations DNA analysis and you name it so so they&#x27;re areas like that are showing new new outcomes and of course in the remote remote viewing era that&#x27;s so-called area I mean that that&#x27;s just a whole new element of finding out that sure hoe talent within the human being that&#x27;s I mean we found in the program that we did that you know it&#x27;s a bell curve like everywhere everything else you got virtuosos that went into the scale tone deaf people at the other but most anybody in the middle can learn to play an instrument play a tune well it turns out the same thing with it ordinarily gets labeled paranormal phenomena that it&#x27;s a bell curve distribution some countries like India take it for granted yeah countries and the Western culture basically don&#x27;t and so that&#x27;s coming to the fore so all these things are beginning to knit together and beginning to reveal much expanded view of human life and even gets to the point where for example in remote viewing we did some challenges about Investors are so great why don&#x27;t they make money at the stock market or Las Vegas or whatever and so we did some experiments where we use that process to do silver futures right 30 days in the market we made two hundred sixty thousand dollars right and so the fact that you in principle could even see into the future and have actual documented proof with great statistics and money in your pocket right you begin to realize well there&#x27;s a whole aspect that people are not absolutely tied to the present there&#x27;s some element okay it turns out that fortunately at the same time our expansion of ideas and quantum physics with quantum entanglement and nonlocality and all these kinds of things that physicists are very busy gathering really good data on but they haven&#x27;t made it into the mainstream thinking as to who we are yet and what we can do but when all of that gets integrated you know we&#x27;re gonna have a whole new picture yeah well what you&#x27;ve described quite delightfully is this convergence from multiple kind of dimensions that is reconfiguring the kind of the essential nature of who human beings are the understanding of who we are and moving us from one ERA to another one and in that process all the old ideas kind of implode or collapse and a whole bunch of new ones come up and what you and your associates at TTS a are doing is an integral part of that an important part of that and we&#x27;re really pleased to have you here today and looking forward to what you have to say well I&#x27;m looking forward to the presenting my data yes we appreciate your being with us thanks Helen well thanks for the invitation I appreciate you and thank you for being with us we try to do this on a regular basis we&#x27;ll be back about once a month and we&#x27;ve got Joanie Petry coming next month Joanie patria is a world-class astrologer quite a force on the internet and she&#x27;s going to come and talk about long-term what the astrological kind of indicators are for the changes that are coming in the next five to seven years and so that&#x27;ll be interesting and we hope that you&#x27;ll come you can find out complete information on our program at transition talks dot org transition talks org and we&#x27;re located here in Berkeley Springs West Virginia just 100 miles from Washington and Baltimore and it&#x27;s a wonderful little resort town where you can come and spend a weekend and get provoked intellectually as well as getting massaged and all kinds of good things for your for your mind and your spirit in your body and we hope that you&#x27;ll come and be with us and so thanks again I&#x27;m John Peterson from the Arlington Institute and we thank you for coming and beaten with us in post great [Music]</p>
