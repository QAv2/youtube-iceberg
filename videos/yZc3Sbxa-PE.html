            <p>Free energy suppression (or new energy suppression) is a conspiracy theory that technologically viable, pollution-free, no-cost energy sources are being suppressed by government, corporations, or advocacy groups. Devices allegedly suppressed include perpetual motion machines, cold fusion generators, torus-based generators, reverse-engineered extraterrestrial</p>
<p>technology and other generally unproven, low-cost energy sources.. The alleged suppression (or weakening) is claimed to have occurred since the mid-19th century and allegedly perpetrated by various government agencies, corporate powers, special interest groups, and fraudulent inventors. The special interest groups are usually claimed</p>
<p>to be associated with the fossil fuel or nuclear industry, whose business model would be threatened.Claims of suppression include: The claim that the scientific community has controlled and suppressed research into alternative avenues of energy generation via the institutions of peer review and academic pressure. The claim that devices exist which are capable</p>
<p>of extracting significant and usable power from pre-existing unconventional energy reservoirs, such as the quantum vacuum zero point energy, for little or no cost, but are being suppressed.Some examples of individuals who were allegedly suppressed, harassed or killed for their research are: Thomas Henry Moray, Stanley Meyer and Eugene Mallove. == See also ==</p>
