            <p>[Music] in the ranching Heartland of America a plot of land known as Skinwalker Ranch has been dubbed the strangest place on Earth the ranch is a large 480 acre property located in Northeast Utah uent County not far from the small town of Rosevelt this property borders the UT Indian Reservation whose people are set to not enter this area as they believe the territory is a hot spot for skim Walker activity the Ute people take this very seriously believing the Skin Walkers to be powerful spirits who inhabit the land due to a curse placed upon them and the land Generations Ago by the Navajo tribe the youth and Navajo tribes have a deep and complex pass together featuring a lot of conflict and territorial disputes while there may not be a singular definitive event that can be pointed to in which the belief of the curse originated the most popular belief is that it arose due to these conflicts for instance in the 19th century the Navajo people had claimed the Basin and the area in which the ranch would later be built the Navajo people thought of this land as a paradise as it provided crystal clear water and prime hunting spots but this wouldn&#x27;t last though and the land was coveted by others the Ute tribe came in force and attacked took Navajo prisoners and sold them to the Spanish while staking their own claim on the area people believe that this was the reason the navajos was said to have retaliated with the curse in the form of a spirit that could shape shift into anything it wanted thus the skin walker was born however others have debated that the goal of this legend or C might have been to dissuade European settlers from the land in the for claw the skim Walkers themselves are dark creatures birthed from black magic and this is a magic that they wield as the name might suggest they are said to have the ability to shapeshift into whatever they desire perhaps deciding to appear as an animal or in some cases resemble a person in their natural state it&#x27;s said that their eyes glow red which makes them stand out in the darkness their physical prowess is said to be far greater than our own being faster and stronger they are also said to be care capable of affecting people mentally driving them mad or making them act in ways that they wouldn&#x27;t normally one way or another the fkw paints them as a creature that is best avoided at all cost whether or not the curse is real imagined exaggerated always intended to keep people aware at the center of this whole story is the ranch the you people say that this Ranch is the path of the skin walker and tribe members as said do not venture too close believing it&#x27;s to be dangerous the earliest mention of unusual things happening in this region that I could find came from the late 1700s Spanish explorers searching for the Spanish Trail passed through the uint Basin the future site of the ranch at nights while sitting together in their Camp next to their warm fires they would describe seeing unusual things and lights moving in the sky above unfortunately detailed and verifiable records from the 1700s in this area are scarce but there are accounts by explorers and missionaries of observing things that they did not understand mostly while these groups traversed what is now New Mexico Utah Colorado and Arizona they documented their journey and encounters with the Native Americans among these accounts there are occasional references to Celestial phenomena like comets and meteors but there are more unusual accounts of strange lights or things in the sky for instance in 17 1976 father Escalante was part of an expeditionary group trying to find a land route from Santa Fe New Mexico to Montery located on the coast of California during a portion of this trip they found themselves in Utah and specifically the winter Basin where Escalante reported seeing and I quote a strange Fireball fly across the sky I believe that most of these incidents were interpreted through a religious lens the legend of this place Place didn&#x27;t want to just remain in the past moving towards the present in 1911 settlers in the area reported hearing strange noises in which they did not understand the point of origin The Sounds were described as large distant echoing bangs resembling the sound of thunder at first these sounds Disturbed those in the area but they became frequent occurring through day and night all year round later these sounds were thought to be as a result of L of rock crashing against one another along the fault present there aside from that the earliest accounts from the 20th century that I can find seemed to begin in the 1950s and onwards for instance similar to Escalante&#x27;s observation in the summer of 1956 a description was given by a local that was quite reminiscent Sandy Richmond stated that while to the east of bridgland there it was observed that an orange ball around 100 ft overhead flew above a hill and down towards the river it was said to be humming and fast this was around 30 m or so away from the ranch some accounts vary slightly but remain along these lines for example in mid June of 1965 Brent D young of Dry Fork stated that he thought he saw a bright star in the sky but then it got closer to him before flying aware there are many others of this type but also those who have reported seeing something more detailed than just a light in the sky from the&#x27; 60s and onwards there are incidents of particularly awful things occurring in regards to cattle and other animals which I have a full video on the topic on my patreon because it&#x27;s difficult to go in depth on YouTube but these incidents typically involve animals disappearing than the body being found with odd qualities and circumstances sometime later again though whether these incidents have a rational explanation or not the U County became a hot spot for this kind of unusual activity now this brings us to 1994 when Gwen and Terry Sherman purchased the ranch from Kenneth and Edith Meers who had eared it since the 1930s at some point as the Myers aged they left the ranch to live elsewhere essentially leaving it abandoned though it was on occasion visited by members of the me family wanting to live a peaceful Rural Life the Shermans felt that they could fix the place up to their liking and so move their family and livestock to the site while they may have been hoping for a peaceful existence given their later accounts that we&#x27;ll get into their time at the ranch was anything but peaceful the Shermans had the ranch for 2 years before making the hard decision to leave in their own words they could no longer stand what was happening to them and their family at that place during their ownership of the ranch the Sherman family made some extraordinary claims of having been subject to highly unusual incidents Terry himself already had a lot of experience raising cattle and believed this to be the perfect place not only to raise them but also his two children on the very first day that the Shermans arrived at their new home Terry was greeted by what he considered a very strange and unusual sight Terry described that there were dead bolts on the doors and windows as if to keep Intruders out in the middle of nowhere some of the doors and windows had dead bolts on both the inside and out and Metal bars placed over the windows attached to their property were large chains that looked to Terry like they served the purpose of restraining heavy animals his best guess was that the Meyers must have positioned large guard dogs to the front and back of the property what they were supposed to be guarding against Terry wasn&#x27;t sure and said that it was something that confused him but he set that aside and began unpacking on the very first day that the shamans took possession of the property while unpacking Terry and the the rest of the family spotted what he thought was an enormous coyote or wolf in one of their pastures close by to make matters even more bizarre this wolf started to approach the Shermans Terry said that it didn&#x27;t appear aggressive and therefore felt it was Tim and must have been owned by a local according to the Shermans this wolf was massive and it allowed the family to pet it displaying no signs of aggression at all Terry was just in awe at how big this thing was was and the family didn&#x27;t believe that this was just a regular wolf it was incredibly muscular and far taller than you&#x27;d expect for a wolf that day it had been raining quite heavily and the shamans described that it smelled of pent wet dog after a few moments of awe confusion and wondering just what they were looking at the wolf wandered over towards a livestock pen where it found an unsuspecting Cal this calf was curious and pushed his head between the coral bars which is when the wolf struck grabbing with its teeth and trying to force the cth through the bars Terry and his son grabbed some nearby sticks and began hitting at the wolf which probably wasn&#x27;t the best idea but thankfully it didn&#x27;t turn against them this didn&#x27;t work out though and the Wolf was not fed by the blurs things immediately take a bizarre turn needing to handle this quickly before further damage was done Terry told his son to retrieve his Magnum he opened up to the wolf with four rounds each round Struck it from a closer distance until he was right up against this thing the wolf seemed unfaced he reported but it did release the calf it just stood there watching the family it made no attempt to run away or leave Terry continued using even greater Firepower but all the impact produced was a piece of tissue and hair from the creature the wolf remained calm and trotted off across a pasture into a wet Brushy area Terry and his son tracked the creature for over a mile away from the ranch but he was unable to keep up with it and then lost it completely after watching it enter into a tree line despite this the ground was wet and they could clearly see a direction of travel but soon the tracks just came to an abrupt end and they could follow it no further the pair didn&#x27;t really know what to make of this so they stuck around for a while just looking before heading home hoping that they&#x27;d scared it off for good and would be left alone Upon returning home the retrieved tissue apparently had a very strong Ur that of rotting meat in the days to come after this incident the family did see other canines on the property but they didn&#x27;t have another incident like this until some weeks later this time though it would be Gwen that was the recipient of the unknown it was either the same creature as the one the family came into contact with on the moving day or perhaps a similar one but Gwen stated that she was inside her car when this thing walked up to her she said that whatever it was was so big that its back was parallel with the top of her window as it Stood Beside the car she also said that this enormous wolf was accompanied by another canine that she could not identify the Sherman family just wanted and hoped for normaly to return but these incidents were only the first of many that would disturb the family and we&#x27;ve barely even scratched the surface yet over the course of the next 2 years the Wolves wen&#x27;t the only things that bothered them they were plagued with a range of strange occurrences that both they and neighbors had reported to the police while driving into the ranch on a very bright afternoon Terry and Gwen saw something in the distance chasing and attacking one of their horses the description of this thing was that it was low to the ground looked heavily muscled perhaps weighing 200 lb with red curly hair and a bushy tail from the distance they were they didn&#x27;t know if it was some kind of hyena or another one of these canine like creatures Terry chased this thing down and got within 40 ft of it and said that it was so fast that it just vanished Terry was shaken and upon inspecting the horse found numerous claw Maxs on its body and legs interestingly enough a few months after this incident it was stated that the wife of the deputy sheriff reported seeing a similar muscular reddish Beast running across the property another visitor to the ranch had an ominous encounter in the middle Homestead this visitor along with Terry and his son said that they saw a large Blair something moving through the trees towards the pasture covering a 100 yards in seconds the account goes that this thing came upon the visitor quickly and upon reaching him let out a furious Roar that was loud enough to be head hundreds of yards away in all directions the description of this thing was that it was nearly invisible and the visitor stated that he was so scared and wed up over what happened that he grabbed a hold of Terry as hard as he could the sh Germans reported other such intense incidents with beings that they described as 9 foot and void like in terms of the color in circles that are interested in such things these beings are often referred to as shadow people these incidents would often follow up with overwhelmingly strong urds within and outside the home not all of the incidents were as intense as the ones like that others were trickster for example Terry and the family began noticing that certain items would go missing around the ranch items that you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily expect to just go missing either like heavy and large equipment Terry apparently reported that a 70lb post digger just outright disappeared after he&#x27;d placed it down left the area for a few minutes came back and it was gone allegedly this post digger was found sometime later 20 ft up in a tree similar to those in 1911 who heard the thunderous distant rumbling the Shermans claimed to have heard what sounded to them like heavy machinery being operated beneath the ground though I suppose the earlier explanation of the fault line could perhaps explain such sounds others were just outright weird it was stated that the Shermans had observed their pastures lighting up at night like a football stadium they were quoted as saying that they&#x27;d seen shafts of light that seemed to emanate from the ground these types of incidents would correlate with seeing strange lights in the sky and on occasion they could see what these lights belong to the description given by the Shermans are reminiscent to descriptions given in the 50s 60s and Beyond in the area here are a couple examples of that in the spring of 1956 a man by the name of Sam Bru 3 Mi east of Roosevelt or 23 Mi east of the ranch reported seeing a silver Dome hovering and moving in the sky he said that it was around the size of a small house and humming as it traveled at the time Sam was out hunting and was able to use a scope for a better view he stated that he believed that he saw a person standing at a window in this dome in addition to this he said that he felt a pressure bearing down on him that he believed emanated from this thing months later on the 20th of July 1956 Bill lock who was 72 mil west of Roosevelt saw another silver Dome traveling at great speed he said that it had a dark band around the middle whistling and screeching as it flew the Shermans one evening reported seeing something like this they not doome shied but rather they said shaped like a refrigerator during this incident Terry his son and his nephew all witnessed lights on his land quite some distance away from the home itself headlights and tear lights they thought they believed that someone was trespassing and using an RV on their property Terry wanted to confront the trespassers and have them leave but as the three began and closing in on the lights they were left stunned Terry recalled that as they got closer and closer the lights in total silence lifted and began moving away from them Terry the nephew and Son slowed down but continued in the direction of the lights and they watched as they Rose 50 ft into the air I&#x27;d imagine and hope that it was this exact moment that Terry realized it wasn&#x27;t an RV he got a good look at this thing that was flying silently above it and descri Des cried it as a refrigerator ship the whole series of weirdness at the ranch was deeply confusing disturbing but also interesting to Terry who wanted to know more about what was happening so during the nights sometimes he would go out patrolling his land looking to see if anything was happening Terry would reportedly see lights moving around in the darkness as well as the objects earlier mentioned he would report seeing silent objects sometimes big sometimes small that hovered over the ground these things he said would flash an array of colors all over the place Terry seemed to think that they might be looking for something though he didn&#x27;t know what apparently he believed that during these events once they had noticed his presence they would leave Gwen also saw something like this from her car as she returned home again like Terry she believed that they had an RV trespassing on their land but that was quickly dispelled when she saw the thing open she said that some sort of doorway opened and she could see a very tall figure in the entrance perhaps 7t or larger wearing a black uniform staring right at her in another instance Terry&#x27;s nephew and I believe Terry himself was present but the nephew stated that he&#x27;d heard a disembodied conversation in a language he didn&#x27;t understand these voices he said spoke as if to be mocking in some Manner and sounded like they were emanating 20 ft or so above them their dogs also reacted to these voices with barks and growls and clearly not wanting to be in the area anymore incidents like this would also be accompanied by sightings of what the Sherman described as glowing orbs usually of an orange color all members of the family saw them and I believe that the obbs were the most common experience on the ranch Terry said that he would just sit and watch them flirt and zip around for hours using his scope for a better View usually they would appear over a group of trees around a mile or so away Terry also believed that this area was the home to a portal of some description reportedly Terry had seen a large orange section of the sky and in the center was a blue hole he believed the Blue Hole was the sky peering through the middle of this Mass whatever it was he said that while watching this thing he would see objects coming out of it at Great speeds there were other physical manifestations too one morning Terry had gone to check on the herd in the third Homestead only to be greeted by a large hole in the ground it had appeared that someone had somehow scooped out hundreds of pounds of soil from the ground the edges were said to be perfect and the hole itself resembled something like concentric circles speaking of circles the Shermans also found something similar to crop circles on their land one formation that was found in their pasture consisted of three Circles of FL grass each circle approximately 8 ft in diameter and they were arranged in a triangular likee pattern each triangle was said to be around 30 ft away from the others bear in mind there is only one Road in and out of this property so if someone was just messing with the Shermans you think that they would have seen them coming or going it&#x27;s also important to highlight that the longer the Sherman stayed at the ranch the incidents also escalated in their nature the the family were often left confused or spooked by these events but they were never actually harmed by them whether talking about the orbs the Wolves the hovering objects or beings that they&#x27;d seen they were never threatened directly by anything it&#x27;s not even clear if there was a singular phenomena responsible for all of the events or if each category of incident was unrelated to one another but whatever the case may be whatever was happening on the ranch took a turn the following was documented in quite some detail by rents.com first let&#x27;s talk about the animals Terry wasn&#x27;t the average farmer he had college degrees and Advanced Training in animal husbandry he was considered an expert when it came to artificial insemination and had plans for raising high-end hybrid stock at the ranch it&#x27;s important to note that the sharan&#x27;s kept a very close watch on their stock with all the strangeness surrounding the ranch they were observant and diligent despite their increased efforts to watch and guard over their stock some sort of malevolent presence began to exact a terrible toll cows would disappear and later be found in the fields still and motionless eyes would be missing or crescent like ships carved out Terry would find no tracks leading to the point of Discovery making it completely unclear as to how the cows even got to their final place of rest there would be nothing on the ground to indicate an attack no fluids on the ground and Terry had no idea what could cause such a thing he noticed that the carcass would typically emit a strong musky order a smell he would come to know far too well as said Terry was an experienced Rancher but this is also true for hunting he was highly familiar with the capabilities of predators but he did not believe that this was being done by anything he was familiar with whatever was doing the hunting of the cows was doing it with surgical like precision as said no fluids in the animals were left nor would the fluids be found on the ground their dogs started to develop anxieties or perhaps even paranoia they preferred to remain in their dog houses for days at a time and displaying fearful behaviors six of the family cats vanished in a single night and speaking of which cows also started disappearing altogether there were many that he simply just never recovered and never found them anywhere around the ranch for months this went on and during the time that these events were occurring Terry noticed that yellow lights would appear over the ranch these yellow orbs or lights or whatever they were would be accompanied by bad weather conditions either during or after their visit Terry came to associate incidents with the cows with these yellow lights so once he saw one he knew what to expect shortly thereafter there were incidents in which Terry would spot random hoof prints that led into the field but the tracks would simply stop as if the animal had vanished right there and then at the end of the tracks in the end 14 of their prized animals vanished or whose carcass was found under bizarre circumstances in one instance Terry&#x27;s son had checked on one of the cows which just 5 minutes after being checked on was found in a similar manner to that we&#x27;ve discussed something had cut a hole 6 in wide and 18 in deep in its rear there was nothing on the snowcovered ground to indicate that anything had just happened on another day Terry found another carcass and this time noted a brownish liquid on the ground next to it he described it as being gel-like and cold to the touch needless to say but losing 14 expensive animals from the head put the family in a difficult position and was leading to significant financial difficulties cattle are not inexpensive after all one April afternoon Terry and Gwen drove to a nearby town for supplies as they left they made a passing comment and had a short back and forth to one another about how much trouble they would be in should something happen to one of their prized Bulls Upon returning to the ranch around an hour later all four of the Bulls were missing from the pasture the Shermans immediately in a panic began searching all over the property but they couldn&#x27;t find a trace of these Bulls inside the Corral is a metal trailer and Terry hadn&#x27;t checked it because the Bulls had no way of getting in there as there was a thick metal wire securing it but sure enough knowing that weird things tended to to happen on the ranch he checked it and all four Were Somehow inside cramped in the small interior Terry said that they appeared to be in a dazed or trans-like state but once he&#x27;d made his presence NN by calling to Gwen they woke up and began thrashing around trying to get out soon after this took place there was evidence present that the bars that held the trailer together had been magnetized somehow it was also noted that it would have been practically impossible to get these four massive Bulls together inside this small space it was stated that they would have been panicked and maddened before you could get them inside the magnetization of the bars then apparently went away over the course of the next 48 hours we&#x27;ve mentioned the orb sightings already but it was actually one such incident involving the orbs that made the Shermans realize that it was high time to leave they believed that the ranch was becoming more and more dangerous over time and that things were escalating one evening in May 1996 ter was outside with three of his dogs when he noticed a blue or dancing around in the field not far from the ranch house the or was close to the ground and the dogs gave chers Terry was unable to recall them it was stated that this or flew around just outside the reach of the dogs as they tried to jump at it as if teasing them it was stated that this or LED them further and further away from Terry and into a thick Brushy area that bordered the field the OB and the dogs then went behind the tree line and Terry said he heard terrible Yelps followed by a deafening silence he called for them hoping they would come back but there was no response feeling it was too dangerous to follow them out into the brush in total darkness Terry waited for the morning to go find them instead of finding the dogs what he found were three round spots of dried and brittle vegetation in the middle of each circle was a black greasy lump Terry came to the conclusion that his dogs had somehow quite literally been melted or rather incinerated by something right there the Shermans were conflicted they had a lot of money tied up in the ranch but it seems that with everything going on they felt that financially it was only going to get worse for them if they remain there that and following the loss of their dogs they realized it was time to leave but the family also felt very conscious about passing the ranch over to an unsuspecting buyer or family who didn&#x27;t sign up for the extra weirdness present the final straw had been reached though and it was time to sell so the shamans went public with the strange happenings at the ranch Terry spoke to a reporter at Desert news which was one of the most popular outlets in Utah at the time while he did go public he was also quite reserved at that time with the details he gave to Desert news he knew full well that this was going to lead to ridicule and a total loss of privacy but the family just wanted out and they wanted to leave ethically so in late June of 1996 desert news printed the story and as you might imagine this drew a lot of attention to the property people were showing up uninvited wanting to investigate and hoping to see or experience something odd while the Shermans rejected most of these visitors he did allow some onto the property to have a look it was reported that as time went on he did have people of not visit or show interest in the property the obvious one was Robert Biga the founder of big Aerospace in Nevada but apparently or allegedly I suppose there were also Military Intelligence Officers that had an interest in the sightings that the Shermans had seen in the sky specifically the orbs and the objects that were described as refrigerators and other such shipes soon after putting the property up for sale the Shermans were so desperate to leave that they sold the proper proper Y at a loss to Robert who gained ownership of the property on September 5th 1996 other parties were interested in purchasing the property but the Shermans didn&#x27;t want to put anyone through what they&#x27;d been through and so chose Robert as he wanted to use it for the purpose of study and research Robert is a billionaire real estate Tycoon who has an interest in unusual phenomena this interest is what sparked the creation of nids the National Institute for Discovery Science Dr Colm a Keller would lead the research team at Skinwalker Ranch under Bigalow Keller was an Irish scientist with a PhD in Biochemistry This research group included Edgar Mitchell who had famously walked on the moon the team consisted of many professionals with backgrounds in all kinds of Sciences ranging from astronomy to physics and psychology and others too present in the team was a healthy dose of skepticism and people who just wanted to understand what was going on at the r Ranch whether real exaggerated or imagined entirely the Shermans relocated to another Ranch that actually wasn&#x27;t far away from Skinwalker Ranch about 20 mi away or so a little surprising perhaps you&#x27;d think that if they went through these things then they&#x27;d want to be many many miles away but with everything the shamans had experienced it seems that Terry wanted to know more and requested that he manage the actual Ranch for the nids team the team agreed and Terry was able to remain there caring for the animals and tending to the ranch nits had been formed in 1995 a year before Biga took ownership of the ranch the nits team were interested in incidents involving cattle namely the strange events in which they would go missing and later be found under the circumstances we mentioned earlier they also had a particular interest in sightings of objects in the sky whether orbs or something else much like the sh had described sir from Robert&#x27;s perspective acquiring Skinwalker Ranch was probably too good of an opportunity to pass up interestingly enough on the first day of the job for the nids team they went around exploring and observing the property getting a lay of the land and while doing so they came across cattle carcasses precisely in the manner that Terry had described they also found other SES of note such as the location where Terry felt his dogs had been incinerated they saw the black blackened Ground Three circles surrounded by healthy grass they found the random holes that Terry had earlier said that the orbs or lights had removed Earth from not long after being stationed at the ranch the nits team described seeing moving lights in the distance there was a bright light in the sky hovering above the same trees that Terry had earlier told them about the team said that it appeared out of nowhere above the trees hovered for around 10 minutes or so before disappearing into the tree line they also said that images had been taken but the light while present seemed dimmer on the pictures for some reason it does appear that after the nids team had observed this among other incidents they believed that something out of the ordinary was happening at the ranch for instance they had another incident with cattle after 6 months of been present at the ranch it was the 10th of March when a new calf had been tagged the calf was then left with the others but approximately 45 minutes later reportedly the very calf was found in a manner that is difficult to describe here on YouTube but to try its inets had been removed and there were no fluids on the ground and the injury suggested that this wasn&#x27;t animal predition and seemed to be a professional job the team expressed their sheer incredulity as to how this could have happened in the space of just 45 minutes and of course it was discovered 45 minutes after the tagging meaning that whatever had happened was likely to have happened much sooner than the 45 minutes that passed the researchers were also said to have come upon a large creature that the Shermans earlier reported only this one was witnessed hi up in a tree two days after the cough incident dogs on the ranch were heard making a fuss so Terry and two members of the nits team one being Keller himself got in a truck to see what was happening it was there that they saw this thing in the tree Terry took a pot shot at it which made it fall to the ground and flee away it was then spotted again and Terry made a direct hit from a distance but they never found a carcass from tracks they discovered Keller stated that it appeared as though the creature was similar to a large bed of prayer stating that it had two claws of 6 in in diameter the nits team had another professional Rancher come into assist on the ranch here&#x27;s an incident as depicted by the Rancher and documented on Skinwalker ranch.org I quote I know it&#x27;s going to sound hard to believe but whatever is behind this stuff does not want to leave evidence behind in July of 1997 the nits team set up two groups of video cameras on telephone poles and they had a camera that was angled so it could see part of the field as well as the other cameras this was in an area in which a lot of unusual incidents had occurred so they felt it was a good spot for them around a year later the cameras would all come to be damaged the wires on the cameras were torn out at one point and the one camera that was facing them was on at the time but there was nothing to indicate what happened happened the feed on the cameras all ended at about 8:00 p.m. and reviewing the footage revealed nothing Shaman&#x27;s neighbors had been questioned by nids to see if they themselves had had any incidents to report specifically one area of all this weirdness did crop up a few times that being the unusual things happening to the cattle and that the neighbors had experienced this too it&#x27;s important to highlight however that four of the neighbors did not believe a single word of the Shermans this investigation by nids went on for six whole years and it ended in 2002 after the incidents became less and less frequent in fact they stated the most active period on the ranch was right at the starting period up to a year or so afterwards the most unusual incident they reported happened towards the end of August in 1997 at 2:30 in the morning Jim and Mike who were both a part of the nits team saw something in the sky they said that it was a yellow light above the prop proper y just hovering and seemingly observing the property while they were observing it using a pair of infrared binoculars Mike suddenly noticed that this light was emanating from what he described was something looking like a tunnel right above the ground from this tunnel he described a black silhouette of a person or something similar of around 6 ft in height he said it came out of this tunnel and moved off quickly into the darkness Jim on the other hand didn&#x27;t see this but did see the light above the property upon descending on the area the P stated that there was a sulfur-like UR lingering and their nuclear anomaly detection and recording device found various radiation markers and then faded shortly thereafter although saying that this was the most unusual might be incorrect because they had another that occurred 2 months prior to August in June at that time an orb was spotted very close to Keller less than 100 yards away Keller was with another researcher and they described this thing is just bobbing around the place it was late when this was occurring and they had access to some night vision binoculars and a powerful flashlight the researcher with Keller then noticed that there was a huge black thing in the tree line ahead of them heading in a Northerly Direction This researcher then stated and I quote it&#x27;s got me it&#x27;s saying we are watching you Kell was not able to see what the other researcher was referring to I&#x27;d say that probably qualifies for The Stranger spot in any case the nids effort at the ranch came to an end in 2004 Biga said that after 1999 the incidents had reduced significantly and that after 2002 there was really no reason for them to be there however the ranch would be brought back to the spotlight in 2005 the history of the ranch and all the media that was created surrounding it and everything that had been reported there by the shamans and nids caught the attention of the DIA the defense intelligence agency from that department Dr James latsky traveled to the ranch with Biga where James believed he had seen some kind of yellowish object in the sky no one else present had seen it outside of James but this convinced James that there was more to be discovered through big alert Senator Harry Reid heard about the ranch and lat&#x27;s interest then became his own in 2017 the New York Times reported that $22 million had been spent on an advanced Aerospace threat identification program in 2007 this money came at the request of Harry Reed and apparently based on the article the funds were sent to an aerospace research company run by biger biger had recently formed the biger Aerospace Advanced space studies or Bass for short which was something of a continuation in some sense for nids so it appears as though this more secretive Defense Agency the DIA contracted workout to Bigelow&#x27;s group and back they went to the ranch this time though there was Personnel present from the government agency as well as bass researchers there isn&#x27;t a lot known about the outcome of this investigation but there are reports indicating that the teams did in fact observe more unusual phenomena at the site for instance this paper was published to Edge science in June of 2022 by no other than Colm a Keller in this paper Keller confirmed that the DIA were involved and that they were running the now famous assap program he stated that one area of the investigation by AAP was in fact interested in and conducted on Skinwalker Ranch Keller spoke about how in 2009 another ominous phenomenon was discovered at the ranch that being the idea that these experiences can follow you away from the ranch itself I quote all five Dia Personnel deployed to the ranch experienced profound anomalies while on the property and more importantly all five brought something home with them the leader of these five military Personnel was a naval intelligence officer whom we gave the pseudonym Jonathan Axelrod Axelrod was an accomplished engineer who would eventually be promoted to the rank of two star admiral within Naval intelligence and who possessed top secret and sensitive compartmented information clearances at the time of his Ranch visit in 2009 Axel Rod accompanied by Jim Costigan and David Wilson encountered an anomaly on the ranch that caused a lot of fear in all three men but little did he know that this incident was only the beginning of his troubles within a month of arriving back home in Virginia a plethora of paranormal phenomena suddenly erupted in Axel Rod&#x27;s home for several years following his July 2009 and subsequent trips to the ranch Axel Rod&#x27;s wife and teenage children were subjected to nightmarish dogmen appearing in their backyard to blue red yellow and white OBS routinely flirting around the home and in the yard to jet black shadow people stand standing over their beds when they atw and to a Relentless barrage of loud unexplained footsteps walking up and down the stairs of their house the Axel Rod teenagers enjoyed some very scary episodes in their bedroom Paul the younger teenager claims to have been attacked by blue and red orbs in his bedroom on the night of February 7 2011 but they kept quiet about their strange experiences so imagine Paul shock when he was approached by one of his high school friends in 11 who told him that on the previous night he had looked out of his bedroom window and witnessed a large wolf-like creature standing outside his bedroom window looking in at him a few weeks later another friend told Paul of seeing strange blue lights flying around his backyard these accounts go on and on and this phenomenon was dubbed The Hitchhiker effect which pretty much just means that there is a feeling of bringing something home that should not be there in his paper Keller describes that various people who experienced hitchhiker effect in what should be the safety of their own home after such horrible experiences would experience some kind of negative health impact Bigalow himself said that he had experienced this in his own home too saying that it went on for years interestingly it seems that a whole debate sprung up from this so-called hitchhiker effect those who experienced it thoroughly believed that there was some kind of presence or just something that was causing this and had followed them home from the ranch other re researchers not a part of this group brought up the idea of social contagion and said that is what is likely to have occurred here for those that don&#x27;t know a social contagion refers to the process in which attitudes behaviors or emotions spread throughout a group so the idea being that once one member felt something had happened then someone else related to it in some way perhaps incorrectly identifying their own experience as being the same as theirs and then so on and so on until everyone believes that they&#x27;ve been subject to the same experience or The Hitchhiker effect in this case I suppose obviously from the perspective of you and I I suppose it&#x27;s basically almost impossible to Fathom the difference could there be some kind of phenomenon happening that is rare and that the public just has very little if no familiarity with sure I suppose so but we also know that social contagion happens too there are famous cases spanning back centuries ago in which people just started dancing and couldn&#x27;t stop and they literally danced until they passed away of dehydration and other such things in this instance I suppose it&#x27;s viest discretion as to how they see it now throughout this video I&#x27;ve covered the incidents as they were presented to me through various sources articles books and the like but there is a lot of skepticism to be had too for example the Myers family was mentioned earlier who were the original owners of Skinwalker Ranch in the 1930s although it wasn&#x27;t called that then in this book written by Frank B Salsbury a plant physiologist who gained his PhD from the California Institute of Technology Frank found himself in contact with gath Meers in 2009 GTH was the brother of Kenneth Meers one of the previous owners of the ranch G had worked on the ranch for three Summers when he was a teenager Kenneth sadly passed away at the age of 86 in 1987 and Edith passed away in 1994 the ranch then fell to G and his sisters who negotiated the sale I believe to the shamans when Frank mentioned to G about the concentration of unusual incidents that happened at the ranch GTH vigorously denied the claims he said I can tell you unequivocally that up to 1992 there had never been and there never Weare any signs of any of the phenomena as described by the Shermans the ranch was vacant for about 2 years after Edith entered arrest home I went to it occasionally just to check out the home then we sold it I don&#x27;t know what happened while it was vacant but I don&#x27;t think anything went on there was nothing unequivocally absolutely nothing that went on while she and my brother lived there GTH told Frank that he even had a conversation with Robert Bigalow himself he said Biga called me on the phone and wondered why we hadn&#x27;t told anybody about the lights and objects in the sky and such I told him they didn&#x27;t get there until the shamans got there and he said they were coming there and you had dogs keeping the people away and I said all they had at most were two dogs and the last time my sister-in-law lived there was with a three-legged dog and part of that time was with no dog at all and there was none of that stuff and he said oh you&#x27;re just not telling me the truth I said if you don&#x27;t believe it I guess we don&#x27;t need to talk anymore and that was about it Frank also questioned GTH about the heavy duty locks and chains present on the property and GTH said it was simply not true and that they were not there so what are we to think about all this well clearly the Myers didn&#x27;t believe a word of it as they themselves hadn&#x27;t experienced any of the incidents but on the other hand the Sherman vehemently believed that something completely out of the ordinary was happening on that ranch it&#x27;s also not as if the incidents just stopped when nits arrived and bigo&#x27;s teams certainly believed that they had experienced unusual things at the ranch 2 now let&#x27;s be honest though the evidence that has been collected from the ranch has mostly been minimalistic and probably not all that useful for scientific purposes we have lowquality photos videos and strange instrument readings despite that though the nits team the bass team and the folks from the DIA all had their own sightings and experiences both at the ranch and later at their own homes through what was dubbed The Hitchhiker effect of course it&#x27;s not clear that all evidence was made publicly available as said the DIA and their assat program was far more secretive than nits perhaps there is further evidence that we just not privy to but from what is available there isn&#x27;t any hard evidence but there is a lot of witness testimony from a lot of people involved at the ranch but not only those who were directly involved at Skinwalker Ranch but neighbors of the ranch also reported unusual things happening too and let&#x27;s not forget there were many people that were totally unrelated to the ranch in Rosevelt and other nearby places claiming that they had seen unusual things in the sky in the s and onwards on the other hand and as said before we have four of the neighbors to Skinwalker Ranch who thought the whole thing was total rubbish meaning realistically that they cannot have seen or experienced anything at all could it have been that things were happening but the Meyers and others had just been oblivious to it all John Garcia another neighbor of the ranch stated that he saw a ready orange object on their land and that it was about the size of a house which was when the Meers were still there he claimed that while he saw it the Myers weren&#x27;t aware of it but it&#x27;s not clear why he wouldn&#x27;t have mentioned it to them in conversation perhaps he thought it would have made him look nuts which is fair though you&#x27;d think that if things like that were happening the M would have noticed over the years surely from the sharan&#x27;s accounts it&#x27;s not as if the incidents were hidden it&#x27;s not really clear why these things would only begin to occur when the shamans took possession of the ranch though they were not taken for liars and they certainly didn&#x27;t seem dishonest to the research groups at least as far as I&#x27;m able to ascertain it also seems that they would have had to have been incredibly good at lying to cause all the fuss including the DIA spending $22 million on absolutely nothing the shamans also lost money on the property because to them they felt like they wanted to do the right thing and not hand it off to someone that was unsuspecting so perhaps at the absolute very least the Sherman truly believed that something was happening so if the Shermans weren&#x27;t lying and I suppose in some sense given everything else that happened with the research groups they didn&#x27;t seem to be where else can you even go with this was it as a result of hallucinations it&#x27;s not clear what might have caused that especially since there were so many people reporting things in the end perhaps social contagion as argued before I&#x27;m not sure how it could have been a hook by the shamans as that would have involved fooling various research teams and I&#x27;m not sure exactly how they would have gotten away with that or even what methods they could have used to present the phenomena as it was was a third party responsible allegedly Terry was said to have suspected that a lot of this was being done by the US government or more specifically the military though the reason why they&#x27;d be pranking or messing with ranchers isn&#x27;t clear in the end there really isn&#x27;t a clear answer to this I did put out this poll on the channel just to see how you guys felt about it so thank you very much to those of you who voted the results are pretty much just split down the middle the people who believe the phenomena is real or pure fiction is basically neck and neck while everyone else is skeptical but open-minded so we&#x27;re basically right down the middle there in the end after listening to all of this I&#x27;d be interested in knowing if you think it&#x27;s real or not anyway I&#x27;ll leave it there I&#x27;d just like to take the time to thank you for watching and a big thank you to the patrons who&#x27;ve been running around on the screen please do remember to like And subscribe if you haven&#x27;t already and do drop me a comment as I read pretty much all of them I hope that you&#x27;ve had a great day or evening depending on where you are and I&#x27;ll see you in the next one be safe guys peace</p>
