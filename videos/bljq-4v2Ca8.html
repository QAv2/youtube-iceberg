            <p>this is I think close to about 30 years since my last major update in anti-gravity research and a lot of things have changed in 30 years and some things have not changed [Music] dr. lang manly a lady that was also trying to work with dr. public knob she she had some promising results by rotating charged semiconductors in super cool conditions and suddenly early in shortly after year 2000 she took some money from the government and basically went on the ground to work on anti-gravity projects and she was never heard from again at least work-wise who she probably still has friends and family but Floyd sweet was a researcher that in 1988 published a paper called nothing is something and he had some bearer barium ferrite magnets that he had conditioned in a special way where he could see the very small AC current into the magnets through some ordinary copper coils and was able to generate over Unity effects he even had his device running cooler than the environment and even lost weight in one in one test that they did and a lot of not a lot but a few researchers have tried to replicate his device and have not been successfully doing so although I did hear some rumor about one guy he was able to forget his name I was able to replicate his device and the word is that he suddenly started appearing in expensive clothing and expensive cars and from what I hear was living very well you know which seemed to have come across some money so the question that people were asking is perhaps he sold out his his technology his replication of the Floyd sweet device to somebody we don&#x27;t know who or if if it really happened but but that&#x27;s the word on the street and he sold out but the Floyd sweet device actually resonates very well with me and the Elector of gravity theories that I developed back in 1987 because it&#x27;s using what&#x27;s called the B cross V field effect which is a la Paz Laplace force that&#x27;s the magnetic force effect in the Lorentz force equation it&#x27;s not the an a pure electric effect but it&#x27;s the magnetic effect from the Lorentz force equation and I like to call it the Laplace force or the B cross V field effect then we have a guy called Hooper dr. Hooper he filed for patent in 1971 I think it was and he was onto the right concept about electro gravity that it&#x27;s a pseudo force of the B cross we filled him in the Lorentz force equation and he had some of his math wrong and some of his demonstrations were wrong it&#x27;s a couple of his demonstrations were just showing the standard transformer type effect and not not really the B cross B field effect old are in many cases they are you can use the same math and came I mean the different maths for the for the phenomenon come up with the same answer but they&#x27;re actually two two independent electrical type phenomena one is from moving charges and the second effect is from accelerating charges there is a difference there and he he was very excited but his effects were very very small was in the micro volts region for a large capacitor and that&#x27;s down in the noise and thermoelectric noise level area and when NASA tried to replicate his experiment back in the 90s I think it was they found nothing there was no they tried to measure the change in weight of an object above a spiral coil and they made a big mistake and they probably were not aware of the divergent effect of a field and they just had a linear quite uniform field effect and therefore saw no weight changes on their test document professor Searle as he likes to call himself he has no engineering or or graduate high level degree but he he claims to have invented some flying discs back in the fifties or even before and he he has in the last few years last ten years maybe fifteen years been trying to replicate and rebuild some of his devices with investor money and so far has not been able at least in my mind not be able to show any evidence of any electro gravity or any unique special effects to reduce weight of his machine and there are some questions about whether he actually really did build some flying saucers type devices that disappeared on him up into the sky which is what he claimed there are some questions about the authenticity of that so take take the professor Searle with a big pinch of salt but it&#x27;s interesting that his device looks more or less like a device that can generate some large B cross V field effects because of the outer he has some outer cylinders as rotor rotates around a central hub and if you know anything about the B cross B field effect the the V in the formula stands for for the velocity so the larger the velocity the larger the effect will be and then we&#x27;ve got the Russian version of the sural device which I actually feel looks more scientific and more promising the guy&#x27;s name is Russian and there was another fellow as well a couple of other fellows I think and then they got some American investors I&#x27;m not sure where the investors came but they had some investors they got some money and they built this huge test machine in in Russia and apparently they did achieve some anti-gravity or some levitation type effects and they also saw some other interesting effects with zones around the device that were acting yeah I&#x27;m not sure to put it but there were some magnetic fields or magnetic or electric zones around the device about a metre or half a meter apart where they can measure some differences and that that whole project disappeared or they&#x27;re the results from the initial project is online but for some reason that was never followed up and continued that work which is a bit disappointing because that in my mind looks very promising and there could be some very strong B cross V field effects the best way to generate strong B cross B field effects which is the important ingredient for which for generating electric gravity is to rotate charges as fast as possible and that&#x27;s what the Russian cell device was doing so I wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they actually those results that were reported were in fact real that wouldn&#x27;t surprise me at all but it&#x27;s sad that it technology was not continues that work from what I heard on that on the street was that device was destroyed or was stolen they ran out of money and the usual stories about how the inventors couldn&#x27;t continue to work because they lacked money [Music]</p>
