            <p>this is the work of Nikola Tesla so his work was suppressed a lot of his patents were were taken sealed up by the U.S government for whatever reason this is some of the stuff that&#x27;s now being developed using his ideas plus some of the others uh again I don&#x27;t want to get into it today but like here&#x27;s an example of what they&#x27;re doing this is a generator that has no moving Parts it&#x27;s all based on Geometry pure geometry and and here&#x27;s the basic idea is I think I understand it at this point resonance frequencies everything vibrates have you ever like if if we had a an electric razor we plugged it in turned it on set it on this table because it&#x27;s going to move around isn&#x27;t it</p>
