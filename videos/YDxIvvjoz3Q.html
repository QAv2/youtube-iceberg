            <p>[Music] oh dear God now Eric Davis is saying Lando never worked for atip ah when will the drama end never okay let&#x27;s talk about it get in here this is Jack with Cosmic I&#x27;ll talk about UFOs in the Paranormal please hit like And subscribe and let me know what you guys think in the comments below okay this was shared by Admiral pliskin uh since UFO Twitter is back on the conflict of lose claims please go read and find statements from Eric Davis James latky calm kill her Etc um yeah H so what this is these are new comments from Eric Davis who is replying uh to uh or is talking with Nick meal here so Erica is saying Lou never work for a tip slaap nickname versus actual name he was also o not in a support role to the DIA program manager James latki J Stratton did Provide support to lki while Lou provided some support to the uaf when Jay was its director wow well that is a different take on things Eric that is a totally different take on things the uh UAP task force as far as I know came into being after Lou left the government so so you know if you know he was providing support it would only be as a consultant or something right if if if Eric is correct uh but surely he&#x27;s not right this is crazy uh Nick meal says so he&#x27;s lying or just embellishing Eric says embellishing uh Eric Davis says Lou is embellishing apparently a lot according to Eric Davis uh Andre to Andre Eric says false Lou was not a security chief for allat because the DIA has its own security Chief uh and Eric Davis shares this James lky&#x27;s response to news nation regarding Lou elando I was the sole program manager for the complete duration of Dia&#x27;s AAP September 2008 to December 2010 and worked alongside DHS in the follow on kona blue program through 2011 Lou elando was not involved in either assap or kona blue well he says nothing about atip and by the way Lou has responded to James L&#x27;s comments and we&#x27;ll get to that in just a minute uh yeah so uh yeah Andre says Eric Davis thanks for your opinion but I I trust my source I love that Eric Davis you know I value my source over you I let that&#x27;s that&#x27;s an amazing comment that&#x27;s an amazing comment I wonder who Andre scr&#x27;s source is where he would place that Source above Eric source so that&#x27;s really really interesting actually I&#x27;m very curious about that um other comments Eric Davis uh the nickname for the aaap was ATP after repeated inference with Senator Reed and lasky&#x27;s efforts to renew assap for another 5-year round of congressional funding Lou entered the picture via his intelligence Counter Intelligence and security portfolio at the ousd O usdi and adopted the atip name when he added the UAP problem to his portfolio uh yeah and that&#x27;s kind of you know what it seems like to me you know there was assap and then you know Lou was you know from the book Lou was invited to be part of AAP and he was you know kind of part of that effort but not really maybe in an official capacity and then Alla was defunded Bou continued on uh with some allies you know kind of doing his own thing and you know their own thing with a small number of people in an unfunded project but they did kind of had have funding uh I forget the term for it but uh where you can double up on stuff where you can uh analyze a video and say hey we&#x27;re just you know we&#x27;re trying to find out if it&#x27;s a Russian Mig or something you know what what what are the capacities of this object and you know that&#x27;s legitimate and that&#x27;s funded uh but you&#x27;re also doubling up and you&#x27;re studying uh UAP activity so you know that is yeah so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s complicated and confusing and people use a tip in different ways uh which is part of the problem I think so I think that luru is totally on the level uh but you know technically Eric may be correct uh the program continued Eric says under internal funding in Lou&#x27;s office the program is still operating on internal funding they don&#x27;t need Congressional appropriation for it because there&#x27;s already dedicated money uh for things like this yeah and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about uh when you double up when you&#x27;re you know you&#x27;re analyzing you know the the Tic Tac video but you&#x27;re saying hey what is this object is this a Russian military craft well then it&#x27;s a legit thing and you can you can get that funded and investigated so really really interesting uh more quotes from Eric Davis Eric yeah Eric Davis as a consultant okay this is I&#x27;ll just I&#x27;ll just read it uh the below quotes are further validation that atip had Consultants not contractors due to lack of funding uh Steven Green Street never never tried to quote Steven Green Street but here we go were you involved with ATP Eric Davis yes I was in what respect were you involved with ATP as a consultant and then the assap program was where I was actually a subcontractor via bass via assap which was the other side of ATP ATP was handled out of the ous DUI and AAP was that the DIA and Assa was the actual funded program that received enough Congressional appropriation to hire outside contractors like bass and Earth deck to work on the programs and I thought that was interesting that that uh app was out of DIA but a tip was handled out of the ous dni so yeah very interesting uh very interesting uh but it doesn&#x27;t in there a lot of people are talking about this um yeah deep prad chimes in Joe merg TR chimes in and yeah these comments are from today um yeah this is this is this is crazy it was rumored that Stratton and Taylor were part of trying to Scupper the uapa last year here on behalf of Radiance Tech due to imminent domain Lou name Radiance and new uapa still has imminent domain in it so could this all be part of that might just be bad blood too I suppose yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s strange it&#x27;s strange because you know Lou has always been very pro- Eric Davis called him a hero and so forth and to have Eric come after him like this is is odd uh so you have to wonder if there is some you know uh you know a reason for it some agenda behind that uh yeah from latky a tip the name itself I did not create that name but it was created for a specific reason and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s ever been printed it was done yes in Senator Reed&#x27;s letter asking for special Access program that&#x27;s been out in the press for what 5 years now but where did the need for a different name come from it came from which took me by surprise uh when I saw the funding someone in other words the notification of funding that yes Dia was getting this money it was on a piece of paper that had highly classified programs listed on the rest of the paper and someone in Congress put secret on the program name and its very abbreviated contents that were on that document I did not want to get crosswise with any national with any security considerations I wanted a different name now I believe that who we called Axel Rod J Stratton or perhaps Lou elzando or perhaps some of their cohorts and maybe all of them came up with the name ATP that would have been a great problem for Dia because assap routed the money to the defense warning office of Dia period it had to be that name so the contract may have been called that too because that&#x27;s what we put at the open solicitation that can still be found on the internet and I&#x27;ve repeated in skinwalkers at the Pentagon you know it can prcise amount of material as to what we requested but that&#x27;s where the name atip came from atip was something that was necessary to be proceeded with on Military cases Lou handled that I was not privy because it was mainly spun up as I was getting ready to leave so yeah okay so what about James L&#x27;s recent comments when he says I was the sole program manager for the complete duration of Dia&#x27;s AAP September 20 08 to December 2010 and work and worked alongside DHS in the follow on kona blue program through uh 2011 uh Lou alzando was not involved in either assap or kona blue now that&#x27;s fine he he doesn&#x27;t seem to have been uh he was aware of it and invited to be part of it but he wasn&#x27;t actively involved at that time um although he was getting briefed and you know attending meetings and stuff so uh you know I don&#x27;t think that really conflicts with Lou statements uh but George nap and Lou sat down and they talked about it and George says well here&#x27;s one I think could be constructive and as recently as today this is floating around all over the place you and I have exchanged some information about it Dr James ly answered an email some news organizations asked him for a photo and along the way they they said something about assap that he corrected that it seemed like the questioner got it wrong and he just corrected him but he didn&#x27;t want to give a comment uh they used his comments anyway and it sounds like he&#x27;s coming after you I&#x27;m telling you he was not coming after you he was just pointing out you weren&#x27;t really a big part of oap you were invited to be part of it and if you if it had survived you would have been part of it but he was just clarifying that and it sounds like he was attacking and says correct I was not part of assap I&#x27;ve made it very clear in my book actually I don&#x27;t know if he did make that very clear in his book it was kind of vague he was attending meetings and then it was defunded and then there was ATP but it was in my mind that wasn&#x27;t as clear as it could have been um but in fact Lou says you know Jim was one of the founders in creators of that you know the guy deserves enormous credit for it he really does there were not be an atip had there not been James laty or an assap and look I don&#x27;t take anything personally I know Jim very well he&#x27;s a highly intelligent man you know I don&#x27;t know the nuances of what happened but you know like I said man I don&#x27;t pay attention to the drama anyways Jim&#x27;s a great guy I&#x27;m sure if he had a problem he&#x27;d probably let me know so just like I would him so yeah I I I don&#x27;t take James&#x27;s uh statements as as counter to in any way is just clarifying so could Eric Davis&#x27;s comments be clarifying I it seemed like he was going after Lou at this point in time I have not seen a response from Lou Lou has been able to respond to James laty but uh we have not seen or at least I have not seen at this time that response to Eric&#x27;s comment so I look forward to that and of course I&#x27;ll report on it when I hear it but Eric may have been meaning the a tip that was synonymous with allet not the sort of unofficial a tip uh that Lou and his allies continued with I&#x27;ve heard several different versions of the creation of oap and atip uh and they don&#x27;t all go together so at this point I&#x27;m not entirely sure which is the the real version and I think the reason for that is because there&#x27;s probably more than one atip or at least the the the word ATP has been used in different ways and sometimes it&#x27;s synonymous with AAP and sometimes it&#x27;s not and I think that&#x27;s where the problem is is just the wording and it&#x27;s not anybody being disingenuous and lying uh it&#x27;s just a confu confusion of names and uh but I I you know look forward to Lou responding to Eric I know Lou thinks very well of Eric and I&#x27;m you know a little dism made to see Eric seemingly coming after Lou like this uh but we&#x27;ll see where the day takes us so let me know what you think about it all in the comments below and if you&#x27;ve enjoyed this video please give me
