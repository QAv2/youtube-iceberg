            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Here is a montage from the movie of top US officials talking about how all of this is relevant because it may pose a serious national security threat. It&#x27;s stop 42. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities and it&#x27;s not ours [clears throat] and we don&#x27;t know whose it is. That alone, just that statement alone deserves inquiry, deserves attention, deserves focus. If you have objects in the sky that you cannot identify, that&#x27;s a problem because it could be China, it could be Russia, it could be any adversary.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, any any explained phenomenon could pose a national security threat. &gt;&gt; Clapper, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s the way you have to treat those things. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s something violating our airspace. There&#x27;s something fouling our ranges that even the people we&#x27;ve tked in the executive branch to understand this cannot provide an explanation. So I would say in addition to the national security implications, this has implications for basic trust and confidence in the American government.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I I just want to play one more. Um here we have a former Navy pilot describing the UAP&#x27;s defying extreme weather and physics in SOP 45. &gt;&gt; In 2014 to 2015, we were operating off the coast of Virginia Beach off the eastern seabboard. It was during this time that we upgraded our radar from the APG73 to the APG79 radar. And this allowed us to essentially see more objects we weren&#x27;t expecting to see.</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s a particular case of one of these objects maintaining a complete stationary position inside of 120 kn winds. Essentially inside of a hurricane &gt;&gt; going against the wind. The wind&#x27;s 120 knots west. So look at this thing. It&#x27;s rotating.</p>
<p>It just seems like they&#x27;re not affected by the environment the way we are. &gt;&gt; And there&#x27;s testimonial after testimonial like that, David. That&#x27;s not unique to have an experienced fighter pilot like our our men and women in the military have been quietly coming forward and reporting on this for a long time only to be told, &quot;Keep your mouth shut.&quot; &gt;&gt; No, that&#x27;s true. And I I have Air Force pilot friends of mine that have seen um astounding things while on duty to include glowing triangular craft uh you know hovering above other aircraft cruising at you know 50,000 ft.</p>
