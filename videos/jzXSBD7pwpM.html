            <p>hi I&#x27;m sha Stone today we&#x27;ll be discussing nuclear fusion stick around this is buz saww Dr Michael mcub has been for over two decades now the director of The Energy Research Center at Stanford research Institute SRI he&#x27;s one of the world&#x27;s most renowned researchers on nuclear fusion processes and he&#x27;s joining us today to discuss where we are Dr mcub first of all I think the B the the first question most people will have is you know we&#x27;ve heard of nuclear fusion over the years um in the context of thermonuclear hot reactions and cold fusion processes what what we work on here is called cold fusion that&#x27;s probably not not the best descriptor but it does distinguish it from hot Fusion the advantage of cold fusion over hot Fusion is one it it works already today not everybody is aware of that but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re working on here and we are able to produce more energy out of the cold fusion reactions than the electrical power that has been consumed this has never been done for a hot Fusion well a really exciting thing happened a couple of months ago is that Bill Gates founder of Microsoft and at this point the wealthiest man in the world visited Dr viante at Ena in Italy or a facility that they had procured for the meeting and we found out that Bill Gates is a fan of cold fusion and Leonard low energy nuclear reaction there have been a lot of breakthroughs in leoner just a few months ago from the team working with uh Ernesto Rossi on the so-called ecat the energy catalyzer and there was a thirdparty report um even though it was controversial but the six phds who examined the device said that over a 30-day period it had produced a lot of excess heat about 1.5 megaw of energy</p>
