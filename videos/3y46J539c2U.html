            <p>Some of the most advanced fighter aircraft never appear in public budgets. Their funding is hidden inside black programs. Classified line items designed to protect secrets. Supporters argue they&#x27;re essential. Cuttingedge fighters rely on breakthrough materials, sensors, and software that lose value the moment they&#x27;re exposed.</p>
<p>Secrecy preserves surprise, deters rivals, and allows engineers to experiment without political interference. But critics see a problem. When fighter programs are funded in the shadows, oversight weakens, costs can balloon. programs can duplicate effort and accountability can be bypassed. There&#x27;s also a strategic risk.</p>
<p>Secret variants may never be produced at scale, tested in real combat, or integrated across the force. Billions can be spent on exquisite prototypes that remain siloed, impressive, but operationally limited. Defenders counter that many breakthroughs only exist because they were protected early, eventually becoming standard capability. The controversy isn&#x27;t about secrecy itself. It&#x27;s about balance.</p>
<p>How much innovation requires darkness, and how much democracy requires daylight? In modern air power, black budgets don&#x27;t just hide aircraft. They hide decisions that shape the future of war.</p>
