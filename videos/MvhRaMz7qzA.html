            <p>say hi everybody binge here hi everybody binge here hey everybody binge here i&#x27;m making this video to give you guys an overview of my Elian our calorimetry arduino base apparatus the jobby i got going on so you see here i got the arduino a couple ICS and i have a boost module i bought this for like two bucks on ebay and it&#x27;s just not been performing well and i&#x27;m going to build this section of my own design just on the on the board beneath and yeah carry on with describe and what&#x27;s going on it has current sense capability there&#x27;s a shunt and an instrumentation amplifier i see the gains controlled with this pot here I got a high-precision voltage reference and then the sensors come out this what the heck&#x27;s are called ethernet cable and comes up to here there&#x27;s two thermistors that go down into the glass tubes here so it&#x27;s just a glass tube with the wire in it and then some deionized water is a healthy heat transfer and there&#x27;s another glass tube with the sensor and if the sensor can be pushed down and then what we see here the wire here let&#x27;s zoom in here the wire here is platinum wire that&#x27;s the anode in this configuration and then the that there is a chunk of palladium and nickel wire wrapped around it now have it hooked up with these alligator clips to stay out of the solution the solutions lithium hydroxide and we have electrolysis go and so I I think I got too much I have too much electrolyte in this off to dilute it but the one thing I&#x27;m happy about is that as you can see the water even though the electrolysis process is going the water is staying nice and clean and I&#x27;m happy about that so yes then if you look over here on my screen I have a telemetry view we&#x27;re going and I have the voltage here the current in milliamps here the wats the input jewels and here&#x27;s a temperature one and chump temperature too and the next box I&#x27;m going to put on this is the Watts out and that&#x27;s the calorimetry mass and whatnot I&#x27;m still working on figuring that out how many little bugs here and there but I think I&#x27;ll get it and yeah so that&#x27;s where i met with this one and hopefully i can get tabulating the watts with some level of precision and accuracy so I can get some data but uh yeah fun times i&#x27;m looking forward to doing a lot more with this stuff yeah so peace everybody later you</p>
