            <p>all right hello everyone good to see you out there my name is Thomas and I do educational videos on this on this channel and um we are in the middle of covering the reciprocal system of theory of Dewey B Larson theory of everything that he developed back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 but not before writing many many books on all things such as uh astronomy and physics and astrophysics and chemistry and economics and we are looking at his final book uh that actually came out after he died um called beyond space and time and uh just to give you a quick uh overview uh Larson uh worked on his theory starting in about 1930 he had uh certain experiences that uh gave him some insights and he developed those insights through a long period of um of uh inductive reasoning uh eventually arriving at two fundamental postulates back in the 50s the first of which is the most important uh which is that the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time uh the phrase it my way I would just say the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it&#x27;s made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are the same except that they are reciprocals of each other one what uh what quality uh you know uh can be observed in one can be also uh applied to the other and therefore you can extrapolate uh into time which you already know about space that it has three dimensions or I would say three or four dimensions and that what you know about time that it is progressing also applies to space uh the progression of space being the recession of the distant galaxies and uh they both have discrete units us uh one smallest unit of time and one unit of space and one unit of time uh one unit of space in one unit of time space over time is speed all um and one over one one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light and um the speed of light is not the maximum speed of the universe as Einstein would say but it is the neutral point or the midpoint of the universe uh and that half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light half is moving faster than the speed of light and um the half that&#x27;s moving slower is what we call the material sector and the material sector contains you know scientific phenomena especially you know like chemistry atoms and molecules um and then the uh but once and then the other [Music] um the sector 2 or the cosmic sector the the half that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light is something that we don&#x27;t uh you know perceive directly but we can extrapolate from our understanding of the material sector to the cosmic sector because of the reciprocal relationship between space and time so all we have to do to go across that boundary to understand the cosmic sector is to just switch the roles of space and time and instead of saying that something&#x27;s in space you say that it&#x27;s in time um and so on so anyway the what he gets into in and then so he uses these this postulate and the other which is is more axiomatic as a way to uh deductively develop the theory you know I&#x27;ve got this uh and if I have this then I have that and then if I have this then I have that and we went over in about 15 videos uh just um in the last month uh over his deductive development of the reciprocal system and he develops you know what a photon is what an electron is what an atom is and so on so you can go back to those videos if you want to be curious about that all that stuff really is uh kind of occurring except for the photon which is kind of on the boundary uh in the material sector but in this book beyond space and time he goes into the cosmic sector and what he really says is that the material unit develops to its most complex these are atoms and molecules develops to its most complex and when it gets to its most complex DNA which is like billions of atoms in a DNA molecule then it becomes eligible to be uh controlled by a cosmic unit because there&#x27;s a loss of the trait in the translation so uh it&#x27;s not a one-to-one battle it is a one-to-one balance but what we see is we only see a tiny fraction of what actually is there across this boundary and so in order to get a one-to-one you actually need billions of uh atoms over here and then but once it does become under the control of the sector two unit uh it becomes a life unit and so that&#x27;s what life is made out of is is the uh balance and the control of a sector two unit over sector one unit then he goes to the next level and says that once this life unit develops to its most complex level which he says is the intelligent human being then it can be uh come under the con overall control of a sector 3 unit and he says sector three is the unit that&#x27;s independent of space and time uh and I would I would suggest that that is the one over one level where uh space and time are canceled out and you just get one which is the speed of light and uh once it becomes under the control of the uh sector three unit uh it becomes bent toward ethical experience ethical uh you know uh Behavior as opposed to Mere survival behavior from the sector two component so the human being is really living in this uh realm of a kind of a tug of war between satisfying the survival motive and the ethical motive and so right now we are looking in chapter 10 which is called Revelation and Revelation for Larson is a communication one of the kinds of communication between the sector 3 unit and the life unit and uh he goes over we went over in the last video several different factors which uh you use to kind of um evaluate your Revelations because uh the basic idea is that the revelations are always correct but our ability to translate them correctly is limited and so we make a lot of mistakes translating our Revelations our intuitions our insights our ESP into those are all Communications from sector three uh but we we have problems translating them because of various things such as wishful thinking um and uh uh we call it authoritarian bias uh where something gives you more Authority than um you know it has less weight as a as a validity of Revelation um there are um you know also he covers uh um anthropomorphism uh you know where you&#x27;re having a tendency to uh put human characteristics on everything and then you know he looks at uh admissions against interest uh if something is actually against your interest uh like in a legal Doctrine if something&#x27;s actually against your interest it gives it actually more weight um as being uh valid because you&#x27;re going against your own interest to uh you know posit that revelation so after going through these different criteria of of how to evaluate or or uh um to validate your um Revelations uh he gets down to this part right here so I&#x27;m going to start reading from Larson right here application of the foregoing criteria to an evaluation of purported Revelations is subject to different factors in different portions of the total field covered by religious Revelations it will therefore be helpful to begin our consideration of the kind of results that are obtained in this process by setting up a general classification of the areas that will be discussed here or in subsequent chapters um or will be admitted from the discussion for specific reasons so we&#x27;re going to the scope of religious Revelation he has five Scopes are five things in the scope of religious revelation one existence and attributes of deity two nature and origin of existence uh and those uh as two subcategories a physical B metaphysical and then three purpose of existence for moral uh moral code or ethical code and then five survival Beyond physical death so those are uh what e Larson says are covered by religious Revelations and the first item the existence and attributes of deity he says the first item is one of those that we will not be able to discuss in this work as no pertinent information with respect to the subject has been developed in our investigation nor has it been possible to verify any of the revelations that are claimed to have been received on this matter these alleged Revelations are plentiful but they are so conflicting that it is not possible as matters now stand to apply the criteria of validity that we have derived so um this is uh as far as I know really the only thing that is outside of the purview of the reciprocal system uh that the reciprocal system can&#x27;t penetrate and come up with uh valid answers for is the existence and attributes of deity not remember um when Larson says sector three uh he really is referring to God okay he calls it sector three being the scientist that he is and uh so but he&#x27;s saying that the the reciprocal system has no information uh a valid information about the existence or the attributes of deity now he goes to item 2A which is the nature and origin of existence in the physical universe turning to item 2A we find that most organized religions have explanations of the origin and nature of the physical Universe which are claimed to have been received through Revelation these and many other religious assertions about physical matters are generally wrong in whole or in part and the manner in which the advance of scientific knowledge has demolished one after another of these so-called revealed truths has been a major factor in weakening the influence of religion in our present day Society um but the position of religion with respect to scientific knowledge and its position with respect to moral principles and other matters of a non-physical nature are altogether different it could not be expected that the revelations which religion claims to have received concerning any but relatively simple scientific matters would be correct since the individuals who presumably received the revelations did not have the background of scientific knowledge that would have enabled them to understand what was being received and to express it in comprehensible terms uh even if the revelations were complete and accurate uh now remember uh from a recent episode we were talking about this that when you receive uh something from sector three communication could be intuition scientific Insight religious Revelation um they they can be more general or more specific the more General he call he classifies that as intuition and that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s any lay person um who it you know is just uh conscientious person uh can receive an intuition um you know like a gut feeling about something and that it can be valid uh because it&#x27;s generally applied but a scientific Insight or a religious Revelation requires a higher standard to be able to kind of accurately translate that you have to you know really kind of study the matter you have to study the background information because the communication that you&#x27;re going to receive is going to be sufficiently complex that you&#x27;re not going to understand it unless you have that background information you have to kind of stand on the shoulders of a few things before you can see far enough to be able to translate that it&#x27;s coming to you in in a more complicated language uh and if you don&#x27;t have the training that you&#x27;re the the Intuition or the Insight or the Revelation is going to pass you by or you&#x27;re not going to be able to understand it or translate it properly so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s talking about here here um and I think he goes on a little bit further the knowledge required for this purpose was not even an existence from the human standpoint at the time the revelations that underlie the major religions were said to have been received no doubt many of the individuals concerned were wholly sincere in their accounts of what they thought had been revealed to them but it is obvious that they could not have understood the message no matter how complete or how distinct it may have been nor did they have any language in which they could have expressed this knowledge intelligibly if they had somehow acquired an understanding of it for these reasons it is unlikely that religious Revelations have had or will have anything of consequence to contribute either in the inanimate realm level one or the biological World level two so really chemistry or biology physics chemistry and biology these levels are readily accessible to scientific investigation and the methods of science methods that are indigenous to the physical Universe can be more effectively used by the human beings who are inhabitants of that Universe for the purpose of investigating it then the methods of sector three which are at least for the present imperfectly understood and not subject to conscious Direction so he&#x27;s I think you what he&#x27;s really saying is that Revelation is not nearly as effective as scientific investigation if you&#x27;re your purview is the inanimate uh and the biological you know when you&#x27;re talking about sector one and sector two then you might as well stick with the scientific uh Pursuits the revelations that you&#x27;re gonna get are not going to be specific uh they&#x27;re going to be they&#x27;re going to be kind of like over your head um that seems to be a little bit of a contradiction because if you are engaging in scientific Pursuits you would think that you&#x27;re doing enough studying to be able to translate the revelations properly but uh maybe he addresses that later on here much of the information about these two lower levels uh coming from religious sources like the revelations regarding the nature and origin of the universe erroneous and that is uh is erroneous and that which is correct can in most instances be found in more complete form in the results of scientific investigations indeed the real meaning of Revelations concerning the physical Universe often comes to light only after science has discovered the truth simply because the human race was not prepared to understand this real meaning without the help of additional information um in terms of the discussion of the preceding chapter the platform or like I said the shoulders that you&#x27;re standing on the platform provided by the then existing store of knowledge was not yet High Enough for example the account of Creation in the first chapter of Genesis has not received it&#x27;s just due as a physical Revelation even to this day primarily because of a misunderstanding as to the subject of its message a misunderstanding that has resulted from concentrating attention on the manner of presentation rather than on the information that is given each statement in the account is made in the form and God said let there be light and there was light specifically therefore the story seems to be one of direct creation of the universe ex nihilo out of nothing in a manner that is either miraculous or fanciful depending on the viewpoint okay so that&#x27;s pretty much all we have time for right now but next time we&#x27;re going to go into uh his assertions here about Genesis and what it&#x27;s really about Genesis 1 chapter 1 and uh what it&#x27;s about and how it is a um a scientific uh Revelation but that hasn&#x27;t been translated uh correctly okay uh have a great day and we&#x27;ll hopefully we&#x27;ll see you next time</p>
