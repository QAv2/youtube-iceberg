            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right veters Dr Steven Greer is back in a brand new interview on the Danny Jones podcast calling out Dr Gary Nolan Stanford Professor Dr Gary Nolan now it all goes back to these little beings right here in I think 2012 when Dr Gary Nolan was asked by Dr Steven Greer and his team to take a look at these little beings here and determine you know what they are well then you know chaos ensues so let&#x27;s hear Dr Steven GRE explain kind of what happened and again he calls out Dr garyan pretty hard here saying he&#x27;s basically paid off he even goes on to you know say quote academic fraud um was you know performed I guess by Dr Gary Nolan and the analysis of these beings right so basically what they what Dr Gary Nolan released about these um little beings right Steven G calls out as academic frog a hoax right these are the words he&#x27;s using I mean he comes out hard against Gary Nolan so let&#x27;s take a look how far have you gotten in your investigation into those beings that you talked about and studied in your serious documentary the small beings and I think you talked about Gary Nolan worked with you on that yeah Gary Nolan received a lot of money right after we gave gave him that genetic sample and he altered the results of it so we don&#x27;t know what that creature is he he received a lot of money yeah I think it was 3.4 million from the Pentagon and uh and then so he is now uh Contracting with the intelligence Community to show UAP injuries which is just a scop yeah of course I mean the UAP injuries are all man-made but of course you get someone like him the manade it&#x27;s the manmade engineered of course and and but you you this uh the stink on the ETS when it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ve done right so unfortunately you know I think that went sideways very badly so to this day we don&#x27;t know what that thing was now he published a report saying it was a deform fetus yes even though the top uh geneticist or uh doctor who deals with bone malformations said no way because it was Global it had growth plates uh consistent equivalent of a six-year-old human but it was only about 6 in tall and so we don&#x27;t know what it was it could have been something that is a completely unknown species on Earth it could have been something that&#x27;s a result of both Earth and nonhuman uh interactions that are ancient in that part of the atakama desert in Chile there are accounts of these UFOs being seen and these small creatures the adult ones are like a foot and a half tall but to this day we actually don&#x27;t know what it is I mean I never said it was ET I said we don&#x27;t know what it is but it&#x27;s most certainly not human so what was published by G Gary Nolan and those guys and I&#x27;ve had the top geneticists in the world tear apart their data say it&#x27;s totally hoaxed it&#x27;s totally academic fraud really yes but this H you know this is this is why you asked about being paranoid I&#x27;m careful but I&#x27;m not paranoid because I&#x27;ve had so many people who could go on the path of finding the truth and they either get blackmailed and or both bribed given a lot of money and next thing you know they&#x27;re everything goes sideways and so you know I&#x27;ve seen that dozens hundreds of times in 35 years so you know you know it makes you a little bit cynical I guess or skeptical so um but no no he I mean he completely started out as an honest person uh I know that and and when we first met and 2012 I think um but at this point man that&#x27;s got to be cleaned up it&#x27;s a mess yikes I mean Dr Steven Greer is going hard after Dr Gary Nolan right he is making some you know extraordinary claims against him um and I guess to some ways like trying to understand Dr Steven gre&#x27;s you know mentality right so he releases a documentary called siries right and it&#x27;s all about these little figures so for Dr Gary Nolan to sort of take the wind out of those sales is kind of you know what Dr Steven G may be upset about because in his mind you know he putting all his eggs in one basket on this right like there&#x27;s something here and then Dr Gary Nolan just be like no it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s nothing it&#x27;s just human weird but human and you know step GRE clearly is not okay with that but let&#x27;s be real why why wouldn&#x27;t you be like that&#x27;s still a cool documentary you found this thing it gets studied and then the conclusion is it&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s just human but it&#x27;s still a strange it&#x27;s like that&#x27;s okay it&#x27;s still like exciting it doesn&#x27;t need to remain so mysterious and be non-human like that&#x27;s okay to do that to go find the truth about something right it&#x27;s still exciting like I just don&#x27;t get it why some of these explanations don&#x27;t get accepted you know now let&#x27;s take a look at a clip from the serious documentary where Dr Gary Nolan is featured right in the documentary now clearly after all of this it changes but you know maybe this is why Dr Steven gr is mad right because in the documentary Dr Gary Nolan says one thing now granted he&#x27;s in charge of the editing so who knows but clearly afterwards the the story Chang but this is what Dr Gary Nolan said as it was featured in the serus documentary um great view of the eye socket very different eye socket from that&#x27;s another thing that the scientists who&#x27;ve looked at this um at Stanford of come on if you look at this creature and you look at the cranial Vault how large it is the the size from the eyes up is at least three times that of a human one of the first things that Dr lochman uh immediately remarked upon was the shape of the head and the skull it was not something that he is accustomed to seeing and it was quite interesting uh and in some ways exciting that the associated features that you would expect from a syndrome of that nature were not [Music] found this specimen does not fall under any known to me class of disorders or syndromes in many respects the proportions of the spine and extremities are normal the major abnormalities appear to be one the size of the specimen mid-face hypoplasia and underdevelopment of the jaw and that the specimen has only 10 ribs humans normally have 12 rarely 11 one of the most remarkable aspects of this is when we came down to study the actual bone density one of the features of uh fetuses that a specialist looks at is the so-called growth plates of the epipal uh joint say of the knees the the shock I think uh and the surprise was and the and the absolute certainty that uh Dr lochman had was that this specimen is between the age of uh six to 8 years old the shock was uh that this specimen was clearly not how do you explain how something 6 in tall survived to any length of time uh that would uh allow for it to survive 100 or a thousand years ago and look I found a clip of Dr Gary Nolan talking about this on Lex fredman&#x27;s podcast so I want to give uh Dr Gary Nolan a chance here to respond right to what Dr Steven Greer is saying but here&#x27;s kind of Dr Gary Nolan&#x27;s version of events you know here&#x27;s what he has to say of what exactly happened Steven Greer uh claimed that a skeleton discovered in atakama region of Chile might be an alien you reached out to him and uh took on the task of proving or disproving that with the rigor of science the result is a paper titled whole genome sequencing of Atacama Skeleton shows novel mutations linked with displasia can you tell this full story the story was as you put it right there correct reached out got a sample of the body did the DNA sequencing then worked with a team of uh two other Stanford scientists and uh Ro sequencing group Ro Diagnostics and probably a total team of about 11 or so people um and as is as his standard in these kinds of things the professors actually don&#x27;t do the work the students do the work and figured out the answer uh and then we helped them put together the story uh and the story was simply that uh it was human 100% I went into it thinking it was originally a monkey of some sort um I got kind of excited a few months into the process thinking well what happens if it is an alien yeah right can you describe some of the characteristics of the skeleton that makes it unique and interesting primarily it had dysmorphia of the of the brain um and so the first thing I did actually when I got pictures of it I took it to a local expert at Stanford uh and uh he was um on the paper and uh he was the world expert in pediatric bone dysmorph is he literally wrote the book and on this cuz that&#x27;s what you do you go to an expert when it&#x27;s outside of your field of of interest and he said well I haven&#x27;t seen this particular collection of mutations before uh or this uh this physiology before but here&#x27;s what I think it might be um and he said but based on the size of the of the thing and the bone density it would appear to be like six or seven years old now again that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the thing where I think the lay public doesn&#x27;t understand or takes a speculation like that and turns it into a fact no one ever said that it was that age we only said that the bones made it look like it was that age but then we went back and looked for uh genetic explanations of why things might look the way they did and if you again read the paper it&#x27;s very carefully caveat to say that these mutation might result in this but what we did find was an an unexpectedly large number of mutations associated with bone growth in this individual and it was just a bad roll of the dice right you roll the dice enough times with enough people born every year and someone will roll the wrong dice all at once so the sad part about it was individuals in the UFO Community who wanted to think that there was some sort of conspiracy around it right that somebody had somehow convinced all of my students uh to lie yeah I mean come on you know I I would lose my I would lose my job first of all uh and they would all be uh you know in trouble forever let&#x27;s go back to the ocama case that I was debunking it well debunking is a loaded term it sort of assumes that you were going in purposefully to prove something as wrong I wasn&#x27;t I was just going in to collect the data and um you know I I showed that this one was human there was another skull that somebody had at one point it was called the star child they called it the star child skull I said you know I looked at it I looked at the DNA sequencing that they had done I said this is human end of story um the people who owned the thing at the time disagreed with me and then eventually another group came in and proved that I was right and it&#x27;s not about debunking it&#x27;s about getting the more spectacular and hyped cases off the table I mean the reason I got interested in it is because somebody was hyping it and not because I wanted to disprove it but because I just wanted to know and let get it off the table cuz it&#x27;s usually the most extravagant things that are most likely to be wrong somewhere in the rubble will be something interesting so there you go you got Gary Nolan given his you know explanation of events of what happened and clearly he wouldn&#x27;t want to risk his job his profession his career um on hoaxing something or you know whatever um but it&#x27;s these allegations right from Dr Steven G and he seems so certain because Dr Gary Nolan got some funding he&#x27;s now paid off and he can&#x27;t trust anything thing he said look what he did to us on the serious documentary you know academic fraud hoax I mean these are strong allegations right um with zero proof just zero proof right um even if he said oh we had doctors look at this and that and they said it was something different that&#x27;s just different of opinions I mean we do that with doctors all the time right you get a second opinion but he goes so far as to say that these other people that he had looked at it they looked at the results of Dr Gary Nolan&#x27;s analysis and determined that was academic fraud or he hoaxed it how do you do that where&#x27;s the proof where&#x27;s the evidence of that where&#x27;s the show that right how did these guys come to that conclusion and are they willing to go on camera and say Dr Gary noan right because that I mean these are just huge huge allegations against Dr Gary Nolan with zero proof right and you know I wanted to show you in this video Dr G Nolan&#x27;s version of events too so you can decide for yourself I think I know where I stand um with this and you know again I don&#x27;t know why Dr Steven ger does this stuff he comes out against so many people and says some things that you know because I like listening to his interviews right but sometimes he just says things like this I&#x27;m just like what what um so anyway you got to see it for yourself make up your own mind um we&#x27;ll see you guys in the next video remember every day is a gift y&#x27;all peace I live ins my own world of kids screaming in the crad profanities I see the Earth through ice covered in in and cross out the ones who had my cries and watched me we</p>
