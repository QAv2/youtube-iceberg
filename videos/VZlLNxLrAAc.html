            <p>one of the first times we got one of these zero point energy devices going in the lab this sphere formed about 10 or 15 feet around the device and myself and the scientists were in this sphere and we could see different times of the planet i mean we saw dinosaurs we saw beings and things through this like a window wherever you look you could see this and it was so captivating it was like wow we just opened some sort of time rift or something and we&#x27;re actually viewing the planet right now as it was millions and millions and millions of years ago</p>
