            <p>welcome welcome are we live are we live let&#x27;s just wait for that stream to go and welcome to the alien scientist where we take a skeptical yet scientific and intelligent look into the ufo phenomenon and the possibilities of technology beyond our current time this is where i need intro music some jam and rocking tunes let me get this thing started up all right guys so today i wanted to take a minute and talk about this recent video that came out by fermilabs and um we&#x27;re gonna watch this and uh and take some time to break it down for my audience because we research anti-gravity here and uh i don&#x27;t know some some of us maybe may feel personally attacked by this video so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s dig in and see one of the most obvious observations about gravity is the simple aphorism what goes up must come down it&#x27;s just how gravity works it pulls things downwards but then there&#x27;s this thing some people talk about called anti-gravity is it real well no or at least probably not but respected scientists are looking into it which means that we need to know more [Music] it seems that a word like anti-gravity would be easy to define it should be the opposite of gravity something that would push you away from the earth for example but the term anti-gravity is used in many ways including dodgy things like explaining how ufos fly which is you know kind of silly i don&#x27;t know why that&#x27;s kind of silly i mean well if there&#x27;s stuff flying around that you know our navy and and these intelligence people are now coming out and admitting to the public they can&#x27;t explain what it is and that should be not really considered silly anymore in fact a lot of a number of intellectuals have now come out and come forward and say you know i can no longer ignore this and and pretend like it doesn&#x27;t exist so we are reaching the scientific community but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s important to pay attention to the message that they&#x27;re receiving and the message that we you know we want to bring to kind of have a merger this is where i i sit on a fine line of a knife&#x27;s edge between this ufo community and the scientific community and they both kind of atta i get attacked from kind of both sides so let&#x27;s break this down though this is uh this is good stuff however researchers at cern are investigating the possibility of real anti-gravity using antimatter and yeah gotta admit that sounds totally cool i&#x27;ll talk about this very real science in a moment but first i think it would be fun to spend a little more time on the silly stuff so let&#x27;s talk about some of the ideas you can easily find if you surf the internet the most common is when people imagine that some sort of electrical current will overcome gravity they go by names like gravido electrics or sometimes electrogravidics just to change it up then there is another term you&#x27;ll find called gravito magnetics now first of all these are all made up terms these all sound very sciencey and all but they&#x27;re not and furthermore oh but they&#x27;re not okay so that was dawn&#x27;s explanation for those terms which you can find in the literature if you research this stuff um i would recommend that dawn and the physicists who write these scripts from fermilab go and check out nathan inn&#x27;s presentation right here for the ssi the space studies institute and check out right here at about 52 minutes where i where i show on slide number 38 he gives a clear definition of what gravitation electrum the analogs here that are being used and his presentation is definitely one to watch to understand what those mean by those particular theoretical approaches to gravity and the you know on the attempts of physicists in the past to try to understand gravity and come up with a formal law which is often based on other laws that we see and find in nature namely electromagnetism where gravido electric refers to the electric analog or of the of the gravity equation and gravito magnetic refers to a mass that&#x27;s moving through space-time should create a gravido-magnetic field in the same way that an electric charge passing through space-time creates a magnetic field so yes very important to to learn what your terms mean before you you uh and research the terminology before you just dismiss it all out right different people will use the same term for different phenomena so that should tell you something about how seriously you should take them well no it&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot of people that have kind of used um it&#x27;s electro gravitic is like the wrong term and that&#x27;s you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ll find that a lot in the literature to describe ion wind and uh you know going back to the 1920s with the bifeld brown effect and you&#x27;ll find you&#x27;ll find this all throughout the literature it was the bifeld brown effect was investigated up until the 1950s at bonson labs to try to really understand you know what if there was some sort of coupling between the electromagnetic field and gravity and there is an ion wind effect but you should also read this paper and some of the subsequent literature again that there&#x27;s a lot of literature in here because there&#x27;s lots of experiments that have been done in vacuum chambers and and ways that have eliminated all the ion wind completely from the equation and they find that there&#x27;s still a propulsive force developed by asymmetric capacitors in a vacuum and this is this debate rages to this day with the m drive and you know experimental evidence that they&#x27;re getting effects which aren&#x27;t explained by physics and um it&#x27;s not just it&#x27;s not this there&#x27;s a lot of there&#x27;s a lot of confusion in the field so there&#x27;s a lot of you know confusing terms that are misused or misidentified coronal winds um there there is this all over the literature and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not as it&#x27;s not as you know it&#x27;s a lot deeper than than he makes it out to be so but here are some specific ideas in the 1990s a researcher claimed that rotating superconducting disks would shield two percent of gravity another person has claimed that parallel plate capacitors can shield gravity then there is the claim that flowing dense fluids and pipes wrapped around a torus will create a repulsive gravitational field well you now that&#x27;s that&#x27;s really interesting because let&#x27;s go back and cover this what he just said because it it was you know for newcomers to this i can understand that they see this stuff and they think oh god it&#x27;s ridiculous if they haven&#x27;t done really dove into the research here um disks would shield two percent of gravity okay if you go and watch the first off he doesn&#x27;t you got to be real careful because you know science real science and respectful science names their sources so if you&#x27;re going to talk about someone&#x27;s research in science and you don&#x27;t name your source so that other researchers can go and look this up and research this then your it&#x27;s basically i i always worry whenever i see news articles that don&#x27;t give their sources i think propaganda right so when you see a science a science video from fermi lab no less this is some of the best physicists in the world showing that they haven&#x27;t read the literature and this is getting a hundred thousand views um and educating all these you know people or at least portraying to educate people about the the real science behind this yet they haven&#x27;t read the research they can&#x27;t even name the part they can&#x27;t even name dr eugene podclitnov all right and if you go i have an interview with him on my channel because i actually researched this and you know didn&#x27;t just you know say it was rotating superconductors because he&#x27;s missing the bi-layer and he&#x27;s missing the radio frequency fields and that&#x27;s covered in part five of five where it&#x27;s called nasa&#x27;s huge mistake that&#x27;s what eugene poglitnov called it because this is this was also missing from the nasa replications that were done with whit brantley at nasa and uh frank sinatrak was there and i interviewed frank whit brantley is dead now but you know i&#x27;ve i&#x27;ve done the we&#x27;re gonna try and get frank back on my channel for for a future apec conference we hold uh we hold an alternative propulsion engineering conference so it&#x27;s not just anti-gravity it encompasses all you know propulsion engineering and different types of reactionless propulsion and and research into alternative propulsion technology that will replace rockets one day because it&#x27;s not silly to think that there might be these flying saucers flying around out there and they might be using propulsion systems that are closer to you know alien technology than than rockets that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not super silly to think about this and and i think the future is gonna gonna laugh at people like fermilab for making this video on antigravity that ignores some of the key research and it&#x27;s not just the rotating superconductors yeah there are ideas about gravitational drag being involved in rotation you know in the rotation of superconductors right and that goes back to you know bryce do it in 1966 you know who published an article in a peer-reviewed article in physics review letters uh superconductors and gravitational drag um so there you have it uh this is this guy bryce dewitt if you know who that is he was one of the forefathers of quantum gravity alongside john archibald wheeler so we&#x27;ll see none of these none of these researchers names are named in this you know complete review of physics but i don&#x27;t want to be too scathing of them because they&#x27;re just not they just didn&#x27;t do their research and i want to help them do their research and i don&#x27;t want to turn them off to this area of research because it is this bi-layered disc it&#x27;s kind of almost shown in this superconductor it looks like it has this layer these two layered materials and those layers are super important because those layers are host to what are known in physics as two-dimensional topologies or two-dimensional materials and inside two-dimensional materials you can you have a very interesting environment quantum environment that occurs and you&#x27;re able to do things with this quantum environment that normal materials don&#x27;t exhibit these kinds of properties there&#x27;s uh there&#x27;s all kinds of research being done into this university of rochester uh working on using these con these very similar physics concepts to produce negative mass in the laboratory you know it&#x27;s a brief type of negative energy state and uh i just they they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re not researching this thoroughly and they&#x27;re not doing it justice and i&#x27;m i&#x27;m ashamed that this uh this has so many views and i want my audience to please like this video share this video and post this everywhere you see anyone posting this video so that people can get educated on the real physics another person has claimed that parallel plate capacitors another person another person again you&#x27;re not citing sources that this is richard van durk&#x27;s experiment i believe jeremiah correct me if i&#x27;m wrong um but this is this is a field gravity then there is the claim that flowing dense fluids and pipes wrapped around a torus will create a repulsive gravitational field while you&#x27;ll even find people who claim to have made machines using these principles none of these ideas have ever been replicated by other researchers scientific claims okay so people making machines to measure you know the gravito magnetic moment how about like nasa and gravity probe b you know why don&#x27;t we go to nasa.gov and see the page on gravity pro b and educate ourselves on that one so that you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s you know this is i didn&#x27;t make this up this didn&#x27;t come from the ufo community that haven&#x27;t been replicated should make you go and of course no discussion of anti-gravity again um hathaway and uh hathaway and blair cleveland george hathaway and blair cleveland if you look up their paper they replicated the podclitnov experiment right um i&#x27;ll post this in the in this link in the description too i&#x27;ll have to leave this one open but if you search for podcanov by layer you have to search for podclit nov by layer because if you leave that bilayer part out of the equation then you&#x27;re not going to get the same you&#x27;re not going to get the whole physics picture and you&#x27;re going to think it&#x27;s just this but he would be complete without touching on the ufo enthusiast community okay so i&#x27;m gonna go back because this is funny and of course no discussion of anti-gravity would be complete without touching on the ufo enthusiast community oh yes because your nine minute video is complete a complete discussion on all the research that&#x27;s been done into anti-gravity some members claim that the u.s government is in possession of a crashed ufo or two the most famous is the supposed crash of a flying saucer at roswell which the story says was transferred to hangar 18 at wright-patterson air force base well hey hey we got to give him credit here guys he at least he gets this right but for the record i&#x27;ve never claimed that the us government is in possession of this uh numerous witnesses and numerous people over the years have claimed that and i&#x27;m just saying you know i&#x27;m putting i put that in my presentation to the uap task force because i think it&#x27;s something that i believe as a citizen is you know maybe worth looking into by my government if something like that does exist i don&#x27;t say i never claim that it does exist i just said hey you know this is a lot of people are claiming this and i&#x27;m interested and curious about it what can let&#x27;s continue this is funny and who can forget the claims that at a facility called s4 not far from the famed area 51 that the us has not won but seven captured flying saucers which the government has reverse engineered those would all be amazing if they were true but they&#x27;re not now i know that some of you again you can&#x27;t definitively claim that it&#x27;s you know the government does not have crashed alien disks bro you can&#x27;t like you know you could say that&#x27;s probably not true it&#x27;s there&#x27;s no evidence for that right so we&#x27;re gonna you know just assume that it&#x27;s probably not true based on the you know probability based on evidence but you can&#x27;t you know you can&#x27;t just you can&#x27;t just say that it&#x27;s definitely not true you know you can&#x27;t it&#x27;s a no that&#x27;s false you know the s4 stuff even the even yeah i&#x27;m a seasoned bob lazar critic i i own bob lazarddebunk.com again he won&#x27;t name the source but if you go to bob lazarddebunk.com i i clearly talk about you know i clearly to talk about s4 and and i&#x27;ve no i&#x27;ve been debating bob lazar long enough to know that you you can&#x27;t prove that there wasn&#x27;t you know a facility there that the government didn&#x27;t cover it up and it&#x27;s all underground and they changed everything and and erased it from the history books you can&#x27;t totally disprove that to the people that really really want to believe that but that&#x27;s that&#x27;s just the nature of truth and belief it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not not my fault um again that&#x27;s this is uh that i just want to point out to the ufo community so that people can begin to see the harm and irreparable damage that people like jeremy corbell have caused to ufology by promoting frauds like bob lazar as you know so the physics community sees bob lazar and and that&#x27;s it for them you know it&#x27;s very powerful and very important for people to see this and understand it in action who will disagree with me on topics of ufos and captured flying saucers and anti-gravity technology and others will claim that i&#x27;m lying to hide the truth but to quote carl sagan extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so i say prove it and make it worth your while if you have evidence of a true anti-gravity device there&#x27;s a prize waiting you worth a million euros which is over a million bucks it&#x27;s called the gaudi award and i put a link to the award in the video description if you believe you have developed an anti-gravity device oh boy one million dollars if we make the most important discovery of all human in all human history pretty much um only one million that&#x27;s it uh fermilabs let&#x27;s uh let&#x27;s just look up fermi labs real quick i i believe they have a budget yeah here&#x27;s their budget for 2019. their budget was 550 million so they you know what&#x27;s one million dollars you know that and that&#x27;s only if you that&#x27;s only if you&#x27;ve done the research that that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s just their grants to do the research that they want to do based on their theories and their physics so i don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s kind of unfair man not really i&#x27;m not not really you know super tempt this is worth billions this is worth billions of dollars it should be a hundred billion dollar prize for this and there should be several like a dozen or so one million dollar grants just for people that like me that want to pursue this this is ridiculous like i&#x27;m i&#x27;m sitting here getting compared to bob lazar and i&#x27;ve done a million times more research and have sources to prove it everything everything&#x27;s linked in the description we live in a world in which it is possible to make outlandish claims that then spread like wildfire across the internet but that doesn&#x27;t make them true no more than the one i heard the other day which was that the fermilab&#x27;s famous dr don knew too much so he was neutralized and replaced with a high-tech android using advanced alien technology from zeta reticuli and there&#x27;s no truth to that one none at all i&#x27;m not saying that anti-gravity is absolutely impossible dude that was kind of cringe man i&#x27;m going to be honest admittedly it&#x27;s not something that is currently accepted by normal physics but i&#x27;m in the business of searching dude all of the all the physics that we discussed is normal physics there&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s crazy we it would get it would get laughed off of our platform we have a whole team of physicists and engineers very competent people looking into this this is this is ridiculous to say that you know it&#x27;s not based on real physics because it is you haven&#x27;t looked into it you&#x27;ve shown that you haven&#x27;t looked into it and i&#x27;m telling you now you guys need to look into this and and let me interview you don lincoln and we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll have a discussion on this why don&#x27;t you just jump on and yeah what if it is the truth and they did replace them huh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a funny people in the chat um but this is this is the good part because he says pay attention right but i&#x27;m in the business of searching for phenomena that aren&#x27;t described by currently accepted physics theories so i&#x27;d be thrilled if one of these ideas worked out it&#x27;s just that okay none of them have so far okay okay none of them have so far well why is darpa still funding the m drive okay why is why is you know all right let&#x27;s let&#x27;s get into they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve replicated this at nasa they&#x27;ll cite the nasa replications which left out these key components and then say well this didn&#x27;t work out you know but you didn&#x27;t do the experiment right and you&#x27;re not taking the physics seriously and you&#x27;re laughing this stuff off the table before you give it a chance so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like they they claim that they&#x27;re looking for new evidence and looking for new um experimental you know results but they&#x27;re ignoring the experimental results and saying that this is french physics and that you know this these all the people that follow my channel and do a alternative experimental science are you know are imagining this this nonsense with the super cavitation and transmutation elements and and cold fusion all that stuff all cold fusion was ridiculed for 30 years they weren&#x27;t looking for new new experimental data they weren&#x27;t looking for a new um new data they were they were trying to prove existing theories and they were trying to maintain the status quo&#x27;s stranglehold over the energy industry which i think had a lot to do with why alternative technologies and energy research and stuff has been so suppressed but anyways uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s getting too into conspiracy theory land it&#x27;s just we need more none of them have so far it&#x27;s because you only offer a one million dollar prize to the winner who has to prove this stuff god i if i came out with anti-gravity you don&#x27;t think lockheed martin would come right up to me and offer me more than one million dollars to shut my mouth about it like come on dude that prize is a joke on the other hand there are a few groups of serious and respected researchers who are looking into what one might call anti-gravity basically they ask if matter falls down does antimatter fall up these experiments are done at cern fermilab&#x27;s sister laboratory in europe now both laboratories know how to make antimatter making antiprotons or anti-electrons is pretty easy with the equipment we have and fermilab once had the world&#x27;s premier anti-proton production facility but neither anti-protons nor anti-electrons are suitable because they have electric charge and the elect okay so they they built all this you know billion dollar equipment multi-million dollar equipment and it&#x27;s useless because you know the things that they create have electric charge and so like any minut it&#x27;s really difficult to take measurements and and get like your measurements exact and make sure that you&#x27;ve eliminated all interference because because the tiniest you know stray electromagnetic field can throw all your experiments out of whack and and mess up all your sensors so it&#x27;s the the and and again he only cites fermi labs research and he says the only serious and respected researchers looking into this right well it&#x27;s if you go to um back to this page um let me find let me find it on here so we go down to uh the the sharon&#x27;s institute um paul shearns where is the paul shearns institute um paul scherer sorry paul sharer um right here here&#x27;s a pdf uh from t it&#x27;s called testing anti-gravity with muonium so they use muonium which is neutral it has it has no charge because it&#x27;s balanced and it doesn&#x27;t react with everything because it&#x27;s made of anti-muons and they&#x27;re doing this at um eth zurich and uh in the university of byrne in switzerland so this is a little different than fermi labs so again it&#x27;s not they don&#x27;t give the credit to the researchers i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s part of why why they do that if it&#x27;s just part of their marketing or the way that they write the scripts but there&#x27;s other researchers there&#x27;s also daniel m kaplan at the university of illinois illinois right who&#x27;s doing research the same kind of research with muonium to test antimatter to see if it falls up so there&#x27;s multiple other you know respected irresponsible you know serious researchers um doing research on this but again again you probably it&#x27;s just a short summary so i i&#x27;m and i&#x27;m going to this is taking way too long force is enormously stronger than gravity the exact strength difference this is really basic boring stuff that he goes over it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like a fresh it&#x27;s like a freshman level college level introduction to physics maybe high school level it&#x27;s really basic stuff and he talks about the equivalence principle and how they measure and the upcoming measurements at cern and then um here but it&#x27;s coming and the measurement is going to be super epic this is real science on the other hand bringing this back to the scientifically irresponsible side of the even if the cern experiments find that antimatter falls up that doesn&#x27;t help us with making gravity shields in our house nor does it really explain the claims of the ufo community anti-really hard to make and that would still be true even with very advanced technology and it&#x27;s also still true that magnets superconductors capacitors and spinning toroids don&#x27;t cancel gravity sorry all right guys okay well sorry don but those super conductors have layered uh structured 2d two-dimensional physics environments where</p>
