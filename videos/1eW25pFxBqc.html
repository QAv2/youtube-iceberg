            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>this episode has been brought to you by justin.com if you&#x27;re tired of being censored tired of having your data stolen and sold go to justin.com a social media site where all voices are welcome what&#x27;s going on everybody thank you all so much for tuning into this very important segment of M suas I am your humble host as always always Nico house uh and today I wanted to share with you all a story that I think is is extremely important probably the most important Story of the Year and bits and pieces of it have been getting released throughout the last few years but the problem with um an introductory story such as this one which involves you know Facebook it involves certain applications it involves politics Tak it involves CIA uh and even involves some Venture capitalism they get started but you no what takes them seriously because you don&#x27;t see the results and it is unfortunately usually and not until people see the results that they believe uh and start taking it seriously and so I think at this point it is important for us to go ahead and start talking about all these connections that a lot of people have have missed over the years and start bringing it back together so recently I was on my Instagram doing my Instagram thing you know double tapping it up checking who double tapped me which is usually not that many people unfortunately because I&#x27;m not that good-looking but you know I take awesome pictures of my cat and I think that they&#x27;re worth the double tap so if you&#x27;re on Instagram go ahead and follow me at ncsc but anyway uh I was on Instagram and this this uh app came across my page it said Brigade oh this is an app where you get to find out what your representatives are doing in office and what they&#x27;re voting for so I said well damn I need that that would be awesome so I click on it then things get a little weird so like I said they said that it was about finding out what your representatives are doing however what it does in reality is a little bit more detailed than that it actually asked you to tell your senators and your representatives what you want it asks for your address so that they can verify that you&#x27;re a voter I you know if if it doesn&#x27;t really I feel like it doesn&#x27;t matter really but the point is because you can actually they send that data right to the politicians via Petition of course all legal via petition to to let them know what you want and what you&#x27;re what you what you hope to see get done which sounds like a really good idea uh except for they start asking for like when you ask for my address just ask if I&#x27;m a registered voter and I put my name my birthday uh and and my ZIP code and you should be able to verify from that why you want my personal address is beyond me but of course the suspicious side of Nico who recognizes patterns such as these immediately thought this sounds oddly familiar I know another company another social media platform that just asked for way too much personal information so let me go ahead and start doing some research so I did said who started up this company I look up Brigade and it was like some random company in real it was a real estate company in India didn&#x27;t make any sense it&#x27;s like that so this must be a new name change because in Silicon Valley when they don&#x27;t know if an app is going to be successful or if a piece of technology will be successful they launch it under what&#x27;s called a stealth uh name and then they make the adjustments and then re-release re-release it under its real name uh but this isn&#x27;t its first real name and we&#x27;ll go into that in a little bit so I found out that one Shawn Parker at actually invested $9 million now some people would say what what&#x27;s the problem with that you know that&#x27;s that could be a potentially really successful app especially given the political atmosphere that we found ourselves in recently it&#x27;s you know people have become more politically engaged uh especially via social media and so that sound like a Sound Investment but the thing about an investment is you expect for there to be a clear plan to make make money so that you can get a return on your Investments you get that right so Facebook didn&#x27;t make money in the beginning but there was a clear long-term path and a uh a and a a plan laid out for how they would make money in the future and clearly they&#x27;re making a lot of it so uh $9 million for something that you have no idea you&#x27;re going to make money on is a little weird isn&#x27;t it at least that&#x27;s what it seems like if you&#x27;re expecting them to make money on the front end what I assume this is all speculative this part is speculative anyway what I assume is what is that we will see something very similar to what we&#x27;ve seen for Facebook which is that they will sell our data on the back end and they got in trouble recently again for doing that they they they just won&#x27;t stop and why do I think that well people Sean Parker has an interesting relationship with this guy named Peter Fel who has happened to be the the fun founding member of What&#x27;s called the founders fun Peter the also might sound familiar to some of you because he was the one who gave that $500,000 initial investment to Facebook yeah yeah but it gets better there&#x27;s another there&#x27;s another investment that doesn&#x27;t often get discussed when it comes to Facebook which is the $13 million investment that came from inq by way of Peter Theo once again what a surprise inq tell in case you didn&#x27;t know is a venture capitalist firm based out of Arlington V Virginia who has one purpose and one purpose alone to invest in technology for the CIA so Peter theel and Shawn Parker Shawn Parker being the one who invested the 9 million into Brigade which is this political app I just showed you and Peter the are both connected and we&#x27;re Partners in or are Partners in uh and later on Shawn Parker left however he was a partner at the time of making that purchase but he was a partner in this this Founders fund connected to the very man who started up Facebook essentially yeah oh yeah now inails also in case you were curious responsible for Google Earth which they literally created because the CIA asked them to why are why is this so important because there is this this Theory somehow that&#x27;s not somehow it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the American dream theory right you see propaganda like uh social media is that what they called it social social networking The Social Network the movie with with Mark Zuckerberg that was a propaganda machine to get people to to to think that it&#x27;s like some Feelgood story that like if you work hard enough and your technology is great we&#x27;ll buy it you&#x27;ll find Venture capitalists to buy and that is true to a very very uh marginal I want to say a marginal degree because yeah venture capitalist will buy it that is very true but the ones who are funding the venture capitalist who are who are funding the major projects that show a lot of uh applicable potential for like you know CIA operations it&#x27;s all coming from the CIA mostly I want you to understand something like I said Sean Parker is connected to the very guy directly connected like they worked together they raised Capital together to invest in these projects the very guy who took money from the CIA to start Facebook Facebook the same company that was invented in the college dorm room in 2003 was launched in 2004 launched fully launched 2004 where Mark Zuckerberg was already having interviews shortly after not a long time after launch not 2007 2008 2004 Mark Zuckerberg was having interviews talking about um literally what we call to Day applications he&#x27;s talking about applications and how we&#x27;ll be able to interface with Facebook mind you people the iPhone hadn&#x27;t even been invented yet the iPhone hadn&#x27;t even been invented yet the average person hadn&#x27;t even thought about the term application I&#x27;m sure that he had to a degree but it phones wouldn&#x27;t even have had really the the capabilities that we have right now to deal to talk about applications in the way that we do and that&#x27;s how he was talking about it like how we talk about applications right now he was talking about this in 2004 before an iPhone had been invented people we were still on no Kia playing snake and break breaker now as you all know DARPA the Ci&#x27;s research and development uh Wing had this program where l everything Facebook does right now storing your data checking where you go seeing what pisses you off seeing what makes you happy seeing who you vote for who you don&#x27;t want to vote for who the market like what what things you buy things like that CIA had a program that ended in 2004 and then Facebook launched like I think it was like either the same day or the same month but it was in 2004 and if that doesn&#x27;t just get yall excited Regina Dugan was in charge of DARPA was the head of the DARPA Wing right before she went over to Facebook well first actually I lied let me be clear she went to Google first so no no big deal there she went to Google first and was made the head one of the heads then she was made the head of the secret research Wing the techn technology wing of Facebook and then she only stayed there for a year and a half coincidentally enough during the election and then like mid 2017 she left I want you to understand how serious this Founders fund SL inq tell investment is into this particular app people Founders fund invested in another thing something else called quadium it&#x27;s owned by ex CIA analyst his name is junio and he worked for Dara too what a goddamn coincidence what a coincidence uh and he was so talented they had so much confidence in his abilities people so much confidence in his abilities they gave him 40 $ million $40 million and guess what that thing does because you know CIA wants it he he he&#x27;s a ex I I I throw up quotations because CIA has what they call official assets and unofficial assets so he would technically be now an unofficial asset if he was still connected to them which probably is so this technology allows him to index every single device not in a state but in the country and potentially in the world allows you to index every device connected to public WiFi or internet in an hour in an hour this is the company funded this is a company funded by the same CIA conected company funding this brigade app saying Hey give tell our politicians what you want so that they know exactly how to Pander tell our politicians if you vote so they make sure they know who to Pander to so we can get the right people in office so we can tell Camala Harris that that she she likes Medicare for all now that is dangerous it is underhanded and I want you to understand something if you see if you come across this app do not download it share this video everywhere if you have this app and for some of you who had it in 2015 uh it was actually called changes uh and people were really excited about it I remember because it was it was primarily at that point a debate and discourse app and then Facebook kind of like took that job realize something people there are no such thing as coincidences $30 billion like Facebook being able to be pushed like that 30 billion for Mark Zuckerberg I think he&#x27;s worth a little bit more than that now bazos now worth like he richest man in the world by far not even close take 600 million from the CIA for technology uh and then in the same year buys Washington Post for 250 million the same Washington Post who just loves quoting random unverified CIA assets to throw the American people into a friend the same Jeff pizos who&#x27;s worth ungodly amounts of money who couldn&#x27;t even turn a profit just four years ago he couldn&#x27;t even turn a profit they could not they could barely make money from Amazon and as soon as the CIA starts injecting money into them tada those are the people investing in this particular app so we have to make sure that one we&#x27;re not worshiping these false businessmen because they are in fact not actual businessmen they aren&#x27;t better than you or I they&#x27;re not smarter often times than you or I they were just willing to sell out you have people like Mark cubin who I mean good God the man owns like everything from basketball teams to technology to to to a broadcast station that he just sold the N ABC he just sold a br or he partnered with them and he&#x27;s only worth three billion and he like over 80 streams of income people who are busting their ass ass all the time never even touch never come close to somebody like bizos even though they&#x27;re also part of disruptive Industries and also have large invest investments in disruptive Industries as well the Mark Zuckerberg of the world they made a movie about him because they had to have you believe the story because at that time it was coming out that the C CIA had invested in him those same people who invested in him invested in this app so good googly mly it&#x27;s exhausting people it really is oh by the way the same firm invested in SpaceX so there&#x27;s that should have mentioned that look people knowledge is power it really is and so you know enough about Facebook you know enough about politics you know enough about the the entertainment industry you know like like the broadcast industry you know enough about these things that it&#x27;s time to start making a decision we have to move we have to have a mass Exodus onto another platform I personally promote Justin you know that justin.com we&#x27;ve had like aund we have a whole hundreds of people registering this week um because of all this information that keeps coming out as of late but there is a coordinated effort people understand to silence us there is a coordinated effort to influence our opinions there&#x27;s a coordinated effort to corrupt even the uncorruptible not by saying hey we&#x27;re evil CIA operatives here&#x27;s some money no they say you have a dream we believe in you and for a lot of ambitious people that&#x27;s all it takes but even the Twitter CEO as successful as he has been he received some money but even as successful as he has been has not even come close to like a Zuckerberg what&#x27;s the difference maybe he didn&#x27;t get20 million to start a company it&#x27;s about who they want to succeed and who they can use for their agenda so with that being said people remember more than anything else find your balance peace</p>
