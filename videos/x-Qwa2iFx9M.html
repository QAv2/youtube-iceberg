            <p>hello citizens and non-citizens of Miller&#x27;s planet welcome back if you&#x27;re returning if not welcome to the channel I have got a great video for you today we&#x27;re gonna be diving deep into the world of free energy claims a couple days ago I got this message from this fella and he left me a comment about a guy named Gerard Maureen he messaged me about how Gerard in this one video was pulling off some free energy wizardry so I visited this guy Gerard Channel and Gerard has a bunch of videos on this channel where he just he talks about unique stuff after what I saw I immediately became compelled to make this video so this first video I want to show you is called free energy the embarrassing truth or on Gerard&#x27;s channel it&#x27;s called the doubt about over unity is over I&#x27;m sorry if it kind of looks like I&#x27;m jumping between cuts this guy Gerard does not edit any of his videos at all and half of the video is just them walking around the garage and I thought that would get pretty boring for some people so I just left in the important parts so let&#x27;s go ahead and get started with this first one his name is Roman I&#x27;m gonna let him introduce myself I&#x27;m the co-director of the metaphysics Academy of the nation that sounds like a cult getting the new earth ready a little weird okay so he&#x27;s done introducing himself what the hell is his job and where does he work the new earth dot work they need a physicist but what would his job be just kind of getting new physics uh maybe I&#x27;ll do some research on it later so my input for everybody and I don&#x27;t want to have any more question my input is for horse power so if you want to follow along with what they&#x27;re plugging in the energy source is going to be a four horse power I think he says diesel later I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s just a generator so what he&#x27;s doing is he&#x27;s gonna take this power source plug it into a step-up and then a step-down transformer and then that output is gonna go to four other appliances and he claims that if he doesn&#x27;t blow this 30 amp fuse on his generator and the the appliances work then it&#x27;s some kind of miracle so you have to have a mover to start an electricity doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s moving parts not moving parts you have to give something into it it&#x27;s no such thing as free energy so he&#x27;s saying that you got to give something in no such thing as free energy but that&#x27;s kind of what he&#x27;s trying to prove is that there&#x27;s some kind of like universal untapped power this is what he calls cold fusion or cold radiation call radiation that&#x27;s kind of like the theme of this video is him trying to prove that all of this magical stuff that&#x27;s happening it&#x27;s happening because cold radiation is involved which I don&#x27;t know what the hell that is supposed to mean I guess let&#x27;s watch the video and find out we have 1500 watts fourteen hundred and fifty watts 1450 1500 watts 1500 watts the next one so we already know my machine cannot ran that so they&#x27;re saying their load is 6,000 watts the power we hook it up to only one side of this transformer we hook it up to this transformer and this is a 50 TV you can 50,000 watt so that&#x27;s the step-up transformer that he&#x27;s plugging in I&#x27;m assuming and with producing high voltage but the conversion goes to call radiation the amperage coming out the high voltage produced coal radiation the temperature really drops up more than normal and as we going to hook up the system the radiation was going to lower down because we&#x27;re using radiation is the flicker shishun of radiation and that&#x27;s normal because radiation is your energy not amperage what [ __ ] man what is that supposed to mean so he&#x27;s looking at this at this transformer and he&#x27;s thinking oh this thing does not run off of amperage it runs off of cold radiation do you think when he says radiation that he means like like electromagnetic radiation like light waves like radio waves does this guy think that transformers are just antennas when it comes from amperage it&#x27;s volts and radiation only makes things move I activate this scan to produce a very high volt with coal radiation dump it into this scan which is 25 25,000 watts so that is the step-down transformer I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m guessing he&#x27;s using a step-down transformer because you can&#x27;t just put 14,000 volts into appliances that would be very bad so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s see what happens when he starts running this thing he&#x27;s still taking temperature readings he&#x27;s just going around what does that prove I don&#x27;t get what a cold reading because it&#x27;s cold it&#x27;s running because it&#x27;s cold I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know this parts important he&#x27;s saying that he&#x27;s gonna send some radiation back to the can he&#x27;s turning one of the appliances off and because he turns one of the appliances off there&#x27;s more amperage going to the other appliances so it immediately gets louder and he thinks that something magical is happening and let&#x27;s watch so immediately after he turns off that one appliance you can hear all the other three appliances start ramping up in power which probably means that you&#x27;re running your appliances at the lowest possible power that they can operate at this next part is very funny to me [Music] it&#x27;s cold radiation and then the guy says hey measure the other one and he just goes and measures the same one again hey man if you love radiation so much why don&#x27;t you marry this guy kinda reminds me of have you guys ever played fallout3 kind of reminds me of confessor Cromwell that guy that stays around the bomb in Megaton your stuff hurrying shall exist no longer it shall be washed away in atoms below that&#x27;s my radiation [Music] it&#x27;s that&#x27;s not a Geiger counter that&#x27;s a multimeter and even if it was a Geiger counter wouldn&#x27;t that be a little concerning like why is this transformer giving off radiation while it runs should I be getting myself somewhere safe am I going to get cancer from this just a thought and push through radiation and voltage entered unit and you whole house you will never burn a lightbulb after that period because radiation do not burn radiation do not burn does that mean I don&#x27;t have to use sunscreen every time I leave the house I&#x27;ve been doing it this whole time for no reason all system is got a very sharp end which sharpens is heat on your wave all jokes aside what the hell did he just say he didn&#x27;t uh that didn&#x27;t that didn&#x27;t mean anything let&#x27;s just go back to what he said hold on trade radios you voltage you will never burn a light all house hundred turn a light pole sharp and on your way sharp ends your heat on your wave he&#x27;s like he&#x27;s like doing his victory lap in front of these two guys now he&#x27;s like did you see that wasn&#x27;t that so cool radiation power homes because of sharp edges also radiation don&#x27;t burn so those are the benefits he doesn&#x27;t seem to like form coherent thoughts and these guys are just kind of like eating it up they&#x27;re not saying anything they&#x27;re not like hey you might be wrong I would be saying something because that just seems insane and these guys are just like yep that seems right I guess I&#x27;ll just list I&#x27;ll just keep listening to what you&#x27;re saying so I can only put so much radiation and those family takes a while to fill up that just like a like a tank of gas you gotta fill up the radiation when you can to fill radiation you have you gotta fill up the radiation do you guys do you see why this is so funny to me that&#x27;s a transformer how do you think a transformer works my guy does he think a transformer is like a radiation storage unit there&#x27;s ninety percent of this energy that can be recycled and used which is again a lot of proof that we can generate over unity and over 90 is is here over unity what the hell is over unity Oh free energy how convenient and it has been hidden from us since more than a hundred years if you have a little bit of humanity left in your soul you would try to do something to bring this knowledge out prove us wrong just prove us wrong and why those energy company knows about it we are giving them money we&#x27;re giving them our power and what they do with that just keep the money corrupt the whole system this guys bought into every single thing that this guy&#x27;s tried to sell them like oh what&#x27;s that voltage and amperage are unrelated to electricity completely and we&#x27;re made up by the world government in order to control us so that we would have to use their regular electricity with like rules and stuff uh yeah I&#x27;m on board look I would imagine if you didn&#x27;t really know anything about like chemistry or physics or engineering if this guy walked up to you and was like hey you want to say something cool get into my van and then started showing you all this stuff and then started explaining it in science II sounding terms you&#x27;d be kinda tempted to agree with him especially if he was promising you free energy I mean sure I&#x27;d love a cold radiation-free interview device in my backyard so I can finally fire up my time machine and go back to a time before I had seven kids I mean these kids are driving me insane no Ronald can you please get egg mcmuffin jr. to wipe you but unfortunately the world does not operate in that way those three heaters were probably operating at the lowest wattage they could possibly operate at that is why when you unplugged one of them the other three you could hear them ramp back up also that&#x27;s all you were using probably wasn&#x27;t drawing any kind of significant current because there was no load on the motor the power was probably buffered by the step-up transformer or the current was at least step-up transformers lower the current significantly on the output which is probably why the 30 amp fuse didn&#x27;t blow up who knows if that was even a 30 amp fuse who knows if this whole thing wasn&#x27;t faked in some weird elaborate way not that it was like so outlandish that it would need some huge elaborate hoax this guy is a lot of videos they&#x27;re all great but I kind of feel bad for this guy I&#x27;m not saying like oh this guy&#x27;s such an idiot I feel so bad for him I&#x27;m just saying like no one really corrected this weird behavior early and everyone in the internet kind of looks it just kind of looks like he&#x27;s growing like a fanbase and no one&#x27;s really calling him out I don&#x27;t know well someone definitely had to call him out because most of his videos comments are disabled but I guess he just doesn&#x27;t listen to it no I&#x27;m not trying to like roast the guy it&#x27;s just funny to me that like so many of these channels are spreading lies on YouTube when none of their evidence has been substantiated so Gerard Morin if you ever see this you probably won&#x27;t because you haven&#x27;t been active for two years but free energy does not exist in conclusion you should find some friends that actually correct you you should find an actual source and you should just listen to them listen to what they&#x27;re saying take in the real information well I think that is going to do it for this video guys thank you so much for watching if you have seen any weird wacky free energy videos on YouTube and you want me to take a look at it feel free to leave a link down in the comments I would love to make another one of these videos okay bye bye
