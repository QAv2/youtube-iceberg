            <p>Maxwell&#x27;s equations are four really elegant equations that explain electromagnetism these equations are not easy but give me about 30 seconds and I&#x27;ll explain each one as simplest as I can Maxwell&#x27;s first equation is called gauss&#x27;s law for static electric fields and says that a lone charge like this electron will produce an electric field Maxwell&#x27;s second equation is gauss&#x27;s law for static magnetic fields and says that you can&#x27;t have a lone magnetic pole or monopole a North Pole must come with a South Pole and form a closed loop Maxwell&#x27;s third equation is Faraday&#x27;s law of electromagnetic induction which says that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field finally Maxwell&#x27;s fourth equation is an extension of ampere&#x27;s law which says that a changing electric field produces a magnetic field</p>
