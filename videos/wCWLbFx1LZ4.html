            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone I&#x27;m Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos on um mostly obscure and and uh esoteric topics uh things that I think are very important that people don&#x27;t know anything about uh that I&#x27;ve discovered over my many years of doing uh research and we are right now uh I think this is the 34th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory developed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 and his work was carried forward by Dr Bruce perrett and others uh until peret died in 2020 uh hopefully the theory is not going to be um discarded and thrown by the wayside hopefully there are more people like me who are trying to understand the theory and develop it even further it is a very difficult Theory to understand mainly because there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that you have to unlearn about uh every subject it is a theory of everything it can be plugged into any type of any subject that you can think of uh and it is uh kind of a very much of an uh equalizer for non-scientists because non-scientists can handle it just as well as scientists can or better and I think that scientists aren&#x27;t going to be the last people uh to come over to the reciprocal system eventually but I do think that by the end of the 22nd by the 21st century uh by the beginning of the 22nd century uh the reciprocal system will be how we do everything and um the basics of the system are that uh no it took Larson about 20 years to get to this point uh he narrowed these things down into two postulates uh the first of which is that the um will try to uh read it verbatim here even though it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very short I should have it even memorized by now but um uh the first postulate is uh that the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time Okay so uh you know the ancient Greeks thought the universe was made out of matter atoms uh Einstein came along 25 centuries later said the universe is not made out of matter it looks like it but it&#x27;s made out of energy energy equals uh matter times the speed of light squared underlying all this matter is a bunch of energy um Larson came along just 25 years later and or so and said uh well if equals m c squared that means that neither matter nor energy can be the most fundamental thing uh the most fundamental thing underlies both of them and that is motion uh now other people have come up with that before such as Hobbes and Descartes and uh but they never made it work because they didn&#x27;t Define motion uh redefine motion for Larson motion is the relationship between space and time any type of relationship between space and time so for example you have speed speed is one kind of motion and speed is space divided by time the car is moving 10 miles an hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time now if you reverse that and you go time over space then you say it took me three hours to move that pile 20 feet so that is three hours of time per 20 feet of space um and that is energy energy is time over space turns out that all uh fundamental uh units in science can be described uh entirely by a relationship between time and space so motion is not only I mean space and time are not only the containers of the universe they are actually the contents of the universe we&#x27;re not in space we are space we&#x27;re not in time we are time but really it&#x27;s space and time space and time have to be together as a relationship in Motion in a fraction and then also these units are in discrete units there&#x27;s a smallest unit of space and a smallest unit of time the smallest unit of space is actually fairly large uh 4.56 times 10 to the minus 8 centimeters I mean it&#x27;s microscopic but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s huge compared to you know um you know the wavelength of uh uh you know gamma rays or something and um the uh unit of time is incredibly small uh meaning that there are over 6.5 trillion 6.5 quadrillion uh units of time in one second so 6.5 quadrillion uh units of time per second um okay and uh they all they both have three dimensions um really they are identical to each other space and time they both have the same quality so we recognize that space has three dimensions or more um but time also has those three dimensions or more um and uh we recognize that time is progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and so we also recognize that space is progressing it&#x27;s always getting things are always getting further and further apart and uh according to Larson we see that in the um the recession of the distant galaxies the distant galaxies are are moving apart and the further apart they are the faster they are moving of course you need to believe in uh galaxies and space and you know all that stuff before you believe in any of that so but um uh now he&#x27;s got the second fundamental postulate the physical Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute its geometry is euclidean that&#x27;s basically unneeded because it is basically just saying that I mean you pretty much have to commit to that just to be a scientist just to engage in scientific uh you know discourse that math works you know and that uh if you measure something it&#x27;s absolute it means that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on um I think Larson says that you know as a um you know you have to agree to the second postulate just in order to even to be a scientist now uh Bruce perrett has gone over this postulate and has uh changed a few aspects of it especially the geometry the euclidean geometry you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s your you know your XYZ coordinates um uh Larson parat changes that over to projective geometry of which euclidean geometry is a subset so you create euclidean geometry is a special case of projective geometry and paret finds that it&#x27;s limiting um and it&#x27;s only applicable to a certain circumstances and that the projective geometry is more all-inclusive okay uh now he starts with those two postulates and he derives an entire universe out of that um step-by-step deduction um and he uh wrote books on physics and astrophysics and chemistry and astronomy and so on um now we&#x27;re looking at his final book that is on metaphysics and this came out after he died and this is an attempt to extend his theory into the social sciences um more or less and um he ended up having to derive four new postulates um that we covered a few videos ago um and so that is kind of the basis for his uh going into um going into the ethical the religious philosophical the Biola biological even um and the psychological um and so he we&#x27;re sitting here in chapter seven uh and the chapters five six and seven are called you know the first level the second level the third level the first level okay again we&#x27;ve got these this boundary line for Einstein this boundary line is the is the maximum the speed of light nothing can go faster than the speed of light for Larson with his Universe of motion where everything is motion um then uh motion is actually the midpoint or the neutral point of the universe and there&#x27;s half of the universe that moves slower than the speed of light that we&#x27;re accustomed to because the material sector and then half of the universe that moves faster than the speed of light and that is the cosmic sector he calls that sector two and so we have uh out of those two sectors and then the boundary between them which I think is a sector three although he doesn&#x27;t say that explicitly um he&#x27;s he&#x27;s he doesn&#x27;t really give a source for the sector three um so you&#x27;ve got these three sectors and you also have three levels and the levels are what we actually observe the the sectors are what what are actually there um the levels are what we actually observe so he says you know summarizing the conclusions of chapters five six and seven as follows there are three separate levels of existence accessible to our observation one inanimate matter and phenomena sector one two biological organisms so that is sector two combined with sector one controlling sector one and the analogy he uses is like a thermostat in a room the thermostat is a is just a minor aspect of that room but it controls the whole environment of the room and in the same way the sector 2 uh or sector 2 entity is a minor becomes a minor aspect of this overall sector one material unit but it controls that unit and then um so that&#x27;s a biological organism and then three is the ethical man where the sector 3 unit takes control of the overall life unit and uh takes control of that and you know starts making decisions for the overall life unit inanimate matter and Associated phenomena are purely physical this is sector one inanimate matter in Associated phenomena are purely physical and are constituents of the material sector of the universe okay now sector two biological organisms are material structures under the control of Life units originating in the cosmic or the inverse sector of the universe sector two under the control of Life units originating material structure structures under the control of Life units okay then sector three ethical man is a biological organism sector two in which an overriding control by a unit from the sector of the universe outside space and time sector three is superimposed on the control exercise by the life units so the sector 3 control is superimposed on the sector 2 control in other words they&#x27;re somewhat competing against each other each sector of the universe is governed by its own set of natural laws and each of the three levels of observable existence is subject to the laws and principles of the sector in control so each one of the sectors has different laws and um they are subject to those laws um to whichever law that they are sub that they are operating under by reason of the operation of these laws level one material existence is directed toward aggregation basically you know getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger level two up until the biggest which is DNA okay so level two level one is directed toward getting bigger and bigger and bigger until it&#x27;s so until it&#x27;s at its most complex which is DNA level two biological existence is directed not toward aggregation but toward survival of the individual and his species okay and so theoretically if this is analogous the survival becomes the the uh ability to survive becomes more and more and more and more complex until it gets to a maximum level and he doesn&#x27;t say this right here but that level is intelligence so once it gets to in a level of intelligence um that that would be the analogous to the DNA um where once you get to a level of DNA then a level two um or sector two aspect can then take control and in the same way when you&#x27;re a biological existence a level two existence once you get to a certain level of intelligence then the ethical the sector 3 unit can take control so let me just read this one again by reason of the operation of these laws level one material existence is directed toward aggregation level two biological existence is directed towards survival of the individual and his species and level three the ethical human existence is directed toward ethical conduct the change from level one no control mechanism to level two sector two control is immediate and complete the change from level two to level three under sector three control takes place gradually and irregularly and human existence normally involves a com a conflict between the two controls now anybody who&#x27;s watched any of my videos on Tree of Life um or understands Tree of Life recognizes that this is like a sixth sphere type thing the sixth sphere is our our Free Will um faculty our ability to make decisions and um we can decide to uh basically there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a competition there uh where you decide um if you&#x27;re going to act in furtherance of your um material structure or your animal being your instinct or are you going to act as a spiritual being in furtherance of the higher self um so the that that question is posed and answered there at the sixth sphere it&#x27;s a balance and that is exactly what Larson is talking about here so the sector 3 control um is really taking place at the sixth sphere uh you can go back and watch my videos on uh on all that you might want to watch my video called Tree of Life an introduction all right so just 10 minutes long okay uh the existence of a sector 3 control over an intelligent biological organism confirms the validity of the postulate that the sector 3 existences are intelligent because in order to control if if if the uh you know the most complex biological organism uh the uh is is determined by what&#x27;s determined by intelligence the emergence of intelligence um then obviously the sector three unit that controls that eventually controls that unit also must be intelligent so intelligent metaphysically controlled beings resembling human individuals exist on numerous planets distributed throughout the Universe um so uh I think he actually even says that if a uh being from another planet is to come here um by basically by definition or axiomatically they must also be if they are so Advanced that they&#x27;re able to come here that they have to be also ethically oriented so that any any being who comes from a different planet um is uh according to Larson already ethically developed so they&#x27;re not going to be over here doing any shenanigans um so you know take that for what it&#x27;s worth uh that may be appointing to the fact that maybe the P the people that are um plaguing us right now um you know maybe they&#x27;re from the underground or perhaps uh his uh estimation of space travel is is an overestimation maybe space travel isn&#x27;t such a complicated thing and that it&#x27;s not so far away and maybe it it just is kind of uh on the same level as driving to your local uh grocery store or something like that and you really don&#x27;t need a great deal of uh ethical development or it could be that the whoever developed the technology um was then taken and taken out and the people that didn&#x27;t develop the technology took it over so who knows okay we&#x27;ll start chapter eight next time</p>
