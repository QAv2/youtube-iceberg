            <p>This motor runs on self-generated energy through magnetic induction Find out how the &quot;Liberty Engine 2.0&quot; is made What you are going to see is the short version of our process of making and testing the &quot;Liberty Engine 2.0&quot;. A self-generated energy system by electromagnetic propulsion Microwave Transformer We will only use this coil We repeat the process with three other identical microwave transformers We are going to manufacture the rotor with a special alloy mainly of aluminum and silver Neodymium Magnets N52 We glue the magnets with Epoxy adhesive We fill with Epoxy resin We let it dry for 24 hours... We repeat with the other three slots We have sealed the four slots Now we are going to create the frame We will make two pieces like this We must center the rotor between the four coils We have added a millimeter of thickness to be able to center the piece Perfectly centered First functional test If you want to see the UNEDITED version of the test, say so in the comments and we will publish it We are going to leave the different parts of the motor open to see inside during the test We connect these two coils in parallel We will also connect the motor in parallel to the coils We don&#x27;t want the cables to get caught in the moving parts Later we will protect the rotor part with methacrylate You can see that there are no hidden batteries because there is no voltage We are going to start the engine with a cable, as in our previous prototype After the test too we will improve this boot system  IT WORKS! We will install some rubber feet to avoid vibrations This is the result of 7 months of research on the &quot;Liberty Engine 1&quot; We have increased power, reduced noise, and made the whole more stable Some of the improvements have arisen from your comments. .. Thanks to everyone who has contributed their knowledge during these months .</p>
<p>For now we are going to connect a light bulb to check that the motor feeds correctly At the end of the video, when the motor is finished, they have a much more extensive test Disconnecting the cable turns off the motor... We are going to disassemble it so that you can see that there are no hidden batteries . Subscribe and hit Like if you want us to publish the extended version of this video Now we are going with the last details of the assembly These LEDs work with a 220v driver There are no hidden batteries inside the socket outlets either. Motor speed: 1400 RPM Output voltage: 230v AC Maximum Power: 20000w Rotor with Neodymium magnets Manual pull start By pulling the starter we rotate the rotor with neodymium magnets. This causes the coils of the 230 volt microwave transformers to begin to generate voltage ...voltage that is injected into the sockets, and into the motor, which makes the magnet rotor continue to rotate at a constant speed of 1400 RPM ...which makes it continue to produce constant electrical current and in a highly efficient way By manufacturing the rotor with a special alloy of silver and aluminum we are able to reduce to zero the Eddy currents...</p>
<p>It is much more efficient than the &quot;Liberty Engine 1.0&quot; because we have reduced friction by eliminating the transmission through pulleys and belt Our engine is finished and ready to start testing BASIC performance test First outdoor test We are in medium of nature. No power nearby Only the &quot;Liberty Engine 2.0&quot; iMac 27&quot; - Grinder - Drill - Water pump</p>
