            <p>hello and welcome to the presentation on the reciprocal system of theory by Dewey B Larson a universe of motion now we will be checking out the concept of quantization I am Gopi Krishna and I will be guiding you through this presentation please begin quantization let us have a look at the origin in its postulates from postulate number one we have the phrase in discrete units now why did we introduce the concept of discreteness and what exactly do we mean when we say discrete or quantized why or why throughout the development of science quantization is seen in various levels light charge atomic mass Galactic redshifts Atomic Spectra pain the melting and boiling points the planks constant the superconducting temperature and the Curie temperature the plasma transition temperatures all of these indicate certain boundaries or limits or in other words discretized nature of the physical quantities and another interesting fact is quantities which were originally believed to be continuous were later found to be discrete one of the very famous example is light which was thought to be continuous and was later called the particle photon similarly electric current is discretized as electron and matter is discretized as atom and another pointless in the ream of the very large and the very small our assumptions fail for example the general theory of relativity is not compatible with quantum mechanics general theory of relativity is relevant only when we have quantities of very large magnitude for example when we are dealing with Heavenly Bodies whereas quantum mechanics deals with atoms and molecules this suggests the idea that there could be natural boundaries in the physical universe and hence all physical quantities are postulated to exist only in discrete units the meaning of it all what it means to say that motion is quantized it means that one unit of space or one unit of time is the smallest quantity taking part in a physical action or it is the smallest quantity possible when dealing with the motion in a universe of motion and what it means is motion can vary continuously but changes only at the end of a unit more important is what it does not mean less than one unit of space or time cannot be identified as a wrong idea less than one unit of space or time definitely exists in the universe of motion motion occurs in a series of jumps is another wrong idea motion occurs continuously let us have a look at the example in the form of a chain we can see that the links in the chain form units of motion and motion can change only at the end of a link more importantly it is clear that less than one link can easily be identified in the same way as less than one unit of space or time can be identified however the smallest quantity taking part in a physical action is one unit so motion exists in units but can vary continuously since space and timer aspects of motion they are also quantized the minimum motion possible is hence United one unit of motion is equal to one unit of space divided by one unit of time this brings us to the reference system used in the reciprocal system so first let us examine the idea of a natural datum of measurement before we can speak about reference systems what is the natural datum we are accustomed to a certain natural datum the zero point this signifies the spatial extent of 0 while leaving the time indefinite hence distance is measured from the origin a zero point in other words and time is measured from any convenient instant this is our natural datum our reference for measuring any quantity so the old natural datum is the zero point of spatial coordinates where this is represented by the origin but remember in the reciprocal system another reference system is also the zero point of temporal coordinates why not this so in this case clock space is indefinite while coordinate time is zero and clearly the two systems are mutually exclusive so let us take a new natural datum because we have these two choices either we have zero space per indefinite time or indefinite space per zero time as the two possible natural datum but we can take up something much more natural that is unit space per unit time in other words our origin is a speed and its value is unity all motion is measured with respect to Unity as being away from Unity the natural reference system the reciprocal system of theory uses an absolute reference system called the natural reference system it is the natural datum of the universe of motion it is a uniform progression it has a unit speed value it is the same in all three dimensions in other words we have a reference system based on unit speed and it is a uniform progression what do we mean by that means that one unit follows another it is a continuous motion which exists in units hence we have like the links in a chain a series of units the motion of the chain is a continuous motion however the chain can bend only at its edges or at the links this is the meaning of motion existing in units while the still being continuous so to summarize let us have a look at the take home ideas space and time are quantized the minimum number of units of space are the units of time in motion is 1. hence the natural datum of motion is unit speed one unit of space by one unit of time and one unit of motion follows another unit continuously and the change of motion occurs only at the end of a unit these are the implications of the quantization of motion thank you and coming up next is the idea of reciprocity between space and time</p>
