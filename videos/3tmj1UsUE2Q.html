            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>okay I have been meaning to make a video on electrogravidics for a long time now but I have been delayed by extramural Pursuits um so right so I&#x27;m assuming people who are going to watch this video are familiar with Thomas Townsend Brown and Thomas vallone and Paul aviola so I&#x27;m not really adding anything new here but what I am what I have found kind of strange is that these people who are attempting to to replicate these findings don&#x27;t seem to have the research funds to actually apply the proper dielectrics and there&#x27;s a guy in Argentina that I&#x27;m friends with on Facebook and I communicate it with and he he realized that you have to use these high K dielectrics and this is something that Thomas vallone is well aware of but for some reason a lot of these replications the only person I know right now that&#x27;s trying to replicate any kind of lecture phenomena under the name quantized inertia to kind of give it some mainstream credibility as a guy named Mike McCulloch at Plymouth University the problem is that he&#x27;s using symmetric plates and that&#x27;s because you have to use asymmetric plates because that&#x27;s the whole principle behind it so there&#x27;s a Japanese researcher whose Name Escapes me who&#x27;s got a whole lot of work published on this he developed an equation to actually predict the amount of force developed by one of these so I&#x27;m in the process of buying some variant strontium titanate sputtering targets there&#x27;s either these are basically little um our little plates and I got a 50 kilovolt DC power supply coming uh so if it all goes well I should be able to get some thrust um this guy in Argentina got some thrust with a pretty crappy dielectric aluminum oxide uh according to the equation if you use calcium copper calcium copper titanatory I I don&#x27;t remember yeah I think it&#x27;s calcium copper Titanic that can get up to 300 000 uh dielectric relative to air so at that point your your uh you&#x27;re levitating uh and the problem is that if this com this comes out uh it&#x27;s likely to be uh the government will likely um sees the facility right and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m perfectly willing to accept that risk right um the Garment will likely seize the facility and and seize all of the uh and keep it secret because it&#x27;s simply far too disruptive to society if if we have uh I mean the proportion system we have is from the Stone Age where we&#x27;re we&#x27;re gushing stuff behind us right we&#x27;re paddling it&#x27;s right you just you just cancel your own gravitational acceleration by reducing the mass basically which is because gravity is electric gravity is electromagnetic and it can be shielded so um I have a theory of gravity which is basically that you have a decent a 50 distribution of positive and negative but there&#x27;s always a slight surplus of either positive or negative so there&#x27;s this mutual attraction uh and matter mutually attracted and it&#x27;s the inverse Square not the inverse Cube so it follows Coulomb&#x27;s law it&#x27;s the inverse score the electric Fields inverse square of distance exactly with gravity is so gravity is electric and they&#x27;ve been using special relativity them using Einstein and all the all that  all that garbage space-time bending to keep electrophobic suppressed we know the Germans have this technology but it was kept kept black uh but it&#x27;s coming out right with the internet you have people like Thomas Malone your people like Paul aviola who are doing amazing work and they are exposing this conspiracy uh paulia laviolet has been told uh he&#x27;s some of his patents have been have been have been scraped or not his fans but he said that the pan examiners will actually the government will ask patents basically to the request patents go go black um so you know we see the uip uh report coming out very recently so so things are getting uh things are getting very exciting um you know I I think uh there are very very few researchers in this field and obviously my goal is to be is to be you know one of them um but this guy in Argentina is definitely a person that I will cite his inspiration had I not seen his work had I not seen the formula that this Japanese guy developed uh it certainly would have not been possible uh what I have is I have the money a little bit of money at least I&#x27;m going to buy these very strong name titanate sputtering targets at very strong strontium uh and uh and we&#x27;re going to give give it a little voltage so uh you know again we&#x27;ll try to get pretty much close to that breakdown of the material which is extraordinarily High and and off we go we&#x27;ll be able to levitate one of these things so the goal is to be able to initially build one that can levitate uh and then once it levitates of course but again I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen I don&#x27;t think the public will see it because when when I upload this to YouTube uh you know again it&#x27;s going to be highly disruptive uh because again no one&#x27;s done this people have people keep wasting their time with these silly little uh you know um bifeld Brown lifters which are which are mainly ionic wind okay the Israelis tried putting those things in a vacuum and and it and they didn&#x27;t generate any thrust on the other hand everybody knows okay then in the black black uh black projects they have high K dielectric bearing shot and titanate or even calcium calcium copper titanate and they&#x27;re applying very very high voltages and they&#x27;re getting enough Mass because we know the B2 simply doesn&#x27;t have the Thruster weight ratio is all screwy okay there&#x27;s something going on with that aircraft um you know everybody and everybody who&#x27;s smart knows that right Paul leviolet isn&#x27;t exactly some you know you know some plumber right okay you know he&#x27;s he&#x27;s he&#x27;s he&#x27;s highly qualified uh and so so yeah basically this is where we&#x27;re at I was shocked to find nobody&#x27;s actually because my friend in Argentina he doesn&#x27;t even have bearings around Titanic he doesn&#x27;t have the money to to buy one uh and in fact the uh the um there was one guy I found who was trying to make it out of powder he didn&#x27;t have the money to buy an actual sputtering Target right and so it&#x27;s going to be pretty funny to see what happens see what the military does uh you know obviously people have been killed doing this uh because and I don&#x27;t actually have homeless people I suspect people have been killed and if you look at for example what happened about Thomas Johnson Brown he just disappeared right what happened to him it completely went black um you know my theory Area 51 is is being used as a the physical presence of alien I think is being used as a cover for electrics I mean this is my theory it&#x27;s actually electric gravitics that they&#x27;re hiding there but they just know that it&#x27;s so disruptive to society in the state because the state power structure ceases to exist once we have levitating crafts right you could literally take off out of your backyard you can accelerate to extraordinarily high speeds and of course for Intergalactic uh travel these things you know are going to allow 10 20 maybe 50 speed of light travel and that&#x27;s just too disruptive it allows people to make weapons it allows people to fight new kinds of Wars it it the power structures We Know It uh the United States won&#x27;t be able to be on top because what it means is the Chinese will get it the Russians will get it other powers will get it it just disrupts everything they will kill to keep this secret so you have to be very careful so certainly you know if they do come to your house and say hey stop doing this you know comply because we don&#x27;t want to get killed but at the same time it&#x27;s going to come out right it&#x27;s just a matter of time the Stone Age propulsion is coming to an end a new age is coming and that&#x27;s Electric gravitics so I had this idea so once we have a an electro Graphics system which we do it already exists right it&#x27;s just a civilians can&#x27;t access it because it&#x27;s being suppressed by the government right um so it&#x27;s not like you know people have this idea like oh I&#x27;ve discovered something no no we haven&#x27;t discovered anything I&#x27;m just lucky enough to have some resources to be able to try to test this and I&#x27;m 100 certain it&#x27;s going to work because I know the government&#x27;s using it the question now becomes well what&#x27;s the ideal way to get electricity to power this thing because at the end of the day you&#x27;re still can&#x27;t can&#x27;t violate the first law you still need an energy source right unless you believe in free energy which I don&#x27;t right you&#x27;re you&#x27;re destroying group Mass with electricity because electricity gravity is electricity so it&#x27;s the reciprocal the converse all right it&#x27;s like um you&#x27;d like to make electricity with the solar panel where you can use electricity to make light with a laser uh so what we&#x27;re doing here is what we&#x27;re we&#x27;re we need a fuel source and so the fuel source would be Boron hydrants uh b5h9 or pentaborate 9 this is investigated by the Air Force back in the 60s back in the late 50s or the zip fuel program Boron hydrates have a higher heat of combustion than uh conventional hydrocarbons uh in the order of 50 next to 50 percent so the lower heating combustion of a b5h9 pine boring is 67.767 magazine per kilogram and uh jp4 is the mil-spec jp4 is like 43 just a bit under 43 like 42 points something so you&#x27;re looking at about a 60 increase in energy density and then you can use something like an adiabatic diesel engine or you can use a gas turbine to burn that fuel produce a heat uh generate electricity uh and and power a high voltage power supply it&#x27;s gonna be something like a 50 kilovolt a DC power supply you have all sorts of advances in microelectronics which make this even lighter than than was the case back you know in the 50s you have a silicon carbide fire silicon carbide uh rectifiers or um you can or you could just have a a commutator on your on your on your motor on your generator uh because I I no one&#x27;s ever told me whether DC or AC is ideal I think it&#x27;s DC right you don&#x27;t want a waveform uh it looks like you want to use DC because that&#x27;s the best way to actually my theory is that you&#x27;re stripping you&#x27;re basically stripping uh uh uh atoms right of of some of their some of their charge and that&#x27;s producing a temporary reduction in Mass again that&#x27;s my theory some people view it as as uh some kind of acceleration uh of electricity but uh but either way again I&#x27;m not a theoretician I&#x27;m more of a uh of of just a um experimentalist and so we will have to have to see but either way uh when this thing arrives and it hasn&#x27;t arrived yet um we&#x27;re just going to stack them up put a little electric at the top a little electric on the top big electric at the bottom take a scale we can take a uh on a digital scale so we don&#x27;t get any electromagnetic interference and voila you you should be able to get some thrust I mean again this guy in Argentina has already gotten thrust so it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re waiting for some new result but certainly um certainly this is uh this is going to happen</p>
