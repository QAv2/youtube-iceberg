            <p>hello my incisive friends and welcome back to alien protocols this is the classic electrogravidic anomaly frankly that t Townsend Brown discovered when you put a tremendous amount of positive energy on one side and a tremendous amount of negative energy on the other side in a sort of ultra capacitor a super capacitor hmm the positive creates a gravity well with enough energy energy equals mass and when you use negative polarity surprisingly it operates as negative Mass creating a wave behind and so you have your positive gravity up here and your negative gravity down here because the positive creates the negative graphic record the negative gravity creates the positive gravity a negative charge creates a positive gravity now this is Possible only if you can have a super capacitor really and what would the best shape be that would allow you to go any direction because the direction is from the positive I mean from the negative to the positive so the craft is going this way where these arrows are pointing so if you had a kind of gyroscopic thing in the center and you could rotate it how you wanted and put the positive and negative where you wanted you could create an electrogravidic craft and if you make the positive and you know cathodes different sizes very large and very small it creates a bonus effect and you could do it in a vacuum which could increase the effect and even utilize a catalyst liquid that makes the effect even stronger now this sphere this ability to go omnidirectional could be inside a larger craft so in a classic saucer you know the sauce is like all right it could be right in the center and what happens is when you pump that much energy into it it will take on an incandescence an incandescent light will glow it would have to Glow that&#x27;s why some of the most advanced UAP we see in the skies look like just energy balls plasma balls and that&#x27;s because of the reaction pretty neat huh guys so you could have all sorts of configurations with these you could have a triangle-shaped craft with three of these all right go omnidirectional very easily you could have a circular craft or a saucer craft let&#x27;s look at a saucer craft From Below okay and this saucer craft From Below could have several different electrographic engines and something kind of interesting happens as you move you give off extra energy you can re-harvest energy through this process as well what do you guys think much love</p>
