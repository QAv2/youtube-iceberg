            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>uh my name is Eugene batov uh I&#x27;m a doctor of Technology uh of Finland I&#x27;m also a doctor of technical science of Russia and I used to be a professor of chemistry at one of the universities in Moscow uh during last uh 12 years I was making my research work in a rather unusual field which is called experimental Gravity Research and I got some uh unusual results which might be extremely interesting for practical application and for the understanding of the mechanism of gravity which still uh can be considered as a white sport in modern physics 1992 is when you first started this experiment or prior to that so can you can you can you elaborate how you started this I was working at tpra University of Technology and in fact I was working with uh high temperature super conductors which are very interesting materials because they can capture the magnetic field of various configurations and they have uh pretty unusual properties at that time it was uh in the the center of the attention of all the scientists of the world and I was working with rather big samples uh with a diameter of maybe uh 6 to 8 in which was unusual even at that time and I noticed uh some uh anomalous behavior of those superconductors and I noticed that uh several objects or any objects uh which were placed over the superconducting disc under uh the uh interaction with u the magnetic fields of high frequency all those objects uh lost some part of their weight uh we checked and rechecked our experiments before we were brave enough uh to publish our first article and it appeared in 1992 uh in the magazine of physic SE and uh it was uh met with great interest by the scientific community and at that time uh we used the term gravity shielding uh because we thought it might be connected really to gravity shielding but later we um decided not to use that term because it was not right now we use the term uh gravity modification or to be exact it&#x27;s the modification of local gravity field and uh though to be honest we do not know exactly the mechanism of of gravity we&#x27;re only beginning to understand it still we are already able to use it in different aspects and for different purposes for scientific industrial and others uh and we think that uh this direction has a big future it says that uh it was It was kind of an accident you were spinning a disc smoke is is that true was it an accident or okay you can say it was uh practically by accident because we were making our research and we were making the measurements of the weight and we were using a cry and uh we were working late in the evening so one of my colleagues came to the laboratory and he was smoking his pipe and he blew uh the smoke over the crad and then a strange thing happened because course that smoke approached the cry start hit some uh invisible barrier and then went straight upward it was a bit unusual but that gave us a very good idea and later uh we used a barometer in order to uh check up um the air pressure over the cry start and it happened uh so that uh um the air pressure in the projection area of the disc was uh lower uh than in the surrounding atmosphere and the difference was up to several millimet of U uh water or even Mercury so uh this difference could be felt not uh only inside our laboratory but on the second floor above ours and we were able uh to show that we really deal with a well reproducible and very um effective phenomenon uh so the disk is made of uh e amarium copper Ceramics and it has two layers that is very important from uh the scientific point of view so when we put the dis on over the magnets and we cool it down to the temperature of liquid nitrogen or liquid helium because of the Meer effect dis is levitating over the magnets and it can be rotated and again with the magnetic field it can be rotated with big speed uh we use the rotation up to 5,000 rotations per minute but later we made a special installation which allowed us to use much higher speeds and uh every uh object that is put over the dis loses some part of its weight in the stationary mode uh the loss is not big it&#x27;s about uh uh uh 1% uh but uh when we rotate uh the disc and use uh resonance frequencies of the electromagnetic field we can increase uh the weight loss up to 2% and if we increase also the rotation speed we can uh reach the maximum values of 5% and at some Peak values up to 9% uh the only thing that keeps us from better result is the rotation speed because the disc is a ceramic one and uh even at uh 20,000 rotations per minute we have uh very big forces which tend to destroy it so we should keep it always in mind but as I used uh magnetic uh suspension system because of the mner effect it&#x27;s possible to rotate it up to uh rather high speeds the maximum that we used was about 30,000 uh and uh then we had to uh make some special protection made of uh plastic materials uh so that we could strengthen uh the structure of the disc in that case we get really good values and uh also uh we have some Secrets uh they are connected with the resonance frequencies of the magnetic fields uh and special configuration of the solenoids but in general uh it&#x27;s a rather simple experiment and it can be reproduced uh in a normal laboratory at any University now the super conducting material if it&#x27;s a secret that&#x27;s fine uh but if you&#x27;re allowed to elaborate on Basics the material no it is not secret uh we have uh two layers one layer is uh normal superconductor or E barium corpor with a formula one to three it&#x27;s uh well known in the world and the second layer is practically the same material but it is not super conducting it is normal conductor so uh by special heat treatment we can arrange both layers in such a way that one layer is super conducting and another is normal conducting layer when we rotate uh uh the whole disc in the magnetic field normal conducting layer produces a lot of uh electrons and they move uh to the super conducting area and they become uh not electrons but Cooper Pairs and uh they form what we call in physics boser Einstein condensate which has uh unusual properties uh and uh one of the main properties is that it is it has the property of super fluidity super conductivity definitely and it can also interact with subatomic particles that exist around all the objects and uh practically form the whole universe uh and by using this interaction of U our superconducting material with u subatomic particles we get very unusual reaction and we can to some extent change or modify local gravity field if we go to a bit deeper physics uh we can say that we have the ability to polarize space around this rotating disc and using this uh polarized um space or polarized physical vacuum we can definitely manipulate gravity I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m an expert on gravity I never was and I&#x27;m afraid I never will be be uh but I want to understand gravity and to make uh experimental research in this area because uh there are a lot of theoretical works and I&#x27;m thankful to those theoreticians who uh also studied our experiments and helped us a lot but the experimental part Still Remains uh from my point of view the key point to overcoming gravity and using it for our uh future for our purposes uh for all our needs if we speak about the magnetic field yes it goes like donuts but uh if we speak about uh the production of gravitons if they ever exist because these are still hypothetical particles we have the emission of uh gravitons which go follows the projection of the this disc and it goes to space in One Direction and we can uh change the direction of uh the flow of gravitons or if we are not sure that these particles are gravitons we can speak about um uh gravity waves which propagate in space and again influence all the objects that are in the projection area of the dis now in the disc is is is the weight loss in the center or is it r no no uh we use this configuration because we also have a current which circulates uh around the dis and it increases the effect and the increase of the effect uh is because of the fact that we should um uh create the maximum density of electrons or coer pairs inside the superconducting materials that is the key to success that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re rotating it with great speed that&#x27;s why we use high frequency and uh the result of uh this density is when a certain critical density of electrons is reached we have that interaction uh of um BOS Einstein condensate with the subatomic particles if we speak about subatomic particles what I mean uh well uh this is um a bit well it&#x27;s not an unusual question in physics usually we deal with vacuum and vacuum normal vacuum is considered to be empty entirely empty still all the Transmissions of electromagnetic waves which go to space to space uh shuttles to the Moon uh they propagate in space and they propagate like waves and wave is only a distortion of the media and if vacuum is entire entire emptiness there is nothing to disturb nothing to distort and then the waves cannot propagate inside it also if we refer to Einstein&#x27;s theory he says that gravity is the bending of SpaceTime Continuum it&#x27;s right maybe but if we want to bend something and it is entirely empty then it is impossible so we have to admit that there are particles which constitute physical vacuum these uh particles are several magnitudes of order smaller than the electron but they constitute that physical vacuum which has a lot of energy inside and can uh to some extent uh interact with uh normal solid bodies</p>
