            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>There&#x27;s a whole fleet of them. My gosh. &gt;&gt; Whistleblowers, government employees. They&#x27;re inside their government office. They see something they shouldn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Look at that thing. It&#x27;s rotating. &gt;&gt; More than 120 incidents over the past two decades are not from the US military or other advanced US government technology. &gt;&gt; There are UFOs. There are non-human intelligence.</p>
<p>We have crash retrieval programs. Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? &gt;&gt; Biologics came with some of these recoveries. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If the story breaks, it&#x27;s the biggest story in the world. And there&#x27;s a lot of knock on things.</p>
<p>Government FOYA, what&#x27;s true, what&#x27;s not true, we&#x27;re following it down just like we&#x27;d follow any other story. And if it is the biggest story in the history of humanity, we want to get into to a piece of it. In podcasting, there&#x27;s a long-held tradition to talk about aliens, UFOs, and abductions. So, we&#x27;re going to do our version of a UAP UFO, Are there aliens out there? podcast this week on Shane Smith has questions. We hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s hear you in the comments. Bango. Seriously, &gt;&gt; yeah, it&#x27;s cool. &gt;&gt; All right, here we go. Jeremy Corbel, investigative filmmaker, UFO, UAP researcher.</p>
<p>I want to get into the difference of when that switched. Uh, known for your documentaries on Netflix, including, I just watched it, Bob Lazar, Area 51. &gt;&gt; Exactly. What&#x27;s going on up there? What&#x27;s Going On up there could be the most important event in history. But you do a lot of viral releases of uh military UFO footage, often through collaborations with George Knapp, and you do a podcast called Weaponized.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All of that is fact. &gt;&gt; There you go. Okay. Good. Welcome.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So far so good. We&#x27;re &gt;&gt; welcome. Welcome. Welcome. So, I have a lot of stuff I want to do.</p>
<p>So, but I want to start maybe we could just jump in with you just released some footage today. &gt;&gt; Yes. This is an example of one of the UFOs that our military and intelligence community is looking at where this orb or this metallic looking ball runs alongside a spy plane. Okay. So footage.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. You used a word viral. That&#x27;s cool. It gets out there for sure to the world and that&#x27;s the point is to get it seen from tabloid to mainstream media democratically instantaneously.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the goal. Military filmed footage of what they designated UAP or UFO. So we vet it, verify it, find all the sources. George Knap you mentioned is the godfather. Sorry.</p>
<p>This is important because if it&#x27;s just somebody&#x27;s thing, you could we made it up. It&#x27;s this. It&#x27;s a This is vetted military footage. Their footage. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That Okay. So, that distinction. So nowadays, out of the hundreds of thousands of videos that are recorded of what people think are UFOs, &gt;&gt; you can&#x27;t tell anymore, right? anything can be made better than reality. But when you have chain of custody, you have cases that are passed around intelligence agencies that are guarded that don&#x27;t want the American public to see, you know, that and they&#x27;re usually filmed on military platforms. Those sensor systems are better.</p>
<p>We have a sensor bias when it comes to UFO footage because great sensors pick up thermal heat signatures, all that stuff. So the whole point of this is that when you get something, if you can vet and verify its kind of chain of custody, it its authenticity. I&#x27;m not calling these UFOs. Your government has labeled them UAP, which is just means UFO basically. &gt;&gt; And sorry, I&#x27;m going to keep interrupting.</p>
<p>No, that&#x27;s fine. What&#x27;s the difference? Why did we switch from UFO to UAP? &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, originally UFO was created to try to make a laugh factory out of the idea of unidentified flying objects. &gt;&gt; In their infinite wisdom, truly in their infinite wisdom, people that really wanted to better describe what was being observed, they called them UAP, unidentified anomalous phenomena, because they&#x27;re not just flying. They go from space to air to sea with zero inertia.</p>
<p>So, you can pop into the water without a splash. How is that possible? So they call it all domain, right? So it goes from space to air to sea. If if it&#x27;s there, it&#x27;s unknown. It&#x27;s anomalous UAP. They did that to destigmatize reporting.</p>
<p>Cuz if you&#x27;re on a ship and you see something that you can&#x27;t explain, what are you supposed to write what it is? They used to say, I&#x27;m not writing UFO. No, I&#x27;m definitely not writing. You writing UFO? Nope. Didn&#x27;t see it. Okay, cool.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. Because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s got a negative context, &gt;&gt; right? Now they&#x27;re kind of normalizing reporting within the military and the world by saying look we don&#x27;t know what it is it&#x27;s anomalous it&#x27;s unidentified or whatever but um unidentified anomalous phenomena and then when you write that after &gt;&gt; more credible &gt;&gt; now I don&#x27;t want to go to get off track Mosul &gt;&gt; okay mo orb &gt;&gt; so Mosul orb this is a big deal &gt;&gt; so tell me why &gt;&gt; okay yeah we can go one for one I can rapid fire so check it out here&#x27;s the brass tax there was a CIA plane and it was flying over a conflict zone, an active war zone. They were targeting a terrorist compound. As they were doing that, they got what&#x27;s called a passive capture of a UAP. It&#x27;s spherical.</p>
<p>It appeared spherical. So, our first episode of Weaponized Mine in George Knap&#x27;s podcast. At the end, we&#x27;re like, &quot;Okay, you want to see what the government terms a UFO or a UAP? Here you go.&quot; But I just released a still image because at the time I was figuring out the legality of obtaining and releasing as a journalist stuff that I&#x27;m not authorized to know its classification. I knew exactly where it went through. I verified it with a ton of people was part of a UAP product to teach people about UFOs.</p>
<p>So I knew that was a UFO and our government had labeled it such and I knew it was unresolved when I reported on it in 2023 with George, right? But the picture was from 2016 and the sensitivity of that compound, I don&#x27;t know. Oh, you get in trouble for the compound, not the thing. &gt;&gt; So, I released a still image as a way to provoke arrow all domain anomaly resolution office. Kind of like the modern day project blue book but worse. &gt;&gt; I am here to discuss the so-called flying saucers.</p>
<p>The Air Force interest in this problem has been due to our feeling of an obligation to identify and analyze to the best of our ability anything in the air that may have the possibility of threat or menace to the United States. &gt;&gt; I was like, &quot;Put out the footage. Show the American public.&quot; It got leaked to me. I obtained and released as a journalist. So, I put out a still image.</p>
<p>Never put out the video. And then all of a sudden I got this wicked smart friend and heing sued the government. He sued the air force. He sued central command. I don&#x27;t know a bunch of people he sued and they freedom of information act request and litigated for 2 years quietly.</p>
<p>First thing he gets he calls me up. He goes no way. I think I got something. No way. Jeremy can you tell me is this what I think it is? Boom.</p>
<p>He sends it on my phone. I go stop sending it. Don&#x27;t tell anybody. Shut up. We&#x27;re doing it next week.</p>
<p>Wow. because they would give a false sense of transparency by putting it out. What comes to light is that my reporting was correct. I wasn&#x27;t talking out of my ass. Absolutely.</p>
<p>There was 4 seconds like I said and if people said it was a raindrop, it was a pothole. They said all this cuz I just gave a still image. That&#x27;s why I started doing videos legally obtained. And this is a huge win for journalism and a huge win for freedom of information act requests and a huge win for the litigation process of journalists and any American trying to get from the government what they don&#x27;t want you to see which is that UAP &gt;&gt; are made not by us not by China not by Russia. I mean some are they&#x27;re misidentified you know we got a cool plane &gt;&gt; somebody&#x27;s making these machines that can outpace outmaneuver and outperform our greatest weapon systems.</p>
<p>Whose are they? Well, those are the bigger questions, but all I know is the Mosul Orb dropped the footage day legally obtained through litigation and it proved that I was reporting correctly that there is a what appears to be a spherical ball with no drop or descent. We don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s moving or if just the CIA plane was moving, but they think it&#x27;s UAP. Actually, two days ago, it&#x27;s unresolved UAP. So, we reported on it and this kid&#x27;s name is Dustin Slaughter. Everybody take a note.</p>
<p>That kid is wicked smart. &gt;&gt; There you go. and he got the foyer released. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Football season is upon us and this season we&#x27;ve teamed up with Bet MGM.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll be using Bet MGM lines to make all of our picks and we have special offers for our listeners every single week.

<p>So, it&#x27;s footage of something we don&#x27;t know what it is, but it&#x27;s nothing. It&#x27;s not like a drone. It&#x27;s not like &gt;&gt; Right. So we can eliminate certain things. Good whiskey, by the way.</p>
<p>What is this? &gt;&gt; Cheers. This is like nice. We met each other a long ass time ago in your office, man. So yeah, and I mean I have opinions and I&#x27;ll give you those, but what we&#x27;re seeing with every piece of footage that George Knapp and I obtain and release &gt;&gt; is what our government labels &gt;&gt; a UAP or UFO. Meaning it&#x27;s not our black project.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not a known adversarial black project, you know, adversarial nation. &gt;&gt; And it can demonstrate characteristics unlike what we have for flight and maintaining flight. Like a positive lift without like wing lits and engines. And in the thermal realm, it gets even weirder because you don&#x27;t see heat signatures. How is that possible? Everything is like rockets to roller skates.</p>
<p>You push something out the back to go forward. These UAP don&#x27;t have that same signature management as they say. So you&#x27;re like, what is it? How does it fly? Who pilots them? Some might be drones or autonomously controlled, but some of them, as reported to Congress under oath by David Grush, have had biologics inside of them. &gt;&gt; Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? &gt;&gt; Biologics came with some of these recoveries. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s get into that. Hold on. Before we do, we&#x27;re already into the deep stuff. Before we do, I wanted to go through uh &gt;&gt; there is no light conversation about YAP. It&#x27;s &gt;&gt; There you go.</p>
<p>Come on. I want to I want to get into some of the more famous, let&#x27;s say, video footage and you can explain to I&#x27;m going to get out of my chair if you can believe that. I&#x27;m coming over. Okay. &gt;&gt; So, we&#x27;re going to just go through.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, that&#x27;s the Mosul or &gt;&gt; Yeah. Which they said was a pothole when I released the image. All the debunker weirdos, you know. It&#x27;s not. &gt;&gt; This is your one, right? &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, not mine.</p>
<p>This is yours. took off. Go get it. &gt;&gt; Okay, so this is also a more of a spherical hole, we think, by angle of observation. And the cool thing about this, the Navy guys, they they say splash.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They didn&#x27;t mean it made a splash. It descended controlled descent. It was illuminated into the water. They sent a sub to try to look for it. It couldn&#x27;t find it.</p>
<p>There was 100 of these over 100 around 10 Navy warships in 100 mile radius. Every ship was getting comms. And I&#x27;ve talked to people on every single ship whose job it was to fight the ship and to this day they don&#x27;t know what it was. &gt;&gt; And so the narrative there are naval officers. &gt;&gt; Correct.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; So this is the flashing pyramid. I mean so it it&#x27;s triangle. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s triangle by angle of observation. Now some people say bouquet.</p>
<p>And I say okay because the thing is is they&#x27;re saying there was a lens problem. The problem with their theory is that this was um range found on the back of the ship. These were objects that no matter what shape they were, they shouldn&#x27;t have been there. So they were objects off the aft or the tail of the USS Russell in that. He used a night vision PBS14 to to you know film through.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t call these UAP. Your government did. &gt;&gt; I did not call them triangle by angle of observation pyramid in shape. Your government did. I actually interviewed the guy who had two optical physicists look at this and that&#x27;s what they said.</p>
<p>So, I reported the news and what people do with that, that&#x27;s up to them. &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. I get it. So, this is the the large disc UFO. &gt;&gt; This one blew me the away.</p>
<p>Right. &gt;&gt; So, again, every piece of footage I put out, you&#x27;re going to have alternate theories. And part of the reason I put it out is to get those theories. But our government labeled this, get this, this is my enhancement. I shouldn&#x27;t even wrote that.</p>
<p>All we did was change contrast, whatever. We&#x27;re not creating anything new. that is in my eyes circular by angle of observation. So it could be a globe, could be a disc. &gt;&gt; Your government labeled it UAP.</p>
<p>This is a Air Force asset with a passive capture in thermal. So it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s up there going and it captures this. They labeled it disc navigating through clouds. &gt;&gt; They didn&#x27;t label this our secret project. They didn&#x27;t label this a Chinese or Russian.</p>
<p>How does this thing propel if it&#x27;s indeed propelling right? How does it propel if it doesn&#x27;t have the traditional heat signatures &gt;&gt; now? I&#x27;m open to other interpretation. Maybe some genius going to figure out what this is. Tell our government because to this day this is unresolved to them. They&#x27;re like, &quot;This is a craft. It&#x27;s discshaped.</p>
<p>Who&#x27;s is it right &gt;&gt; now?&quot; I&#x27;m not a scientist, but I&#x27;ve just looked at a lot of this footage now. I got questions like anybody with a with a bone in their body curious about the nature of reality. Is there a part of our history and nature that we&#x27;re not allowed to know? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, this is that&#x27;s the bigger. We&#x27;re getting we&#x27;re starting small.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re getting there. We&#x27;re getting there. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m following your lead, by the way. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we got the &gt;&gt; You gave me the whiskey.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There you go. We got the &gt;&gt; You got my greatest hits up there. &gt;&gt; I remember seeing something. I didn&#x27;t las it to see the exact how many meters it was away, but it should be me observing it. I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s probably about 200 m.</p>
<p>I kind of seen something raise up an object kind of come off the floor from that distance. This is weird. What the hell is this? I grabbed my camera. I had a little black Pelican case. Popped it open and it started film.</p>
<p>I was looking through my camera screen and uh seen it raise up and keep continually raising. &gt;&gt; So, this is a big one, right? &gt;&gt; So, why this is important is because when you look at the shape &gt;&gt; like a sombrero, bro, like we don&#x27;t have anything that&#x27;s a camera. He&#x27;s on a gunner and he&#x27;s filming through the gunner optics night vision and the kid&#x27;s talking. He tells you exactly. I interview him and put it over the footage.</p>
<p>So he&#x27;s out in I think Iraq and he&#x27;s out there and this is 2008. The gimbal footage is some of the most famous UFO footage that&#x27;s out there by military. Look at that shape. &gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s kind of &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s crazy to me that Yeah. And he filmed it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Kid smart. He knew it was important the second he saw it because you could range fire. &gt;&gt; So, he&#x27;s filming it through his sights. &gt;&gt; Well, he&#x27;s got a phone and he&#x27;s holding it up to the camera&#x27;s optic system, which is in green night vision, infrared, similar to thermal, but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s more of like you can see in the dark better, see the clouds. &gt;&gt; And so, this one caused a lot of &gt;&gt; Dude, they all caused a lot of waves because everybody&#x27;s trying to solve a puzzle and puzzles are fascinating.</p>
<p>the question. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s What&#x27;s the biggest one? That&#x27;s We&#x27;re going to the tic tac. &gt;&gt; Well, this is Oh, this is the 2023. &gt;&gt; So, this one is from 2023. So, that got leaked to me and George Knapp and we produced it, put it out, and one of the people that was there, you can actually hear him on the footage, was like, &quot;Okay, if you guys really do have it, I&#x27;m going to tell you what happened that night.&quot; And that&#x27;s that guy, Alexander Wiggins.</p>
<p>And look, he&#x27;s an active Navy, one of the top dogs. Like, he has a family. I&#x27;m like, &quot;Are you sure you want to?&quot; He&#x27;s like, &quot;I want to. This is important because what I saw that night is so powerful and people need to know about it.&quot; &gt;&gt; But this is a a tic tac shaped by thermal. This gives us the idea of what Commander Fraver chased for the United States military, which was a tic-tac-shaped object that he was up close to.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; As we proceeded to the west, the air controller was counting down the range to an object that we were going to, and we were unaware of what we were going to see when we arrived. The controller had told us that these objects uh had been observed for over two weeks, coming down from over 80,000 ft, rapidly descending to 20,000 ft, hanging out for hours, and then going straight back up. For those who don&#x27;t realize, above 80,000 ft is space. &gt;&gt; He went in front of Congress and said, &quot;We don&#x27;t have that technology now. We won&#x27;t have that technology in 10 years.&quot; He goes, &quot;We&#x27;re not even trying to think of having that technology in 10 years.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I would know.&quot; And what people that don&#x27;t know is that he has a classified job right now, which would give him insight.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why he testified to Congress. He chased a tic tac UFO. &gt;&gt; As we pulled nose onto the object, within about a half mile of it, it rapidly accelerated in front of us and disappeared. Our wingmen roughly 8,000 ft above us lost contact. Also, we immediately turned back to see where the white water was at, and it was gone also.</p>
<p>So, as we started to turn back towards the east, the controller came up and said, &quot;Sir, you&#x27;re not going to believe this, but that thing is at your cap point, roughly 60 miles away in less than a minute. You can calculate the speed.&quot; We returned to Nimmits. We were taking off our gear. We were talking to one of my crews that was getting ready to launch. We mentioned it to them, and they went out and luckily got the video that you see, that 90-second video.</p>
<p>What you don&#x27;t see is the radar tape that was never released, and we don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s at, of the active jamming that the object put on an APG73 radar. Now, we talked to a guy who was in the Navy. Ryan Graves. &gt;&gt; Ryan Graves was the guy from the Red Rippers, I think. &gt;&gt; Here we go.</p>
<p>Ryan Graves, former lieutenant and fighter pilot uh in the US Navy. You&#x27;re the first active duty pilot to come forward publicly about uh sightings of unidentified aerial phenomenon or UAPs. this disturbing pattern of of of incursions that are similar nature over a multi-year period that seem to be growing in scale and and and concern. Frankly, I mean, after a while when you hear hundreds of reports from professionals, from elected politicians, from others that just say, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this. It kind of looked like a plane.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t, but the way it was moving, altitudes, the way they&#x27;re operating together, just not like anything I&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard to discount that information.&quot; So he&#x27;s a good dude. So basically he&#x27;s come out and said, &quot;Look, this is an aviation safety issue if nothing else. If nothing else, my boys are out there and every single day.&quot; So Ryan never saw one. He chased one.</p>
<p>He tried to go after. He couldn&#x27;t see it with his eyes, but they get them on radar. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re very solid and they were behaving almost like an aircraft, right? They were stationary in the air uh in high winds at various altitudes. They were sometimes a circular pattern, sometimes in what we call a racetrack pattern. One of these objects went right in between the two fighters that were about 150 ft apart.</p>
<p>Came within about 50 feet of the lead aircraft went down their right side. Pilot weapon system officer gained a visual sighting of it. They ended up canceling their flight returning home and that&#x27;s when I met him in the ready room and he just had this, you know, look of shock on his face. His his mouth was hanging open. He&#x27;s like, &quot;I almost hit one of those damn things.</p>
<p>What did it look like?&quot; Uh simple description. He said it looked like a dark gray or a black cube inside of a clear sphere. Wow. &gt;&gt; Oh, 5 to 15 feet in diameter. &gt;&gt; Every damn day.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re seeing cubes with spherical auras. &gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s not just perplexing cuz they&#x27;re on mission. It&#x27;s a safety of flight issue because one came right between two planes going. You get a collision going 500 miles an hour, you&#x27;re man. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a seagull, right? &gt;&gt; So Ryan Graves did testify to Congress that look, this is a safety of flight issue.</p>
<p>So if nothing else, if you don&#x27;t want to talk about UFOs, we got to talk about that. That&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s why I love what Ryan does is he&#x27;s bringing it to like brass tax. &gt;&gt; Well, he&#x27;s also, you know, like he&#x27;s an naval pilot, you know, and he&#x27;s out there. His wing saw it.</p>
<p>They also they reported it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; he tried to go after one one time. I asked him, he tried to go after, but he couldn&#x27;t optically see it just on the radar.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don&#x27;t see him visually. &gt;&gt; Hello, Bango. and welcome to our Bet MGM lightning round with Jeremy Corbel. All right, we&#x27;re here. The man, the machine, Jeremy Corbel.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s do a lightning round. What&#x27;s the overunder on the US government admitting that they actually have a UFO in storage by 20 26? &gt;&gt; Uh, they&#x27;ve already admitted that on my show, Weaponized, the head of the DIA UFO program already admitted that we had one UAP and we&#x27;ve breached the whole of it. So, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s 100% because it&#x27;s already done been admitted. Okay, let&#x27;s make it simple. If Earth is Vegas and UFO sightings are the games, how many points would you spot the skeptics versus the believers? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So, both can be equally out out of this world. You know, they you have a fervent belief. But um when you talk about debunkers compared to people that actually research it, I would say the debunkers have lost uh incredibly because the preposterous preponderance of evidence that has been collected and looked at even by our own government is so high. Um big-time losers, I won&#x27;t call them skeptics, but debunkers. &gt;&gt; If you had to make a bet on which country comes clean about UFOs, US, Russia, or China, where are you putting your chips? Yeah, actually we got really really close through the Five Eyes Alliance through Canada.</p>
<p>They actually wrote a document saying we need to get ahead of this or our population will no longer trust us. And so I&#x27;d go out of left field here and I&#x27;d say we might learn about this from one of the five eyes countries. And I would say that&#x27;s most likely going to be the most honest which is Canada. The US is going to come in and control America. &gt;&gt; I like it.</p>
<p>I like going off pie as they say. And it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s Canada for the win. The nice Canadians are going to let the cat out of the bag. Thanks for taking the time. Really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Bzango. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; Well, I used to say bango and then I got bored. So now I say, &gt;&gt; we got a lot of military footage now and we have a lot of military people. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re testifying and you know I one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you is it seems like for the last few years anyways there&#x27;s been sort of more of a fever pitch like something&#x27;s going to break like you know something&#x27;s coming you know in the community people oh my goodness something&#x27;s coming something&#x27;s coming &gt;&gt; and it seems like it&#x27;s gone from fringe &gt;&gt; and and I remember talking to a bunch of people and then there was going to be this Congress and you know congressional hearings and &gt;&gt; we had multiple &gt;&gt; and so you you talked about the All domain Anomaly Resolution Office or Arrow.</p>
<p>And so so this comes out and they say, &quot;Yeah, no, there&#x27;s nothing to see here.&quot; What? What? &gt;&gt; They didn&#x27;t quite say that. &gt;&gt; Well, what did they say? &gt;&gt; Okay, so as a journalist, it&#x27;s the paper trail. If you ask George Knapp, who&#x27;s been doing this 40 years, that&#x27;s why you know about Area 51, Bob Lazar, Flying Saucers, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s the paper trail. He was lied to &gt;&gt; and he knew he was lied to. And that pisses off anybody if you&#x27;re lied to.</p>
<p>The UFO thing you&#x27;ve been lied to about. I don&#x27;t know what it is ultimately, but I know you&#x27;ve been lied to. So similarly for me, my entry point, my gateway drug was that well, if Bob Lazar is telling the truth, &gt;&gt; Bob Lazar claims our government captured alien spaceships, UFOs, and keeps them in a secret warehouse. They are actively and have in their possession uh alien spacecraft and they are actively uh undergoing analysis then distance doesn&#x27;t matter anymore. If they have a different propulsion system, a million years ahead of us in in physics, let&#x27;s say, &gt;&gt; then if they&#x27;re out there, which everybody agrees with, right? It&#x27;s a universe is teeming with suns.</p>
<p>Just look up at the stars. Every star is a sun with orbiting planets, probably in the Goldilock zone. So, if there&#x27;s life out there, cuz we ain&#x27;t that special. Are they coming here? That&#x27;s where the conversation has now turned. And I think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re feeling is that we&#x27;re realizing we don&#x27;t know everything.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s possible there are things in physics and science and nature that we are discovering. Right? So the question is whose machines are these? Now when you kind of back up a little bit and you look at this and you say okay I don&#x27;t know everything it&#x27;s possible. Then you come into the just conflicted reality that UFOs are not in movies and magazines and popular thought and pop culture because we created that idea. They&#x27;re there because people are seeing them. They&#x27;ve been seeing them a long time.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s part of every single culture on every single planet, homogeneous around the world. I don&#x27;t know a single person who at least doesn&#x27;t know somebody who&#x27;s had some sort of unidentified sighting. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So, the elephant in the room is that our government didn&#x27;t say nothing to see her move on this time. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>Okay. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s what they say. What they admitted is that UFOs are real. That there are craft that do things that we can&#x27;t explain that we need. Like an alcoholic, you need to admit there&#x27;s a problem before you can start working on a solution.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They&#x27;ve admitted UFOs are real. Officially, our government has told you UFOs are real. That we we don&#x27;t know how or who we we have suspect how they might operate, but we don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s operating them. So, everybody&#x27;s done been told, but they didn&#x27;t hear it. That is official.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s where it stops. They don&#x27;t want you asking any more questions. And I know that because we have fought tooth and nail. &gt;&gt; But why? Why don&#x27;t they want us to? It doesn&#x27;t make sense. &gt;&gt; Now, we It does make perfect sense once you hear the answer.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Tell me why. &gt;&gt; Originally, back in the nuclear time, it was for strategic advantage. If you can get derivative exploitative technologies. So if you can exploit well almost there if you can exploit any technologies right &gt;&gt; for derivative technologies &gt;&gt; just like how Russia will take and backgineer one of our bombers and figure it out right &gt;&gt; then you have a strategic advantage. So I get it back in the day why they didn&#x27;t want us to know about this is because they thought and this is documented &gt;&gt; then a cold war.</p>
<p>Well, they thought first people would go crazy. Then that&#x27;s been debunked. That like the War of the Worlds thing, nobody went crazy for that. Nobody went wild. Then they&#x27;re like, hm, maybe it&#x27;ll upturn people&#x27;s religious ideas.</p>
<p>And they&#x27;ve realized, no, it won&#x27;t. Most religions are like inclusive of all of God&#x27;s creations. So then they thought, well, this is really important. If we can get derivative technologies through exploitation of these craft, then we would have a strategic advantage. And whoever gets there first, they win because it&#x27;s clear that these craft are operating off of a propulsion and energy system that is different than what we have as far as reactionary propulsion.</p>
<p>So that I understand I understand that back in the 40s &#x27;50s and60s that we needed to protect that information to exploit the actual craft and actual hardware and the propulsion systems that we have obtained which we have and you&#x27;ve been told by people in position to know very publicly even the number of craft in the US that they believe we have &gt;&gt; the nine that was &gt;&gt; well there&#x27;s several uh actually nine uh flying saucers, flying discs, uh that are out there of extraterrestrial origin. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s different. See, people don&#x27;t trust Bob. Except everything that he&#x27;s said is now becoming fact. That&#x27;sing weird.</p>
<p>He must be the luckiest liar I&#x27;ve ever met. &gt;&gt; What facts? For example, like you&#x27;re obviously, you know, kneede in the weeds, but for lay &gt;&gt; dude, I&#x27;m deep in the weeds or above. This is there. Babazar famous for he he worked at uh &gt;&gt; Babazar worked at Area 51, a subsite called S4, site 4. He claimed that there were nine flying discs and that he was working on one of them.</p>
<p>And he was actually able to enter it at one time to see what it was. And that&#x27;s when he dawned on him it was not ours cuz the seats were too small. &gt;&gt; Mhm. They were first one half the size. And also the propulsion system was &gt;&gt; right.</p>
<p>And so that&#x27;s a complex brier patch of a story, but all you got to know is you don&#x27;t got to trust Bob Lazar to know the truth about UFOs, although you should cuz he&#x27;s trustworthy and he told you the truth as it happened, but I&#x27;m the guy that made the movie on him and knows him as a friend. &gt;&gt; So you made a Yeah, you made a documentary on him. And then uh where the hell is Barry? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a great question. Where&#x27;s Barry? How did you jump from I want to know about UFOs to where&#x27;s Barry? cuz that&#x27;s a great question and and George Knapp and I think that we found Barry a couple times and wasn&#x27;t sure we did and now Barry be maybe dead we don&#x27;t know Dennis his boss when he Bob Lazar famously went on the news it was hilarious he called himself Dennis as a pseudonym was like a you to his boss cuz if you know Bob you know that&#x27;s how he rolls right damn I don&#x27;t know if he regrets that now because his life got turned upside down here&#x27;s a guy who never ever benefited from telling his story it only hurt him and I know his family so I know that to be true. So if he&#x27;s the luckiest liar I ever met or he&#x27;s absolutely told you how it happened, but that&#x27;s for you to decide, not me.</p>
<p>But if if you trust anything I have to say, I believe Bob with all of my heart and all of my mind. And so here we go. &gt;&gt; Big picture, let&#x27;s just step back one second here. &gt;&gt; What Bob Lazar told you &gt;&gt; is that the government had flying saucers. Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They were all weird shaped though that he worked on one that they couldn&#x27;t make progress that every day going to work was like working on a nuclear reactor from like some other country and you have no idea how works. It was scary to him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Turns out that in Congress under oath people were raising their hand and they were saying we have a reverse engineering program for UFOs. There are biologics inside some of those crash retrievals, but I&#x27;m not going to call them necessary crash crash retrievalss because some of them seem more like gifts.</p>
<p>Bob even said that one of them he believes was an from an archaeological dig. It doesn&#x27;t matter. You&#x27;ve been told now that we have these programs to exploit the technologies and there are biologics on the craft and Bob happened to say nine. It&#x27;s really funny because just recently um Hal Putoff who&#x27;s a man who&#x27;s been involved with all these programs he goes I if I told you everything they kill me I can&#x27;t is a very serious scientist that worked on all these black projects renowned in the scientific community he was at SRRI Stanford Research Institute studying Yuri Geller and psychic phenomenon anything weird you call Hal put off right so this is a guy that has impeccable credentials working for our intelligence agencies on this stuff and he straight said the number that he&#x27;s pretty sure the United States has, I think, is wrong. I think we have more.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But that&#x27;s where Bob, what he said &gt;&gt; just keeps hitting you in the face because what he said ends up being where we are now. &gt;&gt; There are nine UFOs that that office has helped with uh going out and retrieving and that two of them are actually intact uh craft. When the door was open and I went into the the main hanger, uh, I could see there were other hangers as as I walked by and they went they went pretty far down. I could clearly see two craft in there. &gt;&gt; And we all want to believe and actually not me.</p>
<p>A lot of people want to believe in UFOs, but UFOs are not a matter of belief. &gt;&gt; Well, here&#x27;s my problem with it is if so, we have UFOs and we reverse engineer the technology. So we&#x27;re like, okay, like how can we, you know, it&#x27;s cold war, okay, let&#x27;s follow that trajectory. So we say, we&#x27;ve got some technology. We want to reverse engineer it so we can have an advantage against the Soviet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the old school thought of secrecy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I&#x27;m like, okay, I get that and I understand that. But this would literally be the biggest story ever. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Ever. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So I don&#x27;t even care necessarily so much about the UAPs or the UFOs or anything. That&#x27;s just a physical manifestation of hey hold on a second we&#x27;re not alone what is where are they from what&#x27;s the what has been the interaction is that religion is it not is it part of religion is you know all of these questions that we have you know humanity I mean that&#x27;s why to me and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s quite a large question I in that okay if we if we have these things or we&#x27;re looking to solve these things that&#x27;s actually the tip of the iceberg to a much bigger and this is what I want to say there&#x27;s a much bigger philosophical question of what does that mean for everything you know so for me all of these things that we&#x27;re finding out now like dark matter dark energy weekly interacting molecular particles all this stuff so obviously a lot of these things are coming out now so science physics is being sort of turned on its ear and we have since Snowden and you know we have whistleblowers are are not necessarily a bad thing. So, you know, more people are coming, military people down.</p>
<p>And so so for me and this is why I wanted to talk to you today is and I just wanted to get some of the the mechanics of it down but okay if to go back to the government whoever breaks the story but whoever gets there first for example &gt;&gt; not break the story if they crack the technology &gt;&gt; or crack the technology &gt;&gt; material science &gt;&gt; but also break the story of hey we found or they gave it to us or we found or we&#x27;re friends or we know &gt;&gt; that story done been broken &gt;&gt; by by who? It&#x27;s already been done. See, people um if you don&#x27;t know that, you haven&#x27;t been paying attention and but I understand. &gt;&gt; But I don&#x27;t know that because it hasn&#x27;t been unequivocally proved because I right &gt;&gt; if I knew if I we wouldn&#x27;t be having this discussion. &gt;&gt; So what&#x27;s your barometer for truth? Like do you need to walk into an um I&#x27;ll just say a craft that can travel in space not made by humans. That&#x27;s why they changed you remember UFO UAP.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s no longer aliens. They call them NHI, non-human intelligence, which is way better. &gt;&gt; You know, it&#x27;s smart. It was it was listed like 27 times in in congressional um in a senatorial legislation called the Disclosure Act where they&#x27;re trying to pry the technology out of the hands of like Loheed Martin who were unfairly given the contracts for these things because there was no process of letting other people bid on can I work on this because they wanted to hide them in black budget programs. That&#x27;s proven fact.</p>
<p>what I just told you. So, and I can get you there if you got a couple hours and a few more. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I&#x27;m just saying.</p>
<p>But like your point is very fair. I do like your um problem as as you said um cuz you jumped from you know the stars the sand of the stars. You were like okay but what if it&#x27;s true I should know about it. And &gt;&gt; well if it&#x27;s true it means so much more is what I&#x27;m saying. &gt;&gt; What is your barometer of proof? like um I know it&#x27;s different for everybody and for me there were some real solid hard lines of like I need to know if I&#x27;m wasting my life and it started with me seeing the lies and I have gone high up the food chain as high as I can imagine at this point which is I&#x27;m trying to reimagine things where you get to people who actually physically worked on these nonhuman intelligence craft and they&#x27;re thinking about coming forward to testify in front of Congress at their own detriment that is real.</p>
<p>those conversations are happening. And so that&#x27;s kind of where we&#x27;re at is what is proof for the world. &gt;&gt; Okay, I&#x27;ll tell you what proof is. So there&#x27;s not that much difference between this is what we went through the the video footage and like the you know in the &#x27; 50s and the 60s and the 70s it&#x27;s like a thing and it&#x27;s an orb and it moves and it&#x27;s weird and you know it hasn&#x27;t changed that much. It&#x27;s &gt;&gt; the UFO phenomenon.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, no, just the footage is never like wow there it is. I &gt;&gt; I disagree. I disagree. Well, that&#x27;s but I&#x27;m just I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a layman. You&#x27;re an expert.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I people say I&#x27;m aggress I&#x27;m not being aggressive. I&#x27;m just I&#x27;m just talking about proof. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So proof you want some unequivocal.</p>
<p>The other thing would be okay if they do have let&#x27;s see the machines. Let&#x27;s see these things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A and then B. Okay.</p>
<p>If there are so-called biologics or whatever um this is the biggest story. This is humanity now. And also, you know, we have these things where we&#x27;re, okay, we&#x27;re going to release the JFK things. We&#x27;re going to release the things. We&#x27;re going to release all this footage.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to put people&#x27;s &gt;&gt; wor. Yeah. Exactly. So, but it but it&#x27;s since whoever JFK till now, that means every president, every national security advisor. Okay.</p>
<p>So, so &gt;&gt; not every president has told the same amount of information. I know that for a fact. I know people that brief that has brief presidents on that. So that&#x27;s the whole thing like the amount of if it&#x27;s the biggest story ever, right? &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; Then the amount of people that know about the biggest story ever and the only guy we&#x27;ve got is Bob Lazar sort of &gt;&gt; you got tons of people.</p>
<p>You have directors of national security coming out and admitting that we don&#x27;t know what these are. Um so that&#x27;s the thing I think it takes like it takes like a a kind of a critical mass of information, you know, videos and everything I&#x27;m doing with journalism. It&#x27;s glitter. It&#x27;s glitter around the big the big &gt;&gt; but it&#x27;s all we have. This is you&#x27;re providing the proof.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all we have now. &gt;&gt; And so correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but you&#x27;re trying to use investigative journalism to force them to tell us the truth. So that we have the proof so that we can sit here and say, &quot;Okay, now we saw the machines and now this means because what&#x27;s the next step?&quot; And the next step and &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m trying to force them. I&#x27;m trying to force us because we have representative government, man. There&#x27;s people have been hiding this and holding it so tightly and unless somebody gives me a good reason, I&#x27;m not stopping.</p>
<p>But yeah, we&#x27;re trying to use investigative journalism to poke holes to to show either hold them accountable or show how they lied. It&#x27;s one or the other. And so yeah, that is part of the mission, you know, is to is &gt;&gt; But the end of your mission, if you will, would be okay. They open up Area 51 and we see the nine. &gt;&gt; No, there are secrets that should stay there for national sec.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. We should secrets are kept and they should be kept but not about nature and the fundamental reality that we live in. Like for example to give you a hardcore example. We all know that there&#x27;s nuclear science. We do not know how to make a nuclear bomb at home in our living room.</p>
<p>Fine. You&#x27;ve admitted that atomic bombs exist. You&#x27;ve admitted that we know how to make them. M &gt;&gt; you&#x27;ve also admitted that there&#x27;s a whole element of science dedicated to nuclear science. That doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re giving people the codes to how to make nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>So, same thing you said, Area 51 is sure, there&#x27;s tons of stuff that should remain secret, but the fundamental essence of it is nobody&#x27;s right to hold that back from humankind if we&#x27;re not alone in the universe. It&#x27;s the biggest story of all time. Even if they&#x27;re from here originally, just from a long time ago, if that ends up being what it is, and it&#x27;s not something bigger than my head, like interdimensional, I can&#x27;t even live in this dimension. I don&#x27;t know the ultimate reality. There&#x27;s extraterrestrial, extra temporal, interdimensional, ultraterrestrial, meaning they&#x27;re from here.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t care what I I don&#x27;t care about the nuclear. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Sorry. What&#x27;s ultraterrestrial? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s like um they&#x27;re from here, they just predate us, right? or &gt;&gt; like a time &gt;&gt; or they live here or yeah maybe a long time ago civilization breakaway civilization ultraterrestrial but you know the thing is too they could just be here as like a way point man. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Well that so again there&#x27;s a million questions if in fact you go with the hypothesis okay if there are machines if there are is there is technology which you&#x27;re taking as a given. &gt;&gt; No I&#x27;m not taking as a given I know it&#x27;s true. &gt;&gt; Okay so if that&#x27;s true then obviously there&#x27;s what is it called? uh non-human intelligence. &gt;&gt; Yeah, NHI is the new hip term. So then there&#x27;s NHIS.</p>
<p>Now, that is just the beginning. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the springboard into all of these discussions. &gt;&gt; So for me, which is why I want I&#x27;m going to be honest with you. I have two reasons.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Please always be honest. &gt;&gt; Because if in the near future this story breaks, it&#x27;s the biggest story in the world, which means you&#x27;ve worked on a long time, but I&#x27;m going to have this in the can. will will be part of the biggest story ever breaking it. So we&#x27;re we&#x27;re we&#x27;re following we&#x27;re following it down just like we&#x27;d follow any other story. And if it is the biggest story in the history of humanity, we want to we want to get into piece of it.</p>
<p>Now that&#x27;s a and so uh a b just philosophically &gt;&gt; mhm &gt;&gt; it brings up a lot of questions which I&#x27;m interested in and there&#x27;s a lot of knock on things for example government foyer what&#x27;s true what&#x27;s not true you know what are they keeping if they are keeping what are they keeping and for what reason &gt;&gt; the DOJ does not like what I do for a living &gt;&gt; hi it&#x27;s Shane Smith now before we get back to it I wanted to let you know about my new Substack I&#x27;m shanemithsubstack.com Now, I&#x27;m going to be posting a lot of new content there, from extended versions of this show to behindthe-scenes stories from my adventures all over the world with Vice. Now, the best part, it&#x27;s free if you sign up now. So, go to shaneith.substack.com and enter your email. That&#x27;s it. Shaneith.substack.com or click the link below.</p>
<p>And now on with the show, which rhymes with bazango. Maybe let&#x27;s go to that because you did the you did the documentary. What happened to Bob Lazar with that sort of fallout of he started talking and then &gt;&gt; there was theoretically some you know government push back or whatever. &gt;&gt; I feel like um the least qualified person to be in the position that I&#x27;m in when it comes to journalism. I feel like Inspector Crusoe.</p>
<p>Is that that funny French dude? Yeah. &gt;&gt; More handsome. But like what happened with that was George Knap, investigative reporter out of Las Vegas, didn&#x27;t have somebody to fill the time slot, &gt;&gt; who among us has not heard about an alleged UFO cover up. &gt;&gt; I saw that footage. So she got him in the van.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Just did a blur out of his face cuz he didn&#x27;t he was already under threat. &gt;&gt; The reason he did that was for self-p protection. The man that put him in that car was John Lear. It he was like, &quot;Dude, you got to come forward by.&quot; He was doing that. So, so if you can correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, so that he could have it out there so no one would kill him because he had &gt;&gt; he was literally fearing for his life &gt;&gt; because of what he says happened to him that we verified a lot of.</p>
<p>He was fearing for his life. &gt;&gt; George unknowingly, you know, said the guy John Leer had some trust with George because he had um talked to George&#x27;s mentor about the stealth fighter and he was right about it at 51. John Leer was like the godfather &gt;&gt; existence of the stealth fighter or the development. &gt;&gt; John Leer&#x27;s dad was was William Peer inventor of the Lear J the track stereo and you know he was like really up there in the echelon. So everybody revered John he flew all these CIA flights.</p>
<p>So people were like John would come in and talk about things that actually were true out at Area 51 and they&#x27;re like cool. So when he came and talked about this George sees a you know budding journalist at the time he goes I&#x27;ll look at those. I&#x27;ll listen to that. He looks into it. That&#x27;s kind of how it all started was he he called John and goes, &quot;Hey, you got that guy that might want to break from the fold from 51 and maybe go on camera, you know, just shot in the dark.&quot; &gt;&gt; John&#x27;s like, &quot;Yeah, yeah, no problem.</p>
<p>Come on.&quot; &gt;&gt; It wasn&#x27;t like he was chasing a lead. It just &gt;&gt; No, he didn&#x27;t. He literally had somebody drop out of his show and like in real time had to &gt;&gt; which is kind of interesting because in the in the documentary, &gt;&gt; it sort of feels that way like we just got this guy, we did it and then he&#x27;s like then it got picked up all over the world by Dear News and then it became a big news story. Tonight, it&#x27;s a chilling scenario with worldwide implications that may have its roots right here. This week, we&#x27;ve heard the contention of UFO researchers that there is a secret government within our government.</p>
<p>And George, I take this seriously and then he dug in to is Bob a &gt;&gt; lying piece of is he telling the truth? Turns out he&#x27;s telling the truth. That&#x27;s what George came to. &gt;&gt; What I find interesting about it is I I I have two minds of it. when he throws away stuff. Well, then we walk in and on the right there&#x27;s the gray thing and on the right there&#x27;s the orange thing.</p>
<p>Like it was pretty &gt;&gt; involved like so just as throwaway facts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh yeah. The way he told Bob told what happened to him though he had a lot of detail, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. A lot of detail.</p>
<p>So that rings true but then like and especially on the Rogan thing it would be like well what&#x27;s that? Well, I don&#x27;t remember. &gt;&gt; Have you ever asked anyone where they got them or how they got them? &gt;&gt; No. But um something must have been said to me. Um and but I I it was just too long ago and I I can&#x27;t quite remember what was said, but it it just left a seed in my mind. I think at least one of them was part of an archaeological dig.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You you got to understand Bob that how many years ago? 35. By the time I got him on that show with Rogan, first of all, it was not easy. Like Bob didn&#x27;t want to come forward. I convinced him. I honestly convinced him that everybody&#x27;s going to make up lies about him and that that will be his his history unless you talk for himself.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like that&#x27;s true. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like getting the the Bigfoot on camera, right? Like he had he had not gone on camera except these tiny little snippets with George out of loyalty for like 35 years to finally get him and make a documentary. He didn&#x27;t get for my documentary. He just got grief. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t like being in the public eye.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t got money for doing this. And quite frankly, I could make up a better lie, but I have no motivation to lie. &gt;&gt; And so it was like the fact he did it, I I was like really proud of him as a human being to put himself back out there. There&#x27;s a new thing they&#x27;re making on him where they replicate the whole thing that he saw cuz everybody wants to know like what did it really look like? So he hopefully for him hopefully he gets something out of it, but like you know it&#x27;s his life story, but like they&#x27;re finally gonna show you what it looks like in the in the hanger. But yeah, look, man.</p>
<p>If we&#x27;re sitting here and you think you&#x27;re going to get to the bottom of UFOs by figuring out if Bazar is telling the truth, then you&#x27;re as lost as I was back then. It&#x27;s not going to teach you anything. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m just I&#x27;m just starting at the beginning. &gt;&gt; This is Shane asked questions. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m starting at the beginning. So, you get into it, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; by making the movie about that. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you that story? Okay. Yeah. I just I heard Babazar on the radio and it was George Ne and he is talking about propulsion and he&#x27;s saying that it it it&#x27;s a gravity well these things are propelled by gravity and a thing called element 115 which we believe is correct he&#x27;s not sure on everything but that it falls into spaceime and I thought howing weird I&#x27;m 13-year-old idiot kid I listen to Metallic I don&#x27;t give a about this stuff I hear him explain it and it&#x27;s like wait a second so something I I was doing jiu-jitsu Right.</p>
<p>So, I knew a little bit about mechanics. It falls into place. I&#x27;m like, that&#x27;s weird. It flipped my script. I was like, wait a second.</p>
<p>If that&#x27;s true, then points in space and time are connected and it doesn&#x27;t take light speed and thousands of years to get somewhere. It&#x27;s instantaneous. And I go, I want to know if that&#x27;s true. &gt;&gt; But I&#x27;m 13 years old and I don&#x27;t know anybody and what the hell. So, I went off and started doing jiu-jitsu and all this other.</p>
<p>And then I kind of came back to it and I was like, I really want to know if that guy&#x27;s telling the truth. He&#x27;s been consistent now for like 20, 30 years. I&#x27;m like, what&#x27;s going on? But there&#x27;s no way. How do I get to someone like that? There&#x27;s no way. But then I grabbed somebody gave me one of these cameras, just a little Canon 5B.</p>
<p>First person I pointed it at, they spilled the beans about they didn&#x27;t even tell their wife about. And I&#x27;m like, &quot;This is my passport into my curiousness.&quot; You know, this is what I can do. It is my passport. So, I like would point that at people and tell them, &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m going to make a movie. I&#x27;ve never made a movie in my life.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m making a film.&quot; And they&#x27;d start spilling. And then I think I&#x27;m charming. So, what would happen is people would continue to talk with me. And over years, &gt;&gt; I started filming this guy John Lear. And George Knap got wind of it.</p>
<p>And then one day he called me back after two years of me lo leaving messages for him at his um news station and and emailing him &gt;&gt; Vegas &gt;&gt; and it was like the longest pause in telephone history. I think he was eating a sandwich but he he gave me his time and he told me and I was like okay I&#x27;m genuine. I&#x27;m not trying to hurt anybody. I just want to know. That&#x27;s how I got started with George Knap gave me a chance.</p>
<p>He gave me a chance even though I was not a journalist at the time. He&#x27;s been mentoring me in journalism for 11 12 years now. And so that was the entry point. And each time I earned some trust, they spread that around. So to you get to Commander Favor, the most famous UFO case of all time now is 2004 Tic Tac.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s this bearded tattooed guy that calls him up from the desert. And I&#x27;m like, &quot;Hey man, I heard from a herd from a herd from a friend that you chased the UFO. Who are you? How&#x27;d you hear that? What are you talking about?&quot; I I mean I got coaching from my friends how to speak pilot before I called him. I&#x27;m not that dumb, right? &gt;&gt; So I earned his trust &gt;&gt; and when I kept his trust and didn&#x27;t break the story, although we did kind of break it twice on a radio show with his permission to a degree, didn&#x27;t put his name or face out there. And I called him.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;You&#x27;re on the news. I told you your story would was important and it&#x27;s never going away and it&#x27;s coming out with or without me.&quot; &gt;&gt; This is the story of the tic tac. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Commander David Fraver, who&#x27;s a good friend of mine, right? So, I think when I didn&#x27;t break his trust, cuz apparently I&#x27;m the only person that keeps their mouth shut when you ask them to. And that&#x27;s a super talent.</p>
<p>And I didn&#x27;t know that. I did that for him cuz I promised them, you know, and that spread around. And so all those things compiled, all of a sudden, people tell me more than I want to know, and they tell me I shouldn&#x27;t know &gt;&gt; and I report on 1% of it. &gt;&gt; How do you sit on all this stuff? &gt;&gt; Clearly, I&#x27;m a relaxed person. That&#x27;s what I remember about you.</p>
<p>The first time I met you, you had a laugh, man. Oh, yeah. You came in like you had something around your neck, like a big piece of jewelry. You walk into vice like this, and you laughed like loud. I was like, &quot;That guy&#x27;s having a good time.&quot; &gt;&gt; Sure.</p>
<p>Life is good. &gt;&gt; Life is good. &gt;&gt; Life is good. Especially if we can break this story on &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re not going to break it, man. Come on.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re not going to break it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the opposition to this &gt;&gt; if there&#x27;s but if there&#x27;s evidence out there&#x27;s &gt;&gt; preposterous preponderance if there&#x27;s actual technology machines whatever you want to call them &gt;&gt; they&#x27;re not going to let us in bro &gt;&gt; but we&#x27;ve reached a time when you know keeping these okay okay maybe in the 50s and the 60s during the cold war and the army and everything but we&#x27;ve reached a time when you know it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s going to hold it&#x27;s not going to hold much longer. &gt;&gt; You hear that everybody? I&#x27;m talking right to the camera. It ain&#x27;t going to hold. Shane said, so I agree.</p>
<p>Let the information out. Let the information out. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a nuclear program, right? We know about nukes. UFOs are real. There are nonhuman intelligence engaging humanity on a regular basis durationally.</p>
<p>Okay, we can handle it. &gt;&gt; Well, we have to get the sort of unequivocal proof where we beat the government at their own game, which is doable. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not against them. I&#x27;m not I want to work with them. Work with them.</p>
<p>I I I do because &gt;&gt; But they but hold on. But they&#x27;ve proven themselves, if we follow the logic path, they&#x27;ve proven themselves adversarial. &gt;&gt; Who are they? So, I know a lot of people in government that are fighting with me to get this information out. That is 90% of my experience. &gt;&gt; Well, obviously they&#x27;re fighting against some of who&#x27;s keeping the information in.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s true. But it&#x27;s a very small minority of people with great power. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And responsibility, but but power. So, I mean, I&#x27;m kind of making fun as we&#x27;re joking like I want it broken, too.</p>
<p>Yes. this is the biggest story and and I happen to know it&#x27;s true and yeah that is that eats me inside at night but you know I have a dog I have a wife I have a family I have a good life it&#x27;s not going to kill me if the story doesn&#x27;t break and I&#x27;m certainly the wrong messenger to break it there are people that are better suited to tell you what&#x27;s going on it&#x27;s not my responsibility either but I I just feel like if anybody takes as much time to look at this issue that they do on simply looking at hairstyles on Instagram, then they&#x27;re going to know that this is true and they&#x27;re going to demand the answers because and this this is this is the part where we get serious. &gt;&gt; Um you will see my dayto-day soon because I my best weapon was my camera and letting somebody film me through these moments that were hard. you&#x27;ll see me my worst point that&#x27;s coming out and I&#x27;m okay with that cuz I want people to see. &gt;&gt; But if you can kind of see this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So this is like a documentary or &gt;&gt; Yeah, I shouldn&#x27;t say anything but you know this kid this kid&#x27;s been like um when I was going through some of the threats that I have received &gt;&gt; when I have been going through hard times like that. The only defense I had was to record everything, you know, wired up all the time. Everything&#x27;s filmed. And you&#x27;re going to see that. you&#x27;re going to see it how it really happened.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m happy about that because then people will have a level of trust, you know, that I think is necessary for this conversation. We have to have trust. There&#x27;s a lot of &gt;&gt; crazy people when it comes into government and it comes into this thing because it triggers this shielding into religion or this triggers this shielding into I&#x27;m smarter. I&#x27;m scared of the unknown. So there&#x27;s this there&#x27;s this whole thing that happens existentially.</p>
<p>you get what I call ontological shock. I looked up the word. I believe I&#x27;m correct. Ontological shock. The existence of being, I think that word means.</p>
<p>So that happens to people. But I told you I&#x27;m going to get serious. So let me get serious for a second. What I do not as a journalist is I have facilitated whistleblowers, government employees who have had repercussions due to sometimes accidental spillage to the UAP topic. So they&#x27;re inside their government office, they see something they shouldn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>What has happened to some of these people is criminal, 100% provable in the court of law. It&#x27;s criminal and you will see that it will be reported on and everybody can be judge, jury, and executioner. That&#x27;s up to them. I&#x27;m going to report the news though. So, that has happened to too many people.</p>
<p>So, here&#x27;s the deal. Whistleblowers come to me or I find them. Half of what I do is putting together people that say, &quot;I&#x27;ll protect you and people that say I&#x27;ve had an experience that I believe.&quot; And you will see that in Congress if they have courage and they do their job and I will supply them those whistleblowers who are government vetted for years by me and George Knap. This is not casual. I know what they drink.</p>
<p>I know who they hang with. I know where they worked. And I verified it with people on the inside and sources that I&#x27;ve never &gt;&gt; Who&#x27;s the biggest whistleblower &gt;&gt; so far? &gt;&gt; Right now so far. Yeah. &gt;&gt; David Mother Grush.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mr. Gush, as a result of your previous government work, have you met with people with direct knowledge or have direct knowledge yourself of non-human origin craft? &gt;&gt; Yes, I personally interviewed those individuals. &gt;&gt; So, give me his story. &gt;&gt; David Grush came to me and George Knap at a bar, like all good stories start. &gt;&gt; It was a spook bar &gt;&gt; and it was for, you know, a UAP related thing.</p>
<p>And he handed George Knap, trusted journalist, &gt;&gt; his ICIG complaint. &gt;&gt; Mhm. intelligence community inspector general complaint before he submitted it &gt;&gt; I believe or maybe after he submitted it he wanted journalists to know that could shield him inspector general means like the police of so the police of the intelligence community yeah &gt;&gt; okay I hope we get a good new one by the way but anyway they deemed his report credible and urgent &gt;&gt; inspector general did &gt;&gt; he was tasked as a veteran and an intelligence officer. He was tasked with by the UAPF run by a great guy named Jay Stratton who ran the UFO program that that part UAPF UAP task force &gt;&gt; for who? &gt;&gt; For our DoD, but he was transparent. &gt;&gt; So, he&#x27;s a government employee.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, he was. And and he and he was transparent as best he could with the American public. I really admire him for that. People have all these opinions on who&#x27;s spooks, who&#x27;s not spooks.</p>
<p>They think I&#x27;m CI. Where&#x27;s mying paycheck? All I get is grief. So, here&#x27;s the deal. &gt;&gt; David Grush, he does this ICIG complaint. &gt;&gt; He was who he says he was.</p>
<p>He was in the positions he said. He was specifically tasked by the UAP task force and J Stratton to investigate the black budget programs that deal with UFOs and non-human intelligence and tell us are they hiding? And he did. and he hit pay dirt and he did everything he could to tell what was going on internally as an intelligence agent and it&#x27;s his story to tell but it didn&#x27;t go well so he did a complaint like going to the police and HR you know and this is really serious and they said &gt;&gt; I did my job I did what I was supposed to do &gt;&gt; and now I&#x27;m &gt;&gt; so I&#x27;m going to make a complaint and this is the paperwork that &gt;&gt; yeah but he&#x27;s a fidious mother &gt;&gt; so he didn&#x27;t just make a complaint He brought in 40 witnesses and he had them also testify under oath to all of them and give written statements and verbal statements, recorded statements, &gt;&gt; people that worked in these UFO programs. So that&#x27;s his move. He&#x27;s a gangster, right? You don&#x27;t David.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What was the reaction? &gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s a mixed bag, isn&#x27;t it? Now, because what&#x27;s happened is um he came forward and finally with with with me and George, we&#x27;re kind of guiding him. Hey, we&#x27;ve been down this road like be careful of this. let&#x27;s we know some people, let&#x27;s talk about this. Let&#x27;s get you out in front so it&#x27;s harder to hurt you, you know. And it worked well.</p>
<p>And there he is like this testifying to Congress. &gt;&gt; To his left was Commander David Fraver, the guy that chased the UFO. &gt;&gt; So what did they say? They they &gt;&gt; So David Gres said, &quot;I uncovered the fact that the United States government with other nations. I&#x27;ve read into the programs. I can tell you everything in it for national security in a skiff, but here&#x27;s the basics.</p>
<p>There are UFOs. There are non-human intelligence. We have crash retrieval programs. We&#x27;ve been trying to exploit the technology. &gt;&gt; Crash retrieval, meaning if a if a UAP crashes that we have thing to go.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m suspicious of the crash thing. I think they&#x27;re more like gifts, but whatever. Yeah, crash retrievals, they crash. We jump in with different agencies and, you know, we collect up the material. We bring them over to like Battel, BAE, Locked, Rathon, whoever the and we give them a piece and say, &quot;We don&#x27;t know where it comes from, but we want you to reverse engineer Whatever.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying happens, program names, everything. And he goes, &quot;And by the way, somebody asked him, were there any beings on some of these craft?&quot; And he says, &quot;Yeah, some of the crafts we retrieved biologics.&quot; &gt;&gt; Do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? &gt;&gt; Biologics came with some of these recoveries. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn&#x27;t say um beings, &gt;&gt; bodies. He said biologics.</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s a reason he said that. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Well, I think you should ask Dave. He&#x27;s smarter than me. But I I think &gt;&gt; he&#x27;s not here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s true.</p>
<p>We can call &gt;&gt; Keep going. Biologics. Biologics. &gt;&gt; Biologics. I think because we make the assumption that that&#x27;s why we changed it to non-human intelligence.</p>
<p>We make assumption extraterrestrial alien. Well, maybe they&#x27;re from here. They&#x27;re ultraterrestrials. Maybe some of these things are just like printed flesh with AI. We&#x27;d call that a biologic.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, I see. &gt;&gt; Because we do that. &gt;&gt; We print organs. So I think he&#x27;s leaving the terminology open for interpretation but what he&#x27;s saying is yeah aliens and craft. &gt;&gt; I remember talking to Larry Page and he was saying for space travel it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be you go through these light years for example you can download your consciousness or brain into a computer send that through a laser beam into a clone that&#x27;s already been printed out.</p>
<p>So there there are different sort of you know biologics if you &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s um way above my pay grade. Can I have more whiskey? &gt;&gt; Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah. I just like, you know, I don&#x27;t know, man. It that that&#x27;s so cool. Is this what we&#x27;re drinking? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; that is so cool and I would like to be part of that future.</p>
<p>Um just the idea that we might not know everything is kind of neat, you know. &gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s why like when I say uh it&#x27;s the biggest story, I mean literally it changes everything, which is why agreed. Again, you know, I I understand your points and and again, I&#x27;m playing devil&#x27;s advocate, but &gt;&gt; so am I. &gt;&gt; But I&#x27;m just like, if it is the biggest story in the world, like &gt;&gt; A, we have to break it. B, you know, that&#x27;s a lot of people.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Help me break it. &gt;&gt; That will There&#x27;s a lot of But look, that&#x27;s why &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been alone with George now so long. My hair is long, my nails are long. I don&#x27;t know who it is. &gt;&gt; We got to get We got to get more and more people.</p>
<p>Help me break the snow. &gt;&gt; No, you get you call in people like Snowden and you call in people, you know, who can who can get in there. You get some hackers. We had this guy uh who one of the best hackers in the world and he can hack anything like okay let&#x27;s just go talk to him &gt;&gt; but you know I I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know much about politics and stuff but I&#x27;m not playing that game. I&#x27;m not playing this roundabout stealing game.</p>
<p>I want our government Okay. Mos I gave that to him in 2023 and I I&#x27;ve had the video. I was like put it out. This is your chance to show goodwill to the American public. You&#x27;re not hiding.</p>
<p>And they didn&#x27;t. I mean, not to make enemies, but they end up there&#x27;s a lot of good people that work in Arrow that I know personally that are good workers. There&#x27;s a mandate from the top down to absolutely whitewash to the American public the ultimate truth. All you get to know is that UFOs are real. That&#x27;s it.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t ask another question. Don&#x27;t ask about abductions. Don&#x27;t ask about aliens. Don&#x27;t ask about anything like that. &gt;&gt; But if they say UFOs are real, then the followup questions &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve got a lot.</p>
<p>But you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t say well UFOs are real but then you can&#x27;t ask us another question. &gt;&gt; But they just did. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; They did that. So this show is called Shade Ask Questions.</p>
<p>Help me. &gt;&gt; Okay. What happened? So that guy he he did this thing saying what I said to nothing to see here. But he didn&#x27;t say okay but he said okay you can&#x27;t ask anymore. Then they they fired him or he retired him or &gt;&gt; so David Gres what happened was he basically um I guess you kind of resign when you when you when you leave and there&#x27;s no whistleblower protections like he was going to make better rank and make better pay and I think for all the whistleblowers who are about to come forward cuz I&#x27;ve recorded with a bunch that we&#x27;re going to put out if the government doesn&#x27;t do its job and have them in the hearings.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. So I think they should have protections for them. David Gush should get back pay or whatever like the rank pay. They have no safety net after there. No safety net.</p>
<p>Basically, I would say I don&#x27;t know if he resigned in protest like that guy. That guy, my friend Lou Alzando did. He resigned in protest. &gt;&gt; Who is the head of Arrow? &gt;&gt; Sean Kurpatre. Dr.</p>
<p>Sean. &gt;&gt; But didn&#x27;t he But didn&#x27;t he just resign? &gt;&gt; Check this out. Dr. Sean Kurpatre. He&#x27;s straight up lying to the American public.</p>
<p>I know he&#x27;s lying because I sent arrow people to testify to test them. They testified. &gt;&gt; Sorry. testify before Congress &gt;&gt; to testify within the intelligence community to Arrow. It&#x27;s not for the public to know.</p>
<p>This is just people want to keep their jobs. They don&#x27;t want to be known. They want to keep working, &gt;&gt; right? But to give Arrow this the story. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The scoop because Arrow is mandated by Congress to find the cover up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That was the whole point. &gt;&gt; And sorry, just why did Congress mandate them to mandate Arrow to go find &gt;&gt; Great.</p>
<p>This is shame to ask the questions, man. Because there was legislation called the Disclosure Act and they laid out how to give disclosure to the American public. Like Senator Rounds and Senator Schumer, who I think was like top dog of like Democrats or something, &gt;&gt; they laid it out like you read it, it&#x27;s shocking. Like if you locked happen to have non-human technology and you&#x27;re not sure how you got it anymore, but you feel uncomfortable, you can come to us. I see.</p>
<p>We we we&#x27;ll imminent domain that &gt;&gt; right? So basically they knew it&#x27;s out there. So they said we&#x27;re going to hire you &gt;&gt; or not hire you. We&#x27;re going to put you together to do this. &gt;&gt; It wasn&#x27;t written in a void like all that legislation. But why was Arrow really put together? You know to shape the emerging UAP narrative.</p>
<p>Those exact words. If I&#x27;ve ever seen those in a document, it would be to shape the emerging UAP narrative. Why you got to shape something if it&#x27;s made up? Well, also, yeah, because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s growing in popularity, and so therefore, &gt;&gt; something&#x27;s happening, coming out to some degree. People got cell phones, people talking, people are coming forward, whistleblowers. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, man.</p>
<p>So, Dr. Kurpatre, they watch all this stuff, by the way. I love it. I always get intel when people are watching stuff. era.</p>
<p>When you watch this, why are you having your former director do a PR campaign on select podcasts where you try to say you can&#x27;t trust whistleblowers when you are a known liar who goes against whistleblowers when you ask whistleblowers to come to you? Why do I send you whistleblowers &gt;&gt; as a test and then they &gt;&gt; and then they don&#x27;t put out what they &gt;&gt; and then they come back to me and I put it out. Why why is that happening? Why did um Tim Phillips, the intram director of Arrow, who&#x27;s no longer any director of Arrow, also going on a media tour and telling absolute lies &gt;&gt; to the American public. Now, the new director of Arrow I hear is a really good guy, &gt;&gt; but he did say to a friend of mine, fact, I can&#x27;t even part my hair without getting authorization. So even if he&#x27;s a good guy, how much is he able to tell the American public that he wants to? Now they&#x27;ve admitted some good things cuz they have to cuz we forced them. Cuz they look like dopes when they don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>They look like dopes when people come back to me say I testified to them and they lied. They look like dopes when they go to the Wall Street Journal and use Joel Sheckchman as the guy that they&#x27;re going to um put out false information and George and I tell Joel Sheckchman, &quot;Hey, that&#x27;s factually incorrect. Here&#x27;s the guy that was in the nuclear bunker. you got the story wrong, just do a correction. And they don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>They double down and attack whistleblowers. So, Arrow, I got no love for them. Now, the employees of Arrow, lot of love for good folks in there. From the top down, they got a mandate. And I&#x27;m going to say it one last time cuz no one ever listens to me.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;ve been saying this for years. There&#x27;s one thing &gt;&gt; we&#x27;re listening. &gt;&gt; To shape the emerging UAP narrative that is a CIA mandate about the Yeah. about media and the UFOs. They have something by the way that they call um perception management.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a office and they um have a budget and uh that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I definitely believe in perception management because they try to shape uh political consciousness and have been since uh &gt;&gt; really &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Since World War II. &gt;&gt; I believe it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But um can you walk us through how you got the and verified the pyramid UFO Navy footage or the jellyfish footage maybe? Yeah. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s that process look like? &gt;&gt; Oh, to to verify footage. &gt;&gt; How you obtain it and then verify and then &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not going to tell you how I obtain it, but yeah, I&#x27;ll tell you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um but but I&#x27;ll tell you how I verify it because I&#x27;m I&#x27;m very proud of this.</p>
<p>Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um I use something called Cosmic Time and Good Journalism. So, I&#x27;m in no rush. I never need to break another story in my life.</p>
<p>Um, the jellyfish footage was unique because it was filmed at a at a base in a secret part of the base that was secretly a joint operations part of the base secretly run by the CIA. So, that was weird to begin with, you know. Um, but it &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m sorry. This is in Iraq. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So, that was Iraq. Um, the jellyfish UAP. &gt;&gt; So, again, I don&#x27;t know what the jellyfish is. I know that our government has deemed it a UAP and I know that the CIA came and confiscated that footage like even from within other government agencies like so it&#x27;s not just we&#x27;re not supposed to see that like people in government are not supposed to see that so it got leaked to me and to George and the thing is we usually wait to get something sent to us we never solicit that&#x27;s the law that&#x27;s the handcuff law right never solicit but if stuff is leaked to us we wait till like two three times before we take it seriously because we get a lot of time, right? &gt;&gt; So, with the jellyfish one, &gt;&gt; that was a Rubik&#x27;s cube, man. Because the problem with that was how do you validate something that&#x27;s so specific? There&#x27;s only a certain number of people that rotate in and out of that base for a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>So, protect sources, especially if they don&#x27;t protect themselves kind of thing, right? So, we sat and we sat and we watched and started asking little questions, poking around. I was able with George Knap, we showed it on an iPhone to the at the time, I think it was the former head of one of the UFO study groups, um, a couple of them. We showed them and said, &quot;Have you ever seen this before?&quot; And they were like, &quot;No.&quot; Like they had seen something similar, but not that. So we&#x27;re like, &quot;Okay, cool.&quot; So then finally when we got people that were aware, very small group, you know, of that footage, we heard the whole story. What happened is they filmed this thing.</p>
<p>They all know it&#x27;s different than anything before. Or they get drones flying in with bombs all the time at that base, right? Just normal DJI drones. &gt;&gt; So they&#x27;re very familiar with drones, &gt;&gt; bro. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s their job. They are, &gt;&gt; right? It&#x27;s an aeros &gt;&gt; and it&#x27;s not balloons, right? &gt;&gt; I can prove to you it&#x27;s not balloons.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t even want to do that right now. But yeah, it&#x27;s not balloons. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m just I&#x27;m just not you that but see that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a good question. I&#x27;m just bringing it up. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the world.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s a good question. We have to eliminate balloons. Maybe it was balloons. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve got to eight mile it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What does that mean? in uh I Mile, you know, they he knows what he&#x27;s they&#x27;re going to say bad things against them. &gt;&gt; Eminem. So he goes out there and he says, &quot;Oh yeah, you&#x27;re going to say this and I am white and I did do this and you did beat me up and I&#x27;m still here saying the free world. &gt;&gt; You got a mile that &gt;&gt; you got to but also like cuz I I&#x27;m interested in the truth and and sometimes the government&#x27;s been wrong, right? So So my reporting if you look at it, if you just look at what I write, it&#x27;s like very specific, right? &gt;&gt; So yeah, you got a eight mile of that. Um, but then also you have to get So I&#x27;m on Cosmic Time and I do journalism.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what I said to you. So what I do is I &gt;&gt; You like So you you search up people who are in the base. You verify. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It freaks people out.</p>
<p>About 10 of my friends have called me in the last week saying FBI&#x27;s contacting them. I&#x27;m so good now. I go, &quot;Was it agent blah blah blah and blah blah blah?&quot; And I just said that to a guy at NASA really. And yeah, and I can like prove that to you right now like after the show. It&#x27;s like people I am very fidious.</p>
<p>Actually, I&#x27;ll take that word for myself. So, here&#x27;s the deal. We take our time. George Knap and I take our time. We have a web and a network of sources and it pisses off agencies so much.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s your job. Uh, &gt;&gt; thank you, Shane. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I just want to get to a couple more questions because this has been fascinating. I haven&#x27;t got any questions that I did so much research on.</p>
<p>Um but for me what I think one of the reasons why I think it&#x27;s going to break soon is you know tomorrow I&#x27;m interviewing the head of quantum computing at uh &gt;&gt; can I come so cool &gt;&gt; at Google and um who now are further ahead than NORAD and China the other two functioning quantum computers there will be no more encryption. &gt;&gt; Yes correct to know that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so a lot of these things that &gt;&gt; Well, there could be a picture actually. &gt;&gt; Well, not there&#x27;s not not in traditional &gt;&gt; we&#x27;ll argue about it after you talk.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go. But in any case, a lot of these things are like a lot of these secrets are just going to come out. I mean, between marriage of AI and quantum, there&#x27;s just it&#x27;s a fastmoving uh field that that &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. Now, not necessarily Google&#x27;s going to go out there and release everything, but there people will have the tools with which to to to get in there. Now, what do we think of that some of the knock-on effects will be of okay, let&#x27;s say, let&#x27;s follow your logic to okay, that the government lied all of these years and &gt;&gt; the the government Yeah.</p>
<p>certain elements of the deep state. The deep state &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, I don&#x27;t know. the deep state. The government knowingly lied to the people but but kept again the biggest story ever away from everybody.</p>
<p>There will be repercussions for that. Or what happens when it breaks? &gt;&gt; We need some sort of reconciliation process for the people that committed horrificing crimes and are still committing them right now to whistleblowers. Right now you&#x27;re going to hear from three firsthand whistleblowers as I define them on X. I just made sure I made clear. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you&#x27;re going to hear from them come hell or high water because George and I already recorded with them.</p>
<p>So, you&#x27;re going to hear it in Congress. &gt;&gt; Sorry, you&#x27;re you&#x27;re recording now three whistleblowers &gt;&gt; more than that. But we are &gt;&gt; I have offered to Congress who have asked me &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; three firstand whistleblowers. I said no problem. &gt;&gt; I got them to say yes.</p>
<p>We have a hearing date coming. So, if they do it, great. If Congress doesn&#x27;t do it, and they&#x27;re all great. Like Representative Luna has the task force. She&#x27;s awesome.</p>
<p>Representative Burchett, he&#x27;s like fighting for the truth. Everybody&#x27;s curious like me and you. They want to know the truth. &gt;&gt; If they don&#x27;t go out through that process, if we get interference like we did at the last hearing where I brought the documents that everybody needed to see and they misappropriated the terminology to someone else and gave credit, it was so weird, but it was a bigger problem than people think in journalism. It&#x27;s about chain of custody, right? So, they lied to the American public that day.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But do you think that, for example, you were saying some of the people are good? What you were just said, the names Do you think that they go along a certain way and then somebody comes and says slap them and they say we can&#x27;t go any further or &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s way worse than that. &gt;&gt; Okay, go tell me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I mean there&#x27;s everything from just um what do you call it when you work at a place a bureaucratic terrorism, you know, or administrative terrorism holding people in purgatory with their clearances. So they work there, they don&#x27;t work there, they&#x27;re allowed to do what they&#x27;re doing, they&#x27;re not allowed to what they&#x27;re doing.</p>
<p>You sit there, man, 7 months, 9 months, 2 years, you&#x27;re never allowed out, man. And and and it&#x27;s just cuz you saw something you weren&#x27;t supposed to see accidental. They call it spillage. There are so many issues like that. That&#x27;s why people come to me is cuz they&#x27;ve heard that I&#x27;ve helped other people.</p>
<p>They trust me and I keep their secrets and then I help them and I I move forward. And honestly, it&#x27;s cuz I&#x27;m I want to know what they know. I mean, there is a selfish aspect to it. I want to know what&#x27;s going on. you know, but that has been a funny role that I&#x27;ve played is is bringing people together.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s happening now. Three three whistleblowers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Right now, man, like already recorded.</p>
<p>Like, so if if it doesn&#x27;t come out in Congress under oath to the American public, and by the way, it&#x27;s all safe. It&#x27;s taking care of national security. Don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;re thinkers over here, right? The people talking, they&#x27;re not idiots. They&#x27;ve worked their whole lives in the shadows. CIA, working in State Department, working in um all official capacity you could imagine from military to intelligence.</p>
<p>They ain&#x27;t dummies. They live here. They love this country. But this needs to come out, &gt;&gt; especially because they&#x27;re being enacted against. So the next hearing is to protect whistleblowers.</p>
<p>If we get this done, we set precedent. If David Grush, who I said was a baller, right? Godzilla. If that mother is taken care of, if we &gt;&gt; So he&#x27;s no longer working for the government. &gt;&gt; Well, no. See, this is this is a historic thing.</p>
<p>So, Representative Burlson and the task force under Luna brought him as a whistleblower back into government cuz he had all the clearances for a limited time to be the um kind of liaison to the world of whistleblowers to help them bring people forward to do congressional hearings. So, it&#x27;s weird. You get a whistleblower who&#x27;s now a government employee again. So, this is a guy who&#x27;s a real credit to um the intellig. Do you think there&#x27;ll be any new information come out of that those congressional hearings or not? &gt;&gt; 100.</p>
<p>But if they do the hearings, yes. If not, it&#x27;ll come out on weaponized and me and George Knap because we already recorded with them. We&#x27;re going to tell the whole truth. Nothing but the truth. Help us God.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There you go. But do do you think that this will it&#x27;ll come out through &gt;&gt; Do I think you&#x27;re going to believe in UFOs after this? Is that what you&#x27;re asking? &gt;&gt; No, I&#x27;m asking is do you think that there will be new information out of these congressional hearings? with 100% certainty if congressional hearings are held with these whistleblowers, 100% you&#x27;re going to get new information. And I can also assure you that if they don&#x27;t for some reason where the executive branch steps on their neck like Godzilla and this stops them from doing it, that information is coming out anyway. &gt;&gt; It just won&#x27;t be in a congressional setting. It&#x27;s going to be through journalism.</p>
<p>And what would it take for, you know, Area 51 or S4 or, you know, these places to be opened up? Like what would what would &gt;&gt; we shouldn&#x27;t we shouldn&#x27;t open them up, man. Like great projects are &gt;&gt; or like Okay, open it up in the sense of you can show a little bit without, you know, hurting the national security. &gt;&gt; Missouri, I looked it up on Wikipedia, so I know it&#x27;s true. Missouri is the show me state. Did I get that right? &gt;&gt; Probably.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think so. My dream is we take a craft, just one of them. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. The jello mold. Take the take.</p>
<p>Take the boring. No, &gt;&gt; I want the sport model. I want Bob sport model cuz how nostalgic would it be for him to be in Missouri? Take the sport model. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Put it in a museum.</p>
<p>Now, you can&#x27;t dent this metal. You can&#x27;t blow torch it. You can&#x27;t do anything. Just do a little metal detector on the way in. Make sure people aren&#x27;t crazy.</p>
<p>Let them sign and look at the seats themselves. let them go and like little hit a little hammer. Just have them on little like strings &gt;&gt; or feel it. Casey said when you feel it. Now the other thing is is he said if you go underneath it you couldn&#x27;t see it because of the &gt;&gt; when it&#x27;s when it&#x27;s active because this gravitational distortion allegedly from a lot of these scientists have worked on them.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a field propulsion system. So what happens is it energizes becomes silent after it&#x27;s like maybe 15 ft up. Don&#x27;t quote me on that, you know. And then &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s a a wrapping kind of like a a warping of spaceime. That&#x27;s what they say.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. This is wild, but you look up. &gt;&gt; So, so, but to go back to it, like if there&#x27;s this wrapping of space time, you can&#x27;t see it. How does that explain the fact that we can see these other ones? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, sometimes obviously they want you to see them.</p>
<p>So, the thing is like Phoenix lights, let&#x27;s get really specific. &gt;&gt; Yes. Go. &gt;&gt; Mass sighting. &gt;&gt; So, on March 13th, 1997, thousands reported seeing a V-shaped light formation in the sky.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Lights. &gt;&gt; Huge craft. Really? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Like there there&#x27;s this Navy pilot that came to like rent one of my properties and he just looked at me and there his wife actually said it. She goes, &quot;We saw it.&quot; So they did some research and I was like, &quot;Damn, you tell me what you saw.</p>
<p>You can rent the house. Come on.&quot; &gt;&gt; No, this was in California. But they he was a a Growler pilot &gt;&gt; and uh she had actually seen it with her family. Wow. &gt;&gt; And um so this huge I mean she said from like mountain to mountain just blacked out the sky but you could see a little swarming of the stars as if it was almost see-through.</p>
<p>Kind of like what you&#x27;re talking about. &gt;&gt; The thing is she&#x27;s not alone. And like her dad was like a doctor, her mom was like a lawyer. Okay, I get it. You&#x27;re credible.</p>
<p>So many people saw this. even the governor of Arizona, there was too many calls, which is actually very instructive. We should talk about that, but too many calls to his office. So, he came out with like an alien um costume. &gt;&gt; And now I&#x27;ll ask Officer Stein and his colleagues to escort the accused into the room so that we may all look upon the guilty party.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t get him too close to me, please. &gt;&gt; He goes, I found the culprit. And he has him in handcuffs. &gt;&gt; Are you joking? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Like there&#x27;s nothing to see here.</p>
<p>Move on. problem is a buddy of mine named James, right? He like made a movie and interviewed the guy, the governor of Arizona at the time. &gt;&gt; All right. The guy who came out of &gt;&gt; Yeah. like decades later.</p>
<p>And what he said was, &quot;I saw it, too.&quot; And he was a he was a fighter pilot, a trained observer. And he says, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t say it at the time. It would have caused panic.&quot; So, he did that stunt, but he was like repenting. He&#x27;s like, &quot;I saw it, too. There&#x27;s nothing we have that can do that.&quot; I think we both maybe maybe we don&#x27;t agree.</p>
<p>I I would say I don&#x27;t think it causes pan I don&#x27;t think it causes panic. &gt;&gt; I agree. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think I mean this whole thing of like it&#x27;s going to cause &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s going to cause a lot of people to go &gt;&gt; finally come on now. &gt;&gt; I agree. But I think also we&#x27;re we&#x27;re getting there.</p>
<p>Remember because there was such stigma to the point where now on Navy ships my boys are doing something really cool. So because of mine and George&#x27;s reporting not solely but a lot because of it. If you label it UAP, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s instantly classified. That&#x27;s a new thing. However, if you label it a UAS, unmanned aerial system, it&#x27;s not instantly classified.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, the dudes that write down things in ships, I know a lot of them. &gt;&gt; 2019, they wrote UAS. So, that&#x27;s how we know about it. That&#x27;s how I &gt;&gt; The Mosul thing would be a UAS. Kind of looks like a UAS to me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Unmanned. Well, you&#x27;re talking about a drone. So, so whatever that is, the mosa orb. &gt;&gt; Well, just a small little orb going &gt;&gt; and that&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t know what size it is because until now I haven&#x27;t had the the I call them nerds. George Knap calls them online detectives.</p>
<p>Um I gave everybody the actual numeric imprint from the footage so you can see altitude, flight path, all that stuff. Now that as of today they have the video although the government blocked out all the numbers it&#x27;s only 4 seconds long they can reverse engineer that and I am so curious what is the size? Is it the size of a nickel? Is it the size of you know a house? Like how big is it? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not like a nerd. &gt;&gt; Do you uh did you ever see the movie don&#x27;t with cats? &gt;&gt; I think I have. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s about &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>on Netflix or something? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It&#x27;s I mean it&#x27;s He&#x27;s laughing. It&#x27;s a fantastic &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s good, right? &gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s a fantastic movie. But basically, you&#x27;re going to like this. It&#x27;s a fantastic movie because basically this guy with cats.</p>
<p>He killed some cats, right? &gt;&gt; Ew. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And so, but these sleuths online sleuths like there&#x27;s like hundreds of thousands. &gt;&gt; I have seen it. I have seen it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s &gt;&gt; find him for murder. &gt;&gt; Thousands of people looking to find this guy. There was a title wave of leads that were coming in. &gt;&gt; I wasn&#x27;t going to stop until I found him. Clearly, this video is not the end.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And they get him. They catch him for murder and they followed him because of the murder of these cats, right? &gt;&gt; Oh, he did that stabby thing on the bed. The weirdo. &gt;&gt; Well, he killed somebody in Montreal. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Did he do that stabby thing and pretend to eat him or something, bro? &gt;&gt; Is that what he did? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know. He was that dude that was like &gt;&gt; anyway I&#x27;m just saying what&#x27;s interesting about that isude &gt;&gt; what&#x27;s interesting about that is &gt;&gt; that there&#x27;s people out there that can solve &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; anything &gt;&gt; dude &gt;&gt; online with footage. So we need to mobilize if anyone&#x27;s watching this &gt;&gt; the don&#x27;t with cats type people out in the world and say let&#x27;s look at these different types of footage &gt;&gt; without bias shame because no but hold on you know about the world this is such an impassioned I have never seen people go more crazy over something other than animals like cats and I&#x27;m down with that you up a dog I&#x27;m more right but with UFO thing. We all have a a bias. I like to believe I don&#x27;t, but I I do.</p>
<p>My bias is that, oh, come on. We&#x27;re not alone. You think you&#x27;re the smartest monkey? Somebody else got here. But that&#x27;s that&#x27;s my bias, right? But I try to eliminate and take that out. There are paid people online to tell you that the Mosul Orb is a pothole.</p>
<p>Like, I know they&#x27;re paid. they&#x27;ve admitted they&#x27;re paid, that kind of thing. So, you&#x27;re up against a again, perception management is an actual like they actually have an office. I I want to go in there. &gt;&gt; So, I&#x27;m saying that yes, let&#x27;s crowdsource the UAP problem.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The puzzle. Let&#x27;s crowdsource the UAP puzzle. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not one piece of footage is going to be the end all and be all.</p>
<p>This is just to provoke and to expose people for telling the truth or not telling the truth. This is a tool to get to the bigger. Also, if you get hundreds of millions of people all, by the way, clamoring and electing people, um, that&#x27;s how you get elected. It&#x27;s going to force information to the four just that&#x27;s and so if it becomes a big issue that a lot of voters are saying, &quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; then &gt;&gt; I agree. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>and your optimism is inspirational to me because I&#x27;ve been um you know kind of fighting this battle not even like George Naps fighting for 40 years alone right I pulled him back in I&#x27;m sure he was going to quit a billion times he told me he would right the fact you&#x27;re a journalist and you&#x27;re saying let&#x27;s solve this dude I don&#x27;t have many people that want to solve this your optimism that we&#x27;re going to solve it it&#x27;s either naive &gt;&gt; or and inspirational because &gt;&gt; probably both George George thought he was going to solve it in 6 months. Just need a good journalist on this. That&#x27;s all we need, &gt;&gt; bro. It&#x27;s like we&#x27;re smashing our heads against a wall with online armies of people trying to stop us from doing journalism. If you&#x27;re going to really dive in in any way, I can tell you who to speak with.</p>
<p>I can tell you who&#x27;s legitimate, who&#x27;s full of I am happy to tell you. I got a lot of mouth. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; save you 10 years. &gt;&gt; There we go. Good.</p>
<p>I would like to on that note, okay, &gt;&gt; keep the channels open. This is an ongoing discussion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because it feels like there&#x27;s sort of a critical mass. &gt;&gt; I agree.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You know, and so if there is a critical mass going, there&#x27;s you been in the fight a long time. I come in and there&#x27;s another guy. We bring in more and we get to don&#x27;t with cats people and we get everybody. And then, you know, you you talk to some people in government, in politics, etc., etc. &gt;&gt; Too much.</p>
<p>I mean, there&#x27;s a lot of people like, you know, and maybe it&#x27;s just lip service, but it was a concern to the Republican base about, you know, JFK not releasing it. So, they didn&#x27;t release all of it, but they released a bunch of it. &gt;&gt; And of course, you know, it what it proves is that the CIA were working with the people who killed JFK, which is what they didn&#x27;t want to have happen. Yeah. Everybody knew that because everybody knew it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But yeah, &gt;&gt; whistleblowers, right? So look, all of the truth will out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so uh and so let&#x27;s keep the let&#x27;s keep the dialogue open and if there is any uh breaking news, uh you&#x27;re going to come here and we&#x27;re going to talk about it. &gt;&gt; Well, you&#x27;re going to be a busy man because I&#x27;m going to be breaking news like it&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s business. I&#x27;m like a propulsion system that is going to continuously be breaking news because I made a decision and this is real.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to tell you something real right now &gt;&gt; and you&#x27;ll see this. You&#x27;ll actually see this documented which is interesting. &gt;&gt; George Knap and I made a decision and our decision is that we&#x27;re going to put he thinks he doesn&#x27;t have long to live and I&#x27;m thinking like let&#x27;s do this right. We&#x27;re going to put our best stuff forward. We&#x27;re going to try to provoke try to push.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re not going to stop. We made a decision to put out our best evidence &gt;&gt; and you know be damned everything else because you know people have not liked what we&#x27;ve done &gt;&gt; but it anyway. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you for having me on.</p>
<p>I appreciate it. It&#x27;s nice to rem meet you. It&#x27;s &gt;&gt; different uh to meet you now. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your time. &gt;&gt; Thank you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This was awesome. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for um just having the conversation. &gt;&gt; Thank it. It was great. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re going to crack it, but you&#x27;re awesome. &gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s first steps. First step. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the whiskey, man. We come to Ohigh.</p>
<p>You guys all invited have a sip of mine.</p>
