            <p>Hugh Everett who was a graduate student when he invented this idea in the 1950s said look when you measure that electron what happens physically like forget about you&#x27;re a person you&#x27;re conscious all that BS like you&#x27;re a physical system you obey the schinger equation you you are quantum mechanical system you obey the laws of physics so you look at the electron your wave function changes it used to be you&#x27;re just a person doing whatever you do but then after you look at the electron you become entangled with it and it splits so there is one part of the wave function that says the electron was spinning clockwise and you measured it spinning clockwise and there&#x27;s another part of the wave function that says the electron was spinning counterclockwise and you saw it spinning counterclockwise now everybody knows this like that that far it&#x27;s not controversial at all that&#x27;s clearly the prediction of the equations of quantum mechanics</p>
