            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas I do educational videos on many different topics we are right in the middle of uh studying up on the reciprocal system of theory of Dewey B Larson Larson was a an engineer who lived uh born back in 1898 and uh in the uh about 1930 he started working on uh developing the reciprocal system finally got it to a point where he uh narrowed it down to basically two postulates took those two postulates and uh built a theoretical Universe from those and uh started writing books on pretty much a Theory of Everything he&#x27;s got books on chemistry physics astronomy uh and uh we are looking at his final book that came out after he died he died in 1990 this book came out in 1995 it&#x27;s called beyond space and time and it is his contribution to metaphysics uh mostly on the soft Sciences philosophy religion psychology and those kind of things Consciousness studies uh and uh we are right in the middle of Chapter eight which is called communication local and uh the basic gist of the theory is that the universe is not made out of matter and it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time and space and time are reciprocal aspects of motion so res uh space and time are basically the numerator and the denominator of a ratio or relationship um and that is motion the simplest example of that is speed the car is moving 20 miles per hour 20 miles of space in one hour of time space over time that is speed but it turns out all of our scientific entities uh you know units uh can be broken down in terms of space over time or time over space um time and space both have three dimensions in Larson&#x27;s system other people maybe say three or more dimensions and um they both come in discrete units there&#x27;s a minimum for uh minimum one unit of space and a one quantized you know unit of time and that one unit of space divided by that one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is one over one and uh unlike Einstein where in Einstein&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe in Larson&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe or the null the neutral point of the universe where there&#x27;s uh one entire universe that moves slower than the speed of light that he calls the material sector and then there is one half of the universe that moves faster than the speed of light and that is called The Cosmic sector or The Meta uh the inverse sector and um he goes from there and so this is really uh eventually when he starts applying this stuff to metaphysics he comes up with for additional postulates that he needs to use uh that we got into a few episodes ago um and uh so uh in chapter chapters five through seven he kind of derives where the life what life is and life is basically this material sector um the material sector is the inanimate world this is chemical the world of chemistry you know atoms and molecules and when atoms and molecules develop to their most complex level which is DNA the DNA molecule at that point it becomes big enough to accommodate a cosmic unit a cosmic unit uh that he calls a control uh it and that this Cosmic unit is able to incorporate itself into this material unit as a minor portion of it uh but it takes control over it in the same way that a thermostat takes control over a room uh the thermostat is a very small portion of that room but it takes control of the environment of the room and that&#x27;s similar to how he describes life life is a combination of a material and Cosmic unit in the right proportions and which is really one to one um but there is a there is a a loss in the translation so to speak moving across the boundary and so actually this material sector unit has to be much much much much much bigger than the cosmic unit now once you have this life unit then [Music] um the life unit can become more and more and more complex and uh you know he talks about this in terms of the communication first it&#x27;s communicating directly uh you know through osmosis or you know direct communication then it develops uh chemical Messengers to um communicate to control and then it develops electrical impulses um and the cellular biological organisms the life organisms become more and more complex until they reach their most complex State and in that state then they reach this boundary and then they can be taken over from a unit uh another control unit that is um what he calls from sector three sector three is what he calls the general metaphysical region and sector three is actually independent of a space and time so what I reckon that that that uh metaphysical unit is is really in the realm of this actual speed of light this neutral area neutral point that&#x27;s moving actually at the speed of light at which point time and space um basically lose their significance um they resolve so there&#x27;s not an imbalance between time and space there&#x27;s not more time uh in the cosmic sector or more space in the material sector there is instead a balance and and uh at that point it becomes a one-to-one and it just turns into one um and so there is no they&#x27;re resolved and in this uh so this is the sector three unit and the sector three unit can eventually take control of the entire life unit and he calls that ethical development so now he&#x27;s talking about the communication that can exist between this um this Cosmic uh this metaphysical control unit and the life unit uh and we&#x27;ll start there the control unit exists in a physical location by virtue of its association with a biological organism and also in a non-physical location a location in existence as a whole the general metaphysical region as we have called it by virtue of its own inherent nature we may compare The Coincidence of these two locations to the point of intersection of two lines such a point is located on both lines and if these lines of communication telephone lines for example communication via either line is feasible we have no direct knowledge of the means of communication that exists in sector three but in view of the multiplicity of communication media that are available in the material and Cosmic sectors there is an ample basis from which to extrapolate the existence of communication facilities to the metaphysical region indeed there is reason to believe that there should be more channels open for communication in sector three than in the space-time universe as the specific properties of space and time are in a sense limitations and there&#x27;s greater flexibility where such limitations do not exist we have already arrived at the conclusion that sector 3 existences are intelligent that was one of his metaphysical postulates okay we have already arrived at the conclusion that sector 3 existences are intelligent and since intelligent biological organisms are fully able to communicate with each other by means available in their sector of the universe the intelligent units from sector 3 should be able to communicate with each other by means available in their sector of the universe the inability to detect any physical evidence of such communication is not an argument against its existence as it was against uh communication between sector 2 uh through sector 2 channels as noted earlier the sector Community to communication if it existed would be physical and therefore detectable physically but the sector 3 communication is not physical and consequently it cannot be expected that there will be any physical way of detecting it on the basis of the concern considerations outlined in the foregoing paragraphs we must conclude that direct communication through sector 3 channels between control the control units that direct the activities of ethical man is definitely possible then let us ask is there any evidence that such communication actually takes place and he says there can be no question as to the answer the validity of the evidence of this nature is hotly debated but its existence is undeniable this process and Associated phenomena are systematically studied in the universities and research Institutes the reports of Investigations of these phenomena are published and discussed in various journals and a considerable body of literature on the subject now exists in as much as these as the conclusions that have been reached as to the ability of the control units to communicate directly with each other through their own channels are based on factual premises and have been derived from these premises by sound scientific reasoning so that they have a high probability of being correct even if observational evidence were entirely lacking any support supporting evidence from observational or experimental sources is highly significant obviously however the better the evidence the more support it gives an appraisal of the validity of the evidence that has been accumulated is therefore in order okay now um we&#x27;ll skip a couple of his uh very lengthy sentences and uh cut to the punch line that he is building up to the particular phenomena with which we are now concerned has been given the name telepathy and it is one of several somewhat similar phenomena that are grouped under the designation of extrasensory perception abbreviated ESP closely connected with telepathy is clairvoyance which is obtaining knowledge of facts or events by direct apprehension without utilizing physical means if this information concerns the future the term precognition is applied and it is rather difficult to draw dividing lines into place observed events directly in one class or the other uh and so we&#x27;ll just refer to it as ESP General a related phenomena psychokinesis which is non-physical action upon matter is sometimes class with ESP but psychokinesis is not a communication phenomenon and hence it is clearly on a different footing since the present discussion is concerned only with communication no consideration will be given to psychokinesis at this point but it will be discussed later the current situation in the ESP area is expressed by uh you know this particular scholar uh as follows certain problems that were taboo and physics a generation ago researches in which physicists indulge at the risk of losing his reputation such as paranormal perception and Clairvoyance are now more widely regarded as worthy as of consideration again Larson goes through uh the scientific literature to kind of justify his foray into it saying that oh this is now uh more acceptable uh you know we can do this without losing our jobs and uh so on and so forth I&#x27;m not sure you know I I I understand where Larson&#x27;s coming from but it just kind of uh muddles uh muddies the waters for him when he starts going into the long um literature uh review of different Scholars who have dealt with um whatever question he&#x27;s talking about in order to kind of justify his position it would probably in my opinion it would be much more beneficial for him to just lay out his opinion and you know this is it this is you know I I&#x27;m not his his the reciprocal system of theory is not Reliant upon any of these Scholars to give it uh give it any uh Credence it relies upon itself it&#x27;s a bunch of apostolates and it&#x27;s a bunch of deductions from the postulates and it&#x27;s independent of any type of scholar so I think he just hurts his case when he does this but so we&#x27;re we&#x27;re gonna just skip over that and uh we&#x27;re gonna get to in beginning an examination of the arguments that are reduced against the reality of ESP we will first consider the issues raised by price in the article from which the victory quotation was taken that well okay we&#x27;ll skip this uh to support his contention that ESP and accepted science are incompatible he offers the list of conflicts and uh so this is the he gives eight uh price gives eight reasons why uh ESP is no good um and I again I don&#x27;t know why so I think I&#x27;m just gonna continue to skip over this and um he kind of debunks all of these different reasons why it uh shouldn&#x27;t exist uh I don&#x27;t think that that is really Larson&#x27;s responsibility to do that um I think he instead he should just lay out what He suggests what he thinks what his deductions um are and you know read them and weep if you don&#x27;t agree with it then you don&#x27;t agree with it um okay I suggest that the discovery of the psy phenomena or ESP consciousness um psychic psychic Consciousness has brought us to a point at which we must question basic theories because they lead us expectations contradicted by the experimental results now that the development of the reciprocal system has clarified the basic relationships um he identifies which of these authors that he just reviewed uh are correct and you know who isn&#x27;t um and then he gets back into more and more uh you know discussion I mean I know he&#x27;s trying to contextualize himself to put himself into the conversation uh with all of these other Scholars but again I think that Larson&#x27;s uh best audience is uh an intelligence 13 year old or uh unintelligent adult who hasn&#x27;t really doesn&#x27;t really have an extensive scientific background find that the the people who the more science that you have the more invested you have in the current science and the less the less open your mind is going to be toward um you know toward adapting a new Theory and so Larson is kind of beating his head against the wall trying to place himself into this literature um that already exists and he you know he uses a lot of justifications and uh hedging slow progress in a new field of study is not necessarily an indication of the lack of reality of the phenomena being investigated and [Music] um I mean I&#x27;ve literally gone through about 10 pages of um him placing himself into the literature the lack of reproducity uh reproducibility of ESP results is uh you know a serious uh defect in the case for the reality of the phenomena um in the so-called Natural Sciences a discovery reported in one laboratory or Observatory is promptly checked by many others or in many others and whether or not attempts to reproduce the results are successful is an important factor usually the most important factor in determining whether the discovery will be accepted as authentic the critics of the ESP investigations argue that this Criterion of reproducibility should be equally applicable to the ESP results and that in as much as it is generally perhaps always true in the SP field that the original results cannot be reproduced by other investigators the standard practice of science requires that these results be rejected um and so he&#x27;s kind of looking at this as being um you know something that uh the ESP uh you know boosters are gonna have to uh to get over this this hurdle the reasoning of these critics is entirely valid but their premises are erroneous ESPN experiments have never been repeated under identical conditions unless it has happened by accident attempts have been made to reproduce the physical conditions of an experiment as closely as possible but aside from such effects as they may have on the non-physical situation these physical conditions are completely irrelevant in order to repeat an experiment on a non-physical phenomenon such as ESP under identical conditions it is necessary to reproduce the non-physical conditions okay so he&#x27;s putting it on a different track there uh it&#x27;s not so much the physical conditions um it is the non-physical conditions that also have to be duplicated in order to be able to reproduce the experiment and how are you going to do that if it&#x27;s non-physical um so you would have to be able to approach it in a different an entirely different way okay um all right I guess that&#x27;s all the time we&#x27;ve got we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow</p>
