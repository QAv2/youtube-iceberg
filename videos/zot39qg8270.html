            <p>that happen but watch this that was an only invention he had he had another device that ran on nothing yes you know how much money you can make off on nothing you can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll sell you nothing for $5 a gallon what do you mean there&#x27;s no profit margin on nothing right he built a device that broke the second law of Thermodynamics do you and I even know what that means broke the second law of Thermodynamics whatever it is he was able to figure it out to run on nothing you can&#x27;t monetize when you run on nothing right Stanley Meer had a donut shaped electromagnetic device in his garage slapped with a national security order due to its groundbreaking nature paranoid from past experiences of having patent seized Meyer deliberately falsified the voltage and frequency numbers in his patent to prevent theft or classification Skeptics argued that Meyer&#x27;s technology violated thermodynamics law specifically the second law thermodynamics energy transfers inefficiencies because Myers&#x27;s engine created energy without waste now watch this I&#x27;m going to read this to you it&#x27;s going to sound very weird but hang tight and then I&#x27;m going to validate it with a quote that was given by Tesla back in the days Zero Energy devices are set not to create energy but to channel existing keyword omnipresent energy challenging conventional views on energy conservation is what we&#x27;re talking about with Stanley and you know what Nicola Tesla said if you want to find the secrets of the universe think in terms of energy frequency and vibration what the hell happened to this Stanley guy was he up to something big and why did he disappear all of a sudden it&#x27;s a good question to to ask so now that&#x27;s 1990 how how far back can we go where somebody thought of this in 1898 this man named Stubblefield was issued the US Patent of 6,457 for something called the Earth battery Earth battery what is an earth battery it&#x27;s an electronic coil of iron insulated copper wire that was immersed in liquid or buried in the ground Stubblefield claimed that combined with normal battery operation his device also Drew additional power from the earth however did successfully serve as both a power source and a Ground Terminal for wireless telephones this is getting crazier and crazier right you may be watching this right now saying I&#x27;m going to come up with this idea there&#x27;s no money in this idea you get what I&#x27;m saying like there is no money it&#x27;s just you&#x27;re solving a massive problem you&#x27;re going to create so many enemies the oil and gas industry employs millions of people this isn&#x27;t just about the people that are making the money but watch this one here niika Tesla&#x27;s Pierce AER electric car from 1921 running on pure aetheric electricity what does that mean this is a self recharging car it does not run on batteries oil and gas again recharging how do you keep making money if somebody sells a battery that&#x27;s recharging you shave and you use your razor it gets bad boom you go to whatever store you buy another one okay you put batteries in something you change you go back right you&#x27;re constant I to go back to buy it there is more money being made if it&#x27;s self-recharging car what do I need to go byy cuz it&#x27;s already recharging itself there&#x27;s no profit in it and by the way what&#x27;s Wild is many of these stories were also in the paper here&#x27;s one from August 28th 1921 in the Phoenix paper electricity taken from air drives automobile taken from air drives automobile and by the way I got a bunch of these stories but I want to tell you with Tesla let&#x27;s go through what happened with Tesla so check this out in 1900 Nicola Tesla convinced JP Morgan to fund a Global Wireless communication system later expanding the project to include Wireless power transmission after demonstrating the technology so now JP yeah yeah we all know the story if you don&#x27;t know go do your research</p>
