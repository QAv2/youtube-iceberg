            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone I&#x27;m Thomas welcome to my channel I do educational videos on many different topics uh today is the 50th video that we&#x27;re do we&#x27;re doing on the reciprocal system of theory of Dewey B Larson we did a few uh biographical and autobiographical uh videos then we did about 15 videos on his uh deductive development of the reciprocal system showed um the steps he took in developing the reciprocal system which is a theory of everything he developed back in the 20th century up until his death in 1990 and uh it has been uh extended by many other people not many but a few other people uh over the last 30 years but especially Dr Bruce paret who died back in 2020 and um Larson&#x27;s basic uh just the basic gist of it is that the universe is not made out of atoms like the ancient Greeks would say and it&#x27;s not made out of energy as Einstein would have said but it is made out of motion uh he eventually came around to even saying just change change in three dimensions but he used the term motion uh he first used the term space time I change that to motion um and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other they are the same they have the same qualities uh what everything that you can know about space is what you know about time and that is useful because we can see space but we can&#x27;t see time and so uh we can extrapolate two-time the qualities of space now we&#x27;re looking at his uh his final book that was published posthumously and it is called beyond space and time this is when Larson takes his [Music] um his Theory of Everything which he says can be applied to anything he had originally applied it to the hard Sciences science uh chemistry astronomy and physics but now in this final book he&#x27;s applying it to the softer Sciences such as religion um psychology and um philosophy uh also some uh biology in there and uh through this he he extends a few other postulates but basically uh you know the structure that he&#x27;s carrying this on is that you know for Einstein the speed of light was the maximum speed of the universe but for Larson and it makes sense given that he&#x27;s got a universe of motion the speed of light is the midpoint or the neutral point of the universe and there&#x27;s a half of the universe that moves actually faster than the speed of light as well as half the universe that moves slower than the speed of light this half that moves slower is the part that we&#x27;re accustomed to calls that the material sector the other half is the half that we kind of have to extrapolate to understand extrapolate from what&#x27;s over here is what&#x27;s over here because time and space are reciprocals of each other these over here are basically space over time relationships these over here are time over space relationships and but we can understand this sector because we understand this sector um because of all the chemistry and physics and stuff that we&#x27;ve studied and that we&#x27;ve developed over time about this we can extrapolate or just by Theory uh because that&#x27;s how Larson does it he builds up a theoretical Universe we can take our theoretical universe and apply it over here by extrapolation so he calls this faster than the speed of light uh sector called The Cosmic sector or sector two whereas this is sector one but then he&#x27;s also got a sector three and the sector three is independent of space and time I would posit that it that really has to do with light uh especially if you look at like I Einstein&#x27;s relativity you know uh something moving at the speed of light is not really subject to any time and uh you know if you take the Lorenz contractions it all goes up goes to zero there and that&#x27;s one uh the speed of light is one quantum of space per one Quantum of time uh so it just all cancels out and it just turns into one and uh but anyway that&#x27;s not what Larson says that&#x27;s kind of what I&#x27;m saying but he Larson is really saying that sector three is the sector that&#x27;s independent of space and time he doesn&#x27;t really Define it he&#x27;s pretty much using uh you know replacing God he&#x27;s saying that this is god um again he doesn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m saying that but um so the progression is that something in the material sector becomes more complex through aggregation you know it gloms on a new you know new atoms and new molecules up until uh it gets to the most complicated material structure which he says is DNA DNA molecule has over you know many billions of atoms and at this point uh of of uh complexity it becomes capable of accommodating a cosmic unit a unit from sector two and when it accommodates that uh sector two unit it turned the whole structure turns into a life unit the life unit is um under control of sector two uh in the same way Larson says as a thermostat controls a room it&#x27;s a small a very small part of that room but it controls the environment and in the same way the sector 2 component is a very small part of sector of the overall life unit but it controls um that and it is geared towards survival but uh this life unit once it becomes complex enough then it becomes capable of coming under the general control of the sector 3 unit independent of space and time and he says that complexity level is reached at the level of the intelligent human being or humanoid and so that can come under control of sector three and at that point um it becomes somewhat of a competition uh between sector three objectives which are ethical Behavior or good behavior and sector two which is survival at times those work together and at times they work in opposition uh when they&#x27;re working in that position the individual uh intelligent human has to be able to decide uh which they&#x27;re going to go with the objectives of survival or the objectives of good behavior now uh he is here we&#x27;re in chapter 12. uh he just went through uh three or four chapters where he was talking about communication from sector three and that sector three communicates with us variously through ESP intuition [Music] uh scientific insight and religious Revelation and they&#x27;re all from the same thing they&#x27;re all from sector three it&#x27;s just we kind of interpret them differently depending on our context depending on the level of complexity of the communication now we&#x27;re in sector we&#x27;re in chapter 12 which is called Miracles and Larson had just gotten done uh discussing how um sector 3 is not evil it&#x27;s only good sector 3 is good by definition in as much as as it is in Conformity with the laws and principles of sector three that constitutes good behavior hence there cannot be any evil in sector three so uh you know any discussion about Satan or something like that uh is Satan is a local character is what Larson is saying sector three is independent of space and time and this good is all pervasive throughout the whole universe or many universes but the Satan uh character is um I guess like the Bible says is a principle of a principality it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s only um it&#x27;s only effective it&#x27;s only um jurors it only has jurisdiction over a limited region like uh you know um single planet or I guess a single universe but it it doesn&#x27;t have the same kind it&#x27;s not a sector three uh it&#x27;s not from sector three it doesn&#x27;t have that kind of uh reach it is a local uh fourth and he says if there are other universes similar to ours uh as our findings indicate that there are then these other universes also have their evils analogous to ours confined to their particular universes if there are still other universes of a different kind multi-dimensional perhaps these universes may or may not have evils so far as our present information tell us but sector three the general metaphysical region is the home of good not evil uh at this point it might be asked whether it might not be possible for influences evil or otherwise originated in these foreign Universe to have an effect on our own uh he says no uh then on the basis of this work all assertions concerning evil or harmful influences exerted by metaphysical agencies will have to be identified as superstition even um even when they emanate from religious sources of the highest highest standing there are no evil spirits to be exercised no powers of Darkness to be deified or placated whatever evil there may be in an individual&#x27;s thoughts or actions comes from the inside okay so now that disagrees with many Christians uh but not all you know if you look at somebody like Florence Scoville Shin she would agree with uh with what is being said here I believe and um uh you know some Christians uh do believe in kind of the uh manakeean struggle between uh Good and Evil but Larson is really saying here that according to his analysis that uh good is always going to win out um and that the evil is a local and it&#x27;s coming from the inside and not from the outside um now uh eventually he&#x27;s gonna get into a discussion about uh more about miracles but really having to do with healing um let&#x27;s see here uh okay throughout the ages one of the important functions of religion has been to assist human beings in obtaining the benefit of this metaphysical power uh and that&#x27;s [Music] um the sector three uh and even those who deny the reality of metaphysical existence and who therefore cannot admit that the help which is received is metaphysical generally concede that religion does in fact meet a definite human need for support that is not available elsewhere and then he cites a few different uh atheistic scientists to even admit that um and then he calls uh he says but there&#x27;s one area in which events that meet the present-day religious definition of Miracles unusual and uh his quote is uh his definition is unusual and striking events which have religious significance are not uncommon this is the so-called Ministry of healing healing has been an accompaniment of religion throughout all religious history but the religious communities have never been quite sure just how the healing Mission fits in with the uh with other religious objectives an uncertainty that has been accentuated by the existence of non-religious or quasi-religious agencies devoted primarily to Healing even before the establishment of religions in the present day sense there were Witch Doctors medicine men and practitioners of magic who occasionally achieve notable results and the modern scene is full of Healers of all kinds ranging from the equivalent of which doctors to full-fledged religions of healing because of their disapproval of the methods of some of these more aggressive healers the established religious organizations have vacillated between active participation in the healing activities and rejection of the whole Faith healing concept uh the witch doctors interpreted sickness as the result of demons or evil spirits prompted in their malevolent activities by enemies human or other and the objective of remedial procedures was to get rid of the Demons early religions took over both theory and practice and uh the concept of evil spirits has little attraction for the modern mind uh even though the rights of exorcism are still part of the official doctrine of some of the world&#x27;s religious bodies um okay now uh since most of the western religious organizations have abandoned these Automotive doctrines without providing any substitute they have left the door wide open for the professional Faith healers uh realization of this fact has been growing and in the last few years a number of leading Protestant denominations have initiated studies aimed at determining the extent to which Faith healing is compatible with their religious beliefs and he cites a few experts here so-called um the metaphysical aspects of Faith healing are relevant to the subject matter of this present work it is evident however from the findings described in the preceding pages that Faith healing is not inherently a metaphysical process Evolution has not only produced bacteria viruses and other parasites to attack the human body this is biology sector two it has also produced defense mechanisms that cap are capable of repelling Invaders if the mechanisms are operating properly okay so that is you know sector two kind of healing um these healing processes are purely physical remember that sector two is also physical as well as sector one they are both physical uh sector three is metaphysical these healing processes are purely physical and no intervention by metaphysical agencies is necessary all of the healing that is accomplished including those spectacular instances that are classified as Miracles could be accomplished without any kind of outside assistance metaphysical or otherwise if the individual were able to mobilize his full powers for the task meaning that the body could uh actually heal itself completely through sector two and not even needing to deal with sector three however the mere existence of a curable Affliction is definite evidence that The Afflicted individual is not capable of applying his full powers to the task it is commonly recognized among the members of the medical profession that a patient&#x27;s state of mind has a significant effect on the course of his illness a lot the placebo effect um and uh the available information indicates that this loss of control is the most significant feature of cancer um loss of control over certain cells and then he goes into a few different uh studies and uh consults a few different uh doctors and so on on this [Music] um is estimated that more than 50 percent of patients who visit a doctor suffer from mental disturbances this is the background of individual weakness that makes Faith healing possible the Inner Strength the power of control that The Afflicted person cannot generate for himself can be attained with the help of someone in whom or even some idea in which he has confidence whether or that or not that confidence has any solid basis is immaterial uh there&#x27;s a great deal of chicanery in the field of faith faith healing but since the essential element is the confidence it makes no significant difference whether the credentials of the Healer are imaginary or whether the saint ever came within a hundred miles of the shrine from which his healing powers are supposed to emanate the distrust and antagonism that Faith healing has often generated have not been due to any lack of validity um lost my plate there in the faith healing idea itself or to a lack of competence on the part of the healers generally speaking rather it has resulted from the failure on the part of those healers to recognize or at least to admit the limitations to which this type of healing is subject obviously there are many kinds of physical difficulties that the mechanism of the body is not capable of dealing with even when all of its processes are operating normally and Under full control no amount of Love or positive thinking or denial of existence of evil will take a splinter out of an eye but that&#x27;s a kind of an interesting um quote thereby Weatherhead uh furthermore there are equally definite this back to Larson even though less visible limitations on the extent to which outside assistance can compensate for internal deficiencies the tendency on the part of Faith healers to overestimate the capabilities of their technique has therefore led to a high percentage of failures that hasn&#x27;t had a tendency to discredit the entire undertaking as some of the religious organizations are beginning to realize um medicine Psychiatry and Faith healing all have their places uh in the total picture and the best results will be obtained when each is used where it is appropriate with the benefit of uh this assistance healing Miracles can take place whether or not they are recognized as such to this extent therefore the present study confirms the religious assertions as to the existence of biological or healing Miracles it does not agree however that these so-called Miracles involve any suspension of the laws of nature the healing processes including those features that depend on faith of some kind are wholly natural so that&#x27;s kind of the key Point that he&#x27;s getting at is that Faith healing is natural sector three is natural okay we&#x27;ll check you later have a good time see you later</p>
