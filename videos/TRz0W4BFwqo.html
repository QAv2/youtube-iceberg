            <p>I have a present for you outside. Yo, I&#x27;m excited. Okay, what&#x27;s outside? Oh my, bro. He&#x27;s going to explode my house. This stupid pressure plate.</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, he pranked me. All right, you know what? I&#x27;m going to get him back. Put TNT in his house. Yeah, his dog&#x27;s going to die, too.</p>
<p>Oh, how do you like that, huh? Exactly what you did to my house. Yeah, that&#x27;s what I thought. That&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t trick me, dude. And I&#x27;m going to log off. Okay, let&#x27;s log back on to see how he&#x27;s taking it.</p>
<p>And it doesn&#x27;t look like he&#x27;s taking it.</p>
