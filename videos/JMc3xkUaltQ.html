            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>People are dying to keep America’s  biggest secret… literally. For the first time in history, open congressional  hearings have exposed a secret US UFO crash   retrieval program… and the evidence suggests  the government may have killed to protect it.  Grab your tinfoil hats, today on The </p>
<p>Infographics Show, we’re revealing why   UFO whistleblowers are ending up dead or silenced During World War II, the Vatican allegedly helped   U.S. intelligence locate a site once controlled by  Mussolini’s military. Inside was a crashed UFO -   still largely intact, and unmistakably non-human.</p>
<p>This isn’t the plot of a Hollywood blockbuster,   but the claim of whistleblower David Grusch. As  a former senior intelligence official, Grusch had   access to the most sensitive secrets in America  - his duties included preparing the President’s   daily intelligence briefing, a job reserved for  the most trusted in the intelligence community.  But Grusch&#x27;s story pushes the limits of belief - </p>
<p>secret crash retrievals, recovered alien bodies,   even possible direct contact with extraterrestrial  life. He says the U.S. government would kill to   keep it all hidden. And while he claims to </p>
<p>have compelling proof, he can only present   it behind closed doors, inside a classified  Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility,   or SCIF - an ultra-secure room built to block  any form of eavesdropping, where the most guarded   secrets in America are discussed So how can Grusch have evidence   without giving evidence? Well, it&#x27;s all in the   reaction of his claims by members of the </p>
<p>intelligence community and beyond. That   includes the Inspector General of the Intelligence  Community, whose investigation found Grusch’s   claims credible and in need of ‘immediate action’. So what exactly is Grusch saying? And why would it   put his life, and the lives of others, in danger? David Grusch is a combat veteran and former Air   Force intelligence officer who made the </p>
<p>leap to federal service, working with the   National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and  the National Reconnaissance Office. In 2019,   Grusch was assigned to represent his agency  in a Department of Defense investigation into   Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAPs. During </p>
<p>that work, he uncovered evidence of a secret crash   retrieval program - one he was denied access to. Over the next four years, he interviewed around 40   people who claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S.  crash retrieval operations. These individuals   also informed him that on some of these occasions,  non-human biologics - possibly extraterrestrials -   had been recovered along with the craft or remains </p>
<p>of a craft. However, what disturbed Grusch the   most was evidence that crimes had been committed  to keep these programs a secret, including murder.  This is what ultimately led to  Grusch becoming a whistleblower…   and it almost cost him his own life. It wasn’t the existence of a UFO crash retrieval   program that disturbed Grusch, but the evidence </p>
<p>of crimes committed to keep it secret - and by   the fact that it operated outside Congress’s  oversight. He first raised the issue through   internal channels. He briefed his chain of command  at the National geopolitical-intelligence agency,   then the UAP task force he&#x27;d been assigned to </p>
<p>help. When these failed to produce any results,   he turned to the Senate Select Committee on  Intelligence and House Permanent Select Committee   on Intelligence - both responsible for overseeing  all of America&#x27;s ongoing intelligence operations.  These closed-door meetings however also failed  to produce any results, and Grusch, fearing an   abuse of power akin to the CIA MK Ultra tests, </p>
<p>decided to go public. His first stop was the   Inspector General of the Intelligence Community,  responsible for handling internal concerns and   enabling whistleblowers to report dangerous or  illegal actions. The IG labeled his complaint   as being of “urgent concern”, a designation that </p>
<p>prompted an investigation and reporting to both   the House and Congress intelligence committees.  The subsequent investigation discovered that   Grusch&#x27;s claims of both a crash retrieval  program and his harassment by the intelligence   community - including threats of bodily harm  and death - were quote, “credible and urgent”.  But with no action being taken, even as Grusch  was being increasingly harassed, he decided to   go public to protect himself and push for greater </p>
<p>government transparency. His first interview was   The Debrief, though he carefully avoided speaking  on anything that was still classified. Numerous   open-door congressional hearings followed, with  lawmakers finding Grusch’s testimony so compelling   they’ve spent two years requesting a SCIF from </p>
<p>the intelligence community. Without that secure   facility, he can’t share exact details publicly  - doing so would violate his nondisclosure   agreements and risk up to 30 years in prison So is Grusch really telling the truth? And   who&#x27;s getting hurt over what could be  the biggest secret in human history? First, there&#x27;s no objective way of verifying </p>
<p>Grusch&#x27;s story given that the actual details   remain undisclosed. But, we can start to  paint a picture by looking at how certain   groups and individuals have reacted -  along with publicly known information.  We have to start with the inspector general.  We don&#x27;t know how they came to the ‘credible   and urgent’ conclusion - their own report </p>
<p>remains classified. But it&#x27;s reasonable to   assume that having the same clearances as Grusch,  and talked to the witnesses that he had spoken to.   Grusch also claims that he discovered  documentation of said crash retrieval program.   If freed from his non-disclosure agreements, he  could give names of witnesses, dates and places,   and the exact locations of where some of these </p>
<p>retrieved objects were being kept. While the   IG wouldn&#x27;t have had access to these locations,  they likely were able to review at least some of   the documentation that Grusch had discovered. Then there&#x27;s the reaction by the intelligence   community, which for two years has made  the incredible move of denying congress   the use of a SCIF in order to fully </p>
<p>debrief Grusch. If there was no secret,   or if Grusch was delusional, then why deny a  SCIF in order to put the whole thing to rest?  Shortly after Grusch went public, his private  medical records were leaked to the press,   showing that Grusch had suffered from PTSD  and depression as a result of his military   service.</p>
<p>To many, this was an attempt to  discredit him - though it probably would   have worked better if it&#x27;d been revealed Grusch  had schizophrenia or a record of bad conduct.  Part of Grusch&#x27;s claims is that private American  aerospace companies are in on the program to   recover crashed UFOs - in fact, they&#x27;re in on it  by design.</p>
<p>Apparently, way back when the program   officially started in earnest, a decision was made  that the secret was too big for even lawmakers to   handle. Thus, all recovered materials were made  the property of private aerospace giants such as   Lockheed and Boeing. This way, all materials </p>
<p>related to the program would be exempt from   congressional oversight or freedom of information  requests. Technically, the UFO crash retrieval   program was now a private enterprise one. This brings us to the modern private aerospace   response to Grusch’s claims. When pressed by </p>
<p>journalists, these companies have repeatedly   said such questions should be directed  to the Pentagon. It’s a curious answer,   since if nothing existed, they could simply  state, ‘we have no recovered craft or materials. These statements may have been shaped </p>
<p>by legislation then under consideration   in the Senate. In the Fiscal Year 2024 National  Defense Authorization Act, lawmakers added several   UFO-related provisions. Chief among them was  the creation of a National Archives UAP Records   Collection, a central repository for all federal </p>
<p>reports on UAP incidents - past and present. A   presidentially appointed special counsel would  review older documents to decide if declassifying   them could threaten national security The second provision was a prohibition   on all funding for UAP-related activities unless  such activities were under the direct oversight   of congress.</p>
<p>This includes any materials or  other UAP-related evidence or discoveries.   This was an attempt to curb any further  illegal operation of UAP programs that   evaded congressional oversight, and came with  serious penalties for anyone caught doing so. The last provision however is the most important </p>
<p>one - and one that was never passed as it was   voted down by key congressional members. Included  in both the 2023 and 2024 National Defense   Authorization Act was a key provision that would  have enacted eminent domain over all UAP-related   materials held by any organization receiving  any funding from the US government.</p>
<p>In essence,   this means that private american aerospace would  have had to hand over their recovered UAPs and   UAP materials if enacted into law, or face  serious legal prosecution. The provision passed   the House but was struck down in the Senate,  with Republicans Mike Johnson, Mike Turner,   Mike Rogers, and Mitch McConnell playing key </p>
<p>roles in blocking it - and in stonewalling   other UAP-related legislation Their efforts significantly   weakened the 2024 provision to establish a UAP  Records Collection in the National Archives.   The original draft required releasing all UAP  records dating back to just after World War   II. In the final version, disclosure is no longer </p>
<p>mandatory - documents can remain classified if a   committee deems them vital to national security Aerospace’s response to Grusch’s claims makes   more sense given the growing push at the time  to use eminent domain on all UAP materials. If   they had publicly stated they possessed none, and  then the government seized them, they could face   serious legal jeopardy - making their referral to </p>
<p>the Pentagon for comment far more understandable  The repercussions of Grusch&#x27;s claims being  true could be disastrous for public trust   in its own government. Perhaps this is why  someone within the government and private   aerospace has apparently been attempting  to silence whistleblowers and researchers.  And before we continue,, we&#x27;d like to state </p>
<p>that everyone at The Infographics Show is happy,   healthy, and has no plans to leave  the chat… just for the record.  Grusch says he was immediately harassed  and retaliated against by members of   the intelligence community to keep him from  speaking to Congress. According to journalist   Leslie Kean - who broke the 2017 Navy UFO </p>
<p>videos story - the escalating harassment,   including threatening phone calls to his  home, ultimately pushed him to go public  Luis Daniel Elizondo, another high profile  whistleblower and former intelligence official,   has echoed claims of intense threats and  harassment by members of the intelligence   community. In 2024, Elizondo stated while on </p>
<p>The Good Trouble Show podcast, that quote,   “I am not prone to accidents… I&#x27;m not abusing  drugs. I am not engaged in any illicit activities.   If something happens to me or my family members  in the future, you will know what happened.”  This came amid an intense campaign against  him and other whistleblowers after the 2017   Navy UFO videos, leaked by Elizondo </p>
<p>himself. Republican Congressman Tim   Burchett took the threats seriously enough to  push for stronger whistleblower protections  In an interview with NewsNation, whistleblower  Jake Barber described just how severe the threats   had become. When he went to congressionally </p>
<p>appointed investigators for help, they instead   asked him for help protecting themselves. Jake Barber&#x27;s own whistleblowing was spurred   on by his alleged involvement in part of the crash  retrieval program. Never officially &#x27;briefed in&#x27;,   Barber worked as a helicopter pilot for an elite  unit in the US military.</p>
<p>During his service, he   flew several missions to recover anomalous craft  or debris. It was the recovery of an ‘egg-shaped   craft’ that seemed to have a psychological  effect on him, making him realize what was   flying around. Per Barber, as his helicopter </p>
<p>began to lift the attached egg-shaped craft,   he was overcome with a feeling of sadness that he  felt was emanating from the craft itself. It was   so disruptive that he began to cry to the point it  interfered with his ability to pilot his aircraft.   Interestingly, other whistleblowers claim that  the UAP phenomenon includes a psychic component,   and today Barber is part of Skywatcher - a group </p>
<p>that&#x27;s documented themselves using psychics to   successfully make UAP appear on camera. Barber even claims the U.S. government   regularly uses psychics to interact with UAPs  - and sometimes force them to land. For those   familiar with the government’s history </p>
<p>with psychics, this aligns with accounts   from figures like Joe McMoneagle, a remote  viewer who received the Legion of Merit for   his work in U.S. intelligence operations. President Jimmy Carter himself commented   on the use of psychics by the CIA.  In an interview with GQ magazine,   he recalled the crash of a small American plane </p>
<p>somewhere deep in the African jungle. After   satellites and ground teams failed to locate it,  the CIA turned to a psychic - who provided exact   latitude and longitude coordinates. The plane  was found precisely where they said it would be.  What&#x27;s worrying about Barber&#x27;s claims is that </p>
<p>he too professes knowledge of murders carried   out against whistleblowers and those who got  too close to the truth. According to Barber,   congressionally-appointed investigators  looking into the validity of the crash   retrieval program were so scared by reprisals  that they asked him for tips on how to protect   themselves.</p>
<p>However, this has not been  verified outside of Barber&#x27;s account.  If what Barber says is true, then this means  that a secret cabal within the US military,   intelligence, and private aerospace is exercising  the power over life and death in extrajudicial   killings. If true, a decades-long legacy of </p>
<p>murders might be a big enough secret to resist all   attempts to expose it - nevermind the existence  of alien life or recovered alien technology.  It&#x27;s difficult to find direct evidence of these  murders outside of the claims of whistleblowers.   What we do know is how far someone in  government is willing to go to discredit   UFO researchers and whistleblowers -  and completely destroy their lives.</p>
<p>Paul Bennewitz is a name spoken cautiously  by members of the UFO research community.   Bennewitz lived near Kirtland Air Force Base in  the late 70s to early 80s, and had always had a   strong interest in UFOs. After repeatedly  seeing mysterious lights over the base,   he began monitoring it with radio gear and </p>
<p>video cameras, capturing multiple anomalous   events. His mistake was contacting the  base’s Office of Special Investigations  The public story is that the air force was  concerned Bennewitz was picking up data on   secret air force projects, and thus began a  disinformation campaign targeting him directly.   They began to meet with Bennewitz, feeding him </p>
<p>false narratives about aliens and even giving   him fake classified documents. The Air Force  even staged UFO sightings by using various   aircraft at times that Bennewitz was told to  be on the lookout by his &#x27;insider sources&#x27;. The flood of faked evidence drove Bennewitz </p>
<p>to have a psychotic breakdown from the stress,   resulting in him being hospitalized  in 1988. Bennewitz, who until then had   been heavily involved in UFO and cattle  mutilation research, withdrew from the   UFO field entirely, dying quietly in 2003. The Bennewitz disinformation campaign ruined   one man&#x27;s life, and has been compared to similar </p>
<p>disinformation campaigns throughout history - such   as the one that fed fake invasion plans of Europe  to the Nazis during World War II. As has been   repeatedly noted, the best disinformation always  contains some truth, after all, the phenomenon   that Bennewitz initially recorded was also  being seen around the world far from US bases.  But one element from Bennewitz&#x27;s disinformation </p>
<p>would ring true years later in the 1990s - and   lead to what could be the first publicly known  case of a UFO-related assassination plot.  Phil Schneider claimed to have worked with  the US government building deep underground   military bases across the southwest. IIn the  1990s, Schneider began speaking publicly about   one construction project, claiming workers </p>
<p>encountered hostile aliens already living   underground. He said he lost several fingers and  suffered other injuries in the confrontation.  In 1996, Schneider was found dead in his  apartment, a rubber surgical catheter tied   tightly around his neck. The circumstances </p>
<p>immediately raised alarms among skeptics.   Schneider was missing several fingers, had limited  shoulder mobility from an injury he linked to the   alien firefight, and was battling advanced  cancer along with other chronic illnesses.  But the timing of the death is also claimed to not  be a coincidence. Schneider was discovered dead   shortly after making a series of talks on specific </p>
<p>black budget programs he said the government was   operating. Lecture materials, photographs,  and other personal papers were all stolen   from his house when the body was discovered. However, Schneider remains a divisive figure   even amongst the UAP-believing community. For </p>
<p>starters, there is no direct evidence that   Schneider ever worked for the government. While he  showed various badges and IDs allegedly issued to   him on these programs, none could be verified as  authentic. Schneider presented photos of massive   tunneling machines and underground facilities </p>
<p>he claimed to have taken. However, experts   noted his descriptions of the tunneling methods  didn’t match any known engineering techniques.  The Schneider case remains unsolved, and a  potential murder may itself not be directly   linked to his alleged whistleblowing. Perhaps </p>
<p>due to his failing health, he paid or asked   someone to help him ease his suffering. It&#x27;s difficult to nail down specific deaths   linked to US government cover-up efforts. But the  precedent is certainly there given what we know   about CIA activities during MK Ultra and other  top secret projects during the early Cold War.   In fact, it’s exactly these CIA operations </p>
<p>- some ending in recorded deaths and   psychological breakdowns - that led to laws  requiring all U.S. intelligence activities   to operate under direct congressional oversight. And yet, more whistleblowers are coming forward.   They’re backed by a growing network of former  special forces and intelligence colleagues.   Together, they allege a program that not only </p>
<p>operates outside congressional oversight,   but openly violates the law  through extrajudicial killings  If this is true, then a secret cabal within  U.S. intelligence and aerospace is hiding   the existence of alien life from humanity.  They’ve also subverted American democracy   itself - while holding funding and technologies </p>
<p>that could make them an unstoppable threat.  If that’s the case, then aliens  may be the least of our concerns.  If whistleblowers are dying under suspicious  circumstances, what’s being hidden could be   even more disturbing.
