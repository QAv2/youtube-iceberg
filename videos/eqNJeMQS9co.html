            <p>a little knowledge is a dangerous thing and this was my concern when David Crush started talking about an event where the aliens were murdering people I&#x27;m going I know that incident that was us and I don&#x27;t think he understands because he&#x27;s a young man the problem of having a little bit of information on this and thinking you know a lot is that you&#x27;re going to step into a booby trap and the booby trap is being played by the very unconstitutional criminals that people like him were trying to uncover he was just in the news yeah came out that there was a down craft we retrieved it with bodies correct yes my concern is when you go from that to then falling into the clutches of folks in the UFO Community who then start giving you these Tall Tales of all these horrible things the aliens have been doing I&#x27;m going yes but you haven&#x27;t been read in to that part of the project so this is like a stinking on you pill 500 layers of this onion back and there&#x27;s 500 more</p>
