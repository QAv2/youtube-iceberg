            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel uh I&#x27;m Thomas and I do educational videos on this channel uh mostly of the uh kind of the variety of the esoteric and obscure but also uh I was just looking at a a different article written on the same topic uh they call them the UN uncommitted investigators these are generally like amateur scientists who um you know are not being paid by some large University or research organization they don&#x27;t compete for Grants they don&#x27;t uh have any um anyone else&#x27;s agendas to comply with they are out for the truth and as a result they have done all their work and they never got paid nobody ever knew they were doing it just or just a small group and many of these people are crackpots but many of them are you know onto something and put together a huge Treasure Trove of great information and great research on things that very few people know about and so I uh I&#x27;ve tried to discern the crackpots from the true uncommitted investigators and to bring to light some of the great theories that I&#x27;ve come across over the course of my life today is a video number 194 that we&#x27;re doing on Dewey Larson and his reciprocal system of theory and Larson lived in the 20th century died in 1990 spent about 60 years developing his reciprocal system of theory the basic idea is that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it is made out of motion matter and energy are merely two different kinds of motion motion is the relationship between space and time example speed the car is moving 15 miles per hour 15 miles of space in one hour of time that is a relationship between space and time that is speed a motion most most people would uh grant me that speed is a kind of motion and speed is a relationship between space and time but not only speed but really all other quantities that are uh you know of the uh mechanical or uh physical in science are motions such as acceleration force pressure like I said matter energy uh viscosity fluidity compressibility these are all forms of motion and as a result are all relationships between space and time and uh so Larson has an entirely different notation uh for his system everything every quantity can be reduced to space-time terms and so you can kind of uh create your equations based on only time and space and you don&#x27;t have to have your MKS system or anything like that it&#x27;s just time and space and that makes it very easy to make sure if your equation is correct and so on now it&#x27;s a little bit more complicated than that because uh first of all space and time both have their coordinate aspects we know that space has a coordinate aspect XYZ coordinates space is three or more Dimensions um you know like I said XYZ coordinates euclidean geometry and or beyond that possibly but what we don&#x27;t generally recognize is that time also has its coordinate aspect so there are three or more dimensions of time as well and then space and time also both have their clock aspects we generally recognize the clock aspect of time time is always getting later and later and later it&#x27;s progressing it&#x27;s flowing um and this is what Larson calls a scalar motion this is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no particular direction or you could just say it has every direction and you would Envision this by using a balloon and a magic marker putting a bunch of dots on the balloon and blowing up the balloon this is an outward scalar motion the dots are all moving away from each other but in no particular direction and if you sucked in the balloon then the dots would all be moving toward each other that is an inward scalar motion and [Music] we recognize that time has that quality of of the clock that it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later but in no particular direction but we generally don&#x27;t recognize that space also has that quality that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart even though that was demonstrated by the Hubble telescope over almost 100 years ago where they showed that they might have used some kind of sleight of hand to show it but they purported to show that all of the galaxies are moving away from each other the distant galaxies are all moving away from each other that is the progression of space and time also have uh what is called their discrete units space and time do not come continuous they are come they come in chunks very small chunks but chunks nonetheless there is a minimum unit of time and there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space um and exactly one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so that really sets up three boundaries for this universe of Larson&#x27;s sets up uh three boundaries based on units one unit so the uh one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light the speed of light is what Larson calls unit speed and so this unit speed is a boundary between two separate universes or sectors of a universe which Larson calls the material sector and the cosmic sector the material sector is the sector that we know about and that our scientists have measured and observed and this is the universe where the speed uh where things are moving slower than the speed of light but we also have what Larson calls the cosmic universe and this is where things are moving faster than the speed of light and the speed of light is actually the minimum speed of the that universe that is the universe that Einstein didn&#x27;t know anything about nor do you know most of the other mainstream scientists out there um and then within each one of those two sectors there is another boundary that&#x27;s called the unit within the material sector you have the unit space boundary and within the cosmic sector you have the unit time boundary so once you go inside of one unit of space you don&#x27;t have space anymore because space only comes in units so you have this world of time which Larson calls the time region and then in the other sector in the cosmic sector um you have this region where you can go less than the one unit of time and that is what Larson calls the space region um now when you in the material sector you basically have coordinate space and clock time this is what we&#x27;re familiar with three dimensions of space or more and then uh progressing time but in the cosmic sector you have three dimensions of time and progressing space so even though we know nothing about this Cosmic sector we can extrapolate what we do know about the material sector onto the cosmic sector by simply inverting the roles of space and time and putting the role of space into the role of time over here so that makes the reciprocal system very powerful because it basically doubles our uh our knowledge about things just by simple extrapolation and using that reciprocal relationship okay um now there&#x27;s obviously a bazillion other things to talk about the reciprocal system but we are looking at Larson&#x27;s 1979 book that is called uh nothing but motion which is primarily on Atomic physics and we are in Chapter 13 which is called uh physical constants and Larson is kind of trying to readdress the situation of constants going through some of the uh constants and showing how many of them in Legacy science are fudge factors they&#x27;re just numbers that they use in order to make the equations balance out or make them correct in terms of the numerical value such as the gravitational constant and he is putting so he is putting everything in like such like the gravitational equation into units of time and space and then see how they balance out so we&#x27;re going to take over kind of in the middle here we&#x27;re at the very end of the chapter I believe or toward the end of the chapter maybe we&#x27;ll finish it today but so we will start up uh where he&#x27;s talking about the gravitational constant and he&#x27;s already raked it over the coals a little bit but uh we&#x27;ll start up right here the dimensions that are mistakenly assigned to this term this ratio of 1 over N squared uh belong to a term whose existence has not been recognized because it has unit value and therefore does not enter into the numerical calculation in order to put the as if gravitational interaction on the same basis as a real interaction we have to express it in terms of the action of a force on a resistance not as the action of a mass on a resistance and since the dimensions of the mass term cancel so that the gravitational Mass enters the equation only as a dimensionless number the force of gravitation has to be expressed in actual Force terms that is T over s squared that is the T the time space representation of force the correct dimensional form of the equation is then the quantity s to the third power over t to the third power gravitation times t to the third power over s to the third power which is Mass times T over s to the second power which is force equals T over s to the second power turning now to the numerical magnitudes we note that while the dimensions of the M M1 term cancel out the magnitudes do not every unit of mass is both a unit of s to the third power over t to the third power gravity and a unit of t to the third power over s to the third power Mass each in its own proper context since the units are independent the effective magnitude of the as if action of M units of gravitation against M1 units of inertial resistance is m times M1 however expressing both of the mass terms in conventional units introduces a numerical error as only the inertial mass term is counterbalanced by a conventional Mass magnitude on the other side of the equation to compensate for this error a corresponding inverse Factor must be introduced into the gravitational constant there is no error if the gravitational mass is expressed in natural units as the value 1 does not require any counterbalancing term the relation between the natural and conventional units therefore determines the magnitude of the necessity are of the necessary correction factor one gram is 6.02486 times 10 to the 23 units of inertial mass one mole uh t to the third power over s to the third power Mass the reciprocal of this number is 1.65979 times 10 to the minus 24th but only one-sixth of the total number of mass units is effective in the gravitational interaction because this as if interaction takes place in only one dimension and in only one of the two directions in this dimension the total number of gravitational units s to the third power over t to the third power corresponding to an effective mass of one gram is therefore 9.95 times 10 to the minus 24th uh which he got by multiplying by six expressing this mass as one unit overstates the numerical value and a correction of this magnitude must therefore be included as a component of the gravitational constant a small additional correction is required because of the effect of the secondary Mass gravitation and inertia are inversely related relative to the primary mass that is the primary mass is p over P plus s units of gravitational mass and also p over P plus s units of inertial mass where P and S are the primary and secondary masses respectively the product of a unit of gravitational mass and a unit of inertial mass is therefore one over one plus s the quantity squared units of primary Mass where the result is expressed in terms of inertial mass another one plus s factor is introduced the total effect of the secondary mass is then the introduction of a factor of 1.019299 applying this factor to the value 9.95874 times 10 to the minus 24th we obtain 1.015093 times 10 to the minus 23rd replacing the 1 over s squared distance term by a t over s squared Force term has the effect of introducing a Time Dimension which must be expressed in natural units to avoid creating a numerical unbalance the numerical value of the natural unit of time is 1.52 0655 times 10 to the minus 16. offsets in part the errors in the mass term this the net correction to be made is 1.015093 times 10 to the minus 23rd divided by the natural unit of time end amounts to 6.67537 times 10 to the minus 8 which you may know that it is the gravitational constant in the CGS System of Units looking now at the question of conversion to a different system of units the issue that initiated the re-study of the situation we find that a change from CGS to MKS units in the conventional form of the equation that last equation or a preceding equation results in a change of 10 to the minus 6 in the mass term 10 to the minus fourth in the distance term and 10 to the minus fifth in the force term a change of 10 to the minus third in the gravitational constant is then required for a balance in the theoretical equation 13.3 the net effect of a change in the system of units is confined to the relation of the natural and conventional units of mass as can be seen from the explanation that has been given the gravitational constant is proportional to the ratio of these units changing the conventional unit from grams to kilograms Alters this ratio by 10 to the minus 3. the gravitational constant is then Changed by the same amount disagrees with the result obtained from equation 13.1 those are who are familiar with the first edition will have noticed that the values of the natural unit of inertial mass and related quantities as given earlier in this chapter are larger than the values given in the original publication at the time of the original investigation it seemed clear that a factor of 1 over 3 entered into the mass situation in some way and there appeared to be sufficient justification for applying this factor to the size of the basic unit as brought out in the preceding paragraphs We Now find that the one over three factor is a result of the one-dimensional nature of the as if gravitational interaction this Factor has therefore been eliminated from the mass units as a result the natural unit of inertial mass as defined in this Edition is three times the value given in the first edition with a small adjustment to reflect the results of the continuing studies of the details of the phenomena involved the use of these larger units has no effect on the physical relations involving inertial mass as the expressions of these relations are balanced equations in which the mass terms are in equilibrium with the terms representing quantities derived from Mass and that is the end of the chapter uh the next chapter chapter 14 is called Cosmic elements but I will just conclude by saying don&#x27;t get discouraged if you didn&#x27;t understand any of this I didn&#x27;t understand that much of it and I&#x27;ve probably read this chapter five times and um you know this is something that you just read to to figure how you know get what you can get out of it and obviously if you run a really understand this you&#x27;re gonna have to read it over and over and over and study all of the equations and figure out you know go through all the algebra that he is is putting on here and you know you&#x27;re probably going to have to have some kind of table with you that&#x27;s got all these constants listed and you have to be very familiar with all that stuff it&#x27;s not necessary to understand the reciprocal system I think it&#x27;s important just to give it color just to give it a sense of this is what Larson is going through to get to his conclusions his conclusions are are uh not coming out of no place this is where they&#x27;re coming so if you really want to check him this is how you check him by going over what he put down okay we will start up with chapter 14 tomorrow thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
