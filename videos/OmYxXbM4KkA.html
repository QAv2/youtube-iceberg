            <p>here&#x27;s a big question for you uh uh Thomas beardon had said something about scaler waves proliferating basically whatever it comes from one point if you put multiple cables they all get the same power at the end um I don&#x27;t understand the concept that well yes um we have proved this uh it&#x27;s now 10 years ago that I had gave that I gave a lesson at the technical University in Berlin and uh we I had a lot of uh groups using my experimental kit and they did all these experiments with one transmitter and a lot of receivers uh but at the end if you uh add all these receive Powers it is well just what is transmitted if you have one more receiver this will get no energy so it&#x27;s always balanced energy we could have the chance to to um collect energy from the environment because it&#x27;s an open system and if there is a source in our uh environment then we could uh which has the right frequency and which has the right phase angle then we uh May um uh use this energy and collect and then we have more energy received than we are transmitting this is right but at the end if you have calculated all transmitted and all received energy the balance of energy ever is uh um accepted and is fulfilled okay so if you were to send off for example if you&#x27;re talking about mostly Wireless right he he was talking about if you had wires and you said okay that you would each wire would have the same amount that the original Source had in it okay that&#x27;s interesting concept so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying then is if you have the right phase angle and everything that probably could act be accurate that&#x27;s which is an amazing concept you know I am a believer that we do have a thic Energy Zero Point or D C or whatever you want to call it and that it&#x27;s just a matter of using it properly and and collecting it right so scaler is definitely something that at least implies an understanding yeah of you know the Zero Point Energy so well you speak about um you speak about Scala you say uh I always have problems with this because uh we have to um pay attention that a Scala wave is not the same like a scaler field uh if you say only scaler nobody will know whether you use field or or wave because it&#x27;s nearly the opposite because a scaler field has no Direction uh and a scaler wave has a direction and this is um defined by the wave equation and uh this is why in all my all of my books I&#x27;ve I start with the definition I say first well this is the wave equation the wave equation is is up to La Blas and the laas operator may be separated in two parts and one part is describing uh the Virgin uh of a vector which is a scalar and the gradient of a scalar which is a vector again so it has a direction and the other one is the electromagnetic wave curl Cur well we know this and uh we have but we have to accept this and not all people uh know about this different and then uh it could come to confusion yes I can understand that yeah all right there thank you for your time</p>
