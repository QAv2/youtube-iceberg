            <p>oh all right how&#x27;s everybody doing today I&#x27;m Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos uh we are in the middle of uh learning about the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory a system of theory basically a Theory of Everything developed by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century uh starting way back in about 1930 uh and then he um work this system out to the point where he boiled it down to two fundamental postulates back in the 1950s and then he spent the the rest of his life uh writing books on uh those topics and um he died back in 1990 and since then um a number of people have attempted to uh kind of fine-tune and uh update and popularize his work uh to a limited success therefore at this point almost nobody knows about the reciprocal system that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m teaching it trying to resurrect uh Larson&#x27;s Theory as well as um you know uh develop a little a little bit more and uh just to put it out there because I think it&#x27;s a great Theory um it&#x27;s done a lot for me and uh it&#x27;s it really changes the game because uh no longer does a uh layperson like me or you have to rely on a bunch of pointy-headed scientists to tell us what&#x27;s going on we can figure it out ourselves with the tools that Larson gave us okay now his first postulate which is the most important is that the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time then his second uh and final postulate for the purposes of his physical Theory uh which is uh a subject is some dispute by some of the people who&#x27;ve moved along with his theory is that the physical Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean now I would say uh the the main part there that is in dispute is the geometry euclidean geometry uh Dr Bruce paret who&#x27;s one of the main are probably the main uh popular um you know uh refiners of Larson&#x27;s Theory uh has changed that to uh projective geometry a euclidean geometry is a subset of uh projective geometry so it isn&#x27;t really like a you know uh a mistake it&#x27;s just a broadening of the theory uh and also in the First Fundamental postulate I would in my opinion I would say where he says uh the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions I would probably say three or four dimensions but um that first postulate is what we have to look at okay so he&#x27;s saying that the universe is composed entirely of motion not matter and not energy uh as the ancient Greeks and Einstein uh respectively would say but motion motion underlies both matter and energy and um a lot of times when Larson was asked about it later in his life he he said that he what he really kind of is getting at is change not not specifically motion but change in three dimensions and that this kind of motion that he&#x27;s talking about is called scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that doesn&#x27;t have a direction it just has a magnitude or you could think of it as having um all directions no specific Direction it just has magnitude the way that you can visualize this is if you take a balloon before you blow it up and or just maybe just blow it up a little bit and uh then take a magic marker and paint up a bunch of dots on the balloon and then as you blow up the balloon you will notice that each one of the dots is moving away from each other they&#x27;re all moving away from each other but they aren&#x27;t moving in any specific direction or really they&#x27;re moving in in many many different directions um no specific Direction and then if you deflate the balloon then you will discover that all the dots are moving toward each other those are both scalar motions one is a scalar motion outward and the other is a scalar motion inward okay so um now in Larson&#x27;s uh in so in Einstein&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe in Larson&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is the midpoint or null or neutral point of the universe and half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light half is moving faster now this gets in this gets into what we&#x27;re talking about today because we are looking at his final book that&#x27;s called beyond space and time this is uh came out after he died and it has to do with a metaphysical phenomena and and the social sciences so most of his all of his earlier books are on the hard Sciences physics and chemistry and astronomy in particular he&#x27;s got a couple books on economics that we&#x27;ll look at eventually here too we&#x27;ll look at all those books eventually uh but we we&#x27;re we&#x27;re going with this um Beyond space and time which is on metaphysics his final book and it&#x27;s mostly uh you know philosophy and religion and psychology um and um in this book uh it&#x27;s important to understand where Larson&#x27;s coming from with this uh speed of light boundary uh between two separate universes which he calls the material Universe the universe is moving slower than the speed of light and the cosmic Universe which is moving faster than the speed of light now in Larson&#x27;s estimation we went through this in chapters five six and seven of this book The Life is basically a union of those two different sectors of the universe of of units from those different sectors um but it can&#x27;t occur until the first sector the inanimate sector the sector of chemistry uh you know atoms and molecules until those atoms and molecules aggregate until they get to a uh greatest complexity that is known the greatest the most complex molecule out there is DNA and DNA is the least that is required to accommodate a life unit um a control unit from the cosmic sector and so when that control unit um then takes part with the material unit it forms a life unit and this life unit then um also becomes more can become more and more complex and once it gets to be its most complex which Larson says is uh the intelligent human being then it can also then be taken over by a another control unit from sector three is what he calls sector three is kind of like Larson&#x27;s word for God and um sector 3 is the uh is the universe that is beyond space and time so you would think of it more as like this boundary between the two universes the the speed of light this realm at the speed of light is where time and space um which are reciprocal aspects of motion uh they reason they resolve each other and they really eliminate each other and uh it just becomes one everything becomes one and that is this uh metaphysical unit that he talks about so at a certain point the human intelligent human can be uh controlled by a um unit from sector three and he calls that level three so um and basically sector three and sector two are in um competition with one another um so that that&#x27;s where the human being is is in a competition from uh between the human uh survival motive the by the purely biological survival motive and this ethical component that he calls from uh sector three okay now we&#x27;re gonna look a little bit here at chapter uh chapter nine uh which is called communication local and our communication General chapter eight was communication local and uh he&#x27;s talking about yeah ESP phenomenon as part of this sector three thing um in the light of the new information that is now available ESP is completely in harmony with physical existence and it is a normal feature of human life it is contrary to the rules of the game in the biological world to be sure just as the development of complex biological organisms through evolutionary processes is contrary to the rules of the game in the inanimate world but the inanimate and the biological do not constitute the whole of existence we will find in the course of our investigation that many aspects of human behavior are just as foreign to the principles that govern physical activity both living and non-living as clairvoyance uh it&#x27;s a particular type of ESP they seem less foreign only because they are more familiar an interesting application of ESP takes place in gambling it is not generally appreciated that gambling isn&#x27;t experimenting clairvoyance specifically the anticipatory or precognition type of clairvoyance The Gambler is trying to anticipate what will happen on the next turn of the wheel the next flip of a card or the next roll of the dice in just as real a sense as the subject in the parapsychology laboratory who is specifically being tested for ESP ability the Striking fact about these unintentional ESP experiments and the gambling establishments is that they arrive at essentially it&#x27;s the same results from the qualitative standpoint as the experiments that are deliberately aimed at one aspect or another of the ESP phenomenon the action at a roulette roulette table for it instance has a close resemblance to the conventional ESP experiments the general run of the results in both cases is close so that which uh close to that which would be expected on the basis of pure chance but occasionally a player has a run of phenomenal luck in which the normal principles of probability seem to be totally inoperative such An Occurrence is rare but still frequent enough to make it necessary for the management of the establishment to impose some special limits or other rules to prevent undue losses like the successes in the analogous ESP experiments the run of luck in gambling generally tapers off after a time and at the start of a session and and at the end of a session the results are usually less favorable than at the start furthermore as in ESP tests the favorable run cannot be deliberately repeated no matter how much of an effort is made to duplicate the original conditions the general conclusions that can be drawn from both types of experiments are one no evidence of a general ESP capability has been found that too there is some evidence of uncertain validity suggesting that a substantial number of individuals may have a small ESP ability three a few persons are spectacularly successful in demonstrating ESP on some occasions and four the high-level ESP capability is erratic and not subject to voluntarily voluntary control by any methods now known okay so the success ratio is is substantially lower in the gambling establishments than in the planned experiments but this does not affect the significance of the results so far as the existence of ESP phenomena is concerned as long as some persons are able to demonstrate ESP capability at some times this confirms the existence of ESP Justice definitely have as if the success rate had been higher okay now um I want to skip down here a little bit more again he&#x27;s going through his normal uh literature uh survey where he looks at all these different philosophers who have um chimed in on the ESP phenomena but now he kind of summarizes the first point to which these authors testify is that the knowledge comes suddenly uh three of them actually use the word sudden like a number speak uh of a flash marginal calls it a leap Holton and roller call it a jump the second point is they stress is that the manner in which ESP comes is spontaneous and wholly unexplainable miraculous say two of the writers a term that is all the more significant because it comes from men who do not believe in miracles the origin is incomprehensible inscrutable irrational others assert uh now uh these are exactly the characteristics of Clairvoyance the knowledge comes suddenly in a physically unexplainable Manner and every one of the descriptive words listed in the preceding paragraph would have been equally as applicable to the Clairvoyance phenomena as to inductive insight these two phenomena are simply two manifestations of the same thing communication of information from sector three existences to the control units that exercise Direction Over the human organisms we have deduced theoretically that such communication should exist now we find two phenomena in which it does exist Clairvoyance and then inductive insight um uh this existence is evident not only because the manner in which the information is received is exactly what it should be on the basis of this explanation but also because in the case of inductive insight there is no physical way in which the information could have been received it could not have come through any mechanistic channels any method of reception uh available to man as a biological mechanism so he&#x27;s really attempting to generalize this Clairvoyance phenomena to include what he calls inductive insight and uh if you recall back a few episodes uh several episodes uh we were talking about induction that this is the opposite of deduction induction you know where you have deduction you have a general a general statement and then you apply it to specific things induction is the opposite where you have a specific um thing that you know about and you attempt to apply it to a general situation so you know the example that I was giving is if you throw you throw a ball across the room the ball hits the ground well you say okay I threw the ball and the ball hit the ground that&#x27;s uh you know it&#x27;d be a stretch to say that anytime I throw a ball it&#x27;s gonna hit the ground but if you do it a thousand times and it hits the ground every time then you have more of a uh you know legitimacy or validity to be able to say well every single time I throw the ball it hits the ground now um you know all you would need to to destroy that is if you threw a helium balloon and then it went up then you know that would destroy your hypothesis and you would have to come up with something else you know you would have to say well anytime I throw something that&#x27;s you know not a helium balloon or something you know so anyway the inductive insight is um basically when you ask a question it&#x27;s he uses these words in uh interchangeably um ins insight intuition um and um those uh those are I guess and Revelation as well those are Communications directly from sector three the inductive Insight is really activated by wondering you wonder how things are and then eventually this sector three uh comes to you and it gives you an answer now you have to as Larson says uh deduction and induction aren&#x27;t on the same footing uh induction also requires verification you have to verify your inductions so just getting that getting that Intuition or that Insight um is not uh totally sufficient you have to be able to um confirm or or verify your intuition because you may be even though the intuition is always right because everything from sector three is always right but you may be translating the information from sector three incorrectly and that&#x27;s why you need to verify so um so that&#x27;s kind of what Larson is doing here he&#x27;s attempting to spread this kind of idea of this sudden um Revelation revelatory uh Clairvoyance or a flash of uh into a more General type of situation so we&#x27;ll be talking about that next time and uh have a great day we&#x27;ll see you soon</p>
