            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>If you believe we have crashed craft, uh, stated earlier, do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? As I&#x27;ve stated publicly already in my News Nation interview, uh, biologics came with some of these recoveries.</p>
<p>Yeah. Um, were they, I guess human or non-human biologics? Non-human. And that was the assessment of people, uh, with direct knowledge on the program I</p>
<p>talked to that are currently still on the program. And was this documentary evidence, this video photos eyewitness, like how would that be determined? The specific documentation I would have to talk to you in a skiff about.</p>
