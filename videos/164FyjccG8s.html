            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel uh that is geared toward looking at different theories of everything and uh maybe doing a little bit of comparing and contrasting showing how they&#x27;re probably all talking about the same thing which is this wonderful universe that we&#x27;re in and uh today is the 250 second video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and Mr Larson was an engineer who lived in the 20th century and died in the 20th century in 1990. and uh was actually born in the 19th century in 1898. spent about 60 years of that time working out his reciprocal system the basic idea is that we live in a universe made entirely out of motion not matter not energy but motion and for Larson uh motion was the relationship between space and time so space and time are not the container of the universe rather they are the contents of the universe uh every kind of motion is a relationship between space and time and so that includes uh all the kinds of motion that you recognize as scientific quantities such as speed acceleration force energy matter viscosity and fluidity electrical capacitance electrical current electric charge magnetic flux permeability permittivity pressure these are all fractions where time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator this serves as a wonderful check on Larson&#x27;s system you can always multiply out the time space relationships to get um your equivalencies and so uh it works very well for providing checks and proofs of Larson&#x27;s system now uh there it does become a little bit complex because there are some constraints to space and time and some parallels space and time are reciprocals of each other that&#x27;s basically what it means to be the numerator and denominator refraction for example the reciprocal of one-third is three over one okay so that that uh you know you&#x27;re inverting the fraction and to get the reciprocal um now uh in Larson&#x27;s Larson basically summed up his reciprocal system in two postulates that he came out with in the late 1950s and from there he derived an entire theoretical Universe by deduction by deducing this universe from the his original postulates the first postulate is that the universe is made out of motion uh motion is the relationship between space and time space uh this is not quoting this is just paraphrasing but um um space and time uh come in three or more Dimensions uh three exactly he would say three dimensions and uh in they come in um uh discrete units and they uh also both have their scalar aspects meaning motion that has a direction or has a magnitude but has no Direction so basically uh the first thing that Larson says is that they are coordinate meaning they have three or more Dimensions like coordinate space and coordinate time we&#x27;re accustomed to the idea of a coordinate space x y z coordinates but that also adheres to time and then we are accustomed to clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and later but we are not so accustomed to the idea of clock space that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but the Hubble telescope did um demonstrate that all of the uh or observe at least that all of the distant galaxies are getting further and further and further apart they are receding from each other that is the progression of space or the flow of space and then time and space come in discrete units meaning that there is a minimum unit of space and the minimum unit of time if you do not have one full unit of space then you do not have space and that means by elimination that you only have time and if you do not have a full unit of time then you only have space by elimination as well and uh if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time then you have the speed of light and so this sets up three separate boundaries in Larson&#x27;s Universe first you have the unit speed boundary one unit of space in one unit of time equals unit speed one over one equals one unit speed is the speed of light and the speed of light is a boundary are really the midpoint of the universe half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light Larson calls this the material sector half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls this the cosmic sector and this sector is the sector that the Legacy scientists know very very little if anything about Einstein in fact said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe showing that he knew absolutely nothing about the cosmic sector which is what Larson calls the sector that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light but now within the material and Cosmic sectors you also have a what is called a unit bound unit boundary a unit of space and a unit of time in the material sector you have a unit space boundary and everything that&#x27;s less than one unit of space is in time and that is what Larissa calls the time region and that is a sub region of the material sector that uh uh is you know set aside for you know Atomic formation and molecular formation and interaction one unit of space is very small um one um like 120 millionth of a meter but it is very large compared to the size of an atom you can fit trillions of atoms within the time region and the same thing holds true in the cosmic sector uh where you have the time re the time boundary the unit time boundary if you have less than one unit of time then you only have space Larson calls this the space region and within the space region you have uh Cosmic atoms and Cosmic particles and Cosmic molecules um or what the Legacy scientists would call anti-matter and um so yeah so you have uh basically these four different sectors of the universe that interact and when you cross these boundaries the rules reverse and the roles of space and time reverse for example in the material sector you have um coordinate space and clock time three dimensions of space and time is progressing but in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time and clock space is progressing and three you have three dimensional time this is a way of thinking that we&#x27;re unaccustomed to but we could uh we probably could pick it up over time or space okay now um Larson like I said then he developed his um this whole universe out of this theoretical universe and he wrote many many books on these various topics that he derived from his theoretical Universe including books on chemistry astronomy physics Atomic physics metaphysics economics and um other subjects until he died in 1990. now after he died um or even while toward the end of his life he had some followers who um contributed to his work and some also revised his work to a certain extent and then after he died this person Dr Bruce perrett came around and he came up with the reciprocal system too so this was a re -evaluation of the reciprocal system and uh and paret basically did away with Larson&#x27;s second postulate which was um you know the Universe um adheres to the um that absolute relationships uh it&#x27;s magnitudes are ordinary commutative mathematics it&#x27;s magnitudes are absolute and it&#x27;s geometry is euclidean uh paret felt that the geometry of the universe was projective and that euclidean geometry is just a subset of projected geometry anyway uh he also along with Dr kbk nehru uh were instrumental in uh adjusting Larson&#x27;s idea of the photon and um several other things that were adjusted anyway we are looking at Dr peret&#x27;s article here which has to do with the hidden history of homo sapiens so he&#x27;s extending the Arctic uh the reciprocal system to cover subjects like the hidden history of homo sapiens part three of his anthropology series we&#x27;ve looked at the first two articles already and this third one is called Homo sapiens ethicus Life Death reincarnation and Ascension and um so we&#x27;ve gone this is probably the sixth video that we&#x27;ve done on this um on this subject and so um you might want to go back and re-examine the previous articles or the previous videos so that you can catch up but uh hopefully if not you might be able to pick it up right here this section is called overview of the mortal and Immortal realms the Mortal Realms are the Realms in which we have physical existence in the reciprocal system physical can be either spatial or temporal so the Mortal Realms are either existence in the material sector of 3D space or the cosmic sector of 3D time when your Consciousness is in one sector the other sector has the appearance of the so-called afterlife most theological conventions consider where your Consciousness currently resides is the Mortal realm and its conjugate the afterlife is the other Realm what many folks do not realize is that even when you die you&#x27;re still mortal just mortal in the afterlife realm and will after a death time of experiences get old be born and come back to life here it is a symmetry of existence between the matter of 3D space and The Ether of 3D time the mortal and afterlife Realms are just the opposite faces of the same coin so when you go around the edge of that coin you die on one side to be born on the other the primary difference is that physical existence is valued by space sensation thinking distance and clock time and the afterlife existence is valued by time intuition feeling duration and clock space in the Mortal realm the road to hell is paved with good intentions and one is valued or judged by their actions not their intentions the material realm or life is based on spatial relationships the purpose of our physical body is to sense and manipulate space the cosmic realm or afterlife is based on temporal relationships the purpose there is to Intuit and manipulate time both cases require interaction between Consciousness and the environment The Immortal Realms are reached by the Ascension process breaking the cycle of reincarnation to use the coin analogy it is very difficult to jump off the face of a coin but easy to do when you are making the transition around the edge the most notable difference between the mortal and in and Immortal Realms is that the immortal Realms exist beyond space and time and as such the valuing systems that we are accustomed to are very different they take on a reciprocal form there is little difference between thought and manifestation so valuing is done by a concept similar to intention however in The Immortal Realm the path to mortality is paved with actions it is from this premise that we get the non-interference directives of higher beings such as the ascended ancients of Stargate SG-1 consider once you have ascended you did it because you no longer need to experience the physical interactions sensation and intuition present in the life and afterlife Realms in other words you have graduated high school and have started attending college but if one continues to have an interest in interacting with the physical Realms then obviously you did not complete a lesson there which is why you have the motivation to continue interacting with the physical once that link is formed it tends to get stronger as an ascended being can greatly affect the Affairs of the Mortal realms due to the fact that their thoughts will manifest as structure and action substance and force eventually they get sucked back down into The Reincarnation cycle to figure out and finish off the lesson that they failed to learn so when one gets cast out of the immortal Realms they return to Mortal status with some knowledge of Higher Learning but that knowledge is often misunderstood as the Mortal mind slash brain does not have the mechanisms to compreh comprehend non-core corporeal lessons okay now this section is called um ascended laws of non-interference do interactions between the mortal and Immortal Realms occur yes frequently but it is seldom that a physical at uh it is seldom a physical interaction it normally occurs during a tween time an in-between time the edge of the coin High Noon midnight sunrise sunset birthdays anniversaries doorways Windows Bridges Shadows anytime a new cycle starts or opposites become connected and it is done at a thought or conceptual level that can provide some very insightful information but is still up to an addit an individual to act on it physically since that is the dictate of mortal existence it is from this interaction that we get the concept of Spirit guides ascended masters avatars Guardians at all foreign there are times when the thoughts and intentions of someone in the Mortal realm pokes through to The Immortal Realm and gets the attention of the Immortals it is usually associated with a flash of insights about the nature of one&#x27;s purpose in life it does not happen often but when it does most choose to ignore it remember that The Immortal Realm is valued by intention if a mortal does not intend to follow through by indicating no interest putting it on hold or just denying it the offer of interaction will be withdrawn it is usually a One-Shot deal when an offer comes from The Immortal Realm it indicates that the recipient has a quality of character that would allow them to do bigger things than what biological existence would have them do something to note is that an immortal guide will never tell you to do anything nor act on their behalf they have no interest in the Mortal realms but do have an interest in the larger picture of which you can make a difference if you choose to do so if you encounter a non-corporeal entity that wants you to perform an act on their behalf you probably have another mortal in between lives that has used projection to gain access to this side The Immortals simply give you access to an enormous realm of knowledge and experience and like a librarian will assist you in finding what you are looking for but you still will have to read the book and act on the knowledge interaction between the Realms is a free will choice and hopefully uninformed choice okay that&#x27;s the end of that section and uh the next section is called the conjugate Realms this world and the other world and uh we will start that next time out um uh this is a little bit difficult material once again and uh you might want to just go through this multiple times and go through it slowly to kind of uh uh get all of the finer points out of it I need to do the same and um hopefully we will work our way through this article and be able to make full sense of it over time but uh you know this uh this stuff is not uh kindergarten and I don&#x27;t think anybody would really want it to be right so it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s worth the time uh if you put in the time all right um that will do it for today thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
