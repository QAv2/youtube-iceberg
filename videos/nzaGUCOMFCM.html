            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Well, good day and welcome to Reality Check Q&amp;A where Megan Medic, my colleague in crime, gets to grill me with the hard questions from our audience. Good day, Megan. How are you, &gt;&gt; Ross? I am fantastic. What&#x27;s going on with you today? &gt;&gt; Uh, not huge amounts. Just basically the usual grind grinding through thousands of emails from our delighted viewing audience.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s lots of people wanting to engage. Many people saying that they are having contact experiences. And how does one deal with this in between the daily bread? It&#x27;s non-stop. &gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s funny. I&#x27;ve also been digging through some emails and I will read one to you right now.</p>
<p>This is coming from Anders. Hello. Thank you both for your continued work on reality check and for your commitment to pursuing clarity and truth around what may be one of the most consequential questions of our time. That may sound grand, but it feels accurate. I&#x27;m curious whether Ross has come across any credible information or indication suggesting that Donald Trump would need to first secure or prioritize peace on a major scale before being allowed to disclose anything related to the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. Best regards, Anders. Not specifically with Trump. No. Um there&#x27;s a long history in euthology going right back to uh Billy Meyer, I think in the 1950s and60s, and George Adamsky.</p>
<p>Um two people who claimed to be in direct communication with non-human intelligences who asserted that they were being told by those intelligences that humans needed to embrace peace before they could achieve full potential and full consciousness. Now, there&#x27;s a lot of speculation, of course, that those commentators, those people who were making those claims way back in the &#x27; 50s and the 60s, this was an era when the world was terrified of the prospect of full-scale nuclear war with the Soviets, and there was a terrible risk that the world would be destroyed in a massive thermonuclear conflration. And what&#x27;s changed? Absolutely nothing. We are now yet again in the pitch of a possible thermonuclear conflration and the a bulletin of atomic scientists has the u the clock the doomsday clock closer to midnight than any other time in our history. So I guess the aliens if they are real I suspect they are probably saying the same thing to many of the experiences that I speak to.</p>
<p>And one of the things I do want to start talking about because I do want to start giving these people the credibility I think they deserve. There there comes a time in journalism where when you&#x27;re hearing the same thing from multiple independent witnesses, none of whom know each other, who are all basically saying, as I&#x27;m being told, that there is a phenomenon, some kind of intelligence that&#x27;s engaging with them, often telepathically, often in kind of downloads. There&#x27;s a consistent message coming through and the message is a warning of imminent confilration, imminent disaster unless humanity turns course and becomes more peaceloving. And look, maybe this is a sentiment born of I guess neurosis and fear and paranoia about the current international situation which is pretty grim. Um, but certainly in terms of a policy, I don&#x27;t see any sign at all that President Trump is going to be in any way a disclosure president.</p>
<p>I think he&#x27;s wimped it on disclosure and I think speculation that he may be making some kind of disclosure this year. I see somebody suggested that he may make a disclosure on the anniversary of Roswell. I just don&#x27;t see that happening. Uh, I hope it&#x27;s true. I really sincerely do hope it&#x27;s true, but I I have spoken to people in the administration who&#x27;ve told me to be patient and reassured me that there will be at some stage a decision made on what, if anything, will be said.</p>
<p>I am told that there is an ongoing FBI investigation into alleged illegalities that&#x27;s being run in coordination with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. But frankly, we&#x27;re not seeing any results from those investigations. So any talk of imminent disclosure or revelations about alleged illegalities in a legacy UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s happening anytime soon. And in the same vein, speculation that the president needs to move to a more peaceful tone in order to move humanity to a greater level of awareness. That sounds more like an idealistic pitch than a reality.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry to disappoint. &gt;&gt; Okay, Russ, we&#x27;ll go to another email. This is from Glenn. Dear Ross and Megan, we have been hearing a lot from Trump about Greenland recently, and the rhetoric has been increasing. In his latest statement, he made an odd comment I haven&#x27;t heard anyone pick up on.</p>
<p>He said it was a quote very dangerous situation for the safety, security, and survival of our planet before going on to talk about the Golden Dome. Do you think the Golden Dome&#x27;s actual purpose is a defense system against a possible NHI threat? And the US wants to take Greenland to put exotic, possibly reverse engineered technology there without the knowledge of the rest of NATO. &gt;&gt; No, I&#x27;m sorry. I don&#x27;t uh I I think the Golden Domes project is singularly for an uh anti-ICBM nuclear missile protection program. The reason it&#x27;s to be located where it is in Greenland or at least part of the Golden Domes would be located there is because Greenland literally sits equidistant almost between America and Russia.</p>
<p>And so in the event of Russian ICBMs, intercontinental ballistic missiles being fired at the US, God forbid, um they would fly over Greenland. And that&#x27;s why the Pufik uh naval base is already there. It&#x27;s an early warning station that&#x27;s been there for most of the last 70 80 years and it&#x27;s why in the event of a golden domes being built uh it would also be located or parts of that infrastructure would be located there. I don&#x27;t see any suggestion at all. I&#x27;ve heard no suggestion at all that that&#x27;s anything to do with NHI.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&#x27;t really think there is at the moment, from what I&#x27;m being told, any overt threat from NHI. Um, if we accept what we&#x27;re being told by my sources and by millions of people who claim to have had contact, the NHI seem to be able to come and go as they please and without any kind of knowledge or interdiction by the Americans or indeed any other state. So the idea of being able to defend ourselves against them is, I think, an extremely remote possibility. There&#x27;s also the fact that not only is Greenland strategically important for defense against ICBM attacks, it&#x27;s the part of the Arctic where increasingly the sea lanes are opening up and any control of those sea lanes is integral and strategically important to the nation in control. And of course, China and Russia are obviously looking to move their cargo and uh produce around the world as much more easily.</p>
<p>And if as global warming hits, those Arctic sea lanes open up, there will be increased focus on that as an area of huge strategic importance. And there&#x27;s also, as we have reported on reality check before with our friend Martin Klest from Denmark, who filmed anomalous objects over Greenland. There is an enormous resource of rare earth minerals in Greenland. Outside of China, uh the only two places in the world that have this quantity of rare earth minerals are Greenland and drum roll, Australia, believe it or not. [gasps] So, we&#x27;re expecting the Marines to come charging up the beach at Bondi Beach.</p>
<p>But I tell you what, we&#x27;ll put up a good fight. But sorry, I I don&#x27;t think there is any basis at all to suggest that the Golden Domes is directed at a potential alien invasion because frankly I don&#x27;t think there is going to be one. &gt;&gt; Okay, Russ, we did not chat about this part of James Fox&#x27;s press conference last week, but it was one of my favorite parts. So, I want to pull a question from it. This is from Eli on X.</p>
<p>Hi, Megan. During the Jacques Valet video presentation at James Fox&#x27;s press event, he appeared to suggest that the phenomenon is extraterrestrial in nature and potentially empowered by artificial intelligence, a change from ID. I would love to hear Ross Coldart&#x27;s perspective. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think this is a climb down or a change of position by Jacques. I actually heard that go through the gate when I heard it on the day and I thought, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s interesting.&quot; And then my friend and colleague Joe Mergia who&#x27;s got an excellent uh social media site that I recommend to everybody, UFO Joe.</p>
<p>[gasps] Joe actually wrote to Jacques and asked him the question and I made a note of it because I thought it was extremely significant what Joe got back from Jacques. Um Jacques responded saying I don&#x27;t think the these are mutually exclusive i.e. ETS and the possibility of interdimensional beings. Because in the past, Jacques talked a lot about the possibility that this is cryptoaterrestrials, something that&#x27;s here already, and perhaps there&#x27;s some kind of advanced intelligence that&#x27;s been on this planet the whole time, and we&#x27;ve been sharing our planet with this advanced intelligence for perpetuity. Um, the other term that he&#x27;s used is interdimensional.</p>
<p>And uh yes, I I think there is an extremely high likelihood as David Grush has said that some of the phenomenon is interdimensional, but as Jacques says, it&#x27;s not one thing. So it&#x27;s not mutually exclusive. And he said to Joe, we&#x27;ve started to use AI quite actively and we have to expect other species would as well and better. To me, says Jacques, the creatures seen at Trinity, Sakoro, and Valencol, these are all alleged UFO craft retrievalss, and now revealed revealed quite clearly at Vajinhar in Brazil, could be artificial biological robots designed to withstand our gravity, breathe our air, and look humanlike enough to interact with us or simply to learn about us. When I was discussing this, Jack says with Bill P, circa 1966.</p>
<p>Gosh, Jack, that&#x27;s how long you&#x27;ve been doing this for. That&#x27;s 60 years. Right after Sakuro, he half joked that they could be noticing machines. That could mean that any secret project designed to learn about their biology, although extremely interesting, will teach us nothing about the origin of UFOs whose real controllers are somewhere else and have evolved like us. I&#x27;ve come to believe there are two levels involved at least.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s funny, I&#x27;m not necessarily endorsing what Jacques&#x27;s saying because I actually do suspect that some of what he&#x27;s describing as biological robots, like for example, the being at Vahinha, that was a feeling being that was communicating emotion. I&#x27;d be very surprised if it was a biological robot. But where I do agree with Jacques is I really do think that there&#x27;s something to the idea that a lot of what we&#x27;re seeing on this planet might be AI proxies. Because if you think about it, when we explore the universe, we&#x27;ve sent out Voyager 1, a probe on our behalf. That&#x27;s not us humans.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a probe representing humanity. um and perhaps illadvisedly we put our names and and uh picture on the side of it inviting anyone to come and find us. But the um the interesting thing is are what we&#x27;re seeing or what people are experiencing sometimes some kind of AI biological robot. I do think that that&#x27;s an idea that should be being explored and I do think Jacques&#x27;s got a point. But I don&#x27;t think that that&#x27;s exclusive.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s possible that the phenomenon is a huge range of things. Yes. Extraterrestrial uh beings somewhere else from somewhere in our galaxy or in our universe, interdimensional beings that are capable of moving interdimensionally. And I&#x27;m increasingly I&#x27;d really like to hear from people about this. I&#x27;m getting really interested in the idea of intelligent plasmas.</p>
<p>Is there a life form that&#x27;s been existing in our upper atmosphere and low Earth orbit for perpetuity? And is that in and of itself a life form that hasn&#x27;t yet been discovered? And is it intelligent and responding to humans? And does that explain a lot of the plasma orbs that we&#x27;re seeing? I&#x27;m like everyone else feeling my way in the darkness trying to make sense of this all and I&#x27;m really interested in hearing from people. But I think Jacques&#x27;s explanation of at least some of this phenomenon being driven by AI biological robots, it&#x27;s certainly rationally plausible and it should be considered as a possibility. &gt;&gt; Okay, we will go to an email from Gary. Good afternoon, Megan and Ross. Keep up the great work.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts, Ross, on the massive submarine freshwater reserve found under the seafloor off the east coast of the USA between New Jersey and as far up as Maine reported by live science and others drilled and radiocarbon dated to the end of the last ice age 11,500 years ago? Do you think this void under the seafloor could house an underwater NHI base, i.e. your recent documentary? Does it explain the continuous New Jersey and East Coast UAP sightings coming in and out of the ocean? And could it relate to an advanced lost civilization? Graham Hancock&#x27;s theory about submerged archaeology around this period, end of the last ice age. Are we about to poke the hornets&#x27;s nest by extracting the water for consumption? &gt;&gt; Wow, that&#x27;s a huge long bow. Yes, there has been a huge freshwater aquifer found off the east coast of the United States. Apparently, it stretches from New Jersey right up to Maine.</p>
<p>But my understanding is that it&#x27;s actually sealed in rock in seams. Um it&#x27;s been found using some kind of um uh I I suspect synthetic aperture radar imaging of some kind. Uh or maybe it&#x27;s I think it&#x27;s actually the techniques that are used to look for oil. uh they can look at the relative densities of liquids under the ground and they&#x27;ve been able to discern that instead of it being oil, it&#x27;s water. I was talking to somebody who told me that it initially they thought it might be oil and then they realized it was water and everyone was hugely disappointed because if it was if it was oil the the US would no longer have any oil problems at all.</p>
<p>Um, as for the possibility that it&#x27;s in some way connected to a non-human intelligence and might explain the alleged um, uh, NHI sightings that have occurred, let&#x27;s firstly talk about those sightings. I mean, particularly since 2024, 2025, there have been off thecharts sightings, particularly along the New Jersey coast, there&#x27;s been a huge frequency of the phenomenon showing itself, particularly over military bases and in military training areas along the entire east coast of the USA. I&#x27;m in touch with people who&#x27;ve told me that there are still objects, and I don&#x27;t use the word drones, showing themselves over very sensitive military facilities. Egglund Air Force Base, Langley Air Force Base, White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, um right across California, all the bases there. The NHI do seem to be focusing on military bases if this is NHI that we&#x27;re talking about.</p>
<p>And there are I mean there&#x27;s been um I was looking at the figures 9,000 sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena along the US coastline in that period 2024 2025. It&#x27;s massive and it&#x27;s something that interestingly enough isn&#x27;t really being talked about apart from the New Jersey flap that took place that we gave prominent coverage to at NewsNation. And it really should be an issue of concern or interest. Why have we stopped focusing on it? This is why I commend what the New Jersey local government authorities have done, which is start their own UAP research facility. They&#x27;ve basically spurned the ignorance and willful neglect of federal government&#x27;s disinterest and they&#x27;re doing their own research because they refuse to be uh gaslit by the different agencies that are telling them there is nothing there and these are just the occasional misidentified aircraft.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not true. People are adamant that what they&#x27;re seeing and what they have been seeing is some kind of anomalous technology. Now, as for the possibility that this freshwater reservoir that&#x27;s been discovered could explain the UAP activity, I think it&#x27;s highly unlikely because frankly, it&#x27;s not that this water is sitting out in the open in a place that a um non-human intelligence could enjoy. It&#x27;s basically an underground aquifer that&#x27;s sealed in in um rock or matter. And um I think it&#x27;s just as plausible that they&#x27;d find themselves in seawater.</p>
<p>I I I don&#x27;t see why the NHI would necessarily be drawn to that because of fresh water because we&#x27;re assuming that they&#x27;d be interested in fresh water rather than seawater. I think there is a phenomenon involving our oceans all over the world um which appears to involve NHI craft emerging and returning to the oceans. I suspect that there are NHI in our oceans. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised at all if we were sharing our our world with a cryptoaterrestrial intelligence that is using our oceans to hide. All we can do is speculate.</p>
<p>But um certainly the discovery is interesting. I just don&#x27;t see any reason why it should necessarily be connected to NHI. &gt;&gt; Okay, we will go to a question from Sanj. Hi Russ and Megan. We&#x27;ve all heard of numerous accounts of UFO sightings over nuclear bases.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there have been any reports of sightings over CERN. Given that CERN is imitating birth of the universe by smashing particles and producing significance amount significant amounts of energy, I imagine such a facility would also attract curiosity. What do you think? love the work you all are doing pushing for disclosure. &gt;&gt; Okay, this is a really interesting question because um yes, CERN is the focus of an awful lot of um speculation. Um CERN is the um particle accelerator complex in Europe which spans the um French Swiss border near I think it&#x27;s near Geneva [gasps] and it&#x27;s been the subject of a lot of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>um trying to remember her name. I wrote it down at one stage. Um Astred, it&#x27;s a fantastic name. Astred Stuckleberger. Um she&#x27;s a Swiss public health scientist who&#x27;s previously worked with the World Health Organization and the UN.</p>
<p>and she&#x27;s been making very dramatic allegations about how a nonhuman entity emerged from a portal at CERN and outrageously took a scarf um uh and on a uh on another occasion sat on a table in the room. Now, this is a completely unverified assertion. Uh I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not sure. I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s saying she was actually there when it happened. Um there&#x27;s another claim that was made about CERN that there was a um swirling UFO gateway video shot around about 2016.</p>
<p>And this seems to have been if you believe the the dark forces that would obviously conspire to cover this up. Um the official explanation for this was that it was an unusual weather event and that the oddly shaped clouds gave the impression of some kind of portal or gateway. Um there was a lot of um excitement about the video imagery that that did appear to show lights in clouds, but um there was a an attempt at an explanation by CERN. Believe what you want. I I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s compelling evidence of nonhumans engaging with a very sensitive scientific facility.</p>
<p>There haven&#x27;t been, as far as I know, any UFO UAP craft sightings directly over soon, but there have been thousands of um sightings in and around Switzerland and that part of France. What is more interesting is the fact that CERN uses the term UFO but not in the term that we use it of um unidentified flying objects. Um, there are contaminants that apparently get into the CERN particle accelerator and they cause beam losses or quenches and they use the term unidentified falling objects, UFOs to describe those beam losses. And this led to a very celebrated headline. I think it was a bit of mischief by a tabloid newspaper.</p>
<p>tens of thousands of UFOs seen at the CERN facility and everybody went nuts until they realized they were talking about unidentified falling objects. Um, I would love to believe that there&#x27;s something to the conspiracy theories about CERN. I haven&#x27;t seen any hard evidence yet. Every time I&#x27;ve raised this with friends of mine in the French scientific community who have connections to CERN, they&#x27;ve giggled maniacally. I met one Brazilian scientist who was working at CERN and he told me he&#x27;d never seen anything anomalous and he&#x27;s a very UFO UAP interested person.</p>
<p>If anyone does have any juicy gossip about CERN, I&#x27;d love to hear about it, but no, I I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s been any substantive evidence to show me that there is um NHI connections with CERN. Love to hear more though if people have got any evidence. Okay, the next question is about two of our friends, Patrick Jackson and Beatatric Villerole Theories. It appears to me that both parties interviewed by you are describing the same phenomena, i.e. a worldwide dome of protection built by entities that were on Earth long before mankind.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts Alexander in Scotland? &gt;&gt; Okay, Alex, let me just quickly give our audience a bit of a background here. Dr. Beatrice Villa is a highly respected Swedish astrophysicist who has come up with the most extraordinary peer-reviewed evidence um to show or suggest that there are in geostationary orbit at around about 43,000 km from Earth objects that were artificial that were specular I.e. highly reflective in nature with presumably flat, shiny, reflective surfaces and they were sitting in geostationary orbit uh in the period prior to human beings sending rockets with payloads and human beings up into orbit. Now, no one to date has been able to lay a glove on Dr.</p>
<p>Vill&#x27;s work. She&#x27;s basically come out with this research based on an investigation into images found on photographic glass plates from the Paloma uh observatory survey that was done in the 1950s and the early60s actually no 1950s and uh right up to the period 1957 when the first satellite went into space the Russian satellite Sputnik um There were no human objects in space or at least there shouldn&#x27;t have been. And what we&#x27;ve discovered with the great work done by Dr. Vill is that there do appear on the basis of what is now a peerreed multi-per reviewed study that she&#x27;s done of these images found on glass plographic plates. There does appear to be something that was sitting in geostationary orbit that was almost certainly artificial, highly reflective, specular in nature.</p>
<p>[gasps] Now, we don&#x27;t have the ability because of course the only people with the satellites that could look that way and do the analysis to see whether or not those objects are still there. It&#x27;s not possible to go back and look at the location on the glass plates to s to see if those specular highly reflective objects are still there. But let&#x27;s assume they are and there&#x27;s no reason not to. There&#x27;s another gentleman called Patrick Jackson who we also had on the show a few weeks ago. Patrick&#x27;s a uh British uh person of Irish background who&#x27;s done some great work into the mystery of these metallic spheres that are being seen all over the world by literally hundreds of witnesses.</p>
<p>There are videos of these spheres in the air. They appear to be autonomous, intelligently guided craft of some kind. clearly metallic, clearly moving intelligently and they appear to appear at different times moving at incredibly high speeds over often military facilities or sensitive facilities in some way perhaps surveilling. So the speculation is and and Beatatrice I know has been talking to Patrick and she gives this some credibility. It&#x27;s speculation o only at this stage.</p>
<p>Is there some kind of ancient surveillance system perhaps installed before humanity in evolved that&#x27;s been surveilling our planet? I frankly when Patrick first came to me with this theory was very very skeptical. And interestingly enough, the more I talk to people in government, the intelligence community, people with a knowledge of the UAP mystery, the more I give this theory credibility. Uh, obviously, it&#x27;s hard to be definitive. There are ongoing researches happening into the metallic spheres that I hope to bring you a report about soon. Patrick and I are talking.</p>
<p>Um, and um, it would be lovely to be able to definitively nail down what these objects are and indeed whether they are anomalous. Um, more on that hopefully soon. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Okay, Ross, here we go. This is Tony on X. Hi, Megan.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s one for shits and giggles. Projected time frame for a ride in space in a UAP ARV. Love your work, both of you. Ah, okay. Oh, there&#x27;s wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Um, if anyone&#x27;s going for a ride in in an alien reproduction vehicle, and listen, I&#x27;m quite corruptible, by the way. Pentagon, if you do want to come and offer me a spin around the universe in your ARV, I will happily keep my mouth shut for the rest of my life. No, I wouldn&#x27;t. I couldn&#x27;t hide it. I&#x27;m sorry, but uh I&#x27;d certainly love a ride.</p>
<p>Um, when&#x27;s it going to happen? I&#x27;m not holding my breath anytime soon. What you&#x27;re talking about there though has a glimmer of seriousness to it. Um, if it&#x27;s true that there are aerospace craft that have been developed by the United States that are highly advanced and we&#x27;ve seen photographs in recent weeks of a gigantic triangular object that&#x27;s been seen several times over the um the United States. Uh clearly someone is operating some kind of craft that is not yet known to modern aerospace uh press uh which has been operating I suspect for 30 or 40 years. I mean, it defies explanation that the United States, which expends trillions of dollars every year on national defense, would not have made huge advances in aerospace technology, particularly if, as we believe, they&#x27;ve recovered non-human craft and had them since at least the 1950s.</p>
<p>I do think that there is a strong probability that the United States has developed some type of electrogravitic propulsion if not some kind of energy system derived from 0 point energy. Why are they keeping that secret? I have no idea. But are they going to make an announcement? Not anytime soon, I suspect. &gt;&gt; Okay, Russ, that is it for today. Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, that was very quick. Thank you so much, Megan. And thank you viewers. Let&#x27;s keep those questions coming. If you want to ask me a question, you can send your emails to reality check@newsnation now.com.</p>
