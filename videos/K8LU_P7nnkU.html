            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello this is your host Brendan mcnamer with another episode of anomalous experiences today I have the pleasure of discussing matters of Weird Science and Strange Magic with one Jason cassibry who is Apparently one of the founding fathers of Mo modern fusion and uh recently has begun dabbling in dielectrophoresis which is one apparent route for Gravity control through manipulation close manipulation of the electrostatic and ferromagnetic constants as a part of Einstein&#x27;s field equations in order to manipulate K this G and so we get into that and we get into the State ofth art surrounding this sort of experimentation uh space travel the Multiverse time travel uh a lot of weird stuff uh and actually have a lot of fun if you enjoy it don&#x27;t forget to like And subscribe or leave some kind of feedback uh to that effect so that we can keep this going and bring bring the algorithm in and and let people know about this content um and Jason uh is doing this mostly without funding yet uh or major support so the more attention we can get to his work the better so I hope that you enjoyed this this conversation and uh we&#x27;ll see you next time hello there hey how&#x27;s it going oh good good good it finally worked yeah yeah we we were like ships passing in the night for a little bit there um upgrading my video I had a bit of a panic a second ago too cuz I have this monitor that&#x27;s that&#x27;s really finicky to start up MH and uh I switched modes on it like from analog over to digital for a second like oh that&#x27;ll fix it and it shut down all my video oh no I just had to do a hard reset and come up from scratch and I was like oh my God I hope I hope like I don&#x27;t CA it&#x27;s Linux and it&#x27;s finicky and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t come all the way back up and I&#x27;m like I hope I really I really hope I don&#x27;t have to like Jerry rig my system the last I would have done though I would have still been like we&#x27;re still gonna do it Jason we&#x27;re still gonna do it well uh finally we have some success huh yeah no that&#x27;s great great I&#x27;ve been looking forward to this for a while yeah um your your your presentation at at ape was really exciting to me wow thank you yeah know it&#x27;s it it represents to me it represents uh kind of a grounding of these advanced concepts uh and uh bring it into an experimental um frame that that is accessible you know because you hear about um Char what Charles berer and Drew are are doing over there in Florida and uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s there but it&#x27;s a little esoteric and there&#x27;s this guy&#x27;s like yeah I did this with some sculpy clay and like oh wow okay I want to talk to this dude yeah now I Bueller is among the more um exciting of that group of people trying to you know give us field propulsion um but I I haven&#x27;t seen them show anything yet and I&#x27;m like we we could absolutely test what they&#x27;re doing in our lab if we knew what they were doing obviously they want to hold their cards close to their chest yeah everybody ndas yeah yeah and that&#x27;s understandable um but uh but I haven&#x27;t seen anything from them other than data you know it&#x27;d be great if they had a picture video or something I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not trying to imply that I doubt what they&#x27;re doing it&#x27;s just it would be nice if they could show us something well some movement would be would be cool um and uh because like um showing it on a monitor uh in terms of like Newton or um just just pure Force is is cool but it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t move the needle well it moves the needle but it doesn&#x27;t move the people um you know and and um people were like well show me the dang thing um so you know that that&#x27;s uh moving it from the the counterintuitive to the intuitive I guess yeah to to PE people being people that just need to see something I&#x27;m I have the utmost respect for those guys and I love what they&#x27;re doing um and obviously they want to keep their cards close to their chest but know um one of the people not maybe he&#x27;s not in the uh academic or the engineering space one of the people that&#x27;s been behind the disclosure of this technology for a long time is Step Greer and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s said for many years like if you want to be the next Rockefeller of zero point or uh anti-gravity sorry to use the buzzwords but uh you&#x27;re not you&#x27;re you&#x27;re just GNA get stuck in the mud and they&#x27;re going to stop you because the patent system is broken that way and um uh it&#x27;s it the better the better route anyway is is this open collaboration and uh agree yeah you know repeatability is the the lifeblood of science um you know so if you can&#x27;t if it can&#x27;t be repeated in other people&#x27;s Labs easily and readily then you know basically for practical intents and purposes it&#x27;s not science um it&#x27;s just some fancy data so you know you probably feel for that so you know if you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re working in that space though you&#x27;re in a public university and you&#x27;re do you&#x27;re doing the things so I resp I totally respect that um and uh but no nobody knows about you yet really as far as I know so you know this is exciting um and I&#x27;m excited I&#x27;m I&#x27;m still a novice where it comes to um the mathematics and um I&#x27;ve been in a crash course on this for the last year and a half you know I&#x27;ve been studying uh phenomena for a while and had a passing interest in physics pretty intense interest in physics but really hit the books in the last year or two since the the Congressional hearings and I&#x27;m like well better better seriously figure this stuff out and then people told me like well actually we&#x27;re we&#x27;re much closer to modifying gravity than they&#x27;ll have you believe and uh like oh tell me more um so I&#x27;ve been on this journey of Discovery I&#x27;m open to learning as much as possible so what&#x27;s uh uh since you you&#x27;ve kind of uh been exposed to uh different things uh who what who who&#x27;s come out with information or claims or or or maybe like really credible uh Concepts or ideas that that have really kind of influenced your your thinking or optimism about okay um well even though he&#x27;s kind of a nut uh Jack sarati I was going to ask you what you thought of Jack surfa yeah yeah so uh what what I really like about him is how he really breaks down uh and and not like I I I don&#x27;t really understand the full breadth of of Einstein&#x27;s field equations yet um I don&#x27;t know who really if anybody claims to fully understand it I think that they&#x27;re deluding themselves but um the the concept of modifying the um dialectric and ferromagnetic constants the um the the sorry permitivity and um permeability uh in the nearfield based on uh how light behaves in matter connected to Maxwells equations Maxwell heavy side but the the the Maxwell heavy side part of Einstein&#x27;s equations that have to do with these these factors as a part of modifying C to 4th as a part of modifying K and thus G um that&#x27;s really exciting to me and that seems to just connect you know um that&#x27;s where we stop we stop playing with these electrostatics and electromagnetic fields uh and that&#x27;s you can look at the equations be like oh this this is gravity this this at least part of that um and uh even though it&#x27;s not in matter that you&#x27;re changing the qualities of SpaceTime to be behave like matter um right and that&#x27;s essentially what the what&#x27;s being you know what&#x27;s happening at the in the corona of the Sun as that light from a distant star is passing around it as we discovered through the telescope looking at the the eclipse to verify relativity way back in the day and and so so that that connects for me um and then you know there&#x27;s there&#x27;s I&#x27;ve been following beer and ARA and um oh escapes me I&#x27;m just so glad to not be um toiling in the muck and the M of of Lazar worship anymore um I I was broken out of that by Jeremy ree um some time ago when he was like w you really got to look at that again um and and and not go chasing Element 115 stuff um like wow wow lost so many years that way but um yeah now um that that stuff in Jack sarotti Sunny White um Travis Taylor um few of these guys seem to be orbiting no pun intended a central star uh that is um you know this this this K modification bit and um and uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where I I see you in that club more or less um I appreciate that kind of you yeah um I think you&#x27;re all very close to something that uh that everybody&#x27;s basically um it seems would seem obvious but it&#x27;s terribly counterintuitive and almost unbelievable and uh I think uh and and and Forbidden Science that&#x27;s for sure these things um you know sometimes I have to look over my shoulder and be like you know do I have all my my nose clean just in case somebody decides to stop me not to worry you or anything like you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s it sometimes it&#x27;s like what why are we being allowed to look into this it&#x27;s now like why now are we even being allowed to poke at these things when it&#x27;s been so buried and fought for such a long time is that entirely academic or is there a a deeper there&#x27;s been a deep seems like a deeper uh Push by the powers that be to keep this information way so I I have a few things to say about that if you want my so yeah no I&#x27;m all yours yeah yeah yeah uh so from a uh let&#x27;s say a national security perspective uh the the Widespread Panic that might ensue from you know UFOs landing on the line or or that kind of thing I don&#x27;t think as as severe as it used to be right but um but I I I think that uh you do have to be responsible in that let&#x27;s say someone has this breakthrough and that you could you could build an engine that you could put on an airplane that&#x27;s this big and suddenly this thing could go 20 well that that kind of capability in the hands of someone else where we have it matured it to understand how to counter it like alqaeda or Isis or something like yeah yeah it it would be a disaster so you kind of have to slow walk your way into these things get used to it so so if it if it truly disrupted uh things immediately you would have a lot of resistance from a lot of different directions so you do you do want to kind of like slow walk into it but in terms of like a grand conspiracy so I&#x27;ve talked to someone I I&#x27;m not going to say who but if I mentioned the Navy be like oh yeah I&#x27;ve heard of person right uh we we had a lunch here this like four or five years ago and and they they had the privilege of of studying this stuff and had clearances to do it um like I know who you&#x27;re talking about they&#x27;re in Huntsville I know who it is I have no no idea what you&#x27;re saying right now but but but he said there&#x27;s no he or see whoops uh said there&#x27;s no real real conspiracy different Pockets protect their little pieces of it but there&#x27;s no organization it&#x27;s a disjointed mess basically right yeah and that uh uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very very expensive to try to coordinate an effort to collaborate and a lot of times it gets killed by not politicians so much as mid-level administrators that somehow block it for uh fear or religious reasons or some other you know belief system or or whatever yeah it&#x27;s a mixture for sure of some genuine fear of uh National Security leaks and some religious stuff and uh I was just amazed that David grush got his approval through on on what he released you know um it seems like some last minute bureaucratic like um paper pushing thing where they were just like wow we we legally can&#x27;t stop him he&#x27;s crossed to his teas and dotted all his eyes and just squeak that one through you know yeah yeah and uh that that says something about the administrative State um but yeah I I I I agree and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a patriot I used to be all for Flag Day and stuff unfortunately I&#x27;m privy to a lot of the stuff that we&#x27;ve done over the years and one of the things that soured me on on it all was realizing as a kid like as like I was I think I was 12 years old when I came became aware of the level of Technology we might have and how much it could change the world and the fact that we were keeping it back that really you know just just made me angry you know um and justifiably so I think but um I still think we have an interest in maintaining not hedgman per se but like our own our own interests in defense and stuff and yeah yeah I I think that that the Chinese and the the Russians definitely don&#x27;t need any help already working on this themselves so right now it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a matter of keeping up with the Joneses and the the the jings and stuff it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a matter of maintaining parity like we will get absolutely leapfrogged and then we will be subject to Domination by others um so you know whatever you know it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not even about maintaining Imperial dominance it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a about not being dominated um and about uh yeah being able to enter this new world together I think the implication of the technology is that kind of like the nuclear bomb uh it&#x27;s going to make a lot of warfare sort of redundant and extremely dangerous when you can warp into an area at you said mach 20 I believe it much faster than that if you can open the Wormhole or yeah yeah you know you talk about gravity modification the implications are the modification of SpaceTime um and uh fast than light travel uh all that kind of stuff we can just deal with the sublight stuff and you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re dealing with uh I like I like your route that you&#x27;re dealing with uh artificial gravity systems on conventional spacecraft that seems safe um but yeah the implications are still there of uh uh the the modification of SpaceTime opens up a whole Pandora&#x27;s box of new not just technology but it changes the the changes the intuitive way we think about the universe this is technology that truly unlocks a a new reality for Humanity um it really does yeah yeah it it doesn&#x27;t make sense for us to behave in the same ways anymore um and and that&#x27;s what I hope is that we can we can walk equitably into this new future with as little conflict as possible because imagining that conflict is just you know you think about like nuclear war was bad enough right and every every day that goes by that we don&#x27;t have one of those is is a blessing right there&#x27;s so many Multiverse branches if you believe in everan uh that that have come and and so many simultaneous branches where it&#x27;s all gone to hell and we&#x27;re in one of the few that hasn&#x27;t so I count my blessings um yeah oh yeah I uh I I get into all of that I that that that part of me I don&#x27;t let out too much in public but uh uh but but the whole concept of probable realities and and uh the Eternal validity of the soul and all those kinds of things I I completely buy into it no I and and that&#x27;s it&#x27;s good for you to be honest like that I think um even serious scientists need to have an inner life you know um yeah and and the the Multiverse it hasn&#x27;t been readily proven but um I mean everan Solutions are one of the most most intuitive ironically and require the least amount of obfuscation as a solution to Quantum Mechanics um as far as I&#x27;ve heard and far as far as I&#x27;ve come to understand and also um allow us some of these nice things um like um they uh we they don&#x27;t require these positivity conditions because by having multiple time branches you don&#x27;t have to worry as much about closed Tim like curves um and grandfather paradoxes and all this kind of stuff because you just open a window to another universe and you&#x27;re not actually killing your own grandfather you&#x27;re killing adjacent you&#x27;s grandfathers no worries um it&#x27;s not a causality paradox doesn&#x27;t need to be included um so that&#x27;s we can we can have some nice things that way um even though a lot of people might not like it like you&#x27;re you&#x27;re creating all these universes like I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t create anything um you&#x27;re you&#x27;re creating issues uh for for that but yeah um I&#x27;d love to talk more about your your experiments though sure glad glad to good good to get get this other stuff out of the way though for sure yeah yeah absolutely so um uh we kind of walked into it during the pandemic uh when we were shut down and I had lots of free time uh it was it was wonderful I got so much done I mean the pandemic itself not Wonder it&#x27;s a great time for introverts the world over oh my gosh yes yes uh so um but anyway I was just going down a I do this pretty regularly just go down the rabbit hole on YouTube or other sources just to see what&#x27;s what&#x27;s new what&#x27;s interesting out there and and this guy did this simple trick with the soda straw um where he charged it up on his sweater he put it up on um a soda bottle and he explained that attraction he said most people just kind of dismiss it and say it&#x27;s static electricity and he said he said that&#x27;s partially true but it&#x27;s really there&#x27;s a body Force there called dielectrophoresis and then he explained it uh and he talked about how it&#x27;s done in medical applications and I I went and I started looking into that and realized that a lot of the applications of dialect FIS are in the hundreds of Volt range on microscales and I thought well shoot we routinely charge caps up to capacitors up to 40,000 volts and we have power supplies that go well above that I thought what can we do at that voltage you know and uh can we do large scale Aerospace applications with it so I started looking into it and tinkered with um High voltages to try to understand just to kind of gain an intuition for it and then wrote a wrote a model that that would uh allow me to calculate fields and stuff like that and eventually we got to where we could develop something that could cause a pendulum uh with different materials to to swing and we could quantify the force that we could generate on those objects and so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of how we walked into it we have thus far not seen any forward momentum on anything that we can tell uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s reciprocal in other words if if something swings this way there&#x27;s a pull the other way it&#x27;s just mechanically anchored to the ground or something like that so okay so it&#x27;s not like you haven&#x27;t been able to create a persistent thrust in One Direction um that that&#x27;ll like move a car or something like that it&#x27;s you create a Thrust and then observe the back swing so we haven&#x27;t tried too much of that simply because large scale electrodes that you insulate you know thoroughly with the right geometry it&#x27;s very time consuming and and we&#x27;re all under contract to do certain jobs and so we we have to do these small scale things and um and we&#x27;ve written some proposals to do larger scale stuff right um and like for example to NASA the NASA Innovative advanced concepts uh and we&#x27;ve proposed this concept twice as artificial gravity and uh lost both times I just we just lost again here and uh and it they they they yeah the the the awards go typically to mostly east and west coast that&#x27;s where most of the population is and uh but it&#x27;s always new sensors to do this new Mission or or or things there&#x27;s there&#x27;s very little really swing for the fences exotic stuff that they support they they do support some fusion I&#x27;ve won some of those you know before but uh it&#x27;s very very competitive and hard to crack in with something like this but I mean I don&#x27;t get it because we literally can demonstrate it you like why do you not want to try to do this I I I don&#x27;t get it at all it&#x27;s hard for them to wrap their minds around I think um and and maybe too good to be true uh you know as far as a lot of people might be concerned um yeah you know and and I I don&#x27;t want to un incredulously believe I&#x27;m giving my the game away and and how willing I am to to believe in Strange Magic um things but um that they they they&#x27;re missing out for sure um and uh so I&#x27;m I&#x27;m curious what so you you developed sort of a a um a dialectric surface with sculpy clay and you&#x27;re you&#x27;re coating that with um high high voltage uh electrostatic field and uh so how does how does the actual apparatus how do that set up sure uh so take take a take a high voltage power supply and you&#x27;re going to need some to see this you&#x27;re going to need something at least 10,000 volts okay um you can get one that&#x27;s UNM that&#x27;ll go up to about 60,000 Volts for pretty cheap on Alibaba Tesla coil basically Tesla Tesla coil uh does not work well for this because we actually have a really high-end Tesla coil and um we bought it with this in mind and it it doesn&#x27;t work well at all oh all right uh and the reason is because while it goes to really really high voltages um when you measure it with a a non-c contct voltmeter you&#x27;ll see the the high voltage is a short little Spike and it&#x27;s mostly at zero potential most of the time so it&#x27;s really loud makes lots of Sparks and it&#x27;s a great show but it&#x27;s actually not doing much at least at least it&#x27;s really noisy and it&#x27;s not so much signal um yeah okay so we we wna we want to work towards that again because maybe maybe a Tesla coil can be used to pump something up to really really high voltages if you can Rectify that or something so right to make it do more deliberate work and and less less showy like yeah I hate to go out down all these rabbit holes but there was that artist what was his name mark mandish or something mandish yeah mandish yeah that talked about how he he found out about these devices that use Tesla coils and high voltage plates and so I mean that that that in the that sits in the back of my mind as something that could could we it&#x27;s a complex story too some people say like he he he drew up some Concepts and like then he was going around different people saying like could this work this way could this work this way it&#x27;s sort of like um a little bit of a wishful thinking shopping uh trip you know and uh yeah and then so it it it it it may well be that he stumbled on to some interesting uh materials but it&#x27;s also uh highly likely that it was a little bit of subjective sort of gardening too so it&#x27;s a mixed bag there yeah well anyway back to your question anyway so high voltage power supply and you have the output in the ground so uh it doesn&#x27;t matter how you Orient it but uh take those two leads um and put one on one electrode and the other on the other and the electrodes need to introduce some sort of asymmetry in the system uh two plates is not very useful uh curved plates is better um something small like a stick and then another plate that that that also would be fine um but uh what you do is you coat those electrodes with uh sculpy or something to keep them from arcing right and then the electric field that&#x27;s left in the middle in between that volume the the curvature of those fields is what introduces the force so the force goes with the gradient of electric field squared so the electrostatic field is on the two adjacent like the curved curved plate over here and the stick over here but you&#x27;re you&#x27;re electromagnetic field is in the is in the actual space in between them is that what exactly so say take for example let&#x27;s say if I had a plate this my plate and then and then here was ground or something so you could kind of imagine that the field lines would kind of go up like that and down and there&#x27;s probably some fringing effects and so this this volume that&#x27;s that&#x27;s in here is where the force is and the force usually is to the sharper end where the where the field lines coal yes so usually the things are attracted towards that it&#x27;s not all cases are like that but that&#x27;s generally the case okay okay that&#x27;s starting to make a little bit more sense because the the the approaches I&#x27;ve you know like you you&#x27;re probably familiar with TT Brown you know he had a a dialectric surface and a ferromagnetic surface both of those and you&#x27;re sort of skipping the ferromagnetic surface almost entirely and just going with two different so that&#x27;s the dialect foris aspect is that where that name comes from so the dielectr freis aspect has to do with the way the force works and it&#x27;s mostly observable in dialectric materials so in other words in that space between your two electrodes in the volume you&#x27;ve got um uh if you have a molecule that&#x27;s an insulator of some type that it will polarize in that field and so your your molecule will flip and let&#x27;s say the sharp end is over here uh this side experiences a stronger electrostatic force with its charge Cloud versus this side which is in the weaker part of the field so it&#x27;s like a tug of w on that molecule and it goes that way okay so it&#x27;s a and that&#x27;s it&#x27;s really just an electrostatic effect um and it works best on dielectrics but you can make it work on Metals if you have an AC field which has pulses that are like half rectified or something so in other words if you don&#x27;t have a pure AC field won&#x27;t do it but if you use high voltage diodes and just get the top half or the bottom half then you can pull metals to one one side versus the other so it&#x27;s an AC field but it&#x27;s basically it&#x27;s behaving like pulse to DC in other words because you&#x27;re removing the other okay so it&#x27;s all DC in other words as far as the effect is concerned but you can get there with AC&#x27;s supplies okay that&#x27;s right yeah interesting okay cool um and who&#x27;s the the guy that that had the experiment that you mentioned with the bottle is what&#x27;s that his name or or YouTube handle um so I have not been able to find him after about the first year I I should have uh uh you know written it down or something it was just it scrub from YouTube yeah right right right yeah it it wasn&#x27;t someone that I recognized otherwise because I you know I&#x27;ve seen uh you know what&#x27;s it the what&#x27;s it the science Asylum and and smarter every day and yeah and you know a host of others kind of within that community that right right yeah and it&#x27;s not one that I no I mean they&#x27;re they&#x27;re pretty they&#x27;re awesome absolutely awesome but I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t see them scraping on this stuff yet no no no no um even plasma channel is he&#x27;s got some wild stuff out there but I and I would love to see him play start playing with with Di dialectric uh uh gravity um control stuff but uh yeah he knows where his bread is buttered um yeah I I I was a little bit worried about him when he started putting detarium in in an accelerator just because yikes yeah I mean you uh some of these guys take big risks yeah I mean it&#x27;s probably uh not a significant dose I I don&#x27;t know what what he actually achieved I haven&#x27;t watched his channel lately but uh but yeah you you really have to uh study that stuff a lot to understand like you know what the relative medical consequences are to your body if you what is the yeah what is the risk of of that accelerating detarium in that sense well if you accelerate detarium and it burns uh you you make neutrons and uh that&#x27;s beta Decay uh neutrons are Neutron Decay so you&#x27;ve got you you&#x27;ve got the electromagnetic spectrum which includes um X-ray and Gamma which are just you know G higher frequency than x-ray that&#x27;s the only difference H and then you&#x27;ve got um uh beta which are just electrons that pop off okay and that usually happens when a neutron under goes a Decay uh so the neutron pops out of or yeah Neutron decays in the nucleus the an electron pops out of it becomes a proton so it actually goes up in the periodic table a little bit like one step oh okay when it decays but those neutrons come out and they&#x27;re just like billiard balls and going straight yeah a neutron that comes out has a really high uh internal consequence on the body yeah it so it&#x27;s we get bombarded with everything all the time but it&#x27;s just a matter of the dose in the in the dose rate and so uh he&#x27;s probably fine probably yeah yeah it&#x27;s kind of like when um Nyla red a little while ago was playing with um atomic trampol and he made he was playing with brillium and um really hope he didn&#x27;t give himself bosis um oh my gosh yeah but um yeah these these guys they&#x27;ll do anything for a click um science safely everybody um but um no that&#x27;s that&#x27;s really cool and it&#x27;s interesting you um mentioned dierum because um you know I know you you&#x27;ve done some work in Fusion before um and um I wonder what your your approach has been or if you you know I I&#x27;ve followed uh helon a little bit that&#x27;s where I see the most promise uh rather than you&#x27;re you&#x27;re giving tox and stellarators going to do all this recreate the energy of the sun just to boil water I see that as kind of silly um but you might have different different feelings there more exti I&#x27;m sure well so so Fusion is is has been my bread and butter since 99 when I started a PhD and um I&#x27;m probably mostly known for Fusion propulsion although I&#x27;m uh one of the main uh theoreticians and modelers for a couple of different concepts that are out there and um my area of expertise is primarily in Magneto inertial Fusion which includes uh U Concepts like what helon is doing uh uh zap energy is another one uh helicity space which they you may not have heard of them um helicity is that h i t yeah helicity space they&#x27;re out in Pas Pasadena I think okay uh and then what&#x27;s another one and then a Pacific Fusion which is one that you haven&#x27;t heard you may not have heard of yet it&#x27;s kind of a new upand comer but they&#x27;ve got ties to Sandia and and I have lots of opinions about all of what they&#x27;re doing so okay yeah so you um seems like you you followed these these sort of things so you that that double magnet magnetic Helix sort of idea is is one of your your core ideas it sounds like that you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve worked on here and there maybe not uh maybe not that spe specifically but holis space they you know they they&#x27;ve got a long way to go before they get anywhere near Break Even but they&#x27;ve got a really good idea in that they um want to compress these Jets and store energy in the magnetic field as it twists up and then as it goes through a reconnection which basically means if you have magnetic field lines that are anti-parallel pointing in different directions when they reconnect they they curl back together because of the way the currents set up and start running like little Loops of circuit inside these plasmas they accelerate out and release a huge amount of energy so it&#x27;s like a it&#x27;s imagine like you&#x27;re trying to start a fire right um and all of a sudden you have all these matches go off at once in a mixture of butane and oxygen all over the place yeah so helicity is kind of doing that I saying it is one thing and then actually making experiment achieve that is another but but I think there&#x27;s a lot of potential in what they&#x27;re doing I think that zap energy also is getting really really close but I think they&#x27;re going to struggle to be Pro I think they&#x27;ll work I think they&#x27;ll struggle to be profitable um because they&#x27;re they&#x27;re basically a a pulse reactor kind of like Tok I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost like a sneaky way of doing a tokc because it&#x27;s the first thing that we tried was these Z pinches and so they figured out how to make them stable um but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really really hard to sustain that that level of current and uh not destroy your electrodes when you&#x27;re doing yeah and I I think that that helon is is um doing momentary pinches and then so it&#x27;s like a pinch boom pinch boom and then they&#x27;re cap capturing the the the electrons that are flying away from the reaction with the coils on the outside of it right that&#x27;s what I find most exciting because that&#x27;s a solid state energy capture just getting the electrons themselves out of it do you do you know more about that but doing there so it sounds like flux compression which is where the the plasma expands out and runs into to field coils or or it could be mhd generation I&#x27;m not sure which one they&#x27;re trying to do there but uh but helon has a really good really good concept um their reactor is not going to be High Gain the way they&#x27;ve designed it um and in order to get something where you have like a big yield that comes out from a small energy investment you have to have a liner around that event that you do that basically blankets the entire reaction and then as that reaction takes place and go the energy comes out it lights and burns a surrounding liner of fuel that then can you know make a lot of electricity so it it&#x27;s they maybe they have plans to do that in the in the long term but that&#x27;s you have to have that if you&#x27;re doing a pulse system in order to make it economical so if you were if you were designing you let&#x27;s say you had an infinite budget money is No Object you if you were designing a fusion power system for a let&#x27;s say a gravimetric um spacecraft that was going to Mars you know um or a low one of these low um low energy not low energy but uh uh sub subluminous uh subluminous warp drive craft you know um and you you&#x27;re doing a mission to Mars back what what would you design as a fusion drive system system there&#x27;s that&#x27;s a very good question um one of them that I think would work pretty well is something along the lines of a of a z pinch or a hybrid Z pinch with a liner that that burns around it um in fact we have a couple of proposals into uh NASA with some of our students where um how you turn a z pinch into a propulsion system has never been properly addressed and we kind of had a face palm moment um this past fall when we were talking about it because you think of a z pinch like this and then you think of your nozzle as axis symmetric around that and then you figure out well how do you get the circuit to come back and one of us thought what if we just turn it this way your and your feed to it is is is from the sides and then your nozzle is sort of like a uh like a planer Arrow what&#x27;s what do they call those types of nozzles Aros Spike nozzle or whatever where they kind of they&#x27;re they&#x27;re planer and go around it instead of axisymmetric so so that&#x27;s that was something we thought why didn&#x27;t we think of this before you know so so that&#x27;s something that we have proposed um the my favorite Fusion concept uh I can say very little about because that&#x27;s as a drive system or as a as a power system for an electromagnetic drive system or both both okay so so yeah basically if you have your Z pinch oriented let&#x27;s say this way in and out of the page and your nozzle is like that um so this thing goes off and then it explodes cylindrically outward um that plasma can run into field coils which can uh do what&#x27;s called flux compression it squishes the field and that can be picked up by those coils to recharge a uh faster Bank and and and and if it has enough energy it can do that and blast out that nozzle so you get propulsion and thrust okay that&#x27;s really cool yeah so it&#x27;s hard to make Star Wars stuff right there dang Millennium Falcon eat your heart out um yeah no that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s powerful stuff that&#x27;s that&#x27;s giving me goosebumps um I know some people that my my collaborators is going to love love this conversation um because we we just Jam about this stuff all the time um so man uh now in terms of like connecting this to other Concepts we already talked about like I&#x27;m sort of seeing like the the the compression you know maybe you&#x27;re not using um uh gravity uh gravity modification to do that compression but seeing that the compression of of elements as analogous to this increase in G and and um the expansion to the negative G so to speak uh maybe that&#x27;s not itself happening but uh would would um would these um dielectrophoresis or other other gravity modification approaches enhance the the effectiveness of these Fusion Technologies in any way wow that&#x27;s a great question and um I&#x27;m actually affiliated with a group that is looking at that um not it wasn&#x27;t my idea to combine warp drive and fusion together uh but this guy that leads it uh wanted to go that route he thinks that&#x27;s the best way to try to commercialize this stuff and so um while I thought that&#x27;s a little bit I mean Fusion is already so hard but we&#x27;re going to throw this on top of it but I I might be the the straw that breaks the camel&#x27;s back so to speak so I looked I looked into it and I&#x27;ve studied uh some of the properties that are anticipated by field Distortion if you want to call it that um so if you can create a barrier so that the let&#x27;s say the neutrons can&#x27;t get out uh that that&#x27;s a huge um breakthrough for Fusion not in terms of confinement necessarily but just the material challenges because even when we get these reactors working we&#x27;re going to have all kinds of problems because these neutrons come out and they&#x27;re like bullets just shooting holes in your structure and uh there&#x27;s nothing that can take a dyum tritium Neutron they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re just like these hyper velocity bullets that just damage your reactor you&#x27;d have to have have some yeah some kind of self-healing containment exact y uh so if you had like a some sort of field barrier that could make them you know bounce back in you know it would need to be gravity or something that works on the neutron you know because you can&#x27;t just have an electric or magnetic field they they just don&#x27;t care their their electric properties are so localized it&#x27;s practically neutral you know unless you kind of get down to their their scale um and uh so so that&#x27;s an interesting one also if you can um reflect the radiation that&#x27;s a huge one if you could with if you could hold all the energy in by like by having some sort of warp bubble so that it couldn&#x27;t get out uh imagine like you saw this and it just looked like this black hole sitting there you know but the reactor was on the inside that would be great because you could if you could slowly add energy into that in One Direction like with some sort of energy diode um then Fusion would be trivial concept connect to some of the um the alleged footage infrared footage of some of these UAP by the way that they really black hole you know that that&#x27;s cold from the outside instead of hot from the outside sometimes yeah but any I didn&#x27;t want to get off track no no no that&#x27;s okay so so yeah and and um the the other thing too is if is if you could do that and somehow the the field could be localized to compress and do work on that on that Plasma on the interior that would also be helpful yeah um so all those things are are possible or or all those things if possible could could help accelerate Fusion yeah and and as an experimental um offshoot of one one of the ways it just occurred to me to really prove this gravity modification thing is um like if you had an electron gun and you you could generate a a field that bent the electron gun or sorry Neutron gun you were able to to uh make a Bend in the in the neutrons The Arc of the neutrons that that could convince a lot of people that something real is happening versus like you know even if you were move a dangle a piece of chicken from a string and move that around that still got electromagnetic fields in that but if it was just pure neutrons and you were doing something that would make some heads turn I I feel um yeah that&#x27;s actually a proposal that that I&#x27;m working on with the group so oh really my predictive modeling is working yeah I know it&#x27;s spooky you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re tracking right in the same direction we are so to do that in algebra class all the time but I&#x27;m glad thanks for the ver vindication that I&#x27;m on the right track and not just losing my mind um I I I have four kids so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s how I lose my mind this stuff is where I feels sane um as my mom used to say insanity is hereditary you get it from your kids um no I love them but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re a good problem to have um oh yeah absolutely yeah no they&#x27;re the best the best kind of of of challenge but um no I love I love this stuff it&#x27;s so cool um yeah I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m almost out of questions um do you have any uh anything else you wanted to talk about and well I had some some some comments I wanted to follow up I I uh agree with you because you one of the first people that you mentioned uh is is s Jack sarfatti he uh he I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve listened to him and I tried it&#x27;s hard to find his his papers or his uh presentations but you can track them down uh he he speaks so confidently like oh yeah we got this next year we&#x27;re going to be flying around and you know how many years has it been you know we&#x27;re all optimistic about our things he&#x27;s been doing that he&#x27;s been doing that song and dance routine since the 70s it goes back yeah okay so that&#x27;s just him but but and also instead of papers he&#x27;s got long email Rants and uh no um but but uh but you&#x27;re right I so I I&#x27;ve um when I started to get into this stuff a bit more and I I thought okay well I need I need a foundation in general relativity boy that was a lofty goal um so I had a couple of books and I read through them and I didn&#x27;t do the derivations I just I try I mean I kind of understand the basics of the math and all that but I I tried to kind of get through all that to like what what&#x27;s this really saying you know like I forget all the massive details and and and how these C off symbols expand out into you know bajillion different permutations of you know partial differential equation terms like what is it really saying and all all it is is just you know curvature is equal to mass energy and there&#x27;s the coupling and his point is that that coupling constant is terrible but C&#x27;s not constant in matter I mean that&#x27;s the Crux of it right and so I uh I&#x27;ve kind of looked at all this and realized that even if it&#x27;s problematic to go down this route I really like the gravitomagnetic equations you know the Maxwell like equations instead of general relativity because even even though it&#x27;s like a solution in sort of like a linearized form it&#x27;s so much easier to work on and I think we can make a lot faster progress towards an FTL Drive someday working on something L simpler it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just a whole lot easier to get your head right around starting from scratch with Einstein we go straight to these modified equations are you familiar with Todd desiato no okay he yeah you should look into him he&#x27;s got um all paper uh warp drive from from Maxwell just from Pure Maxwell so oh boy I want dealing with the he he&#x27;s dealing with something he calls the egm electrogravitic magnetic Matrix um and uh yeah he&#x27;s yeah you&#x27;re going to like that one um he&#x27;s he&#x27;s an ape contributor off and on yeah somehow I missed that one yeah ien I haven&#x27;t watched lately sort of flies onto the radar he&#x27;s not too bombastic as a character uh just very nuts and bolts kind of guy U very straightforward but if you can get something by him I guess you&#x27;re on to something um because he&#x27;s very he&#x27;s a very he&#x27;s a pretty serious fellow but uh the fact that he&#x27;s playing with these things is a is a relief because it&#x27;s not all all us all us wild wild cats um not he&#x27;s one to look into what you said though reminds me so there&#x27;s a couple of people that have been U playing with Maxwell heavyside and and Einstein and streamlining it uh what do you feel how do you feel about how put off in the um polarizable vacuum uh concept um that one I haven&#x27;t I haven&#x27;t really uh looked at much um so I that that&#x27;s another one of those areas where I you know I&#x27;d have to I&#x27;d have to analyze is is the idea that you can say change the the vacuum potential somehow and give it sort of a gradient or a curvature very much exactly yeah yeah he just basically Likens um the curvature of SpaceTime to um to a gradient and electromagnetic potential uh and and basically links those those right up um and and I I&#x27;d be lying if I said that I understood all of this but I&#x27;m kind of like a script Kitty sort of playing with Concepts throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks um I&#x27;m more of a surveyor you know uh rather than an individual like I I I&#x27;m still deciding what Lane I really want to pursue and what framework I really want to get but I see like I said I see all these people that kind of are poking at the the the elephant the the blind men trying to feel up the elephant and the dark room you know um yeah and uh they all have a little bit of something but those are some Frameworks that can be helpful to start to grock this one uh and grock it thoroughly we will um so uh one of them that has not been explored much lately uh but was by winterberg who his name kind of popped up like I I I actually knew uh Dr winterberg through his Fusion uh papers and seeing him at conferences I talked to him on a few occasions and and there&#x27;s there&#x27;s almost nothing I&#x27;ve done in Fusion that didn&#x27;t have his name on a paper and something that I was doing I mean he he is just part of that dialogue um but he comes up in t towns and Browns work too I think that&#x27;s the thing is like I had no idea he had this other side of him looking at all of this stuff and so I got a copy of his uh his book on the what&#x27;s it called the plank hypothesis um and I can&#x27;t say I understand all of it plank ether hypothesis that&#x27;s it yeah okay and um um but the idea of negative Mass I think is very very intriguing um there&#x27;s a paper by a guy named Bob forward you probably have heard of him uh Robert forward uh who who did all kinds of different creative uh Advanced propulsion Concepts but one of them was on a negative Mass propulsion system and I&#x27;m not so interested in the ones that could warp SpaceTime and create like a push pool thing with two big gravitational masses but but something where you had negative mass and positive mass and tension like a rubber band between them I think is kind of interesting something like that because that&#x27;s a practical could probably do it in your garage sort of demonstration yeah and and negative mass is now doable like it it there&#x27;s a if you if you build you can you can make materials that have that property under certain frequencies that&#x27;s that&#x27;s been out for about 12 years now oh okay so that&#x27;s accepted um interesting interesting because I I keep hearing like if you even poked around this sort of warp drive and stuff uh people are like well you need netive mass energy and uh that&#x27;s super difficult to do and we&#x27;ve never found it and so that that that&#x27;s BS I guess um they&#x27;re all they&#x27;re trying to throw sand in your face um yeah so but um do you have any reference to the the the paper or the study that showed showed that or uh oh the one that that makes I&#x27;m probably include a list of links in my in the video description when I do this um as much as as much as I can yeah let&#x27;s see let me uh I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll share this with you Google simultaneously yeah um I mean there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s there&#x27;s quite a few papers on it they&#x27;re not in the context of propulsion so I&#x27;m I&#x27;m kind of giving away something that I think is very valuable so okay so but but feel free to look into it uh because I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m my goal is to actually do something meaningful enough that I give another Apec talk and I&#x27;ll probably give an aiaa talk on it as well um yeah yeah and where where is the oh I see I&#x27;ve got a couple of um yeah I was gonna I offered up in Apec talk too that Tim put out a call for more um more material recently I don&#x27;t know if you got his email but I did I just I don&#x27;t have anything to say yet so yeah I was gonna do like a survey of you know the General State of Affairs with all the different approaches yours be very valuable yeah kind of a state-ofthe-art talk you know um and another one eventually on uh life uh biology is a function of entropy reversal and uh planetary control sort of as like this is something that happens on planets in order to optimize climate and um and keep things from just drifting into chaos um but yeah those those are a couple and I I may end up I I&#x27;ve been I may have been asked to uh moderate the open mics um okay yeah so um Tim&#x27;s got a lot on his plate and uh yeah and he he&#x27;s he&#x27;s Contin he&#x27;s still G to be way involved but though um that&#x27;s uh the and I have some experience there um doing those kinds of um talks and and I literally have uh work experience in in in managing and moderating zoom conferences on a more open sort of level yeah so that might be pretty cool it&#x27;s a lot but I&#x27;m willing um yeah yeah so it&#x27; be exciting if you could get another talk together I highly encourage yeah yeah it&#x27;s going to take me um a good four months of just slowly working towards something to to see if I if there&#x27;s a enough there and I don&#x27;t want to give a talk until I have an experiment so I&#x27;ve already purchased everything I would need to do or most of it so but it&#x27;s a matter of just you know putting it together and all that sort of thing but um well poop you could you could just give one on the Fly about Fusion any day of the week I&#x27;m sure um you know but it would be cool the your your your your uh magnum opus I believe is this this gravity control stuff it would be really cool to see more yeah yeah we we&#x27;re we&#x27;re trying to We&#x27;re just trying to get all of this funded at a level like what I need is a full-time person in lab but it costs 300,000 a year uh at the University to have a good person you know to do that because otherwise it&#x27;s just me you know around teaching and then our undergrads and grad students it&#x27;s just hard to make progress but um I I wanted to ask uh so during the Apec meeting there those guys running their Labs what who who are they what what is that like is that some kind of Consortium like who&#x27;s that trust Falcon space are you talking about Mark and and uh Jared and so forth I guess yeah um well you besides Drew obviously has his own thing going on right um that yeah and and Falcon space is another thing I&#x27;m not entirely sure I think that they have some uh fund funding um and um it&#x27;s independent um that&#x27;s about all I know uh and that so they they&#x27;re they&#x27;re an independent uh research Consortium that um I think Jared&#x27;s affiliated with Mark and ver um and then Jeremiah pop has his um thing also and I don&#x27;t think that he&#x27;s Falcon space I think he&#x27;s also got his own thing and I think he has a private funer um to just play you God I wish I had that kind of right I know God send me a wealthy benefactor so I could just play with gravity all day and night please um I I promise I&#x27;m not going to radiate my children um right or myself uh know that that would be so cool um and I I think that they&#x27;ve got something going on there but the basis of that uh financially I couldn&#x27;t shake a stick at it&#x27;s a question for them pretty KY about it oh I&#x27;m sure yeah no they they seem like a very very bright you know highly engaged people it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s good to see that there are folks like that that have like dedicated resources they&#x27;re going they they&#x27;re they&#x27;re playing with just about everything that comes across the desk uh you know just try trying this and that um more or less throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks um I kind of wish that they would uh go heavy into one particular thing and and push that but the problem is who who knows what that is right who knows what ends up panning out right so yeah that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re trying everything I think that the other day they were they had something some massive experiment where they were trying to replicate the 3M event I don&#x27;t know if you what that is they were they they made a massive um uh tape reel basically with connects in their lab and um some massive voltage applier um and and they were applying electrostatic voltage to to this tape that was going around and it was just something to see man um and uh and sending B like pingpong balls through the field to see if their trajectory altered but they they were doing it live and it was nuts um but man like talk about a dream come true to every like tinkering kid that that like yeah wish they could just play with conect all day in their laboratory I&#x27;m jealous I&#x27;m JY honestly yeah no but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re s super cool um another well they one thing they did recently is sort of um soft replicated the be field Brown effect and um vacuum chamber oh um yeah they had this sort of a pair of thrusters that were going around um on um not a pendulum but it was like it was it was Direction thrust around in a circle um and um they took all the energy or they took all the the air out of the chamber it&#x27;s kind of in a in a a bell shaped chamber um clear so you could see into it yeah yeah and these two little rocket looking th things going around into Circle um and allegedly they were using just electrostatic control of the BFI Brown effect um and they were differentiating that with um ion propulsion in that like apparently uh according this is according to Mark um the ion ion field propulsion Works oppositely to bfield Brown effect they they require the same basic materials to do but um the ion so if you if there&#x27;s air in the chamber and he showed this live if there&#x27;s air in the chamber uh the the whole thing moves in an opposite direction really that&#x27;s interesting chamber and the other way and less with less speed but there was definitely movement so was able to show the the the difference between ion propulsion and weell brown as as as alleged so that was very cool was this was this uh all these demonstrated in recent like Apec meetings that are on YouTube yeah I&#x27;ll have to check it out it&#x27;s in the recent I think it was last month um yeah yeah and they were they were demonstrating that live um I think a few of them met up in New Jersey um Jared and Mark and I think Tim was there and Dan Davis was there and a few people actually collaborated on this rig was pretty cool um so it&#x27;s definitely a group a group group Spirit project and to to make this thing um now the one thing that might uh seemed a little I was still they have a had a red cord going around it around the outside and that seemed to me like some people that might might think that you&#x27;re doing electromagnetic propulsion there um might might think something about it but they said that was just to control the kolom attraction um and uh take take some arcing potential off um they needed to do that but the whole thing seemed really really interesting and the fact that it changed Direction when they took the air out that&#x27;s unexpected yeah yeah yeah so that that that that BS the question about like potential actual applications for this technology if you have a a bfield brown Thruster on on on like a EV tall or something like that um if You&#x27; have to um invert the the the the voltages in order to like if you&#x27;re going from atmosphere to um out uh in space or if you would have to enclose that some how inside of your like inside of the fuselodge of your that would really be uh demonstrative of Principle as well if you you had a Thruster that wasn&#x27;t even connected to the atmosphere right it was just enclosed in something um with its own shielding and it was just creating thrust and like the the this direct Center of your craft or something like that um but like if you or you had to I was talking about this with some people um like if you had to vertically flip your thrusters like you had ion thrusters and then when you got the space you&#x27;d vert vertically flip them around yeah to make it work but yeah or just maybe just reverse polarity if that works yeah that too yeah um much much easier than TR developing a whole physical flipping system but it&#x27;s exciting stuff yeah like the a lot of the the the claims that have come out over the years uh and this includes like like the what was it the Q Drive the one that that sunny sunny did you know they all produce like just like these microns of thrust which could be you know handwaved you know into anything um but if you can get something where you can observe motion like that that that&#x27;s that changes it if you can get into the mill Newton up to Newton range um you dramatically change it so even if on the ground it&#x27;s not strong enough to say replace uh a vehicle or helicopter or plane or whatever uh my gosh out in space uh if you suddenly have the ability to not require propellent the rocket equation just you just completely sidestep it and your your final burnout speed is limited to how much energy you you carry on board if it&#x27;s a reactor you could go I mean you could go sublight speeds over time anyway and there there&#x27;s real application there too I think that&#x27;s where Charles and Drew are having their um their their most promising potential application is in keeping satellites in orbit without you know propellant right so when when satellites run out of propellent you you&#x27;re I&#x27;m sure you know they they have to just basically crash them but that uh apparently I&#x27;ve heard is causing uh damage it&#x27;s renewing damage to the uh ozone layer so having all these starlink satellites in orbit and we&#x27;re crashing them all something about I think magnesium burnup in the atmosphere causing ozone depletion so there&#x27;s real sustain sustainability implications to being able to get uh propellantless drive system embedded in these U these um satellite applications even if the Micron Neons of thrust over a long period of time that builds up right so they can um even even their system has some promise but especially if you can if you can show a result and yeah again with the human psychology you know you could show lines on a graph or you know on a reader and person if a person knows what they&#x27;re looking at they could say oh wow that&#x27;s really interesting show me more but most people will be like I don&#x27;t see anything and just seeing the motion seeing something moving um you know that&#x27;s your Kittyhawk moment so to speak right um yeah that you you really need to get people on board the money people um you know that&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of a a chicken in the egg situation it&#x27;s like how do you get there without the funding why do you get the funding until you&#x27;re there it&#x27;s really tough that&#x27;s I feel like a big part what a lot of what people chalk up to some sort of conspiracy not that there isn&#x27;t some sort of conspiracy but a lot of that probably is just how difficult it is to do this stuff it is and get enough results to get more money to do more stuff um that oh yeah yeah absolutely um so I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re busy I&#x27;m gonna have to go shortly but just before we go um You&#x27; mentioned uh uh gerer so you think he&#x27;s right you think there&#x27;s going to be this big disclosure I think I uh my friend Dan um Davis said recently put it very very well he said disclosure is a process not an event and I feel that very strongly uh there could I mean that could be what what we&#x27;re seeing with the the the drones multiple kinds of drones and and uh we&#x27;ve got techn drones that appear to be man-made technological that are exhibiting some sort of possible gravitic propulsion we have the plasmoids and the UAP all in the same breadth of time and space up there um and that is some sort of soft disclosure um whether it&#x27;s being readily explained out there in the media uh it&#x27;s definitely causing people to have a second look at all this uh so I don&#x27;t know what all exactly is goingon to happen Trump said that he&#x27;s gonna release some stuff once you know on the 21st he says I&#x27;m GNA you have how many drones I gonna gonna put it all out there you&#x27;reall gonna be so amazed at how many drone stuff um but I I don&#x27;t know um exactly and and everybody I think the one thing I can say for certain is that everybody who thinks that there&#x27;s going to be some massive drop and like you know just basically Jesus parting the clouds for disclosure I I don&#x27;t believe in that anymore um of course I&#x27;m I&#x27;m open to be being proved wrong and of course now that I&#x27;ve said it like that I probably will be KN knowing the universe and it&#x27;s how how it likes to treat me um to be like see here bam and I&#x27;ll be glad if that happens but right oh yeah yeah I think um it&#x27;ll be this unfolding process and and what we&#x27;re doing is a part of that um uh growing to understand these Concepts as uh private citizens uh is as a big part of uh of that uh because we&#x27;re bringing the the you know bringing the stuff that you see up there down to earth and explaining it in terms that we can understand whether it&#x27;s being done by extraterrestrials or or other humans from our own timeline or other humans from other timelines or other um species that of of terrestrials and maybe not human that have evolved on other parallel timelines or once you open the back the the Pandora&#x27;s Box to um like I said gravity modification SpaceTime manipulation Clos time like curves not meaning much Multiverse travel it it all like you know you deal with the uh the Penrose diagrams and uh taking a fast than light drive a scant to an event horizon and do a couple of things like that you&#x27;re into bridging into other universes and stuff and um the implications of that is is is it&#x27;s hard to track what&#x27;s coming from where and when um could be all of the above and we just um it&#x27;s it it could that&#x27;s where it gets really really weird um and and uh but we can we can make that make sense we&#x27;re on to something you know um I kind of feel like uh the the way science fiction and other blockbuster movies have uh evolved over time that that that&#x27;s served a purpose whether there was an intent behind it or not that uh first you had things like Star Trek to kind of get his thinking about you know extraterrestrials and stuff and then you you fast forward to Marvel and and DC and everything is a is another reality or Another Universe and and it kind of warms people up to that gets it in the Zeitgeist so that if it actually happens it&#x27;s like oh well that&#x27;s kind of like that time that yeah yeah you know their favorite hero does something yeah um and it it very much it be like that um and there could be something there uh there&#x27;s a lot of people in Hollywood that might know something or they&#x27;re just you know trying to get us ready I know the CIA and other groups have a huge effect on on the release of of various things something that Oppenheimer um said shortly after the atomic bomb um became a reality and they were dealing with the implications of the new world they created uh something like um about about dealing with the implications of this new Buck Rogers uh world that they were living in now you know um and people bring that up as uh soft evidence that he knew about UFO Landings or something like that but um you know and and that could well be but but perhaps you know he was privy to um the the weirdness of it all right um where the implications of of um modifying SpaceTime uh could be that you the simple explanation would be extraterrestrials from another planet right but where it gets weird is uh terrestrials from this planet but different timelines um and the same the same technology like if you want to go to another star system you&#x27;re going to need some sort of FTL probably some sort of work drive the implication of that being though that you could just as easily potentially go to other timelines of this planet and that could be you know in terms of traveling to another viable uh version of Earth uh another viable planet for our species let&#x27;s say we reach a point where life on Earth is unsustainable God forbid we don&#x27;t figure out the climate crisis we don&#x27;t figure out the pollution crisis we need a fresh slate right much easier because if you if if you know anything about a strong the idea of finding an adjacent Earth out there with the right Gravity the right chemical mixture the right atmosphere the right biosphere um not to mention if you go to a completely Alien Planet you just touch down if you don&#x27;t have some sort of air filtration every virus every Spore everything on that planet is just going to attack you right out the gate and you&#x27;re going to have the equivalent of a a beasting allergic reaction just turn you inside out basically um but that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily happen if you go to you know TR Earth adjacent you know coming from a branch 300,000 years ago you know let&#x27;s say where humans went extinct dur during the Toba eruption or something like that didn&#x27;t end up handing out entirely possible entirely plausible um but then you play that the other way around with beings from other more successful branches where they did develop gravity propulsion or SpaceTime propulsion already coming here and that&#x27;s you know what we could be seeing um out there and and knowing the the implications of if if any of this warp drive stuff is is in any way true these are the implications in my opinion uh and that&#x27;s not weirdly that&#x27;s not that far out um and uh so if if you&#x27;re not dealing with that you&#x27;re not looking at the full breadth of the issue um and then you know the the the whole you know being an astronomy class be like what do you think about UFOs and them saying well it&#x27;s an issue of how they would get here um that kind of goes out the window right right could be everywhere every every when and even some from here um just which which here are you talking about I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m repeating myself but you get it I&#x27;m glad you get yeah it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s all good and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m 100% with you on on this yeah I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t sound like a crazy person to the science guy that um no but um yeah I appreciate you dude um I&#x27;m glad we had this talk I&#x27;m glad to have another one anytime soon um and uh keep in touch about what you&#x27;re up to and and likewise if I ever get any uh lab experiments going I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll be touching base with you I&#x27;ll definitely be picking your brain on on experimental design when I get closer to building some of these things myself yeah well if if you&#x27;re doing anything with with high voltage uh we we might be able to lend a hand or you know make some suggestions that it sounds like that that that uh that group that&#x27;s that is always available on on Apec is they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they really know their stuff that&#x27;s a talented group yeah they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re I&#x27;m glad to hear you say that they&#x27;re they&#x27;re doing the thing doing the dang thing yeah um and you are too so you know funding is the issue and um you know maybe you want to do some crowdfunding or something um I have a little bit of experience there oh cool and uh I&#x27;m also a web designer and craft designer concept artist and and different things too so um I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be collaborating down the down the road um I I hope so you&#x27;re you&#x27;re fun to talk to you you know I&#x27;ve learned a lot just listening to you You&#x27; got a lot of insight especially into uh a lot of these characters you know like um but and by the way the paper that I&#x27;m starting with on negative Mass I I sent you the um the title and then the the two lead authors on it uh there&#x27;s there stuff s and these are materials people they&#x27;re not thinking about propulsion but um that&#x27;s to to me that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where the interesting connection is between that stuff and then Bob forward&#x27;s concept so that&#x27;s kind of where yeah I&#x27;ve opened several tabs while we&#x27;ve been talking yeah um yeah uh Graham Milton is the one I found on modifications of Newton&#x27;s Second Law and linear continum elect elasto Dynamics cool stuff um and I&#x27;ll be looking into all of this and I&#x27;m equally as excited about uh Desi aut that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a rabbit hole I have not gone down before so I&#x27;ll have to dig into it and see what he to say I&#x27;ll have to find um find his paper I&#x27;ve got a large collection of papers here in my um in my hard drive and I&#x27;m not sure where to find it exactly um but yeah if you want to just Google um um warp drive from Maxwell&#x27;s equations you&#x27;ll probably and Desi Auto I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it um very exciting stuff well I gotta I gotta I gotta drive my little guy to to preschool and do my day but Absolut really fun this is awesome we&#x27;ll do it again soon take care good to talk to you man likewise have a good night all right bye bye</p>
