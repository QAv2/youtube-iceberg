            <p>THAT HAD US TRENDING ON TWITTER LAST NIGHT. I MEANT ACTS TRENDING ON ACTS. YOU WHISTLEBLOWER DAVID BRUSHES PEEVED TO SAY IT DIPLOMATICALLY ABOUT THE MASSIVE PIECE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION CALLED THE 2024 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT OR AS IT&#x27;S EXPECTED TO GO TO VOTE THIS WEEK. YES, THE BILL LACKS A CATCHY NAME AND YOU MIGHT BE INCLINED TO FILE THAT UNDER IMPORTANT BUT BORING. BUT FOR ANYONE WITH AN INTEREST IN THE U F O QUESTION MANY OF YOU, IT&#x27;S CRUCIAL.</p>
<p>THE SO-CALLED IN DA AUTHORIZES A NATIONAL DEFENSE BUDGET OF 886 BILLION DOLLARS. BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ALSO HOPING THE PENTAGON WOULD DISCLOSE MORE ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT KNOW ABOUT FOES OR PEAS, THE GOVERNMENT&#x27;S PREFERRED ACRONYM. IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT AND PERHAPS NO ONE WAS MORE DISAPPOINTED GRESH HIMSELF. THE MAN WHO HELPED RAISE AWARENESS OF YOU A PIECE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC INTERVIEW. AND LATER IN SWORN TESTIMONY BEFORE CONGRESS WAS REFERRING 2 KEY PROVISIONS THAT WERE KILLED FROM THAT LAST WEEK.</p>
<p>ONE CALLED FOR A PROVISION FOR EMINENT DOMAIN WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT THE GOVERNMENT. WHAT HAD CONTROL OVER ALL NON-HUMAN TECHNOLOGY PRIVATE COMPANIES. THE SECOND PROVISION, A 9 PERSON PANEL WOULD HAVE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW ALL THE RECORDS RELATING TO NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE AND IMMEDIATELY DECLASSIFIED THAT MORE DISCLOSE THEM. THAT&#x27;S NOT HAPPENING NOW. IN PART ONE OF MY INTERVIEW WITH BRUSH YESTERDAY, HE SAID THOSE MEASURES NOW DEAD.</p>
<p>THE PUSH FOR DISCLOSURE HAS BEEEN DEAT A MASSIVE SETBACK. WE&#x27;RE WITNESSING RIGHT NOW IS QUITE FRANKLY, I&#x27;M THE GREATEST LEGISLATIVE FAILURE AMERICAN HISTORY. YOU KNOW, YOU HAD A VERY STRONG AMENDMENT. FOR GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY ON THIS ISSUE, WHETHER YOU BELIEVE I AM MY ALLEGATIONS GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY ISSUE AT LARGE. RUSSIA ADMONISHED CONGRESS FOR KILLING THOSE KEY MEASURES THAT HE SAID WOULD HAVE HELPED BOOST YOU AP PUBLIC.</p>
<p>BUT THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER. GRESH SAID IT&#x27;S UP TO YOU. THE VOTERS TO VOTE OUT. THE LAWMAKERS WHO HAS SQUASHED THOSE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED TRANSPARENCY. MORE IMPORTANTLY, GRESH SUGGESTED THAT THE FLOODGATES MAY SOON BE OPENING.</p>
<p>HE TOLD ME THAT HIS CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY HAS INSPIRED OTHERS KNOW ABOUT THIS ALLEGED SECRET UHP PROGRAM. HERE&#x27;S PART 2 OF OUR IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW WITH UEFA WHISTLEBLOWER DAVID GRESH. EVEN WHEN YOU FIRST TALK SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, YOUR SAID YOU HAD SPOKEN TO ABOUT 40 PEOPLE WHO HAD PROOF THAT ALIEN SPACECRAFT, NON HUMAN REMAIINS. IN THE PAST MONTH SINCE THEN, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY MORE TESTIMONY TO SUPPORT THAT OR ANY FIRSTHAND ENCOUNTERS WITH INFORMATION? I&#x27;M AWARE OF SOME OTHER FIRST 10 INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT DID THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY YOU KNOW, COURSE, I&#x27;M NOT PRIVY TO PRECISE COMPLAINTS YOU KNOW, I&#x27;M RECIPIENT OF THAT, BUT I DO KNOW OF A COUPLE OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE KNOWN TO ME THAT THAT DID GOOD. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AFTER MY MY TESTIMONY THE SUMMER SO YEARS, TESTIMONY SPARKED OTHER PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD WITH THEIR STORIES OF WHAT THEY&#x27;VE SEEN IN THE SECRET PROGRAMS.</p>
<p>YES. YOU RECENTLY DID AN INTERVIEW JOE ON HIS PODCAST AND YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU BELIEVED THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS KILLED PEOPLE FOR TRYING TO GO PUBLIC WITH THE STORY. THOSE ARE CONCERNS THAT A CERTAIN SCIENTISTS ON THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE KNOWN TO MEAN, YOU KNOW, PRESENTED THAT TO MYSELF. BUT I DID DIRECT TO THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES ON THAT. THAT&#x27;S SOMETHING THAT I SOMETHING EXPOUNDS BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THAT.</p>
<p>YOU KNOW, I DIRECTED THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES SUCH AS THE INSPECTOR GENERAL&#x27;S AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. I CAN&#x27;T SPEAK TO THAT BECAUSE THAT&#x27;S SOMETHING THAT THEY EXPOUNDS AND I DIRECTED THREAT. AUTHORITIES, OTHER PEOPLE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THAT, NOT IT&#x27;S THINGS UP IN MY PERSONAL LIFE THAT, YOU KNOW, MORE SOME OF THE CAUSAL FACTORS FOR ME TO FALL COMPLAINT, THINGS IN MY LIFE. AND NOTICED A SUMMIT IMITATION. I CAN GET INTO THAT INFORMATION TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND HOPEFULLY THEY&#x27;VE REFERRED TO APPROPRIATE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL.</p>
<p>BUT I DISCUSS THAT PUBLICLY BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVE NATURE THAT FOR MY OWN PROTECTION AND FOR THE INTEGRITY OF THE INVESTIGATION. YEAH, BECAUSE IF IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE THAT IN THE PAST WITH PEOPLE WHO&#x27;VE TRID TO EXPOSE THIS YOU PROGRAM, WHY ARE YOU STILL ALIVE? YOU&#x27;VE DONE MORE TO EXPOSE IT THAN ANYONE ELSE. WELL, THAT&#x27;S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WENT PUBLIC. AND CERTAINLY I WAS SHOWN THAT&#x27;S, YOU KNOW, THEY CAN TOUCH ME ANY TIME. AND THAT&#x27;S WHAT LED ME SO NOT ONLY CONTACT.</p>
<p>MY FORMER AGENCIES OCCUR IN A COUNTER INTELLIGENCE WITH YOU KNOW WHAT I WITNESSED MY PROVIDED EVIDENCE TO THAT FACT THAT FILED THE COMPLAINT AND CERTAINLY GOING PUBLIC WAS THE FOR ME FOR MY OWN PROTECTION. SO, YOU KNOW, FOR A LOT OF REASONS I WANTED TO ALSO DIRECT YOU TO SOME VIDEO THAT WE&#x27;RE GOING TO SHOW YOU FROM APRIL OF DIRECTOR SEAN KIRKPATRICK PRESENTED THE WORLD WITH THE VIDEO THAT WE&#x27;RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT. DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME OF THESE UNRESOLVED CASES THAT ARE INDEED FROM NON-HUMAN THE CO-LEAD AT THE NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY FOR YOU, AP, THERE WERE CERTAINLY A LOT UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS, ANOTHER MAN PLATFORM VIDEOS THAT, YOU ANALYZED A LOT OF IT WAS HIGHLY ANOMALOUS THERE. WE CAN COME DOWN TO A DEFINITIVE ANSWER WITH SOME OF THE THE CASES WHICH COURSES CASES ARE CLASSIFIED. SO TALKED GENERALLY, I&#x27;M DEFINITELY SHOWED A LOT OF DIFFERENT THE SAME MORPHOLOGY ZAHN AND OTHER OFF CHARACTERISTICS THAT DIDN&#x27;T COMPORT A KIND OF KNOWN THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW MY TEAM WAS FAMILIAR WITH, BUT I THINK THE JURY&#x27;S OUT ON I REALLY HOPE THAT ARROW IS INVESTIGATING THOSE WITH, YOU OFFICE.</p>
<p>KIRKPATRICK IS STEPPING AS IN THAT FROM LEADERSHIP OF ARROW. WHAT&#x27;S YOUR REACTION TO THAT? OF COURSE, I&#x27;VE DOCTOR KIRKPATRICK FOR MANY YEARS. I BELIEVE HIS LAST DAY WAS DECEMBER FIRST AND HIS DEPUTY. TIM PHILLIPS IS CURRENTLY FILLING IN AS THE DIRECTOR ROLAND. I THINK WE NEED TO AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE I CERTAINLY PROVIDED THIS YEAR.</p>
<p>SENATOR WAS MY PICK A FORMER INDIVIDUAL WHO&#x27;S VERY SENIOR IN THE PENTAGON, THAT ICE TO WORK FOR AS A POTENTIAL DIRECTOR VERO. BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO. FIND SOMEBODY THAT AMERICAN PEOPLE OR NOT SOMEBODY CALLS ORAL TESTIMONY, NOT NOT CREDIBLE, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT DOCTOR KIRKPATRICK SAID RIGHT DURING IS A TESTIMONY FOR THE OVER AM. YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE DEFENSE CONTRACTORS THAT ARE HOLDING SOME OF REMNANTS OF OF SPACECRAFT OF 7 TO TRY AND THEY WORK SO THAT THEY CAN CREATE. BRAND NEW STATE OF THE OUR WEAPONRY.</p>
<p>YES, I MEAN, THAT&#x27;S DEFENSE CONTRACTOR BASED DOES ALL METAL BENDING WORK, IF YOU WILL, FOR THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX, STOP THE AGENCIES THEMSELVES THAT TYPICALLY DO THE PERFORMANCE THING WE THINK IT&#x27;S THOSE DEFENSE CONTRACTORS LIKE LOCKHEED MARTIN, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE OTHERS THAT HAVE CUSTODY OF THESE REMAINS, NOT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OH, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, HARRY REID SPECIFICALLY SAID LOCKHEED MARTIN, AND THAT IS A DISCLOSURE HE MADE 3 NEW I BELIEVE THAT WAS IN MAY 2021, WHERE HE LITERALLY DISCUSSES LOCKHEED MARTIN IN THAT TO THE JOURNALISTS WROTE THAT ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORKER. WELL, THERE&#x27;S BEEN ALLEGATIONS THAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE BEING PAID OFF BY DEFENSE CONTRACTORS.</p>
<p>I MEAN, ONE OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS THAT WATER DOWN THE DEFENSE BILL, THAT WHAT FOR RELEASING INFORMATION HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF CAMPAIGN DONATIONS FROM MAJOR DEFENSE CONTRACTORS. YEAH, THAT&#x27;S YOU LOOK AT A DONATIONS WITH SOME OF THESE REPUBLICANS. YOU KNOW, IT&#x27;S THE BIG 3 THAT HAVE TYPICALLY DONATED TO SOME OF THESE BIG COMMITTEE CHAIRS, RIGHT? YOU&#x27;VE THAT WAS MIKE ROGERS. JUST HOW YOUR LIFE HAS CHANGED SINCE YOU WENT PUBLIC WITH ALL THIS SINCE IT WENT PUBLIC. CERTAINLY THIS IS A NIGHTMARE FROM EMAILS.</p>
<p>INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, 14 BEHIND THE CURTAIN, IF YOU I NEVER WANTED TO DO BUT MY SENSE OF SERVICE. YEAH, YOU KNOW, I DECIDED TO DO THIS FOR THE FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. I THINK HOLD CONGRESS ACCOUNTABLE, HOLD THE IG ACCOUNTABLE IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE WE HAVE A SEVERE COSTA TO CRISIS RIGHT NOW. THIS IS THIS IS NOT A LAUGHING MATTER. WE HAVE A SEVERE OVERSIGHT ISSUE WHERE WHERE THERE&#x27;S A CASTE SYSTEM OF PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS MOST LIKELY WERE ABUSING THEIR AUTHORITY UNDER THE UNITARY IS A THEORY THAT THE PRESIDENT, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, IS ULTIMATE POWER.</p>
<p>AND WITH THE STROKE OF THE PEN, CAN YOU KNOW THE SIDE CERTAIN THINGS? SO I THINK WE HAVE A SEVERE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION PROCESS. WE NEED YOU KNOW, STARTING THIS COUNTRY AND HERE TO HELP THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AND I&#x27;M TOTALLY ADMONISHED PEOPLE. AND I WANT TO BE, YOU KNOW, A TOOL FOR CHANGE HERE. SO I&#x27;M I WANT TO HELP THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION, IF NOT, WE NEED TO MAKE IT TO THE VOTING OUT THESE PEOPLE AND I THINK NEWS NATION SHOULD POST A LIST OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS FOR THAT MATTER THAT ALLOW THEIR CONSTITUENCIES TO DECIDE IF THESE ARE THE KIND LEADERS THEY WANT HINDERING TRANSPARENCY AND THROUGH A DIPLOMATIC, A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE 2024 ELECTION. WHEN YOU GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF OFFICE.</p>
<p>AND FURTHERMORE, WITH THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, MIKE TURNER THE CHAIRMAN. I THINK SOMEBODY LIKE MIKE GALLAGHER WHO&#x27;S ON THE COMMITTEE IS THE FORMER MARINE CORPS INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. HE TAKES THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY. HE SPOKEN OUT ABOUT YEAR. PEOPLE LIKE MIKE TURNER WHO SAY I I DON&#x27;T KNOW DOESN&#x27;T KNOW WHAT HE&#x27;S TALKING ABOUT.</p>
<p>A FOX BUSINESS REALLY WELL. MIKE TURNER HAS NEVER BEEN AN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. HE&#x27;S NEVER SERVED IN THE MILITARY. HE WAS THE MAYOR OF DAYTON BEFORE HE CAME IN CONGRESS. HE&#x27;S A JUNIOR PERSON.</p>
<p>IN TERMS OF THAT. THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE I GAVE HIS COMMITTEE 5 HOURS TESTIMONY. LAST DECEMBER AND MIKE TURNER STAFF NEVER INVITED ME BACK FROM WAR. THEY WERE INQUISITIVE UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE MORE BROADLY, A MORE IN-DEPTH AND THERE&#x27;S THERE&#x27;S PROBABLY A REASON HIND US I JUST DON&#x27;T WANT TRANSPARENCY ON THE MATTER, QUITE FRANKLY. DAVID GRESH, GREAT TO TALK TO YOU.</p>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON.</p>
