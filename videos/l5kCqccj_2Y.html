            <p>so let&#x27;s say you have something that would fit on a little table and it&#x27;s a generator and it&#x27;s pulling energy out of What&#x27;s called the quantum vacuum or Zero Point Energy field and when you tap into it you&#x27;re tapping into this energy field that can be converted to electricity or thrust that was mastered decades ago a device that would not be very expensive frankly to mass manufacture that would generate all the energy they need for all the needs that we have for a modern civilization and this would be wonderful there&#x27;s no pollution there&#x27;s no radiation and once you have the system there is no cost the bad news is that if you&#x27;re an oligarch controlling the macroeconomic system you know if that technology were to be disclosed it&#x27;s oil gas coal Public Utilities that are obsolete it&#x27;s a you know it&#x27;s a quadrillion dollars it&#x27;s a thousand trillion dollars or more that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re protect</p>
