            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>going back to the early 1900s where you get these repeating stories of a farmer saw this silver object in his in his field. He went out to the object. There was a little man next to it. Little man saw him and then jumped in the thing and took off. This is like from the Kansas local town paper.</p>
<p>Right. Before they even knew what these things were called in the early 1900s, this was going on. You have this story in um Zimbabwe of the aerial school where in a beautiful movie made of it where 60 children uh black and white at this interracial school something landed near their schoolyard and these little guys came out thought at them. What a fascinating story. A psychiatrist from Harvard, John Mack, went and interviewed them and he&#x27;s a specialist in child psychiatry and said, &quot;These children aren&#x27;t lying.&quot; They ran into the school, you know, told the teachers.</p>
<p>Teachers came out, teachers didn&#x27;t say anything, but then the kids drew what they saw. The story is all corroborated. And these are like six to 10 year old kids. I I you know, who just don&#x27;t have it in them to lie like that. 30 years later go back to these kids who are now grown up and they say, &quot;Yeah, it happened.</p>
