            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Let&#x27;s go. I finally got invited to play PUBG Black Budget and I&#x27;m excited to try this out. It&#x27;s like an extraction shooter but for PUBG battlegrounds. And it&#x27;s so cool how we kind of go through these phases in gaming, right? Where like this kind of genre just takes over. You get so many games just pumped out in that niche.</p>
<p>First, we had that battle royale era where you had PUBG, you know, lead the way for battle royale to follow like with Fortnite and Apex. We had the whole era of this year with the rogue likes mega bomb, you know, kind of copying Vampire Survivor. We had that ball rogue like all kinds of rogue likes just kind of coming out non-stop. And then now we have an extraction shooter kind of meta. We&#x27;re kind of seeing a lot of games follow suit of.</p>
<p>Obviously we had Tarov and stuff like that already, but this year we had Arc Raiders really take the gaming scene by storm. Now PUBG, you know, kind of going full circle, starting that battle royale wave, jumping on the extraction wave. I always did love PUBG back in the old days when it first came out trying to play to get that chicken dinner. Um, so I am kind of curious to see how they handle an extraction version of that. All right, so now we can choose our background.</p>
<p>It could be a spec ops, a secret agent, or a mercenary. Oh, that&#x27;s kind of cool. you kind of like, you know, your history or your work history, my resume. [laughter] Okay. All right.</p>
<p>So, do I want to be spec ops? You left war behind. The only thing you ever known. [laughter] So, we got lore. So, when you approach about this classified op, you didn&#x27;t hesitate to dive back into the fray. Oh my god.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like one of those movies where the guy retires, but they need it for one last job. Oh, yeah. Okay. Who is it? We need you. We&#x27;re going back to Kalahar.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m in [laughter] one last job. All right. So, we have the spec ops, the secret agent. Let&#x27;s see what this one is. After neutralizing a high value target, you were about to lay low with an encrypted message on your burner phone presented an irregular opportunity.</p>
<p>All right, so secret agents, spec ops, and then we have the mercenary. All right, so the mercenary, private security, VIP extractions, but Republic Coupe, you&#x27;ve seen it all, but can prepare you for the wildest job yet. Okay, [laughter] I think I want to be the spec ops guy who was like retired, got to come here for one last job. Yeah, we do this one. It also does tell you what like weapons you get too as well.</p>
<p>So, let me see. So, can I see all of them at once? Yeah, we can. Okay. So, the spec ops, you get the AKN12. It&#x27;s like a like an AK.</p>
<p>Then we have the um SMG MPX9 for the secret agent and a shotgun for the mercenary. I kind of do like SMGs. I&#x27;m a big fan of SMGs. I might just go with the secret agent for that reason alone because I do like this gun more than this one. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of AKs too much.</p>
<p>All right, let&#x27;s go with the secret agent. &gt;&gt; Kohley Island, a former military base [music] turned into a top secret facility by Colonel Industries back in the 50s. Colonel recruited the best mines and took them off the grid for their black [music] budget initiative. Sapiens. Billions were poured into classified projects, experimental tech way ahead of its time until 2002.</p>
<p>Something went haywire and the island was trapped in a time loop. &gt;&gt; Oh, you heard that right. Once the secret got out, some pretty big players started circling cuz now the Colonel&#x27;s artifacts are lost to time. They&#x27;re up for grabs. Your mission is simple.</p>
<p>Enter the loop and extract the goods. Once you get to the other side, you&#x27;ll land on the coast. Outer areas are mostly residential and hold limited [music] value. Main research facilities are located further inland behind the perimeter fence. Now that&#x27;s where the real secrets lie.</p>
<p>And the best kept secrets fetch the most. But there&#x27;s a catch. The anomaly. A shimmering mass that consumes the island and mutates all living matter. This is where the life support device comes in.</p>
<p>Every time you deploy, your PLSD injects compound S, [music] a gene stabilizing serum. &gt;&gt; The T. Remember, the juice is only effective outside the anomaly, so stay away from it. Most importantly, make sure you get the hell out in time. Get yourself killed or miss the chance to extract and you&#x27;ll lose everything.</p>
<p>When the loop is reset, it flushes everyone out, back to where they entered, back to 2033. We ensure ceasefire outside Coley at the Stigian Haven [music] and your personal bases around it. But once you cross the killing horizon, anything goes. There are no rules, no comms, no backup. Make every loot count.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s kind of cool. Like this room training sim. You&#x27;ll see what it&#x27;s like on the ground. &gt;&gt; All right. Dope.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go. We got to find a weapon. Okay. Yeah, the colors are so vibrant on this island, too. Looks like really nice.</p>
<p>[panting] [gasps] Damn, bro&#x27;s out of breath. Working that cardio, man. All right, here we go. We can load our magazine. Okay, nice.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s our magazine. All right. Dope, do Oh, wow. Put the bullets inside the the magazine, too. I like that.</p>
<p>All right, let&#x27;s go. Oh, a better gun. Oh, let&#x27;s go. Better guns, baby. Give me those mags.</p>
<p>All right, fall damage. Damn, he got bodied, bro. What do you have on him? All right, security vest. Take all of his stuff, too. Get a helmet.</p>
<p>Oh, nice. All right, let&#x27;s heal up. [sighs] Oh, what the hell? Oh, it&#x27;s a damn Jaguar. You stupid. &gt;&gt; How are you not dead? You still alive? Oh no, he&#x27;s dead.</p>
<p>[laughter] He just died standing up. Goddamn crazy Jaguar. We can search him. What do you have on him? We can take his his cap whiskers. Take Why would I want his whiskers? Why would I take this? We can take his whiskers.</p>
<p>All right, so Oh, it&#x27;s a crafting material. You can use this to craft stuff. What are you going to craft with a damn cat whisker? What the hell? What are you crafting with that? All right, I guess I&#x27;ll take it. You never know. We&#x27;re going to need a cat claw.</p>
<p>Okay, I guess. Yeah, that&#x27;s what I thought. Break yourself. Maybe. Okay, got more stuff.</p>
<p>A game console. Some wine, too. Oh, let&#x27;s go. All kinds of goodies. I found a um a camera, some heels, some bomb, more heels.</p>
<p>Okay. A pager. Oh, no storage. Damn. Where you out of space? HDD.</p>
<p>What do I download? Is it in here? Maybe. All right, we got it. We can extract now, too. Right. All right, we got the data.</p>
<p>What do I do? Do we leave? Oh, it&#x27;s locked. Okay. The window. Let&#x27;s go. Extract.</p>
<p>I enter AUV. Oh, what&#x27;s going on? You crazy, bro? Look at you now. Are you crazy? Taking stuff. Taking stuff. All right.</p>
<p>Now we enter the AUV to extract. Okay. Is it this? All right. So, wormholes. Activate a wormhole.</p>
<p>If you cannot get to an AUV, you can try to extract into a a wormhole. It&#x27;s so trippy to see PUBG take this kind of like sci-fi route. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of crazy. All right. Wormholes take time to open.</p>
<p>Have to be activated first by anybody to extract. Okay. All right. Ready to go. Oh, wow.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s like an actual like you can walk around and stuff, too. It&#x27;s not only just like it&#x27;s not a menu where you kind of just like select your game mode. You&#x27;re actually in a real deal base. Okay. Let&#x27;s see.</p>
<p>Where do I go? Am I Batman? Why is there bats in the base? [laughter] Alfred. Alfred. Yo, it&#x27;s so dark, bro. Yo, give me a goddamn flashlight. All right, so base management.</p>
<p>Oh, we have to actually like upgrade the base and like manage it the whole nine yards. Really? All right. So, cop station. Okay. We got our stash.</p>
<p>All right. Let&#x27;s see. Hold on. All right. Cop station.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m excited. All right. Here we are. Holy crap, it&#x27;s so colorful here. Damn, my computers.</p>
<p>I need RAM inside this crate, bro. [laughter] We going to need it. Let&#x27;s go over here to these buildings. The hell? Who&#x27;s shooting already? We just got here. Let&#x27;s go check it out.</p>
<p>Oh god. Goddamn Warthog. Get away from me. Oh my god. Goddamn cougar.</p>
<p>We got a car. We could drive in this game. Wait, we could drive? No way. I could drive in this. Get away.</p>
<p>Look at you, idiot. What are you doing? God, I want to drive the car. All right, hold on. Can we drive this or what? I don&#x27;t think so. I guess you got to drive the car, I guess.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. Got some metal. Not much in here. Some plastic. I&#x27;m more scared of wildlife than real players at this point.</p>
<p>Oh, see I I say see. God damn it. Oh, hello. Hold on. Let&#x27;s go see what&#x27;s going on.</p>
<p>Was it a jaguar? Oh god. No. Oh, it&#x27;s gone. I was Oh, more shots and more animals apparently. Oh my god.</p>
<p>[laughter] Get away. No, I don&#x27;t want to kill you. Go away. God damn it, dude. Go away.</p>
<p>How many jaguars are running around this these this forest area? God damn. I should reload, baby. I don&#x27;t know. Get a whole clip ready just in case. All right, this is a pretty big area.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go and spoil some of this. What do we have here? Some clothes. Oh, here we go. Oh, nice. Bunch of stuff.</p>

<p>They got to be close. They got to be so close. [panting] Those shots sounded so close, bro. Where are they at? Those shots are like like right next to me. Hello.</p>
<p>I will say the game looks beautiful. Like I like the color. It&#x27;s very vibrant. I love the the map. All right, let&#x27;s see.</p>
<p>All right, I&#x27;m over here by the the Watts quarters. And we can extract over here. That&#x27;s so far. There&#x27;s one over here, too, actually. Okay, nice.</p>
<p>Oh, wow. Hold on. Hold on. That&#x27;s so close. They going to get busy.</p>
<p>Wait for me. You scared me. Is he dead? The fence block it. I don&#x27;t know. Oh.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not sorry. [laughter] Yo, look how he died, bro. [laughter] Give me your stuff. Oh, yeah. Oh, he had a nice AK.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#x27;ll take that AK, buddy boy. You don&#x27;t need that. Where you going? Got all your little stuff. Give me all your stuff, bro. He had a a antler in his bag.</p>
<p>What the hell? All right, let&#x27;s see. What else could I bring with me? Um, have no space anymore. That was easy. You got slaughtered, bro. All right, so I&#x27;m already full on material.</p>
<p>My backpack is full. We got to go. We got to extract. Let&#x27;s get out of here now. Oh, I killed this guy.</p>
<p>[laughter] He might have friends. I don&#x27;t know. We got to get out of here, dude. All right. Where&#x27;s the nearest extraction point at? All right, hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on. Let me see. Damn, this is kind of far, bro. Yeah, I might have to mark this. All right, let&#x27;s go towards that.</p>
<p>We have a lot of stuffs. I want to extract now. We We just killed We just killed that dude. Took all of his stuff. You have a lot of stuff on us already.</p>
<p>Oh crap. It&#x27;s like a war zone out here. We got to go. All right. Come on.</p>
<p>Come on. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s here. I think so. Listen, don&#x27;t mess with me. I already killed the guy.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll kill again. [laughter] Oh, god damn it. I want to get out of here. Safe and sound. You hear me? All right, let&#x27;s go.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go. Now, what&#x27;s scary is too, somebody could be waiting for me at the extraction point trying to ambush me. It could be a trap. They could try to ambush me at the extraction point. We go over here.</p>
<p>Oh crap. Leave me alone. You serious? What&#x27;s wrong with you? Leave me the hell alone, man. This is so far, bro. Oh crap.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re right there. Listen, that&#x27;s between you guys. I&#x27;m going to keep walking with my stuff, okay? Hey, don&#x27;t mess with me, bro. All right. How far are we, dude? We&#x27;re so far.</p>
<p>[snorts] Yeah, we&#x27;re still pretty far for Oh, wait. There&#x27;s one over here. Right. Oh, there&#x27;s one over here. Hold on.</p>
<p>Oh, crap. There&#x27;s people here, though. Is it worth it to go over here to this one? I might just go to the one I marked because like there&#x27;s people here fighting. I don&#x27;t want to risk it, you know? Is it worth it? How far is this thing? It should be right here to extract. Oh, it&#x27;s right there.</p>
<p>Oh crap. Let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s go. Get me out of here. Come on.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re so close to the extraction point. I want to kill them, but I want to be I don&#x27;t want to be greedy. Let&#x27;s not be greedy. Let&#x27;s just go. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Should I go? Should I go over there? No, I&#x27;ll just leave. Let&#x27;s just leave, bro. I&#x27;m out of here. I&#x27;m out. I extract.</p>
<p>There we go. Boom. We did it. In and out. I had to take one life.</p>
<p>One life. That was it. In and out, baby. There we go, baby. One player kill.</p>
<p>That poor guy. I mean, I don&#x27;t know if he was Philly or not, but it&#x27;s so hard to tell because by the time you know if they&#x27;re filly or not, it&#x27;s too late. He could have killed me and took my stuff. I had to do it. I had to kill him.</p>
<p>So, we killed one player and then four animals out in the wild. They kept attacking me. I don&#x27;t want to kill those animals. They were attacking me, bro. But, I do like it&#x27;s fun, man.</p>
<p>This game is fun. I do like when this kind of thing happens where you kind of get like a rush of a lot of games in the same genre. you know, the extraction uh shooters are now really popular cuz I feel like if you get more good games like this, it pushes the other ones to do better and innovate and make their games to do more better. Nothing wrong with healthy competition, you know. So, PUBG jumping into the fight and dropping their own extraction shooter is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>I This was fun. It was a lot of fun. Are you going to try PUBG Black Budget when it comes out? Let me know. I mean, I think it&#x27;s pretty fun. And obviously, in a day and age where we have so many options in front of us, it&#x27;s good to have a mix of things to choose between and I have a monopoly between like Tar Golf and Arc Raiders.</p>
<p>So, PUBG jumping into the mix. It&#x27;s about time they kind of like, you know, copy somebody else because they got copied so hard with four letter Apex. Let them have their fun. [music]</p>
