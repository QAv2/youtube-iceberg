            <p>all right how&#x27;s everybody doing today uh welcome to my channel and U I&#x27;m getting this going a little bit late today uh today&#x27;s been one long emergency for that for me to tend to and so this might be a little bit shorter video but uh we&#x27;re going to get something accomplished anyway uh this is an educational Channel and we attempt to uh shed light on some of the great theories of everything from days gone by and uh today is the 33 331st video that we have done on the reciprocal system of theory from Mr dwey B Larson Mr Larsson was an engineer that lived in the 20th century and died in 1990 uh from 1930 to 1990 he worked out his reciprocal system uh the first half of which he was pretty much using a process of induction to uh take his uh initial epiphanies and turned them into his two fundamental postulates that summed up his reciprocal system and then the next 30 years he spent uh uh writing books uh taking his two postulates and turning them into a theoretical Universe from which he wrote uh many books and many many articles uh that are some of them are I think quite fantastic uh in the ab uh his ability to probe into any subject physics and chemistry and astronomy and economics biology and philosophy and religion and psychology and um the basic uh his two fundamental postulates the first one is the most important and it is basically that uh you know the universe is not made out of matter and the universe is not made out of energy either but the universe is made out of motion and in particular the universe is made out of three dimensions of discrete units of scalar motion now what that basically means is that uh and then that motion is the relationship between space and time and so what that basically means is that uh space and time are reciprocals of one another they do not exist in and of themselves but they only exist together in motion and motion is more or less a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator and uh space and time come only in discrete units meaning that they are quantized there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you ain&#x27;t got nothing and if um you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light which Larsson refers to as unit speed and um unit speed is basically the background of uh the reciprocal system universe and so half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light uh which is blasphemy to the Orthodox scientists out there uh who follow Einstein who said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe for Larson the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe or the null point the state of rest the origin the zero point the uh ether of the universe and half the universe is moving faster than speed of light half of them which Larson refers to as the cosmic sector half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light which Larson refers to as the material sector and the material sector is the half of the universe that the scientists are familiar with and uh they make their where they make their observations and measurements and uh but fortunately the cosmic sector is a reciprocal of the material sector and so you can understand through extrapolation what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector simply by inverting the roles of space and time when you cross over that border and uh you can kind of see what I mean once you understand that space and time both have their coordinate aspects uh three dimensions of space XYZ coordinates and three dimensions of time which is an unfamiliar concept and uh that is called coordinate time but then space and time also uh have their uh scaler or what Larson calls their clock aspects clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and later and um but not in any particular direction and uh clock space which is an unfamiliar concept um but basically space is getting farther and farther and farther apart parts and this was actually uh observed by the Hubble telescope which observed that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and it also can be envisioned uh using a balloon with dots on it you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other that&#x27;s basically uh clock space or the progression of space or the flow of space so if you&#x27;re in the material sector you&#x27;re dealing with a world uh world that we&#x27;re familiar with a world of three dimensions of space and uh clock time the clocks always getting later and later and later but then if you cross over to the cosmic sector you&#x27;re dealing with three dimensions of time coordinate time and and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart so you can see that uh in the cosmic sector you uh you can understand the cosmic sector by simply inverting the roles of space and time from what you see the relationships are in the material sector okay now today uh with that uh fairly quick summary uh hopefully we might be able to flesh it out out here a little bit um today is the second episode of going through Larson&#x27;s article called the search for the ultimate and uh so we if you want to if you want to get the first half of this paper uh Watch yesterday&#x27;s video and then so today hopefully we&#x27;ll be able to wrap up this article the search for the ultimate and uh in the beginning of of the article he just talks about how um you know uh the scientists of the past uh had their various debates about what the universe is made out of um and you know um it went from the you know the four elements earth air fire and water and uh the Chinese had um uh fire water metal wood and um Earth and um then the Greeks kind of came around and had and they had the atom so the universe of matter and then some other people came around and they proposed the universe of energy but then there were SE several several uh scientists in the past who proposed a universe of motion um but they they couldn&#x27;t get their Theory off the ground because they didn&#x27;t have a good uh definition of motion so that&#x27;s where Larson sets himself apart from them is that Larson defined motion as the relationship between space and time and so I&#x27;m guessing that in the second half of this article he maybe flushes out some of this here we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll uh read the last few sentences of the of the previous and then move on indeed none of them really got off to a good start these are the the motion motion people um none of them really got off to a good start but the complete failure of the present day concept of a universe of matter to meet the tests of validity makes it imperative to continue the efforts along this line of a universe of motion and and call for a more Critical examination of the obstacles that have hither to prevented taking advantage of the potential that is inherent in the concept of a universe of motion this is the background of the research on physical fundamentals that I and my associates have undertaken and on which we have spent a great many years in essence what we have done is to locate the error that has stood in the way of developing a viable theory of a universe of motion this error We Now find is at the very base of the currently accepted theoretical structure a mistake has been made in the definition of motion one that excludes most of the basic motions of the physical Universe the prevailing view is that every motion is characterized by a magnitude and a direction and can therefore be represented by a vector in a spatial coordinate system like the Assumption as to the fundamental status of force this definition of motion persists only because no one has questioned it as soon as the issue as to its validity is raised it can easily be seen that the definition is much too restriced there are observable motions that have no inherent Direction dire for instance all of the distant galaxies are observed to be moving away from our location at high speeds unless we make the assumption that our galaxy is at is the only stationary object in the universe an assumption that was repudiated by science long ago this means that we are also moving outward at away from all of the other galaxies that is we are are moving outward in all directions and since it is concluded or since it is conceded that our galaxy is not unique it follows that all galaxies are moving outward in all directions if these were ordinary vectorial motions the only kind of motions currently recognized by science the Motions in all directions would cancel out and there would be no actual change in the position of any Galaxy but the measurements of the Doppler shift in the frequency of the radiation that is being received from the galaxies shows that they are actually receding from us and therefore from each other such a motion in all directions has no specific Direction it is a scalar motion one that has no property other than a positive magnitude represented as an outward uh movement in the reference system we encounter the same kind of motion in gravitation if we visualize a group of gravitating objects scattered in space and far distant from any other aggregate of matter we know from Newton&#x27;s discovery that each of these objects is moving toward all the others in this particular case then gravitation is also a scalar motion not merely the equivalent of a motion as asserted by Einstein the gravitational motion of these objects differs from the motion of the galaxies only in that it is negative inward in the reference system whereas the galactic motion is positive outward in the reference system so that gravitational motion would be like taking that balloon with dots on it and sucking it in instead of blowing it up you know you suck it in and all of the dots are moving toward each other and that is AA gravitational motion an inward scalar motion this brings up the question as to the nature and function of the reference system we are accustomed to identifying motion by change of position relative to some identifiable objects that we regard as Motionless in ordinary practice the surface of the Earth and those objects that are motionless relative to the Earth&#x27;s surface are the reference objects for scientific purposes we recognize that these objects Define a reference system to which we can relate the various motions for mathematics medical treatment on the basis of the prevailing definition both the magnitude and the direction of motion are specifically related to the coordinates of the reference system and are independent of the location from which they are being observed if object X is seen to be moving due north when viewed from point A it is also seen to be moving due north when viewed from any other point B providing that the observations are accurate in both cases but as we have just seen this is not true in the case of scalar motion the direction of a scalar motion depends entirely on the location of the reference point in the galactic case if we designate our galaxy as a the direction of movement of Galaxy X as we see it is ax but but observers in Galaxy B if there are any see Galaxy X as moving in the very different direction BX those in galaxy C see the direction as CX and so on in the galactic case the location of the Observer is the reference point but in the more General situation the reference point is determined by other considerations for instance the Motions of spots on the surface of an expanding balloon constitute a scalar system of motions for which the reference point is the point on the balloon uh that is in contact with the surface on which the balloon is resting in a gravitational system the reference point is usually determined by the location of the largest object in the system which is immobilized by its own inertia we thus can see the identification of gravitation as a scalar motion is not confined to those cases where the gravitate gravitating objects are free to move in the reference system all particles and Aggregates of matter are moving gravitation irrespective of whether or not they change position in the context of the spatial reference system observations show that the magnitude of the gravitational motion is a measure of the amount of matter that is the mass from a theoretical standpoint the mass is usually identified with the inertia but the inertial mass and the gravitational Mass are numerically equal which indicates that they are merely two different aspects of the same thing the finding that gravitation is a motion explains this identity gravitation is the motion itself inertia is the resistance that this motion offers to an opposing motion matter then is a form of motion as so many investigators have long believed furthermore when the gravitational force is identified as the force aspect of a scalar motion it can be seen that the forces due to the electric charge and its magnetic counterpart have the same general characteristics as the gravitational force the characteristics of scalar motion it follows that these forces too are properties of hitherto unrecognized scalar motions thus recognition of the existence of scalar emotion unites matter and the forces that act on matter all physical entities and phenomena are motions combinations of motions or relations between motions the universe in which we live is a universe of Mo okay that is the end of the article the search for the ultimate by Dy bson author of the reciprocal system of theory and that&#x27;s one thing I didn&#x27;t mention at the beginning you know I was saying that uh you know um the Ancients used the four or five elements as the you know ultimate um you know the ultimate thing that the universe is built upon um and then you know the Greeks came along with the matter concept Adams and um Einstein and his his crew had uh some of them thought that it was energy but then there was also force and that&#x27;s you know he talked about how Einstein spent the last 20 years of his life searching for the uh unified field the unified force field Unified all of the forces gravity uh electricity magnetism the weak nuclear force which is uh you know just a madeup fudge Factor uh for their own ignorance and same with the strong nuclear force and uh Einstein felt that all these forces would somehow be able to be uh unified uh and larsson&#x27;s basically just saying they&#x27;re barking up the wrong tree because uh force is not the ultimate thing on which the universe is based it&#x27;s motion and force is just a kind of motion in in the reciprocal system all motions have space or time coordinates so speed is space over time acceleration is space over time squared uh force is the conjugate of that time over space squared energy is time over space matter is time to the thir power over space to the Third power inertia gravitation space to the third power over time to the third power pressure is time over space to the fourth power um you know capacitance is space to the third power over time um resistance is I think uh time to the second power over space to the third power um and on and on and on um so that&#x27;s kind of how it works I hope uh this was somewhat enlightening to some people and uh we will be back with uh another article tomorrow thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
