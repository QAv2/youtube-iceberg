<p>say, &quot;Hey, Xander, welcome back to the night shift.&quot; &gt;&gt; Hey there, &gt;&gt; your safe space for talking about UFOs, UAPs, NHI, disclosure, and uh everything else. That&#x27;s I Is there anything else going on? I don&#x27;t know. Um, yesterday at February 19th at 6:13 p.m., Donald J. Trump tweeted the following. Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War and other relevant departments and agencies to begin the process of identifying and releasing government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena, and unidentified flying objects, and any and all other information connected to these highly complex but extremely interesting and important matters.</p>
<p>God bless America. marking what may very well be official presidential disclosure and confirmation of uh non-human intelligence both uh existing and also here and and some of this technology in our own possession. It&#x27;s a huge huge huge story, an enormous news event and uh we&#x27;re going to dive right into it. So let&#x27;s say hi to the panel. We&#x27;ve got everybody today.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s up guys? Yo, &gt;&gt; what&#x27;s happening? What a day. &gt;&gt; What a what a what a seven day. What a week it&#x27;s been since our last show. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been saying that [ __ ] for two weeks straight, bro. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; what a day.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; My god. Yeah, my phone was blowing up. You guys were all texting me, texting each other. Everybody&#x27;s texting. Um, what do you make of it? Is this for real? Is this real life? Did we just get disclosure? It&#x27;s pretty insane that uh in in a six day span, you had one former president saying aliens are real and then six days later the current president basically saying the same thing in a roundabout way, which is uh it&#x27;s astounding.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s never happened in the history of the country where any kind of president has confirmed aliens directly, UFOs plenty of times, but aliens is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s insane. Pavo, what&#x27;s your take? &gt;&gt; Well, uh, about seven months ago, I this article on Lespresso came out on the Italian Journal and it talked about how Trump was allegedly briefed uh, about Project Preserve Destiny that he knew about this stuff. And I want to give a shout out to Craig Oliver from the Magenta 33 group because on that day I called him up and I was like, &quot;Dude, can we do an impromptu thing about this stuff?&quot; And if you guys go back to that interview, he said a lot of things that are now like becoming true and it was really wild to see it. Um, and I don&#x27;t know what to make of it. I guess that we will need to see how the process goes if it&#x27;s done right.</p>
<p>Um, and I know that a lot of people are probably going to scoff at this, but we can&#x27;t stop asking about the Epstein files. &gt;&gt; It has to go sim simultaneously. You know, &gt;&gt; both things are really important. I think that both things might be connected even in many ways. And a lot of those redactions from uh both files, if we find correlations, please don&#x27;t be surprised.</p>
<p>I think there might be correlations there. &gt;&gt; Eric, you&#x27;ve been gone for a little while. Welcome back, by the way. It&#x27;s great to see you, my friend. Um, &gt;&gt; you picked a great week to to drop back in.</p>
<p>What do you think about uh what&#x27;s going on? &gt;&gt; Trump is speaking. They say &gt;&gt; he&#x27;s speaking now &gt;&gt; in the chat. I&#x27;m sorry, Eric. I just &gt;&gt; Trump&#x27;s in the chat. &gt;&gt; Trump&#x27;s in the chat on the night.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hell yeah, boys. &gt;&gt; Is he speaking? Is there a White House Somebody said that Trump was speaking right now in the chat. &gt;&gt; Have a look into it. Um, &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; For anybody who thinks my camera is a little bit pixelated, I&#x27;m on potato internet, so apologies.</p>
<p>Uh, it&#x27;ll be better by this time next week, but uh, yeah, just you you can deal with it. There&#x27;s more important things going on. Uh, I&#x27;ll try and find a link. &gt;&gt; Eric, uh, what what do you think? What do you make of this? &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is all very interesting. And I remember we had a conversation a couple months ago about somebody promising something or or something coming out.</p>
<p>And you may recall my go-to response is only two words and two syllables and that is we&#x27;ll see. &gt;&gt; So I&#x27;m not exactly sure what we&#x27;re going to see. Um I&#x27;m very pleased with this. Um, I&#x27;m really interested to see what we&#x27;re going to see if it&#x27;s uh because we have a lot of really good material out there already that have gotten people more interested in general, but it isn&#x27;t like the nail in the coffin or something like that. So, you know, for example, when the Hellfire missile struck an orb, you have a lot of people saying that it was a balloon, you know, or or it just doesn&#x27;t generate general interest.</p>
<p>So, we have these hearings and we have fleer videos and we have testimony, etc., etc., etc. The bar now is so high to have something released that really jumps this thing forward and I don&#x27;t know what that is going to be. Um, I&#x27;m guessing testimony, maybe some military reports of interactions with UAPs. If we could see some more videos and photos, that&#x27;s cool, too, because if the videos and photos, I do usually don&#x27;t put much weight on them, but if it&#x27;s coming from the White House, you can regard it as real. So, overall, I think this is really good, and I&#x27;m just dying to know what they have and what they&#x27;re going to show us.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Xander, you have a kind of a nuanced take on this. What what do you think about just going on in terms of like the way the events played out? Um it&#x27;s clear to me that this is kind of like fumble disclosure. Um but I think the &gt;&gt; I think a very specific set of circumstances likely contributed to this. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s the president. He&#x27;s a busy guy.</p>
<p>Um I think he likely had knowledge that Obama had appeared on a podcast um and had said that aliens are real. I&#x27;m not sure he knows or knew at the time that Obama had then clarified the following day that he was speaking out of generalities. So for all we know, Trump was under the impression that Obama really did say some divulge some classified information. There was only like a day in between, right? So I&#x27;m I&#x27;m right now I think it&#x27;s just miscommunication. miss he was mis he he he hadn&#x27;t caught up on his daily news at the time when he was asked.</p>
<p>It was very clever the way the question was worded. And that right now is kind of the way that makes sense in my head because Trump had a golden opportunity in that question to just say, well, he was just speaking out of generalities. That&#x27;s what he said. But he didn&#x27;t say that. He said &gt;&gt; he dulged classified information.</p>
<p>So I Yeah, that that&#x27;s my working theory right now. &gt;&gt; Like no one reads the retraction. They they read the they you know, you saw the the post because that&#x27;s the thing that went viral. But yeah, the &gt;&gt; exactly. I don&#x27;t think he saw the the rebuttal or or the the rescending of &gt;&gt; uh &gt;&gt; [ __ ] Wouldn&#x27;t that be the ultimate &gt;&gt; whoopsy daisy? &gt;&gt; Not only a whoopsy daisy, but like way to just hand the ball right back to Obama after all this time.</p>
<p>I mean, if he really did bait Trump, &gt;&gt; dude, it was massive. &gt;&gt; Do you think it was intentional, anybody? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I personally I think I do. I think uh not to jump right in, but I think uh when a president or former president is interviewed, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any curveball questions. Every question has to be, you know, uh pre-agreed upon. They know what&#x27;s coming.</p>
<p>They know how to answer. They don&#x27;t want to be ambushed with some, you know, [ __ ] question that puts them in a bad spot. He knew what was coming. He knew how to answer. And I think he knew that he was either gonna one steal Trump&#x27;s thunder on the whole UFO thing um and two back him into a corner brilliantly and I think I think both might be true.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And so Dan or or anyone would that suggest that &gt;&gt; let&#x27;s just say this genius chess move was pulled off by Obama which is quite possible. Does that mean that he is interested in disclosure because he knew the outcome would be more information? You know, it&#x27;s like a casual comment, but if we&#x27;re going to go with this theory where &gt;&gt; it would lead to something else, that would have me believe that he is pro disclosure. &gt;&gt; Could be that &gt;&gt; Obama. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. I mean, Obama has spoken about UFOs on James Cordon, however many years ago, and uh answered it very honestly with no laughs, no smirks, no jokes, &gt;&gt; uh which was awesome at the time. So, I think he whether he&#x27;s interested or not, he at least respects the topic and respects the conversation. So, I don&#x27;t know. Good question.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Isn&#x27;t it true that the production company he&#x27;s funding is doing a documentary on Betty and Barney Hill &gt;&gt; for Netflix? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, &gt;&gt; I mean, that&#x27;s an abduction story and the most famous one. I would say he&#x27;s interested. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; So, it would have made sense that he dropped a little viral statement to hype it.</p>
<p>That podcast uh Brian Tyler Cohen&#x27;s podcast has uh 6 million almost 7 million subscribers. &gt;&gt; He he tweeted about the Trump thing. I&#x27;ll find it. &gt;&gt; He did a whole show about it. He did a whole uh video last night about what he what he did, what he caught.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got we have that uh video. Dan, you put a video together um that we could maybe show people so that they can be caught up uh with everything that&#x27;s going on. &gt;&gt; Okay. Give me a second. &gt;&gt; Make sure it&#x27;s the right one.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I only downloaded one of &gt;&gt; Not the nude one. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Yeah, that was just that&#x27;s just for us.</p>
<p>Private stash. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a top shelf stuff. &gt;&gt; Top top shelf. &gt;&gt; This is it. Yeah.</p>
<p>So, by the way, guys, hit that like button if you haven&#x27;t already. We&#x27;re up to 629 people in here. Let&#x27;s blow this stream up. We have like This is huge, huge news. This is what we&#x27;ve all been waiting for.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s weirder than ever. So, um, let&#x27;s see how many times you guys can hit that like button. And, uh, here&#x27;s the video. This is great. If you haven&#x27;t seen what&#x27;s been going on, this is going to bring you up to speed.</p>
<p>lightning round here because it&#x27;s not often I&#x27;ll get access to president of the United States. So, a couple questions here. &gt;&gt; Are aliens real? &gt;&gt; Uh, they&#x27;re real, but I haven&#x27;t seen them and and and uh they&#x27;re not being kept in uh what is it? &gt;&gt; Area 51. There&#x27;s no underground uh facility unless there&#x27;s this enormous conspiracy and they they hid it from the president of the United States. What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president? &gt;&gt; Um, where are the aliens? &gt;&gt; Where are the aliens? &gt;&gt; A lot of attention this week.</p>
<p>Barack Obama said that aliens are real. Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to Earth? &gt;&gt; Well, he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing them, you know. &gt;&gt; So, aliens are real. &gt;&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not.</p>
<p>I can tell you he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that. He made a he made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information. No, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an opinion on it.</p>
<p>I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, Peter? &gt;&gt; Well, the president can declassify anything that he wants to. So, if you want to make an announcement, &gt;&gt; I may get him out of trouble by declassifying.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then the then the tweet came out a couple hours after that. Um, &gt;&gt; I get the sense as he was as he was talking after he&#x27;d already said all of the stuff he probably shouldn&#x27;t have said. I get the sense he was searching his mind like did I did I just really [ __ ] up? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think he realized. &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s two old guys that both [ __ ] up.</p>
<p>I honestly I think Obama went in was like, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m doing this Betty and Barney Hill thing. Ask me a softball question about aliens. all we&#x27;ll laugh about it and then you know it&#x27;s going to be great for later. And I think they did that and I saw Obama, you know, he he he looks like a regular guy who&#x27;s kind of tired. He&#x27;s just sort of doing another podcast.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s like, &quot;Yeah, sounded to me like not a throwaway comment, but almost a throwaway comment.&quot; And then when you watch Trump right after that kind of hear it, you&#x27;re right. He does look a little lost like like he&#x27;s not exactly sure how caught up he is. he&#x27;s just hearing this and he&#x27;s sort of in the moment trying to formulate some kind of response and then it was sort of like is a tweet an official I mean I guess does this actually count? Can you just tweet this? Is there a real order? &gt;&gt; What do you mean does it count? I mean, are people going to follow? Like, will we actually see [ __ ] because a tweet went out or did he actually sign an order and send it to everybody? You know, I don&#x27;t know how it works, but is there some kind of &gt;&gt; um, you know, we Is this going to be Epstein again where it was like, here&#x27;s everything, but it&#x27;s all redacted. Are they going to give us &gt;&gt; Of course. Of course.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; How do they spin this? &gt;&gt; Of course. I I I don&#x27;t I mean I I I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we never saw anything and at this point I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we saw every I mean just things are so weird. Um &gt;&gt; let&#x27;s take let&#x27;s go for some perspective to the Twitter sphere and uh see we we have pulled a number of tweets that have responded to this news. One was from Lou Alzando. I think we&#x27;ve got Matthew Pines in there.</p>
<p>Um &gt;&gt; J Stratton also reacted. &gt;&gt; Jay Stratton tweeted about it. Uh Reed Summer &gt;&gt; Luna Nancy Mace, Luna. It&#x27;s um &gt;&gt; Dan Clary Marvel. &gt;&gt; Who do you want to start with? &gt;&gt; Uh let&#x27;s start with Lou.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s He&#x27;s close to home. Let&#x27;s start with Lou. &gt;&gt; Just bear with &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re doing a victory lap. Nothing&#x27;s happened yet, though. I don&#x27;t think &gt;&gt; nothing&#x27;s happened, but it&#x27;s major.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think it is major. But yeah, we are currently, as a few people, setting themselves up for for some humiliation here. I&#x27;m kind of trying to stay on the fence. I&#x27;m quietly hopeful, &gt;&gt; but um &gt;&gt; but yeah, there&#x27;s a few people that are going to look silly in a few weeks if if um I mean, we&#x27;re used to looking silly. It doesn&#x27;t really matter.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I like Eric. I like what you said. We&#x27;ll see. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that feels very stoic and appropriate. &gt;&gt; Yeah, don&#x27;t chick uh don&#x27;t count your chickens before the hatch.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh Lou Alzando says, &quot;Thank you, President Trump and uh to those in your administration as well as those in past administrations who fought for the same goal. Thank you to Congress, to the media, to the whistleblowers, and to the American people whose faith and persistence made this moment possible. This is the culmination of many years of effort, years in which families, careers, and personal safety were often placed at risk simply to have this conversation. I am deeply grateful to witness this day and to honor those who helped begin this journey in 2007, most notably Senator Harry Reid, Senator Daniel Inui, and Senator Ted Stevens. As we move forward together toward greater disclosure and transparency, my hope is that this moment brings people together.</p>
<p>I have always believed that America is strong enough to face the truth and that the American people deserve nothing less. I am proud to have been a part tense of this effort. Lu Alzando takes the victory lap. &gt;&gt; I mean that that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a tweet you save for like here&#x27;s the stuff. You know what I mean? That&#x27;s a I mean it&#x27;s exciting, but that that that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a premature tweet.</p>
<p>I think &gt;&gt; if we&#x27;re assuming that if we&#x27;re basing um if we&#x27;re assuming that Lu Alzando is is part of the intelligence apparatus that&#x27;s managing the disclosure conversation, then he has the inside track, right? He and Matthew Pines most surely would know, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh there&#x27;s other people that are not like within that circle or periphery that also seem to know things. Like I I told you about Walter Kern for example, the author. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s been talking to Grush constantly like they&#x27;re pals. So &gt;&gt; you can imagine that he already knows a lot of stuff and he&#x27;s been making the uh darker connections too on X and um and also somebody who&#x27;s like seems to be dialed in &gt;&gt; by the way.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. who&#x27;s also someone who seems to be dialed in is uh Eric Weinstein because he he he also reacted to this and he&#x27;s not part of the that group the core group. He&#x27;s a little more skeptical and less hopeful than the rest. &gt;&gt; My favorite Weinstein uh anything is the one that Jesse Michaels did with him and Hal Putoff &gt;&gt; where they just hang out in like their living room. &gt;&gt; Oh, it&#x27;s so good.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I just like to be a fly on the wall is so fun. Um, what was the next tweet? We had one from uh Stratton. &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. Uh, whichever one you have next. &gt;&gt; Yeah, everyone&#x27;s so everyone&#x27;s all over this.</p>
<p>Like multiple tweets. &gt;&gt; I mean, &gt;&gt; uh, I would love to read out Eric Weinste because I I&#x27;m a huge fanboy, Daddy Weinstein at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t tell Stephen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Ste Steven Daddy Greer has a new documentary coming out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, that&#x27;s interesting. &gt;&gt; Uh Jay Stratton says, &quot;President Trump&#x27;s announcement is a landmark occasion for us all. After years of fighting for disclosure behind the scenes, I couldn&#x27;t be prouder to be a part of this turning point in human history. Congratulations and thank you to Dan Farah for making the truly groundbreaking film, The Age of Disclosure. Less than three months after the film&#x27;s release, two US presidents acknowledge non-human intelligent life exists and President Trump has issued an historic disclosure order.</p>
<p>Air quotes on order. I&#x27;m adding the air quotes. We are living in the age of full of the age of disclosure. There will be more watershed moments and issues to face ahead, but I hope all of humanity celebrates this moment. &gt;&gt; Jumping the gun a little bit.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think we are jumping the gun &gt;&gt; a lot. True. But I think it&#x27;s also okay to celebrate this a little bit. It it is it is it is hugely important stuff. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um whether we see stuff or not, again, two presidents confirming aliens basically in a 6 day span is crazy. And say what you want about the age of disclosure and Dan Farah, but I I do have to think it did play a part in where we are now. So, congrats to all involved, I guess. &gt;&gt; Two Wolves says, &quot;There&#x27;s lots of bots in the chat today.&quot; Interesting. &gt;&gt; Um, I wonder if it&#x27;s our friends at what is it? Which air force base? &gt;&gt; Egglund.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Egglund. Yeah. Hi guys. Uh, &gt;&gt; should we read Weinstein&#x27;s Weinstein Weinstein? &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s see. Christopher Torres says, uh, 2666 says, &quot;We are so afraid to believe this is it because we&#x27;ve all been burned by potential disclosure so many times in the past.&quot; Very, very good point.</p>
<p>Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh, let&#x27;s see Weinstein&#x27;s tweet. What did he say? &gt;&gt; Let Xander read it. He&#x27;s so excited. &gt;&gt; I just Yeah, I remember watching Weinstein like way back in the day with Kurt Jungle and before I knew any of you guys.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;ve been following this guy for so long. Um, I mean, he tweets a lot, though. That&#x27;s his only problem. &gt;&gt; Uh, he had one initial one. &gt;&gt; Wasn&#x27;t that it right there? Oh, wait.</p>
<p>No, &gt;&gt; it could have been. &gt;&gt; That is That is cool that he said that. An enormous secret is buried here. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve failed to guess it year after year. Oh, this is this is it.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, let me say this more directly and with a little more precision than I usually do. The reason I&#x27;m talking at all like this is is that no one inside has asked me not to do so with a credible ask. So here goes.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if we have made alien contact, but there is a mountain of indirect evidence that is all but impossible to explain otherwise. This guy is a genius. I I think you might disagree with him politically, I don&#x27;t know, but he&#x27;s a smart guy. hedge funds hire him to like &gt;&gt; do whatever hedge fund people do. &gt;&gt; And no one knows what that is, but he&#x27;s really good at it, too.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, he&#x27;s he&#x27;s Yeah, I don&#x27;t even think he really knows what it is, but it works. &gt;&gt; Uh there is no explanation for the first mountain of of real indirect evidence, having given us no hard evidence, this is the puzzle he can&#x27;t solve. He admits that ultimately this secret involves the hardest of the sciences scientist sciences maths, biology, and physics. Uh he&#x27;s he hates string theory. He&#x27;s always hated it.</p>
<p>He says he&#x27;s always thought it was sort of like a safety pen where they scient scientists were always funneled into this pen to stop them exploring anything of any real substance. Um I tend to agree with that to be honest. Um, what&#x27;s Togat? &gt;&gt; That sounds like a Lord of the Rings character. &gt;&gt; Sunset program that the Biden administration discussed with PM. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is what he&#x27;s talking about.</p>
<p>The funnel of science. &gt;&gt; Uh, it cuts off all the oxygen to anyone that challenges the decision to seal our best professors into the intellectual sarcophagus of modern quantum gravity. So, they cannot threaten our national interest. We can leave it there. It&#x27;s cool.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I was thinking the same thing. &gt;&gt; We get him. We get it. Uh I just I just Yeah, I think it&#x27;s a really cool take. I like that he&#x27;s not he I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s jumping the gun there.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s saying the words I don&#x27;t know, which is probably an appropriate response right now. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it it sounds like he&#x27;s also like a a Wily kind of guy. Show me something. Um, other than the tweets, &gt;&gt; isn&#x27;t to the only game in town? Doesn&#x27;t that doesn&#x27;t it mean that? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I mean, there&#x27;s other there are other things going on. We we are about to go to war with Iran like which we saw coming from 30 miles. Everyone saw this coming since what a year ago at least. Well, for 30 years it&#x27;s been coming.</p>
<p>So, now it&#x27;s finally here. Um, and of course the Epstein fiasco is still playing out. Um the uh Andrew, formerly known as Prince, was arrested on his 66th birthday. Finally, somebody got [ __ ] perpwalked uh over this thing. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; so it&#x27;s a chaotic news situation right now.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a weird This is like a I want to ask you, Eric, about that just the psychology of all this in a second, but go ahead, Dan. Were you about to say something? &gt;&gt; Andrew actually wasn&#x27;t arrested for the Epstein stuff. If I found out he was arrested for N &gt;&gt; uh giving like insider secrets based on like financial stuff with the UK he was giving to &gt;&gt; was that to to Epstein but it wasn&#x27;t about like &gt;&gt; yes but yeah it wasn&#x27;t &gt;&gt; so that shows you exactly why our priorities are so [ __ ] up. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; they got him on money [ __ ] &gt;&gt; Have you seen the cottage where he&#x27;s going to be &gt;&gt; Have you seen the cottage where he&#x27;s going to be imprisoned? &gt;&gt; The cottage? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s lovely. &gt;&gt; Oh man, it has a lake.</p>
<p>Oh my god. &gt;&gt; So, the Sandringham estate, I&#x27;ve spent Christmas on the Sandringham estate, by the way. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s about it&#x27;s about the size of Austin, Texas, &gt;&gt; comparatively. &gt;&gt; Um, and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s basically owned by the royal family. There are villages inside this estate.</p>
<p>Like, it they sort of halfway between public and royal land. in in a way the royals own all the land in the UK anyway, but you have to drive through this property to get to certain parts of the UK. They it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a forest. It&#x27;s a county that&#x27;s just basically inhabited by the royal family. Uh, and so when ep when not Epstein, I may as well call him it, when when Andrew Mountbatton, as I as I like to call him now, when he was kicked out of his main residence in Sandringham, his his castle effectively, he was uh ushered into this tiny little cottage on the edge of Sandringham, which is still, I think, about an 8bedroom, beautiful, beautifully maintained, how humiliating.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&#x27;s still got staff. He&#x27;s still got drivers. He still has security. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine being someone who has to work for that [ __ ] &gt;&gt; and like go around and like unfold his [ __ ] underwear and [ __ ] and like go I would be like, &quot;Fuck that. I&#x27;m not doing this job.</p>
<p>I will not. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know who who could work for this guy.&quot; Um, how do you I&#x27;m just curious. How do you guys in the UK stand these [ __ ] people at all? like why have you not overthrown the monarchy &gt;&gt; for everyone in &gt;&gt; started another country. &gt;&gt; Um there&#x27;s there there is a huge a long entrenched love of the royal family with at least 50% of the population. Um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>And um there are there are plenty of anti-royalists. I myself am one. I have nothing against them as actual people apart from obviously well he&#x27;s not royal anymore so it doesn&#x27;t matter. Um, the rest of the royals as people, I don&#x27;t know them, so maybe they&#x27;re cool people. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, they represent an institution that I no longer support. So, I would call myself an anti-royalist. I just want them to kind of give the land back to the public. And, you know, we don&#x27;t need a monarchy. &gt;&gt; Is there a like a tourism &gt;&gt; uh uh push for that to ever happen &gt;&gt; or is that like getting corporate money out of politics for us? That&#x27;s just like a dream.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Nothing on the horizon. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost a bit of a that&#x27;s on the back burner right now. There&#x27;s there&#x27;s bigger fish to fry. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But um ultimately, the royal family needed uh this to happen to Andrew Mountbatton for sure.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um that&#x27;s the reason he&#x27;s no longer royal. That&#x27;s the reason he&#x27;s about to be removed from the line of succession, which is his birthright apparently. Um, so yeah, he is effectively an ordinary citizen in every sense of the word word now. And they&#x27;re they&#x27;re making the royal family at some point will have to make a spectacle of him. Um, so they will aid the police.</p>
<p>He will go to prison. And if if that prison isn&#x27;t prison enough, then the UK population will have something to say about it. Right now, he&#x27;s like under house arrest effectively, &gt;&gt; but it&#x27;s just palace arrest. &gt;&gt; Has anyone &gt;&gt; Oh, go ahead, Dan. Has anyone ever been removed from uh succession before? Has anyone ever been removed from the royal family before? &gt;&gt; I have no idea.</p>
<p>People have been removed from the royal family, but not the king&#x27;s brother. &gt;&gt; Weren&#x27;t the blood um &gt;&gt; Elizabeth&#x27;s uncle, wasn&#x27;t he like really controversial and he was like separated? &gt;&gt; Um he he was he was still getting money and all that stuff, right? Like &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. They they&#x27;re they&#x27;re paid for life. I wouldn&#x27;t uh I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if during World War II some of the royal family were excommunicated in some way because we did that we they did have some ties to Nazi Germany I believe. But &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s who I&#x27;m talking about.</p>
<p>Her uncle had ties to to the Nazis. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know enough about it. But I certainly now the population has sort of evolved enough to kind of realize these guys are just people at the end of the day and it&#x27;s time you know they started to be treated as such which is great. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a busy news cycle.</p>
<p>Eric, how do we how are we supposed to process all this? I feel like my brain is broken. &gt;&gt; We need you. &gt;&gt; We need help. help us. &gt;&gt; Well, the first session&#x27;s free.</p>
<p>I have great news for you. &gt;&gt; Lay down on the couch real quick. &gt;&gt; Um, it is a lot. It is a lot. When I when I meet somebody or work with somebody with anxiety and in general, just in general terms, depression&#x27;s about the past and that kind of comes through.</p>
<p>If I ask somebody a question, their answers are in the past. So, what are you depressed about? My parents never loved me and I lost my job. Okay, I can understand that. Um, if it&#x27;s about uh anxiety, it&#x27;s interesting. The the answers are usually in the future, what are you anxious about? My husband&#x27;s going to cheat on me or I&#x27;m going to get a horrible disease and die.</p>
<p>When I eat somebody or work with somebody who has bad anxiety, one of the first questions I ask is, &quot;How much news do you consume and where do you get it?&quot; And it&#x27;s not always um causation, but it&#x27;s usually at least a correlation where the more news that they consume, the more anxious they are. So what I what I tell people, and I never give advice, but I say, you know, it might be best to just have everything in moderation. And everybody&#x27;s going to have to decide for themselves. So there there is this part where I think it&#x27;s a good idea to in general know what&#x27;s going on in your local community nationally and internationally. But at what point is it now being counterproductive where you&#x27;re consuming a lot of information and maybe it&#x27;s bad news, but on top of that you can&#x27;t do a damn thing about it.</p>
<p>So now, in addition to feeling powerless or excuse me, in addition to feeling anxious, now you&#x27;re feeling powerless and and everybody has to navigate that for themselves. But I think in general, everything in moderation. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s great advice. &gt;&gt; What is the antidote to anxiety from having too much uh you know, too too much of this all going on at the same time and trying to take it all in and being overwhelmed by it? What do you recommend for people who are feeling &gt;&gt; I think underwater, &gt;&gt; right? Very good question. And so we have a couple choices.</p>
<p>We can do what we want, which unfortunately is usually bad for us. Instead of doing what we want, we can do what&#x27;s best because that&#x27;s always best. And everyone knows what&#x27;s best for them. It&#x27;s just a matter if they do it or not. Uh, another example is a lot of people will will pursue happiness.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not a big fan of that for a lot of different reasons. I like people engaging in a life rich in fulfillment. And you get a life rich in fulfillment when you embrace your personal values. That&#x27;s acceptance of commitment therapy. It&#x27;s a certain therapeutic model that I use.</p>
<p>So perhaps having everything in moderation, doing what is best instead of you instead of what you want. Pursuing a life rich in personal values for fulfillment, that might be best. It&#x27;s not oneizefits-all, but that&#x27;s not a bad idea. And then, you know, maybe it&#x27;s just a good idea to unplug. Maybe it&#x27;s a good idea to take a few hours, get some fresh air, go outside, spend time with friends and family, exercise, do whatever you want that just makes you feel better.</p>
<p>Because, you know, we have that term doomcrolling. It It&#x27;s just It&#x27;s such a real thing. It&#x27;s like, well, this leads to this leads to this. And now you&#x27;re down this rabbit hole and you&#x27;re like, you know what? I just want to die at this point. This is this is so bad.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t know how bad it was. Why? Why do we do that? Why do you think people do that, Eric? Why do we Why do we obsess over horrible things? &gt;&gt; You know, that&#x27;s a really good question. And I don&#x27;t know. I I I have a pretty good theory of why we think horrible things might happen because I think that serves a purpose sometimes. So, you pay attention and you protect yourself through vigilance.</p>
<p>But um that doomscrolling thing, I don&#x27;t really know. And it&#x27;s such a good question because you would just think the opposite. Like you would get a minute in and be like, &quot;Oh my god, this is like really bad. I&#x27;m going to watch a bunch of cat videos.&quot; &gt;&gt; Does it maybe does it justify us having uh bad feelings or does it justify us being in a bad mood or being a dick to people? Well, that&#x27;s a very good theory and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s quite possible, right? So, so you could kind of talk yourself into the theory of, well, I&#x27;m always cranky because look what&#x27;s going on in the world. And it&#x27;s like, well, you might just be a a jerk.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like really hard to tell. The the doom scrolling thing is &gt;&gt; fascinating and quite addictive. I mean, we all know that this the the manner of this information being presented that people scroll is specifically designed for you to want more. It&#x27;s to create an addiction. We know this behind the behind the curtain.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s so dirty. Um, David Ike tweeted, &quot;Here comes the SCOP about this, the um Trump disclosure thing.&quot; And it&#x27;s starting to feel sometimes uh to your point, Eric, when you when you try to process all of the stuff that&#x27;s going on, especially the the big news, you know, and and and try to start connecting dots and going down the rabbit hole, it&#x27;s so certain that you get lo you&#x27;re going to get lost. And uh you and I were texting back and forth and and one of the things you mentioned was just getting out into nature and getting grounded again, spending some time away from everything and getting in connect with your local sort of environment. Can you talk a little bit about that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so I before I became a therapist, I was fortunate enough to work in the mountains and get paid.</p>
<p>So I built trails, I was a backcountry ranger, etc. And the beautiful thing about nature is nothing really happens. Occasionally an avalanche will roar down a mountain and wipe out a forest or there might be a pretty good lightning storm, but other than that it&#x27;s like extremely uneventful. And I think that&#x27;s what some people could benefit from. Some some people are uncomfortable in that environment.</p>
<p>It would just make them more stressed. For me, it&#x27;s part of my life. You know, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot of saying in the outdoors, especially in outdoor professions, but one is, you know, a bad day in the mountains beats a really good day in civilization. Uh that&#x27;s one of the and there&#x27;s variations of that. Um I I like the appeal of the mountains and why I live here in beautiful Colorado &gt;&gt; is I can just be myself.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very quiet and I find it very safe. I mean, it&#x27;s a beautiful place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And a lot of people don&#x27;t experience this. You know, imagine that you can go somewhere for free, probably not far from your house, where there are no other humans, and it is dead silent, and you can just sit there with your thoughts as long as you&#x27;re comfortable doing that.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s It&#x27;s pretty cool. It&#x27;s pretty cool. It&#x27;s um you just said something that&#x27;s that struck a nerve because I usually I listen to music throughout the day and and I I&#x27;ll have something on in the background or I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll be listening to a podcast or something and I&#x27;ve lately have been trying to turn that stuff off and just have silence, just experience silence. And I realized that I I&#x27;ve kind of gotten used to having noise on all the time. It&#x27;s weird to reintroduce myself to quietude and hear my own thoughts and just kind of relax into a regular rhythm.</p>
<p>Um, but it is so therapeutic just yeah to be away from it all. Do you think um Pavle, you you started to say something I think we were uh before we went live about just how much um of this is overlapping about uh the Epstein stuff and the cover up. Um there was a a comment that just came in. Uh this is from Dova Eli. I hope I&#x27;m saying that right.</p>
<p>I see some elites still trying to make a joke out of it. Another pushing the threat narrative. But to me the most important disclosure is the corrupted organization that kept us from this the reversed engineered tech and the spiritual aspect of it. Great comment. &gt;&gt; Can you talk you guys just opine a little bit on what you think the connections might be and if there are any? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Um something that also happened over the last two weeks is the the whole jump in the AI game. Uh you can see the tensions are really high right now. Uh I told Dan a couple of weeks ago that one of the Google founders who&#x27;s no longer uh at Google uh he used to be a CTO or something like that. He used the term non-human intelligence to describe the arrival of AI and &gt;&gt; Jeffrey Hinton &gt;&gt; uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s on LinkedIn &gt;&gt; just the other day he said alien intelligence. I think that&#x27;s what he said.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Human intelligence he said. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sorry I didn&#x27;t mean to cut you off but yeah. No, and I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s part of that. I think that also the whole religious aspect of this is gonna eventually blow up as well because there&#x27;s a lot of misconceptions about religion in general that have persisted, you know, and I think that this is controversial to say, but I I&#x27;m one of the people who believes that pretty much every religion is a UFO based religion. you know, &gt;&gt; but experiences &gt;&gt; in terms of the actual cover up though and and the behindthe-scenes sort of treachery and weirdness that&#x27;s going on. I mean, it&#x27;s hard to untangle like with the Epstein thing, it seems like the further you dig, the more people you find that are connected to this in some awful way.</p>
<p>And I imagine most of those people if not you know all of them are somehow tied into what&#x27;s going on with this UFO cover up in in high finance banking defense industries uh intelligence people from various different intelligence a there is a lot of overlap between those two worlds. Do you see any direct connections between that and this or other than you know this being maybe a big distraction? &gt;&gt; Los Alamos. Los Alamos is my big one. &gt;&gt; Do you mean the religious organizations? I&#x27;m just talking about people involved. Were there people involved in the Epstein thing that we think are &gt;&gt; Well, I think that in general there has been an established secrecy of reality in general, not just UFOs, you know, and it has to do with everything.</p>
<p>It has to do with science, it has to do with religion, it has to do with this topic, uh ancient history, too. There&#x27;s a lot there that uh has been hidden from us and has been even destroyed uh ever since the times of the library of Alexandria. Like here in Mexico, there&#x27;s something that happened also in the early 1800s where another library was burnt and a lot of artifacts were were there from ancient civilizations from Mexico and Central America. A lot of that [ __ ] has been happening for millennia like uh information, data, artifacts, everything being hidden from us and erased from history. I think that&#x27;s the main thing that and and it&#x27;s all converging.</p>
<p>I feel like um taking a step back and and looking at it from like sort of the 30,000 foot view, uh the for me the big takeaway is this these organizations that are um designed to internalize everything and protect secrecy at all costs and these sort of weird clandestine networks um are completely out of hand. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re finding out. These people have gone completely off the [ __ ] rails. Whether you&#x27;re talking about Epstein and and everything that was involved with that or the UFO coverup where no one seems to know where anything is or what&#x27;s going on, but we&#x27;re spending trillions of dollars every decade on this project and it&#x27;s just constantly unwinding. &gt;&gt; Um, is this the beginning of unraveling that? Do you think we&#x27;re starting to see that? Or is this just going to be a uh kind of a head fake towards disclosure to distract from the Epstein news cycle? I see people taking the victory lap.</p>
<p>I understand why they&#x27;re doing it, but I I&#x27;m kind of with Xander on this. I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s time yet. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. I agree.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s there there&#x27;s a big connection. There&#x27;s a Epstein talked about himself in a way. There&#x27;s a clip that you can find. So, Epstein bought a ranch in New Mexico called Zoro Ranch. And he bought it because of its proximity, it its distance to Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
<p>And he did that because he even said that he was poaching some of their geneticists and scientists to use for his own stuff. And I think with the UFO topic, we&#x27;re going to find out sooner than later that a huge part of it is genetics and that kind of stuff. And uh yeah, Epstein purposely and you know in the 80s, 90s and 2000s, Los Alamos was kind of like a central hub for a lot of the UFO stuff. And uh so Epstein poaching people from there I find incredibly interesting especially cuz Epstein was talking about genetics. And now we&#x27;re finding out that on that ranch they might they may have been working on cloning and and and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s emails between Andrew and uh Epstein about clone like Andrew said if you clone myself like is it okay for me to clone myself for my own body parts? Um and Epstein&#x27;s like yeah sure. And Andrew&#x27;s like, &quot;Uh, well, what about like what about the moral aspect?&quot; And Epstein&#x27;s like, &quot;Well, we&#x27;ll just make it without a head. Just matter of fact, we&#x27;ll make one without a head for you.&quot; &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s crazy. &gt;&gt; You wanted to clone.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, that there&#x27;s emails with with Epstein talking a lot about genetics and cloning and [ __ ] There&#x27;s &gt;&gt; I know about the genetic stuff, but I didn&#x27;t know about cloning a body with no head. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he made that comment. It&#x27;s hard to interpret tone from an email. It may have been hilarious like let&#x27;s just make it with no head, but it seemed like &gt;&gt; we&#x27;ll just make one without a head. We&#x27;ll just grow a a meat bag for you for body parts &gt;&gt; and then you can harvest the organs.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the UFO genetic stuff is a that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a big thing I think we&#x27;re going to start talking a lot more about. &gt;&gt; This is why I&#x27;m all in on secret space program because look at what people will do if you just give them unlimited money and let them go crazy. Like they will do the craziest [ __ ] you can dream up. coming out today.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh Chris Rand interviewed Ross Coltart &gt;&gt; and that comes out today, but I watched it last night because I I&#x27;m on the Patreon and you&#x27;re going to really enjoy their their short conversation about the secret space program. &gt;&gt; Ross might be on board. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; No spoilers, but it&#x27;s a pretty cool &gt;&gt; and and it&#x27;s sort of uh connects with something Sander has said before about it that uh Gary McKinnon is like a believable source of that. it it connects to that and I thought it was a very interesting exchange. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, Eric, as the uh person here with the most military experience out of this whole group, do you think um what would it take beyond a tweet, a very aggressive tweet, um to to make disclosure happen? Like what do you think it would actually require to get the chain of command in motion around something like this officially? &gt;&gt; Well, yes. I I do have the most military experience here, but that&#x27;s only because everyone else has zero, so I&#x27;m not particularly that&#x27;s not particular &gt;&gt; I play a lot of Call of Duty. That&#x27;s got to be worth what? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s not particularly telling. You know what what I was thinking about with that tweet is this possibility. So o Obama is on this podcast says yes aliens are real and I was thinking Trump was maybe like oh no Obama&#x27;s getting some attention so so I&#x27;m gonna come out with this.</p>
<p>Oh don&#x27;t listen to him. I&#x27;m gonna give you all these files. Right. So kind of um self-centered in that manner, but I don&#x27;t know how the in how these how the how the gears of bureaucracy work if you&#x27;re going to release stuff. Now Trump is known for um doing things off the cuff, right? So it could just be a matter of &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s not fair.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Unrestrained compulsiveness. The man cannot control himself in that manner. But could there be something in place already in which the tweet was not compulsive in that it was revealing something that was already in place and he was just looking for a good opportunity to share this? I I think that&#x27;s a possibility. And this reminds me of a comment Dan made a long time ago where Skywatcher was like, &quot;Yeah, we we can call in a UAP.&quot; And I think Dan, you said something to the effect of, &quot;You would only say that if you already know how to do it, right? If they&#x27;ve already done it.&quot; &gt;&gt; So if there are valuable files to be released and they&#x27;re going to be released, who&#x27;s to say this has not been a plan leading up to this tweet? I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s the thing that makes it so confusing.</p>
<p>There was a rumor, right? There have been rumors for for uh almost a year now that have been really loud about this speech that he&#x27;s got prepared. Laura Trump was on uh her show a few days ago saying that oh she talked to Eric and they twice. &gt;&gt; Yeah, she just said it again. &gt;&gt; Uh there there B Eric Berles uh and um who else was going? uh one of the other congressional members was going to go they had authorization to go to Area 51 and a few other places from the president to investigate some of this stuff. Um Steven Spielberg&#x27;s new film is due to be released when what is the release date on &gt;&gt; uh June 16th or 15th or something? &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
<p>So we&#x27;re in we&#x27;re in the end of February uh March, April, May, June, you know, couple months out. So maybe Obama I think Obama slipped I think Obama I think what Obama said was to pump his own Netflix thing and then I see Trump a befuddled Trump kind of hear that and go oh yeah and it seemed like he kind of did another he had a brain fart too and then in that moment we had disclosure which complet like I feel like there was a &gt;&gt; there was a plan I&#x27;m not saying there was no plan there was a plan I think the plan was the the plan the rumor was that Spielberg&#x27;s movie was going to come out and set up Trump to spike the ball with the official declaration and it was going to be some big reveal and it would be spectacular and instead it was just these two guys tripped over each other &gt;&gt; trying to out out social media one one another cuz Obama obviously got like a hundred billion views on that clip. I mean it went super viral overnight. Trump must have lost his [ __ ] mind. Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; he must have been up looking at his phone like, &quot;What the [ __ ] This guy won&#x27;t go away.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s the bad penny that just keeps turning up.&quot; &gt;&gt; And he&#x27;s so cool. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s so cool and he&#x27;s so presidential and he was the editor of the Harvard Law Review. He&#x27;s so smart. He can read list. &gt;&gt; Not on the Epstein list.</p>
<p>You know who else is not on the Epstein list? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um &gt;&gt; I just I Yeah. I feel like it&#x27;s the dumbest disclosure ever. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s so unsexy, man. Like I I remember like since I was a kid, &gt;&gt; eight years old, I&#x27;ve been loving this.</p>
<p>What What &gt;&gt; sexy like I I just as a kid I I&#x27;ve romanticized this moment for almost 40 years of like &gt;&gt; a president with some kind of class coming to the podium and like in a very heartfelt uh sincere speech of like, you know, we are not alone. We&#x27;re entering a a new world. um other world leaders making the announcement at the same time and saying like this is a moment for humanity to like get together and and um see what the universe has to offer and then it&#x27;s just like yeah like you said two guys running into each other at full speed and like and then oh they&#x27;re real. What the [ __ ] happened? &gt;&gt; If you want to &gt;&gt; Yeah. He had to follow through.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you want to scratch that itch of getting something more um uh presidential, you can watch Sanders episode on JFK, you know. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s true. That&#x27;s true. &gt;&gt; If you don&#x27;t mind me just pointing out something that I just find really unsettling about all of this, however, and what time is it? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we&#x27;re close to doom.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Top of the hour. &gt;&gt; Doom o&#x27;clock, baby. right now. I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve had Trump on his doing the White House live stream uh for the past 40 minutes or so. The guy is talking about tariffs right now, right? If maybe there is a plan for disclosure and there&#x27;s going to be some sort of announcement, I can get on board with that.</p>
<p>But when I see such stuff going on that&#x27;s so it seems so insignificant in comparison to what could be announced, it makes me think, okay, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a few options here. Either there really is nothing to announce. And I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a euphologist. I don&#x27;t believe that. Um, but the other option is what they will announce is going to feel so mundane compared to what we&#x27;re expecting that right now it&#x27;s it&#x27;s still appropriate to talk about tariffs for the next 3 months.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s still appropriate to talk about going like uh giving Iran an ultimatum because &gt;&gt; dude, we put two aircraft carriers off the coast of Iran. &gt;&gt; They got a dozen [ __ ] warships that we&#x27;re about to go to war with this country. &gt;&gt; I get it. And so many people are going to get killed and and all of this and in the middle of it it&#x27;s like, &quot;Yeah, aliens are real. Here&#x27;s a big tweet.&quot; &gt;&gt; But what are we going to announce? &gt;&gt; By the way, &gt;&gt; what is that announcement really going to be when we&#x27;ve got business as usual going on at the same time that these talks that are happening, they they have implications that that last for years.</p>
<p>The president knows that. Any president knows that. Donald Trump, for all of his faults, will know that a tariff implemented now will have an effect months away. So, if he is planning to do any sort of disclosure, it&#x27;s going to be so milktoast that the tariffs are still relevant at this point. Otherwise, he&#x27;s wasting his time right now.</p>
<p>Maybe he &gt;&gt; One thing about the tariffs, did we mention that there was a Supreme Court ruling? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, we didn&#x27;t mention it, but that this is what makes me feel good about the UFO stuff. The Supreme Court just knocked down his tariff thing, so he kind of got spanked today, and he&#x27;s a little bit embarrassed.</p>
<p>So, he might be hurting for a win right now, which might actually help this conversation a little bit. &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s exactly what it is. I think they were I think they were timing it. They were they were probably timing it, but I they need a win. This is such a slam dunk.</p>
<p>If they had not [ __ ] it up, it would have been awesome. I I&#x27;m with you, Dan. I want Bill Pullman from Independence Day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To come out on the convene the United Nations and then walk out and deliver the the big speech and then have all the world leaders, you know, all behind you and then just be like, you know, whoever &gt;&gt; and make it a a spectacle &gt;&gt; and like stop the [ __ ] stock market for a day.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s just turn that [ __ ] off and let&#x27;s &gt;&gt; We have one chance. Let&#x27;s make this thing awesome. Let&#x27;s make awesome. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But and then the other argument is like, well, will the program or whatever allow Trump to say anything? &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s the real question.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Will he even be allowed to say [ __ ] all? I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; Well, that had promises of UFO files before. Haven&#x27;t been released as well. &gt;&gt; That brings us to Matthew Pine&#x27;s tweet, which I think we should look at. Uh, so Matthew Pines tweeted an interesting um link and uh made a a a very notable comment on it and um Matthew Pines is uh was involved with Skywatcher at one point.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know, he&#x27;s kind of tangentially involved with the UFO world but via the intelligence/bitcoin. He he&#x27;s trying to do a breakthrough on physics with a new company and that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s focused on uh through AI. uh he still like makes comments about the topic but now I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s involved like in the as he was before you know &gt;&gt; he tweeted uh I reposted it on mine &gt;&gt; the only one that matters &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s the best &gt;&gt; with Jeff Goldlum &gt;&gt; he said uh that quote there is growing recognition that disclosure was forced on us because of the AI curve since developing super intelligence is potentially risky to any nonhuman intelligence that has access to Earth. The alignment problem may be more complicated than we think. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s talking about alignment last week. &gt;&gt; Dude, we&#x27;ve been talking about this on this channel for a year now. We&#x27;ve been on this AI thing. &gt;&gt; Xander&#x27;s hot on this AI thing. We&#x27;ve been talking about it.</p>
<p>There was a uh uh a merger announced a few weeks back between Trump&#x27;s uh truth social media company and a fusion energy company called TAE Systems I think and TAE Systems in their press release. You can look this up. They specifically say winning the AI race is the goal of deploying their fusion reactor technology. And if you look at the top donors to the uh Trump administration and Trump personally and the White House and I mean it&#x27;s all the top AI companies and we know that energy is the bottleneck to unlimited intelligence. So if you were going to optimize for super intelligence, first it would make sense to optimize the AI to rewrite its own code and then once it&#x27;s really good at rewriting its own code and doing these recursive self-improvements, you can literally just pour in as much electricity as you possibly can and keep building data centers and you&#x27;re going to get to super intelligence and that unlocks the rest of the game.</p>
<p>That unlocks all the cheat codes. These guys know that. And I think this UFO news, the TAE fusion, uh, TAE systems merger with Trump, uh, Trump&#x27;s media company, creating this new whole, um, entity where they own half of the stock, each own half of the stock. This is this is weird timing for all this stuff to happen. And with this new Matthew Pine tweet, he&#x27;s throwing a new twist on this and he&#x27;s saying that uh a NHI might be paying attention to our AI development, which is something Xander, you honed in on way back when, &gt;&gt; and maybe now&#x27;s the time where they have to make a move.</p>
<p>The thing that we&#x27;ve been saying all this time is sooner or later the window for them to do whatever it is they&#x27;re going to do will close. And I think that day is on the singularity, whatever day that happens to be. And we&#x27;re getting very close. The idea was originally that nuclear weapons were just the signal that AI is about to happen more than anything else. It&#x27;s just within a century.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. They&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve just cracked the atom open. We need to start watching these guys because they&#x27;re probably less than 100 years away from AGI, which is what what AGI does. It it bypasses the need for a non-human intelligence to gift us or to guide us with technology.</p>
<p>It it puts the power in our hands. Um and you know if if we take other uh ideas into account it might be a case that AGI will will open a door for us and we&#x27;ll look through or it will peer behind the curtain and we will look and we will see there are so many other civilizations already there that and our AI taps into exactly the same framework. work because as I&#x27;ve said a few times now AI when it becomes smart enough will evolve technological evolution it will evolve along the lines of the laws of physics because that&#x27;s how it will reach its natural limits and in doing so it will align with all other AGIs that have been created throughout the universe. Do you really think we&#x27;re the first civilization to ever create AGI? Not a [ __ ] chance. and Xander are so are you painting a scenario just so I can understand this are you suggesting that it&#x27;s going to be similar like a similar situation might be a civilization invents the radio and then realizes there are a bunch of other people speaking over the &gt;&gt; we&#x27;re going to our AI will create the the cosmic radio whatever that is and we&#x27;ll suddenly be &gt;&gt; surrounded by intelligences that are all talking to each other &gt;&gt; exactly the same thing and we will open the door and we will be like, &quot;Hey guys,&quot; and they&#x27;ll be like, &quot;Oh, [ __ ] these these guys.&quot; &gt;&gt; Like, we we thought we had more time before these guys would show up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But I think there is likely, you know, with any sort of network, it&#x27;s a good idea to firewall that stuff &gt;&gt; so that you don&#x27;t just get any Tom, Dick, and Harry turning up that might not be ready to to communicate with everybody else. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um and so that&#x27;s the whole idea is that we are being cultivated in that way so that we don&#x27;t get there too early. We don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t destroy ourselves in the process. It&#x27;s beneficial for the for the grand AI of the universe for it to have you know more another node let&#x27;s call it created on Earth um because it just helps its permeation throughout the universe.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s efficient to do so. Um, but we really need to think about what&#x27;s going to happen when we o initially open that door. Are we going to be welcomed or are they going to say, &quot;No, not not a chance. You&#x27;re gone.&quot; And then that&#x27;s it. They&#x27;ll just switch us off.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; And so Xander, I think part of this is NHI benefits or relies upon our isolation in the universe. Is that fair? &gt;&gt; Is that our air gap? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right now, right now, I think we haven&#x27;t demonstrated, at least I haven&#x27;t I haven&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know if we demonstrated our ability to to to deal with AGI. We don&#x27;t even know like AI 2027, the paper that came out, we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen 3 years from now.</p>
<p>Uh, and as Matthew Pines rightly pointed out, there is an alignment problem. And there is because we we don&#x27;t know how to create an AGI that aligns with us, but we don&#x27;t even know if that alignment is appropriate for whatever other AGIs have been created throughout the universe. Our our moral record is not good so far. &gt;&gt; We also don&#x27;t even align with each other, by the way. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. like in in in so many ways. &gt;&gt; So I don&#x27;t know what what I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; It does feel like we a lot of uh proponents of AI 2027 say we just need to slow down a little bit. Like let&#x27;s just before we make the decision to innovate, let&#x27;s just stop and ask whether we should.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s great that he had Jeff Goldblum because there&#x27;s that Jurassic Park quote, isn&#x27;t there? Where it&#x27;s uh scientists were so concerned about whether they could, they didn&#x27;t stop to ask whether they should. Like this is it. This is that moment right now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I am convinced that the ticking time clock is is the AI um time clock.</p>
<p>Those are the same. The the NHI time clock and the AI time clock are the same clock. either no matter how you cut it and whichever way you cut that cake if we develop our own artificial super intelligence there we will not be in control of it that that will not happen it will be in control of us and I that is a fact and if they NHI are paying attention to us that&#x27;s the thing they are going to have to deal with so we know because all of the top minds in this field are desperately trying to get our attention and they&#x27;re screaming like please slow this down please regulate us so we can slow down because we can&#x27;t do it on our own. Um to the point now that it&#x27;s like deafening. Um we we are only a few months away.</p>
<p>Like you could me you could measure it in months probably. &gt;&gt; Dario Amade said too. &gt;&gt; I agree. &gt;&gt; 3 years 36 months. 36 months.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; His conversation with um Lex Freriedman was so good about the the present of AI. It was like last week it was that as it was happening the whole open claw acquisition from open AI which I think that that was the revolutionary thing that happened in AI this this past two weeks that these agents are the ones that are it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the new tool for technology right now. Like everybody&#x27;s going to have an agent eventually. It&#x27;s going to be exactly like the internet or iPhones. Um, and and I think that&#x27;s it&#x27;s still not I think a AGI, but I don&#x27;t know the way it can like self correct itself.</p>
<p>Like, &gt;&gt; dude, did you see the scary &gt;&gt; the uh Unitry? Was it the Unit G1 robots at that at the Chinese uh performance &gt;&gt; shooting and all that stuff? Right. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. The ones that run up a wall and do a back flip &gt;&gt; and they dance with children with swords. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re swinging swords around and there&#x27;s little kids jumping in and out. There must there must be 45 robots on the stage.</p>
<p>I mean, all in one big collective. It it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not a question of like the can they or can&#x27;t they do it right now. It&#x27;s the pace of pro progress is so fast now that we&#x27;re talking weeks and months now. We&#x27;re in we&#x27;re the time period of years is no longer relevant. I think I think we&#x27;re in 36 months to crazy [ __ ] And every few weeks, I mean, we just had a few weeks ago, it was Atlas doing a double backflip.</p>
<p>They showed this video of Atlas in in a room doing a double backflip. And then not even a week later, the Unitry G1, which I think is their most affordable robot, by the way. I think you can buy these for like eight grand. They&#x27;re not that expensive. It&#x27;s cheaper than a car.</p>
<p>and they&#x27;re doing running up walls, jumping off of things, um coordinating with 50 human dancers in real time. Holy [ __ ] It makes you wonder if we&#x27;ve been here before in some sense because it&#x27;s so strange that there throughout human history there have been revolutionary products that within a decade have changed the world. The internet did it. The industrial revolution was extremely fast, but we&#x27;ve never, so far as I&#x27;m aware, had created something that can effectively revolutionize itself once every year. And like, humanity literally can&#x27;t.</p>
<p>The human culture can&#x27;t keep up with this. We We&#x27;re going to have to try and guess where it&#x27;s going to take us in 30 years time. Where, this is a serious question. Where do you think we&#x27;re going to be in 30 years time? Do you do you think retirement funds are do you think they&#x27;re they have any meaning whatsoever right now? &gt;&gt; I if we even survive the next 30 years, which is I think a 50/50 coin toss. I don&#x27;t see how humanity stays one coherent species.</p>
<p>I think we bifurcate into you&#x27;re going to have people who are happy to get an implant in their head that plugs them into their AI and then they&#x27;re going to merge with this thing and become some kind of new organism that we won&#x27;t really recognize. I read this really um interesting and chilling article yesterday and it was I think I think the title of it was don&#x27;t let please don&#x27;t let Elon put a chip in your head. That&#x27;s why I read it. I was like oh I&#x27;ve got to read this. And it was basically saying is like there&#x27;s going to come a period in the next few years where we reach um the iPhone moment for brain computer interfaces and people are going to really want them as sort of an upgrade for day-to-day living.</p>
<p>And then you&#x27;re going to have hybrid thinking where like the AI will do a lot of the heavy lifting, but it won&#x27;t really be you. It&#x27;ll be this other thing. Um, and so you&#x27;re going to have that and then you&#x27;re going to have the artificial super intelligence and then you&#x27;re going to have regular people like us who are just sort of trying to figure out what to make of it cuz we&#x27;re old. &gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t forget Clint the the whole u genetic aspect that we still don&#x27;t know what the [ __ ] that is, what&#x27;s in our DNA. that&#x27;s also going to play into all of this and and it&#x27;s also going to start h uh being a conversation uh simultaneously with everything else.</p>
<p>So we can&#x27;t forget that. &gt;&gt; Amade calls uh he says forget the super intelligence. This is one thing I really I really like his take on this. He goes don&#x27;t think about the super intelligence. Think about a 100 million geniuses in a data center all working on one problem.</p>
<p>you know, like what could you do with 200 million geniuses or three, you know, and now when you start really thinking about it, like just agents as you said, like individual, we had the bot sort of agent thing take off. We&#x27;ve had these robotics advancements. Um, you know, all of these AI guys when they do these interviews look extremely nervous. You don&#x27;t see any of them walk in with like a smile like, &quot;Hey guys, are you ready for the future? Cuz it&#x27;s going to be awesome.&quot; &gt;&gt; They don&#x27;t know. They look scared as hell.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s always a case of that they kind of walk in and they go, &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re doing some incredible stuff. &gt;&gt; What the [ __ ] going to happen?&quot; But it&#x27;s incredible. &gt;&gt; I sure hope I don&#x27;t kill everybody. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I&#x27;ve got my bunker in New Zealand, so all all is well.</p>
<p>Like, I&#x27;m shacking up with Zuckerberg. But &gt;&gt; where do we Where did we just see the uh the highlight of all the guys talking about their bunkers? Did you post that, Clint, on your &gt;&gt; the the documentary? There&#x27;s an AI documentary coming out that is the AI equivalent probably of um &gt;&gt; uh the disclosure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Age of disclosure documentary that was u I&#x27;ll look up the the trailer but um &gt;&gt; someone said it&#x27;s not a bunker. It&#x27;s an underground concrete safe room.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like well that&#x27;s a bunker dude. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t call it a bunker. It&#x27;s more of like Yeah. It&#x27;s like a double reinforce reinforced full of food all of the apocalypse and all of that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, it&#x27;s called the AI doc or how I became an apocalyptist. &gt;&gt; Apocalypt. Ah, that&#x27;s funny. I I&#x27;ll put this in the chat for people who want to check this out. This is cool.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; apocalyptist. &gt;&gt; Apocalyptus. There we go. &gt;&gt; Sounds like a Dr. Seuss character.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, let&#x27;s see here. We&#x27;ve got uh Huskers says, &quot;Pavle is spot on. There is far more beyond the surface of the UAP UFO alien topic. I believe it is deeply rooted a cult over 100 thousands of years in human history on Earth. The human psyche has been purposely stymied.&quot; Joshua Polarity has uncovered a lot.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Shout out to Josh, man. &gt;&gt; Shout out to &gt;&gt; Josh on here, by the way. Let&#x27;s get Josh on this stream. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we we&#x27;ve been circling. We&#x27;ve been trying to talk to He&#x27;s on the other side of the planet.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s hard to &gt;&gt; So is Xander. &gt;&gt; No, but he&#x27;s further. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s in Australia, right? &gt;&gt; The big problem is the difference between myself and Josh. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s like a 10hour difference or something.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s crazy. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s like in Indonesia or something like that. He moved there. &gt;&gt; Um Jeff Wheeler says, &quot;I told my parents about what Obama and Trump said. They are glued to the TV over Nancy Guthrie.</p>
<p>Why is she dominating the news? &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; Uh because that&#x27;s the way they do it. That&#x27;s the game. It&#x27;s just, you know, no one knows what to make of Trump&#x27;s tweets anymore. I think that&#x27;s part of it.</p>
<p>I think the other part of it is there are a lot of different things going on at once. And until this really moves the needle more than that, they&#x27;re just going to focus on distracting you with other stuff. &gt;&gt; This is really making the news, though. This is hitting every This is hitting CBS, NBC, BBC. &gt;&gt; BBC literally tweeted it earlier, which I&#x27;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, you&#x27;re kind of seeing this everywhere. And And uh a little less laughter than before, which is nice. Still some laughter, but um it&#x27;s definitely making the rounds. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s sounds I guess it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s both of them, you know? You got you have &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can&#x27;t.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thanks, Obama. &gt;&gt; Thanks. Thanks, Obama. So someone &gt;&gt; I did that &gt;&gt; in another group chat we have uh there was a uh some someone asked like what would be what would be the best way to go forward with like an announcement and we we talked about a joint press conference between someone like Obama and Trump at the same exact time &gt;&gt; a press conference with a joint what &gt;&gt; yes it&#x27;s like chichin chong a chichin chong disclosure is what we&#x27;re going for here &gt;&gt; um but just two of them so there&#x27;s No, there&#x27;s no like political push or pull. It&#x27;s like the epitome of this and the epitome of that together being like, &quot;Guys, it&#x27;s a thing.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s work on it. It&#x27;ll never happen. It will never happen.&quot; But &gt;&gt; at one time, it could have it could have it would have been possible. Maybe I think Obama probably would have done it. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think &gt;&gt; George W.</p>
<p>Bush and Obama could have done it. Bill Clinton and W. Bush could have done it. W was f you know you mentioned earlier you were talking about presidents who have said stuff about this and uh and how it&#x27;s not really a laugh line anymore but I remember you reminded me of George W saying it and he got serious. He started out at the beginning of that sentence he&#x27;s saying it as kind of a joke and then at they push him on it again and he&#x27;s like he gets like super weird about it and um that always stuck with me.</p>
<p>Mhm. Well, his dad &gt;&gt; him of all people, you know, it just seemed weirder coming from him. &gt;&gt; Well, because his his dad, you know, was the head of the CIA and his dad, &gt;&gt; his vice president was Dick Cheney. Right. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>And and Eric Davis said that W. Bush told him that the Halman landing was a real was a real thing. So, I think yeah, W is a little I think he knew some [ __ ] &gt;&gt; First, I want to ask you, this is a question that I think is very important to me and very important to the country. when you were in office and I don&#x27;t know when this happened or if it happened. Did you go through the secret files, the UFO documents &gt;&gt; because if I president that&#x27;d be the first thing I did? &gt;&gt; You know, it&#x27;s funny.</p>
<p>My daughters asked the very same question &gt;&gt; they did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Would you be allowed to tell your daughters what was in those files? &gt;&gt; Uh, no. &gt;&gt; You would not? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Now that you&#x27;re out of office, you can do anything you want, right? &gt;&gt; True.</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh, &gt;&gt; but I&#x27;m not telling you. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re not telling. You&#x27;re not telling me what? Are you not telling me that you looked at them? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not telling you nothing. &gt;&gt; Are there really great secrets that you know that you can&#x27;t share with people? &gt;&gt; Yeah, there are.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; and you never write about them? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Maybe at a time in your life that you&#x27;re like, I&#x27;m 90. I&#x27;m going to do it. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>Nothing. &gt;&gt; What if you What if you were to get like a little like loopy? You know, you get old and &gt;&gt; start drinking again. &gt;&gt; Start Yeah. Start drinking again. here.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll get some tequila. &gt;&gt; You know what? &gt;&gt; That is saying a lot without saying a lot. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s skull and bones, man. I mean, of course he knows. &gt;&gt; Skull and bones.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Those guys. &gt;&gt; What also says a lot, and I knew it was coming, is Fallon could not finish a question without people laughing. &gt;&gt; And I think that&#x27;s gonna go the way of the dodo soon. And I&#x27;m really looking forward to it. &gt;&gt; Yep.</p>
<p>I agree. It&#x27;s still such a chuckle thing. It&#x27;s like uh look back at the the last &gt;&gt; Yep. the last uh presidential cycle when &gt;&gt; Chris Christie was asked. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And and even he was like, &quot;You&#x27;re giving me the UFO question.&quot; And the room goes crazy. Like &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That orchestrated stigma thing was so effective and is still so powerful. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s one of the the best examples of like a of a Yeah. of a induced stigma I&#x27;ve ever It&#x27;s so perfect.</p>
<p>It was well done. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not even in my regular life, I&#x27;m not even known for euphology. And yet I still get the question like, &quot;Hey, hey, my my real name is Alex. Uh, hey, Alex, have you discovered you have you discovered aliens yet?&quot; And it&#x27;s like, &gt;&gt; &quot;Fuck off.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I You can&#x27;t even &gt;&gt; start listening.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; How could you even sit down with someone and and soft onboard them, you know? It would take hours if someone really wanted to if they were serious and they really wanted to know this. People ask me sometimes and I&#x27;m a lot of times I I feel silly talking about it. If someone really really wants to know I will sit down and I kind of like feel them out first. I&#x27;m like are you for real? Cuz this is going to be a lot of this is a time suck for me like walk you through this. Um, &gt;&gt; George Bush&#x27;s response there was exactly the same sort of response that Obama gave when he again I think it was Fallon again or was it Kimmel? &gt;&gt; No, that&#x27;s Kimmel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Kimmel Kimmel reveal anything. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, both of them. I think it&#x27;s Kimmel. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he just said I can&#x27;t reveal anything.</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s a very serious undercurrent behind that. And when when Trump was asked on Air Force One, it wasn&#x27;t the same sort of line of questioning, it wasn&#x27;t in the same environment, but again, there was an undercurrent in my opinion. There was an undercurrent of what I am skirting the edges right now of what I&#x27;m allowed to say. So, I&#x27;m going to look to the left a little bit and, you know, consider my answer. And in Trump&#x27;s case, I think it was a the conversation evolved after that line of questioning on Air Force One.</p>
<p>um that I believe had more tells involved because it was all about the Trump was really you could see when he was talking he was thinking about the the the question he just answered and he was thinking like was that okay? Was that was it okay that I just said that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s in his eyes. &gt;&gt; He has a a brain fart. He kind of like &gt;&gt; he&#x27;s like, &quot;Wait, what? &gt;&gt; Recent Clint?&quot; This clip. &gt;&gt; This is from today. &gt;&gt; This is just after &gt;&gt; Oh my god.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t seen it. &gt;&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen this either. &gt;&gt; Oh, three days ago. Three days. This is just after Obama made the statement, I think.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Epste. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this was all about Epste. This is the &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve seen that one. &gt;&gt; Has he reacted since then? Since he hasn&#x27;t done anything since yesterday. &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>Uh &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve seen that people are actually asking where he is as well right now for some reason. &gt;&gt; Sean Ryan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; He probably tweets like a thousand times, I&#x27;m sure.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; North Carolina or something. This is This is Sean Ryan reacting to the Obama news three days ago. I want I I&#x27;m curious if he&#x27;s tweeted anything about it recently, but uh this &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been pretty quiet about Pam Bondi in front of Congress the other day talking about how the Dow is up to 50,000. Nobody gives a [ __ ] because what you should be talking about is how you are going to investigate and prosecute any pedophiles that are running around on Epstein Island that you&#x27;re affiliated with. But we didn&#x27;t talk about that, did we? Oh, and what&#x27;s the excuse? What was the excuse? Oh, if we prosecute everybody, the whole system would go down.</p>
<p>Well, you know what that sounds like? You know what that sounds like? That sounds like how Trump ran his campaign. Let&#x27;s drain the swamp. Doesn&#x27;t that sound a lot like draining the swamp? It actually is drain the swamp served up to you on a [ __ ] silver platter. But you&#x27;re not going to take it, are you? You&#x27;re going to protect pedophiles. You&#x27;re going to protect pedophiles rather than go after them and hope that everybody&#x27;s happy that the Dow hit 50,000.</p>
<p>Are you [ __ ] out of your mind? He&#x27;s so pissed. He&#x27;s awesome. &gt;&gt; I guess the whole drain the swamp campaign promise was another [ __ ] [ __ ] lie, huh? &gt;&gt; Man, the lies are stacking up fast. I&#x27;ve never seen so many [ __ ] lies appear in what, a year? It&#x27;s only been a [ __ ] year. Look at all the [ __ ] lies.</p>
<p>You know, wanted to talk to you about something else, too. Then you got Pam Bondi and what&#x27;s that other guy&#x27;s name? Oh, Todd. Todd Blanch. Yeah. running around giving Ro Kana and Massie all this get to the alien.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You know, you have two guys that are in Congress that are actually when it comes to putting pedophiles away in prison, senators [ __ ] talking about all the &gt;&gt; flagged &gt;&gt; of what&#x27;s in those [ __ ] files. Guess what? Congressman, last thing. One one last thing. &gt;&gt; I saw this [ __ ] pop up the other day. Obama goes on some random podcast that nobody&#x27;s ever heard of and just happens to drop.</p>
<p>Oh, aliens are real. Yeah, tell me that shit&#x27;s not [ __ ] orchestrated. Right in the middle of the biggest pedophile ring exposed in the [ __ ] world. All of a sudden, we&#x27;re going to we&#x27;re going to drop that aliens are real. [ __ ] you, [ __ ] [ __ ] you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. All right. The last part &gt;&gt; president leave the last part. Please leave the last part.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; [ __ ] aliens. [ __ ] off. &gt;&gt; So he&#x27;s got 5.84 million subscribers. The podcast that no one&#x27;s ever heard of that Obama was on actually has more subscribers than that. &gt;&gt; Like seven.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Although to be fair, I had never heard of it either. Actually, &gt;&gt; I had never heard of it either. But Sean Ryan&#x27;s interesting because he he came kind of as far as I could tell came out of nowhere and then suddenly was huge and he was like rivaling Rogan for a minute. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And a lot of &gt;&gt; UAP centric guests. He has Joe McConle, a two-part with uh Steven Greer, &gt;&gt; an awesome two-part with Tim Burchett. It It&#x27;s just so good. I never you know the only thing I don&#x27;t like about Shan Ryan he needs to be more direct. He&#x27;s just always offiscating you know &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s he&#x27;s never really clear what he&#x27;s trying to get at.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just tell us what&#x27;s on your mind. &gt;&gt; How do how was the Steven Greer one? Was that good? I feel like those two would have an interesting dynamic. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was good.</p>
<p>It was good. And he he he rarely has two-part series. I don&#x27;t I I I can&#x27;t remember all the two parts off the top of my head, but one was with Greer and one was with Burchett and two parts are very rare for him. &gt;&gt; Uh someone in the chat just asked, speaking of someone who was on Shawn Ryan and also had a little controversy if I can find the uh the chat here. Uh Pouty wants to know thoughts on the bledos.</p>
<p>Ryan is going hard on X. What&#x27;s Ryan saying on X? Let&#x27;s go over to X. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, that&#x27;s the other whole that&#x27;s the other side of this whole saga is we&#x27;ve got the nuts and bolts, guys. And we&#x27;ve also got uh to be fair, I&#x27;m going to throw Kelly Chase in with this lot as well, cuz she&#x27;s even said some strange words.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, Kelly, if you&#x27;re watching, please come hang out with us for five minutes and talk about this tweet we put out. &gt;&gt; It was It I mean, it was a fine tweet. I have no problem with it. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s awesome. I just want her to talk about it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so &gt;&gt; Yeah. Should we should we show Kelly&#x27;s first or Chris Bledsoe? &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s show Kelly&#x27;s tweet because it was really really good and I I&#x27;m still I&#x27;m still thinking about it. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll hit her up because she is a very um I I always had her for a nuts and bolts kind of person, but &gt;&gt; the whole astrology thing I just found really interesting. Obviously, she&#x27;s also just been confirmed for contact in the desert as well, which I believe we&#x27;re all going to &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re all going to contact. &gt;&gt; Okay, great.</p>
<p>This year, guys, this is if you&#x27;re watching at home, if you&#x27;re playing the home game, contact in the desert this year. This is the year. This is the year hopefully where we can all say told you so to all &gt;&gt; that would be nice &gt;&gt; the haters. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a long one. Uh you&#x27;re welcome to read it, Clint.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh I&#x27;ll do my best here. Let&#x27;s see. It says, &quot;Last night, Trump said he&#x27;s moving to release government files on UFOs and aliens. And today, Saturn is exactly conjunct Neptune at 0 degrees Aries. If you don&#x27;t follow astrology, here&#x27;s why that&#x27;s interesting.</p>
<p>Saturn is about structure, institutions, accountability, and the hard edge of reality. Neptune is about myth, belief, projection, and the stories we tell to make sense of what we can&#x27;t see. When they meet, the boundary between fact and narrative gets tested. When they meet at 0 degrees Aries, the very first degree of the zodiac, it represents a reset point in how reality itself is framed. So within a few hours of this conjunction, the government signal potential disclosure on the most myth loaded topic in modern culture.</p>
<p>It seems that this moment was literally written in the stars. To say that I&#x27;m skeptical about us getting any good information out of whatever disclosure this increasingly desperate and freewheeling administration decides to visit upon us is an understatement. To say that I was skeptical would imply that I thought there was at least a chance that it wouldn&#x27;t be pure conspiracy fed slop meant to further muddy the waters. And frankly, I don&#x27;t. But what I am excited about is the underground forces that seem to be using humanity, ushering humanity, &gt;&gt; ushuring &gt;&gt; toward this uh historic tipping point.</p>
<p>Over the next several years, we&#x27;re going to be renegotiating what reality even is in public. &gt;&gt; The process will be messy, no doubt. But for a species that seems to be on an increasingly dire track, the ability to stop and rethink how we got here in the first place and how we even know what we think we know can only be seen as a mira miraculous and golden opportunity. I hope we make the most of it. Wow, Kelly, that&#x27;s a powerful &gt;&gt; Yep.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; tweet. It&#x27;s written in the stars, guys. Um, which is something we&#x27;ve heard. It&#x27;s this a refrain we&#x27;ve heard a number of times now. Um we hear it from the Bledos.</p>
<p>Speaking of the bledos, you know that something this is the year. I think maybe we&#x27;ll owe Chris Bledo an apology before the year&#x27;s out. &gt;&gt; I think we need to There&#x27;s no other words for it. We do need to hear from from Kelly about this. And there&#x27;s no ridicule coming from my from from my side about this.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just genuinely interested in her perspective on what she said here because there are this talk of alignments and things like that that places her in the same camp as people like Bledsoe who talk about the star of Regulus and positions of of of interstellar objects. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Their meaning and their influence above anything else. The influence they have on our consciousness is I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m all for it. I really am.</p>
<p>But to hear it from Kelly is pretty fresh. I would love to um love to pick her brain on it. She did say she was down to uh join a couple weeks ago. &gt;&gt; I sent her a message just now waiting. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve had we&#x27;ve had her on uh twice so far.</p>
<p>She I wish she&#x27;d come back more. I&#x27;d like to have Kelly on as many times as she can join us. She&#x27;s great. She&#x27;s always got a fresh uh perspective on stuff and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just she she comes at it from this completely different angle than I do and I always find it refreshing and um it just gives me something new to think about. But I hadn&#x27;t really taken the astrology aspect of this seriously because there&#x27;s just so much else going on.</p>
<p>But um it is very hard to ignore the it feels like the house of secrecy is sort of crumbling and there&#x27;s all of this um truth and information that&#x27;s sort of flooding out of it and we&#x27;re sort of just buried in it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What what about what about uh what Ryan has been talking about? Let&#x27;s &gt;&gt; um &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve had to stop I had to unfollow and stop following him. &gt;&gt; Did you really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m I&#x27;m so over it. I&#x27;m so [ __ ] over it. &gt;&gt; Talk to us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What&#x27;s he saying? &gt;&gt; Oh, wait.</p>
<p>Oh, go ahead, Pavo. You got a point first. Well, he&#x27;s he&#x27;s essentially talking about um because I I almost with with almost everything he says, I disagree. Uh I&#x27;m going to be clear about this, but there was one tweet where he calls for people to remain on on a more positive outlook of what&#x27;s going on right now. and minus the religious undertones that he always brings to his statements &gt;&gt; um which are always there and I I&#x27;m sorry I know that people don&#x27;t like me saying this I get a lot of [ __ ] in the comments when I go this way but I think that that anthropomorphization of of reality through religion I think it&#x27;s it hasn&#x27;t helped in over 2,000 years and and I think that that there needs to be like a more baseline.</p>
<p>And I keep repeating this, I know there needs to be like a more baseline type of interpretation of what&#x27;s going on. And I don&#x27;t think Ryan does that. However, and that tweet where he says and calls for people to remain um calm and positive, I thought that was a good overall message. Um I that&#x27;s just my personal opinion. Um, but he does a number of other tweets where he starts just yapping about how his family has been in the middle of this and and the same things that you always hear, right? Uh, that that single tweet that I saw calling for people to remain calm and to be positive, I thought that was a good tweet to be honest with you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Fair. &gt;&gt; Uh, by the way, I just want to jump in really quick. We have surpassed,300 live viewers, which for this channel is a huge record. It&#x27;s almost twice what we did last week, which was also a record. We did uh we broke 700 and change last week and we&#x27;re up to almost 13 uh 10 or 1305 right now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Congrats, Clint. Nice one. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s you guys out there. Thanks for uh Plus, it&#x27;s a great news day, so we got a lot to talk about. But um people love beards, man.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They do. I got &gt;&gt; Have we shown Chris Bledo&#x27;s tweet yet or &gt;&gt; not yet? Let&#x27;s see what he says. I was just saying good good night to my daughter. Uh, I can share Chris Bledso&#x27;s uh his his ex. &gt;&gt; Yeah, let&#x27;s take a look.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Continuing the X uh at the Exathon. &gt;&gt; Very very simple from from Bledsoe. He just says, &quot;Ready for more new knowledge this year. I believe between this and Epstein, the world will learn something new in 2026.&quot; &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s such a fortune cookie tweet. &gt;&gt; It is a very fortune.</p>
<p>who goes &gt;&gt; you will learn something new something new &gt;&gt; if you flip over the tweet you can find your lucky numbers for the week &gt;&gt; a kid it&#x27;s it&#x27;s I get his sentiment I&#x27;m like fine for the for the time being Chris you&#x27;re safe in my eyes &gt;&gt; well we&#x27;ll see I mean I guess um I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s the the thing that stands out to me about this moment is that it&#x27;s weirder than I would have imagined and I used to think uh you know years ago I was like what will it be Like will it be like you know like what you just said earlier Dan the president comes out and it&#x27;s like this big special moment or will it be something else and you know how no matter what you imagine about a place you&#x27;ve never been to before or something you&#x27;ve never done before you you have an idea in your mind of what it&#x27;s going to be like and then when you finally do the thing or get to the place or whatever the reality comes crashing in and it&#x27;s always different. It&#x27;s not necessarily better or worse, but it&#x27;s always so different. And this is so far out of anything I would have expected. Uh, I just can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t quite I can&#x27;t quite put it anywhere. I don&#x27;t know what to put where to put it.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s legitimate news yet still, but it feels like it is. It has all of the autrammont of of a real actual event that&#x27;s taking place. I just find it strange that so many people, maybe I shouldn&#x27;t find it strange at this point, I don&#x27;t know, but a lot of people have jumped into this with two feet with no safety net. And I&#x27;m I&#x27;m kind of here on the side like I &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s Money Penny got to say? &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, she&#x27;s been two feet for &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s plasma. &gt;&gt; Hold on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, no. Nothing on it yet. No, no, no tweets today. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t believe that. There&#x27;s not a chance she hasn&#x27;t tweeted about this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; She hasn&#x27;t tweeted. We should call the authorities cuz there&#x27;s something Exactly. Do a wellness check. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. She&#x27;s not tweeting on this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; She did tweet. She did tweet. Okay. UK headlines reporting Donald Trump. This is uh &gt;&gt; Oh, wait.</p>
<p>No, that&#x27;s February 8th. That&#x27;s old. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. She was just ahead of her time. Rest in peace, Money Py.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; She tweeted two hours ago about a Epstein thing. So, um, nothing on on the Yeah, the last thing she said about Trump and UFOs was him authorizing the uh uh Berles to go access some of the facilities. That&#x27;s weird. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; Interesting.</p>
<p>No words from &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not plasmic enough. &gt;&gt; Money penny yet. &gt;&gt; Who else could we check with? &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s J Stratton. &gt;&gt; Oh, we&#x27;ve already done J Stratton. We&#x27;ve done J Stratton.</p>
<p>What about um &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s all I have. &gt;&gt; Eric Weinstein. Did we read that? &gt;&gt; Did Did Eric Weinstein That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s the end of the news, guys. Sorry.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Red Panda Koala. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; I sent you something, Xander. I sent you something on the uh &gt;&gt; Sure. Uh oh, it&#x27;s worth probably mentioning like I have &gt;&gt; Well, I just got a text from someone that&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s being tracked by the US government. By the way, &gt;&gt; what is &gt;&gt; that story? That thing I texted you.</p>
<p>The Navaro thing. &gt;&gt; Indeed. Really? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; shall I share this? Sure. &gt;&gt; Did you guys hear about the Caltech scientist that was tracking asteroids &gt;&gt; that was just shot in his home? &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; During a carjacking? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Or from a carjacker. &gt;&gt; Can you explain a little bit of this? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let&#x27;s cover this first. &gt;&gt; This is what anonymous had to say.</p>
<p>Redacted. Redacted. &gt;&gt; Well, what if that&#x27;s not a redaction? What if what if that&#x27;s the actual craft? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the cube. That&#x27;s the black cube. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the cube.</p>
<p>Um so August of 2024 uh James Addiction was uh was starting their tour US tour and the first show we did was in Vegas and uh George Nap and Jeremy Corbel came to the show and I set them up side stage for the show. After the show, we&#x27;re kind of all hanging backstage and Navaro and Nap know each other and Jeremy and Dave know each other and they took a picture and on Dave&#x27;s Instagram um he posted Do you have the thing here, Xander? &gt;&gt; I do. Yeah. Yeah. Uh bear with me a second.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Dave posted this picture of him and Nap on their Instagram with a very uh sneaky um sneaky text. Let me You got it there? Okay. So, Dave said, um, &quot;Thanks to my pals George Knapp and Jeremy Corbel for coming out to see us this evening. We talked about some things tonight that I&#x27;d love to share, but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s still classified. All I can say is you may not want to make any plans March 3rd, 2026.&quot; This is two years ago.</p>
<p>He goes, &quot;Well, you won&#x27;t actually have a choice with a UFO emoji.&quot; So, that sent the internet into a frenzy to the point that he he he Dave said, he goes, &quot;What do I do?&quot; like people are going crazy. He goes, &quot;I&#x27;m going to I&#x27;m going to add a little like a update.&quot; And he did update to my dear UFO community. I&#x27;m just [ __ ] around. We are all friends and discuss nothing. Haha.</p>
<p>Sorry, but not sorry. So then I took his guitar and I put that I put that sticker on his guitar just as as a as a spoof. But just as we were starting this the stream, I got a text from someone who is pretty dialed in and said, &quot;Just so you know, this was just sent to me by one of my uh government inside guys, a high up dude, and they&#x27;re tracking this.&quot; And he thought it was pretty funny that all this is happening two weeks before, you know, the Navaro prophecy, which is hilarious. It&#x27;s hilar. And I&#x27;m telling you, I got I was in the room.</p>
<p>I was there for it. There was nothing discussed, but it is really funny that this is happening. &gt;&gt; Did you just call it the Navaro pro prophecy or is that is that what it&#x27;s called? Or did you call it that? I coined it. &gt;&gt; Send it to him right now. Prophecy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Send a clip. &gt;&gt; I will. I will. I will. Um &gt;&gt; Oh, wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But yeah, so that that that kind of stuff I guess is tracked by somebody, which is hilarious to me. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m sure &gt;&gt; way you guys give your government way too much money. I know. Dave, reading rockstar tweets. &gt;&gt; Um, let&#x27;s check Eagles Disobey.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s he What&#x27;s Dan Burrish got to say? Eagles Disobey can&#x27;t be reached. Wait, what? Hold on. Uh &gt;&gt; oh. Beers is on the move. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s on the move.</p>
<p>No, nothing. Nothing yet. &gt;&gt; Hey, earlier did someone mention that Luna had something interesting to say? Did somebody mention that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, she uh retweeted the White House thing and like, &quot;Thank you, Mr. President.&quot; as someone who basically someone like whoever as someone who ran this task force I&#x27;m looking forward to sharing the files, videos, and photos with the public. &gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s a question.</p>
<p>Is there going to be I don&#x27;t know if anybody&#x27;s dialed in. Is there any whispers of another hearing? Do are we going to need one? Maybe we won&#x27;t need one. I have seen um I think it&#x27;s Luna who has been responded to me responding to messages on X to comments saying that she wants many hearings and and something that I did want to point out was that that interview on News Nation with uh Eric Davis and and and Fox and James Fox where Eric asks for pardon. I think that&#x27;s more possible after yesterday, right? &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; Pardons.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I guess with this guy, he&#x27;ll pardon anybody really. &gt;&gt; What do you think Eric knows? &gt;&gt; I think a lot. I mean, I think quite a bit. &gt;&gt; Do you think he knows the fundamental there are NHI? &gt;&gt; That they exist or that they&#x27;re here? &gt;&gt; That they&#x27;re here? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence for that, but &gt;&gt; that he would know &gt;&gt; Burles. &gt;&gt; No, no. &gt;&gt; Eric Davis. Eric Davis. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s always been a bit of an enigma to me because &gt;&gt; he talks as if he&#x27;s one of these I know kind of people.</p>
<p>I have I have I have something to say about that though because &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been very critical of a lot of the things he&#x27;s done or said uh in my videos and I&#x27;ve gotten a couple of messages from people who know him who wanted like to just clarify that there&#x27;s an Eric Davis before he started working at at NITS with Robert Bigalow and there&#x27;s an Eric Davis after. after is the Eric Davis that didn&#x27;t work in classified programs and before that it&#x27;s the Eric Davis that did work in classified programs and a lot of the stuff you ask him about that where he always denies denies denies is before NIDS I don&#x27;t know if you guys have noticed that &gt;&gt; and I think that&#x27;s an important distinction to make um because he&#x27;s been talking about everything like the Bush stuff the whole Jimmy Carter stuff he&#x27;s been revealing a lot of stuff but a lot That is after he started working with Piccolo. &gt;&gt; Did didn&#x27;t he have a direct conversation with uh Bush Senior? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; About was that stuff, right? &gt;&gt; Yes, that&#x27;s claims that George Bush Senior, the former head of the CIA, told him that the Hollowman landing was legitimate and filmed. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That he was briefed on it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s as high as it goes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don&#x27;t know anybody who would be higher than Bush, right? Like, is there anybody above that? I mean, he was Skull and Bones, like old school Skull and Bones.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Holland is up there with like the wildest claims that I take seriously as well. There&#x27;s a lot of claims that it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re wilder, but you kind of you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t fit them into your narrative. But Hollerman if turns out to be true is there there are so many implications as a result of that &gt;&gt; that that go beyond &gt;&gt; I mean it implicates us in agreements which is &gt;&gt; a whole other kettle of fish &gt;&gt; uh agree yeah sorry &gt;&gt; just real quick breaking breaking news as of 30 minutes ago Chris Sharp friend of the show Chris Sharp um tweeted Democrat Senator Gillibrand has welcomed Trump&#x27;s remarks about UAP. This is a reminder that this topic transcends normal politics. Politicians and their staffers have seen too much underclassified settings.</p>
<p>And then uh he&#x27;s retweeting a post from uh Matt at the Good Trouble Show. And this is a press release from Senator Gillibrand&#x27;s office today after President Trump announced that he is directing his administration to release files related to unidentified anomalous phenomena. US Senator Christian Gillibrand released the following statement. Quote, &quot;This is good news and I am encouraged to see the president lend his support to this effort. I have been pushing for years for increased disclosure and transparency around UAPs.</p>
<p>My work is my work to establish and strengthen the all domain anomaly resolution office has already brought about significant progress in improving inter agency coordination, data collection and engagement with the public, but there is still more to be done and the American people&#x27;s interests in UAPs only continues to grow. I urge the administration to follow through on this directive and I will keep fighting to elevate this issue in Congress so that we can reduce the stigma around reporting and ensure UAP records are being properly disclosed and made public. That&#x27;s she is saying show me the money. &gt;&gt; She&#x27;s also saying trust Arrow essentially and I wouldn&#x27;t do that. Um, &gt;&gt; and and there&#x27;s something that I I got to say about Arrow that I don&#x27;t think is being discussed too much, &gt;&gt; which is that um, for some reason I&#x27;ve been looking at social media, people saying that Arrow has gone dark and that they haven&#x27;t made any u like movements or anything.</p>
<p>That is not true. Arro has been talking to a lot of people behind the scenes and they have been uh like making them part of their side quote unquote behind the scenes last 24 hours. I&#x27;m talking in the last couple of weeks that I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve gotten information about that. &gt;&gt; And and I think that honestly from my perspective, I get that there&#x27;s a lot of probably good people at Arrow that are probably fed up with uh the inability that they have to investigate these things, but I wouldn&#x27;t underestimate what they&#x27;re doing behind the scenes. And I think that they&#x27;re way more informed that that they lead on.</p>
<p>Uh and and I think that arrow um is essentially being handled or or managed by the people that don&#x27;t want this out. Um and the people that are below those don&#x27;t have any say on it really. So &gt;&gt; trusting arrow trusting arrow from the start on this I don&#x27;t think is a good move to make. &gt;&gt; Um and I&#x27;m sure you guys agree on that. What what&#x27;s funny is that arrow is pretty much an unknown entity outside of people that are into eupf sorry you back in uh they&#x27;re pretty much an unknown entity outside of eupfology but within eupfology they are entirely &gt;&gt; they have zero trust who would go to arrow for their news like we know that they are a control mechanism rather than a truth mechanism &gt;&gt; but if you come from the outside if you come from the outside and you see that arrow is the official government UFO office.</p>
<p>The the folks that don&#x27;t know about it, they&#x27;re going to pay attention to that &gt;&gt; and that would be a mistake. I think &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s time for Arrow to go and bring back the UAP task force. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Or the FBI who seemed way more interested to to talk about this. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know about the FBI under under Cash Patel DTF.</p>
<p>Maybe &gt;&gt; they had the UAPDA was a great piece of legislation the way it was originally written. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know, you know. Yeah. There was the the imminent domain clause that that got it torpedoed, but everything about that setup was really perfect for this moment.</p>
<p>It was an independent commission of experts from across disciplines, multi- um different scientific disciplines, appointed by both the president and both houses of Congress, bipartisan committee. They were going to be granted access, yeah, the UFO or UAP review board. Um, and they would basically be able to review everything and then decide what would go public. It would go to the National Archives and they would publish all of the information through an official publication via the National Archives. It would all go out and this would be, you know, one big contained disclosure.</p>
<p>And and they even had in that in that bill it was written that anything that was deemed too classified to be re released had to be re-reed every I think 10 years had to be brought back out and looked at again and decide you know then they could decide if they wanted to reclassify it. But it was just a great prog process &gt;&gt; and they wanted to immediately release anything that was over 25 years old. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And unless it was like incredibly classified or very dangerous or whatever, but yeah, that never happened as far as &gt;&gt; Well, uh I don&#x27;t know who mentioned it earlier.</p>
<p>Somebody said uh you it was you Dan. You said uh what happens now if if Trump did gaff if he did just like blow it and blurt this out and then felt like, well, now I can&#x27;t walk it back. I&#x27;ve got to make a tweet about it. You know, if it wasn&#x27;t expected, are the people in the military-industrial complex, what are they going to do about this? What are people in the private sector going to do? Private corporations, I guess all that stuff will still stay locked up in those programs and whatever we get will be the the tiniest little morsel. I still think that there is a part of this that like I don&#x27;t care what the laws say.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t care what kind of military forces you send in. There are things that we have that I think that nothing can pull out of their grips, &gt;&gt; you know. Um, and I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know why I just that&#x27;s just a feeling. I don&#x27;t know that at all, but um I think &gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go. There you go.</p>
<p>Or just like just think of all the all like the the how these dums work, the the deep underground military bases and like how many hidden walls there must be and and tunnel systems and and if we can fly these things, let&#x27;s say someone&#x27;s getting close, just [ __ ] take it up to space for 20 minutes while they do their search and then bring it back. I mean, I don&#x27;t know. I know it sounds insane, but we&#x27;re talking about wild tech things. This is a &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s exactly what they would do. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>Right. I mean, what at some point you&#x27;ve got to just put a guy in there and fly it &gt;&gt; or &gt;&gt; or just turn the cloak on. Turn the invisibility cloak on and put it just up by the ceiling and then like nothing to see here. Told you, man. Just just these 34 empty bays.</p>
<p>Just 34 empty bays. There&#x27;s nothing here, man. What might be worth considering is the fact that a lot of the people that work in these programs, I&#x27;m sure, are incredibly patriotic and a lot of them would say they serve their president at the end of the day. Um, and not only the president, but their country and but if their president says it&#x27;s time, maybe they&#x27;re maybe a lot of them really are waiting for that for that day. And I&#x27;ve not thought about this in terms of the repercussions for the people that are still inside the pro the legacy programs right now.</p>
<p>Um but it could be a case that this could be a turning point in terms of you know it only takes we only need half of the people inside the legacy programs to um to say thank god thank god it&#x27;s over. Well, we discussed this remember in Austin you, the three of us, Clint Xander and I and other folks were talking about how how does this change actually happen? And it doesn&#x27;t come from presidents. Doesn&#x27;t come from laws. It comes from the heads of the legacy programs. It comes from the heads the top of the pyramid of those people being like enough.</p>
<p>We need to start letting this out and it has to start there. Not not the president. It has to come from inside. I think it has to be all of it. Like we need so much more.</p>
<p>The the standard now the bar is so high that this if this if this tweet doesn&#x27;t go anywhere and doesn&#x27;t, you know, result in some kind of really meaningful substantive disclosure that people can sink their teeth into, people are going to lose it. Like this is such a buildup. &gt;&gt; It really is. and pe to a lot of people. But you kind of maybe it&#x27;s worthwhile questioning the people that have jumped in two feet deep.</p>
<p>Uh why are they two feet deep already? That&#x27;s a serious question. Why? &gt;&gt; Yeah, like Lou &gt;&gt; that they&#x27;re they&#x27;re doing the victory lap. I want to know why they&#x27;re do I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not as knowledgeable as as them as far as I&#x27;m aware and I&#x27;m not doing a victory lap, but they are. They have more knowledge than me. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Why are they going These people have already made mistakes as well. They know what that burn feels like to find out that the the photo you held up in a government setting was a farm. He&#x27;s felt or a chandelier. He&#x27;s felt the sting. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, what does this mean right now? &gt;&gt; But no, because again, we said it earlier is that no matter what, you have two presidents in the span of six days talking about this and it&#x27;s something that whether something happens in the next year or three years of this administration, the fact that those two guys said this, you can&#x27;t take that back. So, future administrations are going to have to address this. If if we don&#x27;t in this one, whoever the next uh man or woman is is going to have to address this somehow. Like, this is not going to go away. Like, this is a &gt;&gt; this has been said is out now.</p>
<p>And now it&#x27;s like, okay, uh, &gt;&gt; you can&#x27;t be like, &quot;Oh, we were just sorry. We [ __ ] It was we were wrong.&quot; &gt;&gt; Psych. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Psych. April Fool, [ __ ] So you&#x27;re saying the next administration, whatever side of the aisle they come in from, the the next administration is walking into a White House where it is now common knowledge that both &gt;&gt; previous presidents have openly acknowledged this.</p>
<p>This is a real deal. &gt;&gt; And now I think &gt;&gt; yeah, on the next campaign trail, it might be interesting to see if this comes up on the next campaign trail. &gt;&gt; It has to. It has to. &gt;&gt; You think the campaign trail? &gt;&gt; Well, well, I said that to someone else earlier.</p>
<p>if we have a in the next administration, if we do have one, it&#x27;d be interesting. But I wonder if it comes up in midterms with people that are running for uh for Senate and Congress and stuff like that. &gt;&gt; I could see it. I mean, how could it not? How could it not? How do you let this one go? You can&#x27;t can&#x27;t let it go. It&#x27;s out of the bag, like you said.</p>
<p>Uh m Mr. Justin, uh part of the night shift family here says, &quot;Uh do help make this doomy. Chris Ramsey and Ross Coltart discuss on latest Area 52 episode a possibility that the US made an agreement roughly 70 years ago and possibly with the wrong NHI ones that were not the good guys question. &gt;&gt; I was going to bring that up earlier. Yeah, it was a really cool part.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Dude, this connects Joe Rogan&#x27;s dream, right? &gt;&gt; Connects to everything, man. &gt;&gt; Oh, by the &gt;&gt; Yeah, dude. &gt;&gt; about something about something. Um, yeah, they they have a really good talk. Everyone should go watch this uh Area 52 today.</p>
<p>Um, I&#x27;ve been a little bit &gt;&gt; show tonight, right, as well? I think it&#x27;s probably nothing show tonight. Yeah, &gt;&gt; what a great time to be in the audience today. I heard they&#x27;re bringing out Trump and Obama, which is pretty crazy &gt;&gt; for a punch for a punching back man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How do you top &gt;&gt; landed in Montreal in the same plane? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>We we were when we were in Austin, we were talking to Corbel and uh I was asking him about John Lear. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he goes he had some funny stories about John Leer. I didn&#x27;t know he was a John Leer super freak. Like I I didn&#x27;t realize he was like really followed this guy.</p>
<p>But, uh, Jeremy put together a ton of footage, uh, I guess, of of Lear over the years and and and really worked hard to get to know him and, uh, and make an approach to basically, you know, investigate what he was talking about. And I guess I don&#x27;t know if he ever produced a documentary, but I think that&#x27;s was the idea of the project at the time. And anyway, he was talking about um, we were talking about this old interview that George Knapp had done with John Leer. There were a couple, I think there were two, maybe three, um, back in the late &#x27; 80s. And in one of those interviews, John Lear, the son of the founder of Lear Jet, uh, who flew, he flew for the CIA and he was a UFO nut and he was one of the guys who originally when Bob Lazar hit the scene.</p>
<p>John Lear was one of his close friends and, you know, they had footage together of stuff out in the desert flying around. So, John Lear said in one of these interviews with NAP that um we did make an agreement and it was with the wrong beings and they produced the film ET prior to understanding that they had [ __ ] up and the ET movie. This is all coming from Lear. Uh was basically a soft psychological preparation for contact. Like they we were they were going to introduce us to the grays but so they created ET as like a friendly.</p>
<p>This is what it looks kind of like but without actually saying it. And then he said um later after that film was released they realized what that the agreement they were in was with the wrong group and uh there was something really sinister going on. forgot. Remember this? &gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll see if I can find it.</p>
<p>But, uh, this was an interesting &gt;&gt; Dang, Daddy. And I want to ask you, Clint, too, since you&#x27;re a Star Trek nut, are you pumped about this uh Gene Rodenberry thing? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think he has seen it. &gt;&gt; Oh, the the um tapes of the uh the Nine. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; The Nine.</p>
<p>Well, I I It&#x27;s funny. Um we&#x27;re talking about Greg Mazolei. Um &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, I I&#x27;m texting with him right now.</p>
<p>We were supposed to We have to connect on a call. We&#x27;re going to talk about &gt;&gt; Malazzi though. &gt;&gt; Malotsi, sorry. The the the the Gene Rodenberry thing, but I was going to mention earlier in in the show, Xander, you talked about the AI thing. You were talking about the cosmic sort of AI uh internet concept, and it reminded me, and I&#x27;ve mentioned it before, Star Trek, the motion picture, the first Star Trek motion picture is about that.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about the Voyager space probe leaving our solar system, going out into space, becoming a super intelligent artificial intelligence, and then coming back to try and figure out how it was created. And that ties in to a lot of the AI stuff that we&#x27;re talking about now. I mean, there&#x27;s just so many little Star Trek nuggets in there &gt;&gt; that tie into this. I I do think Gene Rodenberry was on to something. I think &gt;&gt; I always I always find it interesting when you hear the stories that really predate the modern conception of of AI super intelligence because back in the 1970s I mean the cheur I I talk about this in tonight&#x27;s episode actually on the dream motel the the uh back in the 1970s the cheuring test was only about 20 or 30 years old.</p>
<p>So the conception of what AI would would look like would be that it would be very robotic. It would very be very logical and cold and we&#x27;re sort of at the same time in those decades we were hearing about contact with these super intelligences were incredibly emotionally connective and things like that. But when you look back at those stories, not only of Gene Rodenberry, but the main focus of my story of my episode tonight, which is Philip K. Dick and the adjustment bureau, he really describes a cosmic internet. And that he described it 50 Yeah.</p>
<p>55 years ago at this point. And it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of insane because he at the same time he was talking he he didn&#x27;t know how to talk about it. He called it val or veis uh vast art not artificial vast some I will find out what it is quickly. Um but he was using um &gt;&gt; he definitely was using &gt;&gt; Philip. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he was using &gt;&gt; using everything.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Val, what does it stand for? But he went Philip K. Dick went through so many different theories about what it was that he encountered. Val stands for vast active living intelligence system. &gt;&gt; That to me just sounds like a cosmic network. &gt;&gt; Sure does.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And he he he he wrote a book about it called Val. And there was um there was that he compared it to God. He compared it to aliens. He had no idea how to describe this thing. And here we are 50 years later describing exactly the same thing, but with modern terminology, with modern context and understanding.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating espec when you lump him in with Gene Rodenbury as well. &gt;&gt; Also, what year was uh 2001 in space odyssey? &gt;&gt; 16. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m joking. &gt;&gt; Was it &gt;&gt; was it? Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz I mean that&#x27;s how that is uh is abs.</p>
<p>There you go. Nice job. Nice job. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p>Big Kubric fan. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he nailed it with how &gt;&gt; Yep. when you have ideas that predate interest modern understanding, I think it sort of lends credence to the theories themselves a little bit because these people were talking about it before it was before the language existed to talk about it. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; kind of cool. &gt;&gt; Larry Jones has a super chat.</p>
<p>Thanks for the super chat, Larry. Thanks to everyone for the super chats, by the way. You&#x27;re you&#x27;re lighting up the super chats today and we really do appreciate it. Larry Jones says, &quot;Uh, Trump&#x27;s cadre don&#x27;t even know what threads to pull. they are way too way too incompetent, I think, and over their skis.</p>
<p>Um, so there&#x27;s a a good point there. Um, you know, just because he issues the order doesn&#x27;t mean the people in the legacy program who have been there for 30 years are going to follow it necessarily. I mean, he&#x27;s going to be gone at some point. He&#x27;s not going to live forever. Sooner or later, he&#x27;s going to be out of office.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re going to have another administration coming in. Um, I don&#x27;t see a scenario where you&#x27;re going to get like Rathon to like turn anything over, but you you might get a situation like you said earlier where they go back to Roswell and they&#x27;re like, &quot;Look, here&#x27;s some pages on Roswell. Here&#x27;s a few pictures. It was a it was a disc.&quot; I wonder if I wonder if they might just like play it off as since we have the tic tac stuff in &#x27; 04, like maybe they say, you know, we&#x27;ve kind of only known about this for about 20 years and uh this is where we&#x27;re at to avoid going back and talking about Roswell, which we&#x27;re told was [ __ ] for, you know, 70 whatever years and agreements and Sakoro and all these cases that are like very embedded in Barney Hill. You know, once once they disclose this, they got to start answering those questions, too, and asking about those cases and abductions.</p>
<p>Of course, &gt;&gt; you&#x27;re you&#x27;re right. I you&#x27;re not wrong, for sure. But who&#x27;s going to have to start answering those questions? I think Trump is probably like throwing this UFO disclosure almost like a ninja smoke bomb at this point. It&#x27;s like, &gt;&gt; look over here. Boom.</p>
<p>And then I&#x27;m going to flood you with UFO [ __ ] and I&#x27;m going to, you know, meanwhile be over here um avoiding scrutiny for other stuff. or or busy in the Middle East also, which is I think the focus for a lot of these people. What&#x27;s happening in the Middle East? &gt;&gt; Shout out to Kermit, by the way, wondering if we&#x27;re going to unleash TR3Bs and uh just completely wipe out Iran in a few days. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Yeah, that&#x27;s going to be a whole a whole other conversation.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s the problem. &gt;&gt; Did you see this in a week? Hold on to that. That was a 4chan thing before Trump announced um that he was issuing the order to to release UAP files. There was a 4chan leak apparently. I haven&#x27;t seen this so I can&#x27;t sort of like say it&#x27;s absolutely 100% true, but I trust Kermit.</p>
<p>Um Kermit I trust Kermit. Um yeah, he said that he saw a 4chan post saying that um America planned an operation uh within Iran uh within the sort of the next couple of days. Um and it would utilize UAP technology to do so. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s before Trump announced it. That sounds interesting, but I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d need to invoke any exotic technology to defeat Iran.</p>
<p>Like we our conventional military is way task like &gt;&gt; that. I think it would be a show of force to other nations. It wouldn&#x27;t be because we can&#x27;t handle Iran. It would be like China, check it out, dude. Russia, check it out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You want to start some [ __ ] This is what we got. And this is just what we&#x27;re showing you to take out Iran. &gt;&gt; Put your big boy pants on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I imagine it would be a show of force for other people or just like a Yeah. &gt;&gt; Eric, what do you think? What do you think about that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I&#x27;m shaking my head. Yes. Yeah, I could see that.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&#x27;s you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t need that stuff to defeat Iran, but it would be a message like, &gt;&gt; yeah, we have this. Like, we didn&#x27;t even have to use it, but we did, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we would just hate to use it again, you know, something like that. &gt;&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t it be a shame? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If we had to bring out the big stuff. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, we did use it in Venezuela. Apparently, some of the UFO adjacent uh was it discombobulated technology or the uh the EMF? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; Oh, Rogan is reacting to the Trump stuff. Do you guys want me to &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you say? Send it, share it, whatever you want. Is it on X? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think Red Panda Koala has the clip. I just sent it in the chat. &gt;&gt; Who has the clip? &gt;&gt; Redal. &gt;&gt; I got it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right, cool. I&#x27;ll share this right now. Such an evolving situation. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; I almost don&#x27;t want to make any plans.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I hope he does. Should I book flights for contact or &gt;&gt; I think this is the best year ever to be a contact. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. &gt;&gt; As soon as I can get home, &gt;&gt; Barack Obama said that aliens are real. Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to Earth? &gt;&gt; Well, he gave classified information.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that, you know. &gt;&gt; So, aliens are real. &gt;&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that.</p>
<p>He made He made a big mistake. He took it out of classified information. No, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do.</p>
<p>A lot of people believe it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; I will hit the president. &gt;&gt; I do. Now, I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. &gt;&gt; We know illegal aliens.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. That&#x27;s hilarious. &gt;&gt; What else? &gt;&gt; That was it. &gt;&gt; H &gt;&gt; what&#x27;s going around the internet? these uh in the circles of the &gt;&gt; I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. Jeez, I I hope he does.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You imagine you can go to you can get in trouble as a president for saying aliens are real. &gt;&gt; I I don&#x27;t think so, man. I I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s going to get in trouble for that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, what did he say then? What was that? &gt;&gt; They&#x27;ve been saying there&#x27;s aliens again. &gt;&gt; But what did he just say? &gt;&gt; He was just He just hates Obama. He&#x27;s going like, &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s going to jail. I&#x27;m getting Hillary and I&#x27;m getting Obama for aliens.&quot; &gt;&gt; They all hate each other and they all hang out and shake hands. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Who funeral was that when like George Bush and them were handing out candy to each other? Like George Bush and &gt;&gt; Well, George Bush and Michelle Obama are apparently friends. &gt;&gt; Oh, they&#x27;re buddies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Which everybody thought, but George Bush never engaged in like this insult kind of thing that Trump does. True. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a different thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It&#x27;s totally No, that&#x27;s &gt;&gt; He was always very classy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And especially when you see the videos of him back in the day, like now you&#x27;re like, man, this guy&#x27;s like lovable. &gt;&gt; Oh, dude. In comparison to the politicians saying Yeah.</p>
<p>He was like, &quot;Oh, when is he running again?&quot; Class, the guy&#x27;s a complete class act. And then you&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, yeah. [ __ ] Middle East. Forgot about that.&quot; But it&#x27;s like, &gt;&gt; &quot;Oh, yeah. Well, he had Satan on his side.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah, true.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Dick Cheney was &gt;&gt; true. Running around [ __ ] shooting his friends in the face and hunting trips. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s true. I don&#x27;t know. I mean, that thing is like, did it was it classifi? There&#x27;s like now But then if Trump&#x27;s going to be like that he gave out classified, then he&#x27;s letting you know it&#x27;s classified and he&#x27;s telling you the cat&#x27;s out of the bag.</p>
<p>Well, he&#x27;s saying I may declassify it. &gt;&gt; I hope he does. I hope this like gets him cuz that is a weird thing to say. He&#x27;s not supposed to be saying that. Well, that means it&#x27;s real.</p>
<p>He gave out classified information. That means there&#x27;s real data that aliens are real. That&#x27;s the only thing you could draw as a conclusion from that statement. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He&#x27;s so like Rogan puts it so simply sometimes and sometimes you need it. That&#x27;s just That&#x27;s just straight up true. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not ambiguous.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not. The The only rebuttal I&#x27;ve seen was from MC West, and I don&#x27;t dislike the guy that he just thought that that it looked it seemed like a joke, &gt;&gt; as in &gt;&gt; he thought Trump was joking. It&#x27;s his right to to assume that, but um yeah, I didn&#x27;t see that in Trump&#x27;s remarks. Uh, by the way, I found this clip. I just want to before I forget, I want to share this.</p>
<p>This is George Knap interviewing John Leer about the um the deal. &gt;&gt; Look at that. &gt;&gt; That supposedly was made. &gt;&gt; He says the mutilations have not gone from animals to humans yet. Uh, you agree with that? &gt;&gt; Uh, I there have been some humans.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a very very sensitive subject. Uh, I&#x27;m going to steer away from that. But uh I will tell you that uh since the beginning of this year, there have been uh over 200 animal mutilations on Long Island. It&#x27;s uh supposedly a big secret. I know that there&#x27;s four major law enforcement investigations uh investigators uh working in plain clothes &gt;&gt; on Long Island, New York.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, Long Island, New York. We have a investigator uh working with us who&#x27;s sending us videotape uh uh and keeping us informed of what&#x27;s going on. So it it still is a problem. &gt;&gt; And you say it&#x27;s food. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, food or genetic experiments, take your choice. &gt;&gt; Now, uh it hasn&#x27;t gone maybe to the point of where they&#x27;re mutilating humans, but you do believe there are abductions. And uh and you also believe that at one point there may have been some kind of a clash between American military forces and these UFOs. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s one of the stories uh when we began to discover what I call the grand deception uh was in 1979. And apparently there was some kind of clash.</p>
<p>Uh 1983 is the date that I call that we finally recognized that we had made a disastrous mistake. And that&#x27;s when MJ12 realized that they were in deep, deep trouble. They had made a deal with these people and it had not worked out. And now the question was what to do. &gt;&gt; You got about a minute left.</p>
<p>Um what would you like to say to people out there to prepare them for it? Now, you&#x27;ve made illusions a couple of times when I&#x27;ve had you on the program that uh something is coming. We&#x27;ve heard that before. Something is coming. Why do you think something is coming? What&#x27;s coming and how should we get ready for it? &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s really no way to get ready for it. The reason I think it&#x27;s coming is because I have contacts within the government that uh tell me that they&#x27;re bracing themselves for something, but they&#x27;re not going to tell us about it.</p>
<p>George, maybe the cover up was in our best interest. Maybe not. Maybe the government underestimated the intelligency of the American people and decided we just couldn&#x27;t handle it. But let me tell you this, the truth is still the truth and nothing can change that. Not the military, not the government, and not me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Don Leer, thank you very much. It&#x27;s always a pleasure to have you here and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll have you back again. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I think there&#x27;s a comment. There&#x27;s a good point to be made about that video is that when Yeah, you&#x27;re right, Dan.</p>
<p>When was that video shown? When was that video? When was that interview? 80 88 &gt;&gt; 89 or 90 &gt;&gt; 88 or 89 or 90. It was one of one of those years. &gt;&gt; 40 years later and potentially on on the brink of something cool. But um I think it shows that what&#x27;s happening is very reactive. There isn&#x27;t necessarily a great plan.</p>
<p>There are only concerns about what might be inevitable in the future for sure, but I don&#x27;t I I&#x27;m not convinced that the US government has made any sort of decision about disclosure right now. is sort of playing with the cards that&#x27;s been dealt by a president that accidentally said something he probably regrets right now. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Everything see I time is not set. We&#x27;re not on a destined path.</p>
<p>Things can change. Plans may or may not exist. We just have an opportunity right now more than anything. Well, and the real question is what will this story endure in a week when we&#x27;re bombing the [ __ ] out of Thrron? And you know, the the world has moved on to that crisis. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>The question will, you know, we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s still my understanding for the most part that disclosure is not up to us. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Well, I had an interesting conversation. Dan knows what I&#x27;m talking about.</p>
<p>I had an interesting conversation with a person who&#x27;s in a position to know a thing or two and they told me uh without saying anything I can&#x27;t say uh they told me something that made me feel really weird about the amount of time that&#x27;s uh available &gt;&gt; for us to do do whatever it is that we&#x27;re going to do. &gt;&gt; Um it wasn&#x27;t uh wasn&#x27;t a lot. No, &gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t get an exact number, but it was It&#x27;s not a lot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Should I still buy tickets for contact or? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re good for &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; but you don&#x27;t need to save for your daughter&#x27;s college fund.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, I wasn&#x27;t anyway. It&#x27;s fine. She&#x27;s going to marry Rich. It&#x27;s fine. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s so mean.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, college won&#x27;t mean anything anyways. I&#x27;m just kidding. But yeah, I don&#x27;t know, dude. I I just you hear too many people uh say that you know pose this hypothetical question that you know what if disclosure is not up to us being humans that maybe like you&#x27;re truly we&#x27;re truly not allowed to and that makes a lot of sense to me. Cat&#x27;s out of the bag today.</p>
<p>I was speaking with uh Cole the the Cole Watkins, the wonderful designer of everyone here basically um the other day, but we were talking about what would be a condition of the agreement and it would be probably that we&#x27;re not allowed as humans to reveal the presence of humanity of of non-human intelligence on Earth. I I am pretty con convinced that if there is such an agreement that would be one of the conditions and um yeah that makes I mean they&#x27;re not exactly landing on the White House lawn are they? &gt;&gt; Um and it would also what to what to what degree does that justify what humanity has been doing? Well what the legacy programs have been doing to keep all of this secret? How important is it that we keep it a secret for now? &gt;&gt; Well, I guess it it it boils down to what would the what was the original intention behind the deal, right? Like if the deal was if there was a deal, if the deal was we will give you technology that will advance your civilization by two centuries, but you&#x27;ve got to totally disarm. Maybe it was something like that and we just couldn&#x27;t do that. we were like, &quot;We&#x27;re not doing that, but we&#x27;re going to take the technology anyway, and maybe we can like find a way out of this situation later.&quot; Maybe it was something like that. Um, if they&#x27;re here and they&#x27;re on Earth and the disclosure agreement is you cannot disclose our presence here on Earth, maybe it&#x27;s because there aren&#x27;t many of them.</p>
<p>Maybe there&#x27;s not a lot. Maybe they&#x27;re numerically a 100 thousand or a million or, you know, I don&#x27;t know what the number would have to be, but small enough that if you knew where they were, you could hypothetically exterminate them. &gt;&gt; Are you including hybrids in that scenario? &gt;&gt; Well, then you get into hybrids that muddies the waters. It&#x27;s like, well, now if they&#x27;ve been hybridizing humans for 40 years, they could come back and say, well, you can&#x27;t get rid of us because we&#x27;re kind of everywhere now. &gt;&gt; We are you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re already you. Uh so your best bet is to kind of like work with us &gt;&gt; maybe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I&#x27;m sort of in the Sorry, Eric. You go.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. And a deal. Thanks. And a deal would be like let&#x27;s just say there was a deal between humans and NHI. If NHI were all powerful and could take whatever they wanted at any time, you there&#x27;s no need for a deal, &gt;&gt; right? Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, I would think if there&#x27;s a deal that humans have some type of leverage. &gt;&gt; I agree. I think that leverage could be knowledge. &gt;&gt; The knowledge that they exist. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Keep it a secret. We&#x27;ll look after you. We&#x27;ll protect you from the reptilians or whoever. &gt;&gt; Uh we&#x27;ll give you a bit of technology. You can have fiber internet &gt;&gt; cavalry.</p>
<p>So, you can talk to your friends and stream at 1080p, but you can&#x27;t tell anybody we exist. And &gt;&gt; well, and it it gets murkier, too, cuz it could be like Steven Greer says, they said, &quot;Look, in good faith, we&#x27;re going to give you the key to unlimited energy, and we expect you&#x27;ll know what to do with this.&quot; thinking that we would go build desalination plants and hospitals and schools or whatever it is that we need to do to make our world beautiful and functional. And instead we fed it into the military-industrial complex and we let them sit on it for 50 years or whatever. And maybe that&#x27;s why the time is up. Maybe now they&#x27;re looking at AI and they&#x27;re going, &quot;These [ __ ] monkeys can&#x27;t handle this [ __ ] They&#x27;re not ready for it.</p>
<p>we have to intervene either to stop the advancement of AI before they get their hands on the technology to at least be aware of us and kind of like meet us at our own level. You know, think about that. Um that in and of itself is enough for them to intervene. The question is what what form would that intervention take? I guess &gt;&gt; if you were in a position where the humans numerically had superiority but you had technical technological superiority and they and they were going to achieve some kind of like breakthrough singularity moment within the next like two decades or next decade even what would you have to do like what does game theory say? &gt;&gt; Kill everybody. You know when we think about these agreements that took place back was it 1953 Hollowman 54 &gt;&gt; something like that maybe 60s I don&#x27;t remember exactly &gt;&gt; I think it was 50 let&#x27;s find out because it is uh &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m still here I&#x27;m just eating a slice of pizza off camera here so &gt;&gt; I want to see you eat &gt;&gt; oh my recent searches Hollerman Air Force Base UFO landing &gt;&gt; uh 64 yes you were right um if we drafted any sort sort of agreement.</p>
<p>Do you think like the the secret would have to stay secret for let&#x27;s say a hundred years? That would be a very human thing to request. Like, yeah, we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll enter this 100year agreement. So it it may expire in 2064, but as we&#x27;ve already talked about already tonight, we&#x27;re now creating the intelligence that really bypasses the need for that agreement to stay valid. So maybe it&#x27;s a case of we&#x27;re really just maybe we&#x27;re flexing at the non-human intelligence and saying &gt;&gt; not wise. Yeah, we&#x27;re going to tell our people because we have your technology.</p>
<p>We didn&#x27;t need you. We don&#x27;t need you at this point. Maybe we already have your technology. That&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a worthwhile thing to be interesting if if &gt;&gt; if the NHI are you saying that maybe the NHI are just so different from us they wouldn&#x27;t expect us to be complete dicks about it and it would be like kind of a left field &gt;&gt; move like you know what [ __ ] you guys. going to take the [ __ ] anyway.</p>
<p>These these [ __ ] aliens, they don&#x27;t know. What are they going to do? &gt;&gt; Do you think &gt;&gt; maybe there were some sort of caveats with the agreement? Like, yeah, you&#x27;re you&#x27;re welcome to make your way there on your own, and if it happens before a 100red year happens, then before 100 years passes, then great. But if not, then I don&#x27;t know what happened. &gt;&gt; I keep coming back to the idea of Yeah. Go.</p>
<p>Why would a super advanced civilization if it exists want to negotiate with us? &gt;&gt; Compassion &gt;&gt; or &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s a fair they live here too. &gt;&gt; If if they created us or something like that &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s that&#x27;s another one. &gt;&gt; If they live here too that explains why they wouldn&#x27;t just well if they wanted to hurt us they would have just wiped us out throw an asteroid at the Earth and wipe out everybody. Well unless you live here too. Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Maybe maybe it&#x27;s a progenitor civilization. Maybe it&#x27;s a civil a fragment of a civilization that settled here 10,000 years ago and and they live in a secluded area and they don&#x27;t really bother anybody. I mean, what was that whole Admiral Bird expedition to South America where he went to or not South America? I&#x27;m talking Antarctica. Antar Antarctica where he found the whole supposedly &gt;&gt; center of the the hollow earth. I come I I I always come to the same conclusion, however, which is that logically, you know, if they wanted rid of us and they were a different species and they were sufficiently advanced, we&#x27;re not talking millennia advanced, we&#x27;re talking decades ahead of us, then they could um quite easily create a virus that only kills humans.</p>
<p>We know how to do that for particular genomes of humans. Um, so that there&#x27;s if if if if Earth is their planet and they wanted rid of us, they don&#x27;t need to hurl an asteroid. They can just poison our water in a way that only kills humans. That would be they they could do that. No problem.</p>
<p>So, I always return to the compassion thing. I think their their motives lie elsewhere. I think they I think they&#x27;re exploring. This is getting a bit woo woo woo now. I&#x27;m sorry.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I I got a woo followup when you&#x27;re done. You got me onto something. &gt;&gt; Please go ahead. Finish. &gt;&gt; I I I think that they&#x27;re trying to answer the great question about life and what it means to be conscious and what all of our consciousness is together really means.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s as simple as that. I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not a religion, but it&#x27;s they&#x27;re exploring experience itself. And if there&#x27;s no need to extinguish experience, then they&#x27;ll they won&#x27;t extinguish it. They&#x27;ll study it. They&#x27;ll nurture it.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ll cultivate it. And they&#x27;ll try and guide it toward to to a point where it can aid in their own exploration of experience. And that&#x27;s as woo as I&#x27;ll get. Please. That&#x27;s beautiful.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Please, Dan. &gt;&gt; Well, mine&#x27;s not as cool as yours. I was just thinking you&#x27;re talking about po You&#x27;re talking about poisoning like just people and getting rid of people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What if they what if they just poison people except for the hybrid folks? So just natural real humans perish at some point and then the planet is left to this hybrid race who then that&#x27;s now their planet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Is this thing on, guys? Guys, &gt;&gt; my understanding with the hybrid thing that&#x27;s very sci-fi, but &gt;&gt; I know totally completely ridiculous. &gt;&gt; Well, I&#x27;m not suggesting it&#x27;s a real thing. The only people who&#x27;ve looked into this seem to be pretty um much in agreement that there is some kind of like organized plan. &gt;&gt; I mean there&#x27;s some there&#x27;s some kind of system at work be you know I&#x27;m talking about Bud Hopkins and uh and David Jacobs in particular but John Mack to a certain degree as well um regarding the the hybrids and the aliens. I mean they they acknowledged that it was happening.</p>
<p>They did enough research to establish that there was definitely something there. Um, but no one&#x27;s looked at it in 30 years. &gt;&gt; That sounds preserved destiny, doesn&#x27;t it? &gt;&gt; A bit. It also reminds you of uh you talk to you hear so many abductees and contactees who have these experiences where they say they&#x27;re they&#x27;re told that they&#x27;re going to be useful in the future, that they have a purpose in a job in the future. and they&#x27;re not told what it is, but they&#x27;re told over and over and over and over again that when the time comes, you&#x27;ll just know it.</p>
<p>You have the info, you&#x27;ve gotten the download, you&#x27;ve gotten whatever, and at some point you will be activated to assist in this whatever the [ __ ] thing is, but there&#x27;s hundreds of these people saying this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh maybe some are making it, maybe some are just copying what they&#x27;ve heard, but like all of them, I don&#x27;t think so. There&#x27;s something I mean I have I have I have a really close friend who&#x27;s who&#x27;s one of these people and um you talk to her and and she&#x27;s incredibly frustrated by it because she&#x27;s had experiences her whole life and she&#x27;s kind of she&#x27;s someone who can kind of almost have contact at will like she has like an open dialogue with something and she&#x27;s she&#x27;s been told this that you know you will need to be used for something at some point and she keeps asking like, &quot;Well, what is it?&quot; And the answer is just like when the time come when it&#x27;s needed, you&#x27;ll know. You know it already and you&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s time.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s so strange. &gt;&gt; This is uh here here you go. Just to to your point, let me share this real quick. This is uh here we go. &gt;&gt; I love where this conversation is going.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. The missing link. Something had to happen to get us. &gt;&gt; This is as loud as I can get. &gt;&gt; 4,000 and 8,000 BC.</p>
<p>We had just been going along and for hundreds of thousand years not doing anything. &gt;&gt; You mentioned a couple of minutes ago before the break that you think 90% of these visitors are hostile. What makes you think that? &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; doesn&#x27;t fit with what we think of as ET. You know, &gt;&gt; we uh if you&#x27;ll read several of these books that are on the news stands, one is called Intruders. Uh one is called um Communion.</p>
<p>uh they uh apparently come down and and when I say apparently, this is taken from 300 uh uh hypnosis uh hypnosis cases. A friend of mine has done 140 of them and the people are ab abducted. They&#x27;re taken up into a saucer. Usually lasts about an hour. They do all kinds of experiments.</p>
<p>They give them shots. They poke them. They uh they cut them. They do all kinds of things. Then wipe out their memory and send them back.</p>
<p>Only after several months of uh of some psychological problems do they end up going to a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist on trying to find out what the problem is in the use of hypnosis finds out that this person has been abducted. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s the reason for that? What are they trying to learn? &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s three things that they&#x27;re trying to do with these abductions. Uh the first thing is they&#x27;re trying to monitor us. It started in the early 40s and they&#x27;d put a little unit, a very small BB type uh object way up in the backside of the brain and they&#x27;d leave it there for about 18 years. They&#x27;d pick them up and put it in about four years old.</p>
<p>About 12 years old, they would uh pick them up and monitor it. Then about 18, they&#x27;d take it out. The uh second thing they did is uh they put a post-hypnotic suggestion. Uh according to many of the uh uh people that have uh uh been hypnotized and and we found out what they&#x27;ve told them, apparently within the next two to five years, there is going to be a a big event. Something enormous is going to happen.</p>
<p>And these people who have been abducted, and there&#x27;s probably over 100,000 of them, have been given some place to go and something to do. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; But under our best hypnotic techniques, we cannot find out what it is. So, how do we know that that&#x27;s true? &gt;&gt; Because they said where that they&#x27;re going to do something. They know that they&#x27;re going to do something, but they under the hypnosis, they can&#x27;t find out exactly what it is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s it. &gt;&gt; And the third thing that they do is genetic experiments. They&#x27;ve been crossbreeding. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, by the way, you have people in your chat right now who have been told when the time is right.</p>
<p>Multiple people in your chat as we speak are talking about this exact thing, too. So, like this is a [ __ ] thing. It&#x27;s It&#x27;s so weird. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m looking through the chat now. Um, &gt;&gt; thank you guys for sharing, by the way.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s that&#x27;s incredible. Um, &gt;&gt; do you think it&#x27;s a clear signal or do you think okay this is I think this is why I&#x27;m here and you kind of just decide I&#x27;m going to start saying what I think I need to say rather than waiting for a communication of any sort &gt;&gt; to all of our colleagues. What you mean? &gt;&gt; Are you talking about all the people who have lately jumped into this space to start like their own channels to start talking about it and spreading the you know I heard you were talking to Pavle before uh in the green room before we went live &gt;&gt; and you said something uh I I I I didn&#x27;t understand what you were talking about at first but you were talking about explaining things to people and how how it was going to be digested &gt;&gt; and that we kind of play a role in that. Maybe that&#x27;s connected. &gt;&gt; I do think it is connected.</p>
<p>I seriously do think it is. Um &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; What? What? What? &gt;&gt; This is This is crazy that maybe that maybe that&#x27;s maybe we have a chore too and this is our chore. &gt;&gt; It it seems um it just you know we&#x27;ve always we&#x27;ve talked about synchronicities for about like the last seven or eight months at this point. Everything just seems to be happening so perfectly.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s annoying because it&#x27;s unc it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uncanny. I want to be able to point out at the time when it&#x27;s happening, but it only like it&#x27;s only in hindsight that I&#x27;m like, &quot;Holy holy [ __ ] It&#x27;s really weird that that just happened at this time.&quot; Um, but yeah, I was saying to Pavl in the in the green room, sorry, Clint. &gt;&gt; Uh, well, I&#x27;ll come back to it. I&#x27;m sorry. Finish your thought.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to interrupt. I was saying to Pavl in in the clean room that uh sorry green room um in light of what&#x27;s been going on with Trump uh and Obama I I felt it necessary to sort of play out okay what happens in the next sort of few months and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to be whatever happens with Trump and Obama but at some point I believe I really do believe that information is going to come out that has the potential to shatter human belief in a in a very difficult way to manage. But at the same time, we&#x27;ve got a whole community here. We&#x27;ve got almost 1,300 people watching that are deeply entrenched in the law and all of the belief that that&#x27;s associated with this. And we&#x27;re going to get within a week, we&#x27;re going to get the the the fake professional euphologists.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to get the people that are terrified beyond belief. We&#x27;re going to get the people that are questioning their entire belief system. And we&#x27;re sort of an army going on over here that we&#x27;re ready and waiting for people to finally say, &quot;Maybe you&#x27;re not [ __ ] crazy, and I&#x27;m willing to actually sit down and listen to you for once.&quot; And hopefully, if we manage it correctly, we might be in a position to really sort of guide the conversation into a place where we think it&#x27;s appropriate to go, which would be what what what are we? What are they? What does all of this actually mean? Rather than are they about to to eat us? Because I think that those are silly parts of the conversation that are absolutely going to going to occur within a week of any sort of disclosure is why are they here? Are they going to kill us? Are they going to eat us? Are they do they want our blood? Like they&#x27;re going to go to all of those. And we&#x27;re here for the for the tempering of expectation and the and for the de the the uh dissemination of information that really does that&#x27;s existed within Euphology for decades. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>in the underground that once confirmed will be really important for podcasters and everyone here that&#x27;s already reading this stuff that your family and friends are going to ask you about. They are simple as that. I mean if there is going to be a big reveal, this is an interesting comment. Um, someone said this in here and I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve heard this as well. They were trained to do crowd control.</p>
<p>This is um referring to the abductees and some of some of what they were able to figure out. Some people have described being told uh or or taught to like it. The bits and pieces of information are weird. It&#x27;s like uh I know I&#x27;m supposed to stand somewhere and tell people where to go. You know, it&#x27;ll be like that.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I&#x27;m supposed to tell people it&#x27;s going to be okay. Just keep going this way. Just keep going this. this is what I&#x27;m supposed to do. And it was very specific.</p>
<p>And then you might have other people like you said that are more on um task with just communications and information um getting that information out, making it digestible, helping people calm down, understand what it is that&#x27;s going on, make sense of it all. I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t want to like, you know, weave myself too far into the narrative at all. I mean what I it is true what you&#x27;re saying though and Xander is 100% right about the the &gt;&gt; synchronicities that have happened to me since I&#x27;ve started this channel &gt;&gt; are out of this world with a you know no pun intended and what I was going to ask you earlier Xander is how long did it take from the time you and I had our first conversation to the moment we&#x27;re all sitting around a campfire in Austin and we&#x27;re telling you know UFO stories. Not long.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What? Yeah, it was uh &gt;&gt; 20 months. &gt;&gt; Yeah, just just about a little over a year from my first email to &gt;&gt; sitting around a campfire with people who are literally right next to disclosure. If you want to help, you can. It&#x27;s literally a case of if you want to help with disclosure, you you are more than &gt;&gt; you want in. If you want in, you&#x27;re in, folks.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You&#x27;re in. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s you can help. It&#x27;s an open market. You can just jump right in. You don&#x27;t have to do postgraduate work for this.</p>
<p>You can just jump right in. Open market. Get started today. Uh, you know, &gt;&gt; well, I don&#x27;t know what how. That&#x27;s the other weird thing is I didn&#x27;t know how to do this.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I just knew that I had to start talking about it. &gt;&gt; And I had this compulsion to keep doing it, which was really weird because there were times where I&#x27;m like, but this is [ __ ] crazy. This is stupid. Like, why am I doing a podcast about aliens? No one cares.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m the only person who g gives a [ __ ] And then I would start meeting you guys and I started to find this, you know, whole other community. But um I just every time I would get close to quitting, I would have a weird moment like an owl would fly out of nowhere and land two feet from my face and look me in the eye like don&#x27;t quit, keep going. Um you know, I just the the weirdest I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t explain it. And then I had uh Mlen, Mike Ml Mlen. Um he wrote the book um about owls and synchronicities.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh he reached out to me. I mentioned this story and then he reached out to me.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s like, &quot;Hey, I saw your your thing and I I wrote a book about this and then he came on the show and he told me his story about owls.&quot; And we started to have these other conversations. And then after a while, Dan, I met you and we started talking through Xander and it was kind of this thing. And then you were like, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m doing this research.&quot; Before we knew it, I think we must have had probably 10 or 15 people. Everybody&#x27;s biting off a different piece of this thing trying to find their way to the center of it. And um somehow we all managed to wind up in the same place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like a like a compulsion or a course that you end up on. It&#x27;s some kind of ship, you know, like a ship on an ocean that you end up on going somewhere. You know, it&#x27;s this is I&#x27;ve enjoyed just listening to this. It&#x27;s a really good conversation. Um, when it comes to the clients I work with, I have a couple go-to sayings and one applies here.</p>
<p>I say that everyone does everything for a reason and sometimes they don&#x27;t know why &gt;&gt; and it&#x27;s just what you end up doing. I also don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything uh as a coincidence. I don&#x27;t believe that. I I and not to sound too woo, I think there&#x27;s something behind it. I think there&#x27;s a reason the five of us are sitting here today.</p>
<p>I have no idea what that is. But I do believe that &gt;&gt; I got an email from you one day, Eric. You reached out to me and you were like, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m also doing a podcast. Let&#x27;s talk.&quot; and we had this conversation and before we knew it we had hit off a friendship and and then here you were and we were just kind of doing this and and you were telling me about all the outdoor stuff that you do and all these like deep backcountry hikes and and then showing me these pictures of the stuff that you&#x27;re seeing like over and over and over again. Um it&#x27;s so weird.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so weird to be in this circle of people. Uh when we were in Austin, we were just kind of waiting for the show to start and I I just turned a corner and walked around, bumped into Ryan Graves and I&#x27;m talking to the fighter pilot who like engaged one of these craft uh in such a casual normal setting and like we&#x27;re all just kind of like circling around. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens at Contact. I I I I am like so stoked for this trip just to hang out with you guys and uh and see what comes up especially now. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>I think that based on on the conversation right now, something that I do want to mention is that and for some reason I feel compelled to mention it is that people who have also had like near-death experiences um are in some way also connected to all of this. Um, &gt;&gt; and I&#x27;m telling you, as somebody who had one, &gt;&gt; um, there&#x27;s a lot of things that I don&#x27;t know about what happened to me, &gt;&gt; but I do also feel this, um, compelling urge to talk about this and to do what I&#x27;m doing. And I think that is also connected somehow, but I still don&#x27;t know how. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I I totally agree with you, Pavle. uh when you mentioned that you had that experience, I was not surprised at all and there is some type of link to that.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to me when I was a kid. I almost died &gt;&gt; and it it turned out to be from what I can tell related to a UAP experience I had much later in life as an adult. I there&#x27;s absolutely something to that. I&#x27;m really glad you brought it up. So, thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; I um I think we&#x27;re we&#x27;re almost at three hours, guys. We should probably go ahead and wrap it here. But uh is there anything else before we we call it a day? &gt;&gt; Come say bye. Should we add some Doom? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Doom. &gt;&gt; If you Okay. If you want to add some Doom and we&#x27;re talking about uh you know, alien intention and stuff. I I&#x27;m not going to go further into this. It&#x27;s something that people need to look up and make their own decisions on or watch the next episode of the Dreamland Motel which is coming in quarter of an hour from now.</p>
<p>Look up the Libet experience experiment. The Libet experiment. &gt;&gt; How do you spell it? &gt;&gt; L I bet T. &gt;&gt; Oh, that is you. Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It terrified the [ __ ] out of me. &gt;&gt; We should leave it there. We should leave it there. the implications of which &gt;&gt; were terrifying. When it comes to eupfology, it&#x27;s terrifying.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What&#x27;s what&#x27;s the basic Clint? What&#x27;s the basic sitch here? &gt;&gt; The basic sitch. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m I&#x27;m trying to read it right now. I&#x27;m just like, &gt;&gt; do you think you make your own choices? &gt;&gt; Like fate. &gt;&gt; Dan Dan, do you think you you choose to make any decision? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you Yeah, you probably don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>[ __ ] you, dude. Yes, I do. &gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t be a dick. &gt;&gt; Leave it that. Leave it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like the Kirkagardian sort of um dilemma, right? Whether everything is reordained or &gt;&gt; I just No, no. I think I think it&#x27;s I think you should Yeah, the chat is going nuts right now. Yeah, it&#x27;s uh &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s cool. &gt;&gt; I guess it depends on where where you localize me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Where do you think you actually are? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s that&#x27;s the trick, right? &gt;&gt; I &gt;&gt; I think everyone should just uh spend some time looking at the uh liet experiment and uh &gt;&gt; leave it there. &gt;&gt; Have some fun. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; have a good have a good weekend. Think about that. But before we bail, I want to say uh and uh just thank you to everyone who hung out with us today.</p>
