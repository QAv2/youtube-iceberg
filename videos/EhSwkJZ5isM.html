            <p>all right hello and welcome to my channel this is an educational channel uh we present information about the latest and greatest theories of everything in particular uh things that you can use um in your life um to help you make sense of things and we try to go pretty deep on these things uh present them in great detail and uh today is our 323rd video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and the reciprocal system of theory was originated by dwey B Larson and that was back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 uh left behind a a lot of books and articles on his reciprocal system and uh a few followers who have uh contributed to the cause as well um although it is a very small amount of followers and this is a very very obscure uh Theory uh the basic idea is that we live in a universe made entirely of Mo motion and for Larson motion was a was the relationship between space and time so uh that sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time uh hence the reciprocal system of theory uh you can think of motion as a fraction with timer space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator time or space do not have any independent existence they only exist together in motion and a motion is broadly defined uh he&#x27;s in particular referring to a kind of motion that you call scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion that has a magnitude but has no specific Direction uh that you can Envision using a balloon with dots on it you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other uh and that is uh not in any specific direction or really in all directions and um you know in the previous scientific paradigms uh such as the Greeks the Greeks believed that we lived in a universe made out of matter and the einsteinian felt like okay well it looks like the universe is made out of matter but what&#x27;s underlying that matter is basically energy eal mc² and so ultimately it&#x27;s a universe made out of energy Larson is really saying that matter and energy are just two other two sep separate varieties of motion uh along with all of the other really scientific quantities or units that we&#x27;re accustomed to seeing such as speed acceleration force um you know all the electrical electrical capacitance voltage resistance uh magnetic flux electric current current electric charge temperature pressure uh these are all fractions with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator with the caveats that space and time can come in uh three dimensions possibly even four uh but uh it&#x27;s what Larsson calls coordinate time and coordinate space space and time both have three dimensions or aspects of them have three dimensions and then there is also what Larson calls clock time and clock space and this is really a progression a scalar motion motion with uh a magnitude but no Direction no specific Direction um and you can see that with the clock clock time the time is always getting later and later and later and later it&#x27;s not getting later in any specific Direction and um with so Larson refers to that as clock time and then there&#x27;s clock space remember that these are they&#x27;re the same time and space are the same other than they are reciprocals of each other so they have the same qualities uh to them so you have coordinate time coordinate space then you have clock time and clock space clock space is that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart like two dots on an expanding balloon or like all the dots on the expanding balloon they&#x27;re all getting farther and farther away from each other the more you blow up the balloon the farther they&#x27;re moving away from each other the farther apart they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each each other and this was actually observed by the Hubble telescope um in the back in the 1920s I believe where they said that uh all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other that should have given them a clue uh that um there uh that this kind of scalar motion is important um but it really didn&#x27;t uh they didn&#x27;t really distinguish like this scalar motion is a um it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s different than just your vectorial motion your vectorial motion is always got a direction it&#x27;s an arrow and um they didn&#x27;t do much to distinguish scalar motion from that uh kind of vectorial motion but they should have and if they would have they probably would have come up with something like the reciprocal system before larsoned it uh but so the other aspect of Larson&#x27;s Theory um his his first postulate his first and major postulate is also that space and time are quantized there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space then you do not have space and if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time you do not have time those units are very small but they are you know microscopic or instantaneous nearly instantaneous and um you got to have a whole unit before you have anything if you have one unit of space in one unit of time then you have the speed of light so the speed of light en LaRon system is what he calls unit speed 1 over one equals 1 and unit speed the speed of light is the background or the origin the zero point the reference point The Ether of this universe of motion if you have a universe of motion uh you know you have um motion is the first thing that you have um and motion is really the default position so whereas the Legacy scientists think about they make their measurements from zero you know uh if they&#x27;re going to measure speed they measure it from zero in Larsson system you measure your speed from one from unit speed is it greater or less than unit speed and bu how much and so with the you know so unit speed is one greater than unit speed um since time and space are quantized you know you can&#x27;t be 1.3 times unit speed it&#x27;s got to be an integer so you C you go from one to two to three to four to five but if you&#x27;re less than unit speed then you go from 1 to 1/ 12 to 1/3 to 1/4 to 1 15 so when you&#x27;re balancing out they&#x27;re balanced if they multiply to one whereas in in the Legacy system you&#x27;re measuring from zero + 1 + 2 + 3 - one - 2 - 3 you B they&#x27;re Balan B when they add to zero so the Legacy sence system is an additive system they add to zero the balance but the reciprocal system is a multiplicative system they multiply to one and uh that fits in with the quantization uh quantization of of of space and time and that um half in Larson&#x27;s system half the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light which Larsson calls the cosmic sector and then half the universe is moving slower than the speed of light the material sector which is the only sector that the Legacy scientists concern themselves with L uh Einstein himself said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe thus basically excluding the entire Cosmic sector okay now today um we are looking at an article that Larson wrote um don&#x27;t know when but um we just got done uh with an article called the physical nature of space this article is called the nature of time and uh we&#x27;re going to get it started right now quote to attempt a definite statement as to the meaning of so fundamental and underlying a notion as that of time is a task from which even philosophy May shrink says Richard Tolman in his classic Treatise on relativity but the quote notion of time is basic in every field of science in in legal documents we often see the expression time is the essence of this contract it is no less the essence of physical Theory without the symbol T and all that it stands for there would be little left in physical science in order to make a definite and meaningful statement about any physical phenomenon it is therefore necessary to Define the concept to which the name time is to be attached this definition may not actually be expressed indeed it is seldom expressed in such except in such basic works as tolman&#x27;s but in any work that lays claim to scientific accuracy the exact meaning of this concept must be specified implicitly if not explicitly those who use the concept without defining it are not evading this requirement they are simply accepting a definition set up by someone who has preceded them how then does science meet this serious challenge at the very base of its theoretical structure the absolute necessity of a precise and unequivocal definition of an entity that is so difficult to grasp that the mere thought of trying to understand it appalls the scientist tomman tells us frankly how he and his colleagues have met this issue quote we shall assume without examination the unidirectional one valued onedimensional character of the time continuum so that is how they evaluate time we shall assume without examination the unidirectional one valued onedimensional character of the time continuum Phil uh physical science justifiably Prides itself on the rigor of its treatment of the subject matter which it covers precise definitions clear-cut distinctions careful and critical development of theory in exact logical and mathematical processes but when we examine the foundations of this work we find that the entire structure of carefully developed Theory rests upon nothing more substantial than three items which are assumed without examination scientific Precision here taken the uh uh has here taken the form of precise formulation of pure assumptions the most unreliable of all instruments of thought unfortunately Precision is no substitute for validity an assumption is no less uncertain and speculative because it is expressed in definite and exact language as matters now stand and we have not grasped the essence we see it only through a thick veil of uncertainty and without the solid foundation which only a clear understanding of the true properties of time can give us all of our vaunted logical and mathematical Precision is spirous indeed if the premises are false the more precise The Logical development the more certain we are to arrive at the wrong conclusion the physicist who fills pages of the physical review with complex mathematical calculations may be giving us a development that it in itself is faultless but if any of the properties of time that have been assumed without examination are not valid then he is introducing some kind of an error every time he uses the symbol T and in spite of its impeccable outward appearance the work as a whole may be completely wrong if physical science had been uniform nor L successful in building up a consistent integrated structure of theory fully capable of meeting all demands upon it this serious defect in the underpinnings of the structure could well be viewed with equinity on the ground that the assumptions are justified by the results thereof it is admitted on all sides however that in spite of the spectacular successes that have been achieved in many areas physical science is still far from having a comprehensive and satisfactory basic theory in fact so many scientists have given up uh given up in Despair and no longer consider the construction of such a theory to be within the range of possibility CN Yang for instance was quoted in a recent news item as quote expressing some doubts about the ability of the human brain in general and his in particular to accomplish this tasks this task and Henry margino admits that quote to The Outsider the conclusions reached by a modern physical modern physicist seem almost like a declaration of the bankruptcy of Science in the light of this situation it would seem that science has now reached the point where it can no longer avoid facing the issue as to just what the properties of time actually are of course we have no positive knowledge that errors in the assumptions regarding these properties are are responsible for or have contributed to the failure to construct a satisfactory basic philos basic Theory but [Music] where the best efforts of the most competent investigators over a long period of years have failed to produce the expected results it is certainly much more likely that the fault lies in basic premises that have been assumed arbitrarily and without examination then in any uh lack of ability of the human brain to apply logical and mathematical processes in to these premises a thorough and painstaking examination of the validity of the assumptions that have been made concerning the properties of time is therefore very much in order the question then arises as to how this issue can be approached the scientific profession has hitherto believed that there is no alternative to the use of pure assumptions of the kind listed by tomman but the investigations which I have carried out and have disclosed that is that it is possible to apply a much more reliable process to this problem and thereby to arrive at some different conclusions as to the properties of space and time which eliminate most if not all of the basic difficulties that physical science now faces this new approach substitutes a process of extrapolation for the arbitrary assumptions here to utilized it is true that extrapolation is also in a sense a process of assumption but the extrapolation assumption the assumption that the situation or relation existing in the known region also exists in the unknown region is inherently vastly Superior to any other assumption that can be made with a far greater probability of being a true representation of the physical facts and in any case where extrapolation is possible it is obviously sound policy to give the consequences of such an extrapolation a complete and thorough examination before any else is even considered okay uh we&#x27;re going to stop it short right there and uh take over tomorrow uh with the next installment on this article I think it might take about four days to get through this um but uh you know in general he&#x27;s just saying that uh science you know Prides itself on being rigorous and exact and precise and um you know perspicacious in general um but they assume without examination the qualities of time so Larson is going to step back and um hopefully make a thorough uh analysis of what time actually is and then we can go from there okay uh thanks for tuning in today have have a great night</p>
