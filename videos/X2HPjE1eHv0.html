            <p>is cold fusion actually real it&#x27;s 1989 and University of Utah researchers announced to the world they have achieved a breakthrough the discovery is cold fusion the ability to fuse hydrogen atoms into helium at room temperature their research caused a sensation except it wasn&#x27;t true they&#x27;re called Fusion experiments couldn&#x27;t be replicated nor have they been since over 30 years later and in light of recent breakthroughs in regular hot Fusion are we any closer to Cold Fusion short answer no cold fusion isn&#x27;t possible with our current knowledge of physics the problem is the coulomb barrier the Threshold at which nuclei gain enough energy to overcome the repulsion keeping them from fusing into new elements this energy generates heat which is why we only know it to occur inside stars burning at millions of degrees</p>
