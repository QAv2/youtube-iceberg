            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[music] What&#x27;s upers? Patrick here with Vetted. Today we&#x27;re talking about this. [music] We&#x27;re going to be in another really bad situation where that we are going to have an event that is going to potentially eclipse the the impact of uh of 9/11 had on our society. That day is coming if we are not careful. If we do not take [music] this topic seriously, it&#x27;s a matter of time before some state or non-state actor figures out a way to utilize [music] technology against us.</p>
<p>And if there&#x27;s an adversary out there that has managed to reverse engineer UAP technology, can you imagine [music] that scenario, right? Imagine some rogue nation like I don&#x27;t know North Korea having the ability to to u exploit [music] and and reverse engineer just even some of the capabilities that we see now associated with UAP. Um that&#x27;s a nightmare scenario that that that is um that&#x27;s a threat that eclipses [music] that of of the nuclear threat. [sighs and gasps] [panting] All right, betterers.

<p>All right, so what&#x27;s today&#x27;s video about? Well, it&#x27;s about Luis Alzando and a brand new interview he just did on NewsNation with Ross Coldar. And he spoke about a memo that he sent to President Trump. And I&#x27;ll put a link down below so you can go check out the memo and everything in it. But there are some specific parts, one part in particular that we&#x27;re going to talk about that is kind of, you know, trumps everything if you will. But before we get into the memo and everything about that, let&#x27;s just kind of roll through some of the highlights of this interview and we&#x27;ll get to the memo.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Can I ask you this? Do you think the Trump administration, Donald Trump, is thinking about disclosure? Well, I hear what you hear and everybody else that he&#x27;s contemplating it, that he&#x27;s been told about it, but I I I want to I also want to be realistic here. Yes, there&#x27;s a tremendous opportunity here for our president to be the [music] first sitting president to say, &quot;Yes, this is real and this is a problem.&quot; But there&#x27;s also a tremendous amount of risk because if it turns out that there is some sort of foreign adversarial involvement behind this, there&#x27;s some sort of new type of stealth reconnaissance capability, let&#x27;s say that country X developed or something like that, u and we go out on a limb and say that these things are all because of this and it turns out they&#x27;re actually because of that, then that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a risk as well and that can actually be used to discredit you and to and to hurt your efforts. So, so the president all presidents uh have to be and this is why they have so many adviserss they have to weigh the pros and cons of what they say publicly. Now this this particular president I think uh most people can agree whether you agree with his politics or not. Uh he is not afraid to say what he what he feels and so from that perspective I I think it&#x27;s very refreshing.</p>
<p>I think all presidents should should say how they feel. Um the question is what does he actually feel about this topic? Sometimes if when he&#x27;s been asked in the past, he has said, &quot;I personally don&#x27;t believe it. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much to see there.&quot; And other times he&#x27;s turned around and said, &quot;Actually, you know what? I&#x27;ve received some briefings. Pretty interesting. We should take it seriously.&quot; Um, but again, that&#x27;s a question you would need to ask to to the president himself.</p>
<p>I certainly would not want to be in any type of position to to presume what what what our President Donald Trump knows about this topic. &gt;&gt; You see, I&#x27;ve been saying the same thing, right? [music] That&#x27;s why Trump I mean we can&#x27;t prove any of this. That&#x27;s the whole point. But I thought this was in the bag. I thought it was certain.</p>
<p>No doubt 100%. Right. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re being told. Right. This is just such an interesting message from Luis Alzando.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not saying I don&#x27;t agree. I actually agree with him here in what he&#x27;s saying. Now, this may be the last time in the video that I agree with him, but this is exactly it. Strategic surprise, right? That&#x27;s the whole point. You&#x27;re surprised by it.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t know what China and Russia and other adversaries have. And we can say, &quot;No, no, it&#x27;s impossible for them to have it.&quot; You don&#x27;t know that. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called strategic surprise, right? We didn&#x27;t think Japan could fly across and bomb us at Pearl Harbor, but they did, amongst many other examples that Marco Rubio used in the age of disclosure. And this is what he&#x27;s talking about. This is the whole point.</p>
<p>Is Trump really going to bring disclosure? Right? It&#x27;s too big a risk. He doesn&#x27;t want to look like a fool. What are the odds? Right? Yes, you could be the greatest president in history. You could also be the greatest fool in history. And that is a and it&#x27;s a coin toss at this point, right? Because they&#x27;re not so certain.</p>
<p>And what&#x27;s interesting is Dan Farah has been saying something completely different. I&#x27;ve been getting messages from senior senators and people that are involved in the administration all weekend saying basically the doors just been blown open and the government doesn&#x27;t have any choice but to walk through it in in in [music] some in some regard. I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time before we see a sitting president step to the microphone and tell the [music] world we&#x27;re not alone in the universe and that the US intends to lead the way in this new chapter for humanity. I think [music] that is that is that is going to happen as a result of this movie. The only question is [music] when.</p>
<p>Um I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re too &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s going to happen. It&#x27;s just a matter of when. I mean we we were told it&#x27;s now. Like this is the whole point, right? This is the age of coming soon. And look, this is what Tim Burchett is saying right now.</p>
<p>You know, he&#x27;s just trying to get a meeting with Trump to talk about this. And it&#x27;s just one thing in a 15-minute v uh you know meeting with Trump that he wants to uh talk about. &gt;&gt; What do you think is President Trump&#x27;s position on this? Do you think he&#x27;s still amanable or open or receptive to the idea of being more open about UAPs as he promised during his uh campaign for the second administration? &gt;&gt; I think he is. I still think he is. I&#x27;ve put a lot of faith and trust in in mine and his relationship.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t bother him about stuff all the time. Um I&#x27;ve asked for a a 15minute meeting with him and I would like to discuss. There&#x27;s two or three things I want to bring up to him that I think would [clears throat] would go a long way and one of those is this issue. &gt;&gt; Oh, and it goes further. We&#x27;re think Donald Trump is going to reveal disclosure.</p>
<p>This is the kind of stuff he&#x27;s being told. Okay, take a listen to this audio recording of Eric Berles who did a uh Twitter space months ago before the September hearings. Okay, this is what David Grush told him that is being told to Donald Trump and then tell me if you think Donald Trump is taking this seriously. So, what Grush has told me, this is what blew my mind [music] and what he said that happened with Trump. And I and I&#x27;ll just tell you this, and just again, I don&#x27;t know that I I want to preface this by saying this is not what I believe.</p>
<p>This is what I&#x27;ve been told. Okay? He said that that the u Nordic people are or the Nordic aliens are are like a few hundred years more advanced than the than we are, but they&#x27;re not super advanced. They&#x27;re not like he said the grays whatever whatever is sending the grays is extremely advanced like thousands and thousands of years more more advanced than than us because it&#x27;s doing all the anti-gravity stuff. all of the all the crazy um all this crazy stuff that&#x27;s very highly advanced and a lot of it is is um what he says with the grays is psionic. So they they basically don&#x27;t have physical interfaces.</p>
<p>they&#x27;re using their mind and that there&#x27;s an interface that picks up thought and and then that um and and that&#x27;s how they that&#x27;s how they operate these vehicles is out of out of psionic. Um but the but the Nordic people somewhat resemble humans and they have been experimenting with crossbreeding with humans. [music] And he says some of them that there are aliens that are crossbreeds living in in the world. And I asked him I go okay do they know that they&#x27;re a crossbreed or do they like how would you know that they are a crossbreed? And he didn&#x27;t have an answer for that. Like he he didn&#x27;t know if they knew what, but he said that that the [music] briefings he&#x27;s had describe, you know, talked about them.</p>
<p>And he said when he said when Trump was briefed on this topic, cuz Trump finally had a briefing and he was in the middle of impeachment, like he was in the middle of being impeached. So he&#x27;s going through that and then he had like this existential briefing that just kind of rocked his world view. Um he joked in the briefing whenever they said that there are these half breeds he said he joked that Adam Schiff was must be one of them. And so yeah, what are we talking about? You want him to take this seriously and then you tell him about Nordics and this and that. I mean, with no proof, of course, he&#x27;s going to laugh about this.</p>
<p>What do you think they&#x27;re actually talking about behind the scenes? They&#x27;re making jokes. Now, let&#x27;s move on. What is it? What what what do we what do we do? How do we protect ourselves? Can we protect ourselves? Right? What what role does the government have in protecting us? At the end of the day, there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that the government cannot protect us from. Um, I believe truth is one of those and I don&#x27;t think the government should protect us. I think the truth is always a truth and let let the chips fall where they fall and allow human beings for themselves to decide how they want to internalize this this this information and potentially potentially this new paradigm.</p>
<p>Well, at the moment, Lou, the odds are very much in the the likelihood, the high probability, according to the um the the market pundits, there are polls showing that there&#x27;s an 87% probability that the president [music] is going to make a disclosure announcement before the end of 2025. I actually don&#x27;t share that optimistic prediction. I I think the president&#x27;s going to keep it buried for a while longer. What&#x27;s your take? &gt;&gt; Oh, boy. You know, the problem is the moment I say something, it&#x27;s going to be completely 180 degrees opposite of what actually happened.</p>
<p>So, [laughter] uh, you know, secretly, I hope that&#x27;s true. I hope I hope, uh, the president at least says something. Um, but I also don&#x27;t want the president to be in a situation where he has to compromise some sort of ongoing operation or effort. So, I respect that as well. And I have uh faith and confidence that not only this president but presidents in the past have made the decisions they&#x27;ve made um because at the time they seemed like they were the right decision.</p>
<p>Um I I think there&#x27;s a lot at stake here with this conversation and I think it it&#x27;s going to require a lot of this is a topic as I said before affects people differently depending on how you were raised and and and so this is not just a national security conversation. It&#x27;s a conversation that affects us all from a a philosophical perspective, a theological perspective, a psychological perspective, and even a sociological perspective. And because of that, we need a lot more smarter people advising the president and and key people in his administration. &gt;&gt; But two points here. One, Ross is incorrect about what the bet is.</p>
<p>Okay, here it is from Poly Market. Everyone&#x27;s been talking about it. That&#x27;s not what the bet is. Poly market trader at stir aggressively buying yes on Trump declassifying the UFO files in 2025. [music] Not that Trump&#x27;s going to bring disclosure by the end of the year.</p>
<p>And Trump declassifying files is not disclosure. Everything&#x27;s getting mixed around here. Right? People think, you know, they assume certain promises, but it&#x27;s actually this thing over here, right? That&#x27;s the whole point. They talk about this thing, but then do this thing. Everyone&#x27;s confused.</p>
<p>What? Oh, that is disclosure. I thought that was go. We can&#x27;t even define these terms. We don&#x27;t even know what we&#x27;re doing. And I think I know why we&#x27;re all confused about this and we&#x27;re going to get there.</p>
<p>But one thing I would say about Luis Alzando saying that the government is not with truth and this and that and okay, to some extent I understand, but there are truths that they hide for us from national security. Luis Alzando himself doesn&#x27;t reveal all the truths, right? He&#x27;s still trying to maintain his security clearance and all, you know, and all power to him. I don&#x27;t want him revealing national security secrets even though he&#x27;s allowed to talk about certain things that make no sense that would be a national security issue. Again, another spiderweb of just nonsense. But let&#x27;s keep going.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s finally talk about this memo that Luis Alzando sent to President Trump or sort of. So, Lu Alzando, we&#x27;ve got a memo you wrote in January this year to President [music] Donald Trump as he was coming in shortly before he was sworn in for his [music] um team to analyze and assess. Let&#x27;s hope this got to the president. And again, what&#x27;s interesting about this memo is it&#x27;s four pages, but there&#x27;s one part in particular that Ross is going to bring up that I found to be absolutely fascinating and might explain the entire mess that we&#x27;re in. I&#x27;ll explain in a second.</p>
<p>Firstly, Lou is using a new term, emerging all domain technologies, EA DT. This is a very clever document because it basically doesn&#x27;t talk about aliens. It doesn&#x27;t talk about anomalous phenomena. Basically, it talks about emerging all domain technologies. It&#x27;s a brief written for an incoming president to explain why the phenomenon should be a priority.</p>
<p>Um, [clears throat] it says EADT include unmanned aerial systems, UAS, unidentified anomalous phenomena, UAP, and certain other advanced systems operating across the air, space, and sea domains that are capable of intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and kinetic strikes. You see, what are we talking about now? We&#x27;re mixing UAP with drone and this and that. Come on now. I know what&#x27;s happening here. Right.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re going to stuff this in with other things that are legitimate, right? Is this what they&#x27;ve been talking about this whole time? But using UFOs and using the UFO community promising disclosure about aliens, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about. We&#x27;re here to talk about aliens, right? Or interdimensional beings or whatever you want to call, not humans. But now they&#x27;re going to put in drone, all these other things, right? And now we got a new term, right? another term to add to all the BS that we have to deal with. UAP, UFO, and now this EDM E A B C E I O G, whatever the hell it is. I&#x27;m This is what&#x27;s happening, y&#x27;all.</p>
<p>Right. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re going to they&#x27;re just mixing it in this in. They&#x27;re talking about legitimate concerns with drones, which I agree with, and other unmanned aerial systems from other adversaries, but we&#x27;re using the cloak of UFOs and the UFO community to sort of talk about it and get it in and get legislation. I mean, what are we talking about? Now, what&#x27;s interesting, Lou, about this memo is that it&#x27;s combining drones, human drones, and UAPs. Why did you do that? Why do you why did you in the same memo? &gt;&gt; Sure.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, there&#x27;s a lot of commonalities between the two, right? We don&#x27;t know something. Everything is unidentified until it becomes identified. And that&#x27;s true whether it&#x27;s a Chinese uh spy balloon or it is a drone as we saw in the New recent New Jersey flap last year or it is a UAP. And so think you can think of this this this emerging all domain uh technology as a large umbrella and under that umbrella there are these smaller little umbrellas that fit and [music] UAP are one of them drones are another and at the end of the day we have to do a better job of understanding what is in our skies otherwise what happens is we have this last year where we have to shut down airports restricted airspace uh and we&#x27;re having to move uh some of our our very sensitive military equities to another location simply because we do not have control and awareness of what&#x27;s in our skies. &gt;&gt; So disappointing, honestly.</p>
<p>Very disappointing to use the UFO community if you&#x27;re asking me. That&#x27;s my opinion. That&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s happening. I think it&#x27;s plain as day. They&#x27;re saying it right to us, right? So there&#x27;s this is plausible deniability.</p>
<p>You can be like, I told you that. Why are you confused? Why do you think this is about aliens? I told you it was about this unmanned system blah blah blah you know this isn&#x27;t about aliens even though they keep using new paradigm and non-human and biologic right anything but so that you think it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s ambiguous right it&#x27;s left open to interpretation so that they can then claim whatever interpretation they want [music] retroactively heads on a swivel y&#x27;all pay attention and what&#x27;s the whole point of this memo Mo anyway, what&#x27;s it to do, right? Like what&#x27;s what what are we trying to do with this thing? &gt;&gt; Now, this is a very important memo. The thing that leaps out at me about it, though, is what has the president done about it? What has been the response, if any, do we know if President Trump received this memo directly? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, there uh it&#x27;s a good question. U there are no guarantees in life, right? Except for uh death and taxes.</p>
<p>[music] So, I&#x27;m certainly not going to speak on behalf of the president of the United States. U it is true in your assertion that the memo was sent, it was sent on behalf of myself. Uh and uh whether or not the president has had time to to read it or his staff, that&#x27;s a question you&#x27;d have to ask him. U I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to be presumptuous and try to answer for for the boss in any way. Um, you know, my my hope and desire is that someone in his administration in a position uh of authority had a chance to review it.</p>
<p>So, we don&#x27;t even know if he got the memo or even anyone close to him got it and read it and then read it to him. You think they read him a four-page document? No, that didn&#x27;t happen. That&#x27;s not happening. People are going to sum it up and go, &quot;Remember those guys that told you about the Nordics and the hybrids, right? whatever other aliens. Yeah, they they they&#x27;re talking about this now, right? [laughter] Just it&#x27;s a joke.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a complete joke. And look, I&#x27;m not here to bash on the phenomena. I think there is something going on, just not this because I think this memo isn&#x27;t what you think it [music] is. This isn&#x27;t the first time that Luis Alzando has presented something that turned out to be something else, right? Take a look at this video that I found from a creator called Moon. And it&#x27;s titled The Moment Joe Rogan Realizes his guest is a fraud.</p>
<p>You think the intelligence community&#x27;s media manipulation couldn&#x27;t get any more outlandish? Yeah, [snorts] Mike Baker is actually nothing compared to this guy who might be one of the most suspicious guest to ever sit across from Joe Rogan. So, let&#x27;s meet Lou Alzando. You see, at least Baker admits he worked for the CIA. Lou doesn&#x27;t even articulate what he supposedly did. Um, I had a lot of official jobs &gt;&gt; with the government in regards to, you know, &gt;&gt; you know, you know, [laughter] you know, those things.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s not how many UFO whistleblowers have ever spoken on the show, like David Grush, who came on with a proven highly decorated record. Lou makes some extraordinary claims while hiding behind classification. There is very compelling evidence to suggest that the US government is in absolute possession of exotic material that is not made by humans. He also addresses why so much UFO footage is lowfi, saying that there&#x27;s 4K HD footage out there.</p>
<p>But notice how he says he can&#x27;t expand on any of it and hasn&#x27;t been given permission to talk about it. He just declares that it exists. Yet, here he is on a platform known to reach millions of people, admitting that the government is handling alien objects. Joe questions exactly this. Why is the Pentagon teasing us? Why are they allowing you to say we are in [music] possession of something that was not made by human beings but not allowed to elaborate? &gt;&gt; Lou continued to argue that he was only sanctioned by the Pentagon to say certain things and told Joe a faction of people will be very mad with him and that his appearance on the show would cause a storm within the Pentagon.</p>
<p>But is any of this actually credible though? The investigative publication The Intercept conducted a thorough investigation into him with Pentagon spokesperson Christopher Sherwood explicitly stating Mr. Alzando has no responsibilities with regard to the AATIP program while he worked in OSDI up until the time he resigned. Other whistleblowers have never been straight up discredited in the same way. So, is Lou compromised in the sense that he&#x27;s just a fraud? Well, some people say this, but not just because of his fake credentials, but his documented history of presenting fake evidence is real. For example, in 2018, he showed images of UFOs supposedly swarming the US capital building, claiming what you see here are real photographs.</p>
<p>They turned out to be CGI figs from a movie and a scan from a 1954 comic book. In 2024, during a congressional briefing, he held up what he claimed was a real UFO photo from a pilot, but it was actually just an irrigation circle easily found on Google Maps [music] and now forever marked as Lou&#x27;s UAP shadow. Perhaps most embarrassingly, on his paid book tour, he showed audiences a real photo of a UFO mother ship hovering over the US embassy in Romania. It was a reflection of a chandelier in a window. [music] And you can literally see the photographers&#x27;s hairline in the image.</p>
<p>But if Lou represents the evolution from intelligence professional to UFO grifter, Annie Jacobson shows what happens when your job turns into complete fantasy. Yeah, I think that uh sums it up pretty tightly. I think this is just another chandelier moment here, this memo. It&#x27;s my opinion. But let&#x27;s continue because there&#x27;s more.</p>
<p>I I I&#x27;ll go a little bit into the uh the danger zone, Lou. And I know you can&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m I&#x27;m told Donald Trump was given a limited briefing by a mutual friend of ours who I won&#x27;t name. Um, the president, I&#x27;m told, is aware of the US&#x27;s knowledge of a non-human intelligence. Do you want to contradict me on that? &gt;&gt; Um, no comment. Um, [laughter] I uh I like I said, I would never uh pretend to speak with the authority um for the president of the United States.</p>
<p>Uh uh it&#x27;s um certainly a good question, but that&#x27;s a question that I would probably uh table for later and and maybe ask him directly if you have that opportunity. &gt;&gt; Right. But do I one of the things that frustrates me and I I I saw there was an opportunity uh for Marco Rubio to be questioned about this the other day when he went on Fox News and spoke I think to Shan Hannity. Marco Rivio, of course, as well as being the Secretary of State, he&#x27;s the acting national security adviser. Wouldn&#x27;t it be a perfectly normal thing for the National Security Adviser to have been read in to something as significant as the legacy UAP retrieval reverse engineering program by now? &gt;&gt; One would certainly hope so.</p>
<p>And if if I if I know uh Marco Rubio well enough, he he has certainly demanded that and asked for that already uh and may have very well received that. U but again, Marco Rubio is a very shrewd uh politician and now a uh a leader uh for our nation in the executive branch and he has a tremendous amount of responsibility. So, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m sure uh Secretary Rubio is is handling this topic like he did before with a great deal of seriousness, but is probably going to hold his cards a little close to his chest until he figures out what the boss wants to do um about this topic. You know, when you serve at the will of the president, you have to make sure that your messaging is consistent with the president&#x27;s wills and desires. Uh, and you don&#x27;t ever want to get too far ahead of the headlights, uh, from what the boss is is saying or what they&#x27;re feeling because then you run the risk of, um, you know, saying something that that may not turn out to be in the direction that that the administration wants to take.</p>
<p>My uh journalist colleague Michael Shelonburgger wrote a piece last week where he ended a story talking about um uh the claims that Marco Rubio had made in the age of disclosure film where essentially you know he&#x27;s basically concurring with the idea that the US has recovered alien tech and that they&#x27;ve given it to private military contractors. He then of course in a subsequent interview has said all he was doing was quoting authoritative people who&#x27;d spoken to him. [gasps] But I did think it was significant that at the end of the Shelonburgg article uh an unnamed Rubio advisor said quote we&#x27;re headed towards massive disclosure. That wouldn&#x27;t have been done without authorization from Marco Rubio more likely than not would it? Um, yes, whether officially or unofficially. Um, you know, I&#x27;ve been in meetings myself uh at the Pentagon or at CIA where uh a decision is made.</p>
<p>Um, but you don&#x27;t necessarily have the person sitting at the head of the table barking at an order. It&#x27;s just understood by all that that was the intent of the boss and and we execute accordingly. So, I I think um whoever this individual was speaking to uh to the journalist, Mr. Shelmer uh was probably providing information that he or she had access to during one or several meetings uh with with Secretary Rubio. Um look, there&#x27;s no denying we&#x27;ve got a problem on our hands, Ross, and we can whitewash it all day long and we can pretend it&#x27;s not there.</p>
<p>Um all it&#x27;s going to do is is is um erode more the faith and confidence of the American people because people know it&#x27;s real. In fact, I&#x27;ve had members of Congress tell me that they&#x27;ve had their own UAP experience. And I&#x27;m not going to say who they are. Um, and they are not willing to come out publicly with it. Um, because, you know, they&#x27;re politicians, right? They they they they want to be reelected and they don&#x27;t want to come across a, you know, seeming to be a fringe or anything like that.</p>
<p>But I&#x27;ve had several members of Congress themselves um, reveal to me personally that they&#x27;ve had their own UAP experience and that they are very concerned about this topic. um but they don&#x27;t sit on the right committees or maybe they don&#x27;t have enough authority or they&#x27;re maybe a freshman member of Congress. Um so they are hesitant to to speak publicly about it. But look, the bottom line is we now know these things are real, whatever they are. And some of them may be man-made.</p>
<p>Um some of them may not be man-made and some of them might be a combination of both scenarios. Um and this is exactly why we need to have this conversation um as a as a public. This is why we need to to bring people together. We need to have, I think, a a single point of contact in the US government that is there for better or for worse to answer the questions that need to be answered regarding this topic. Um, this is not going away.</p>
<p>And my real fear here is if that we continue to to ignore this topic, we&#x27;re going to be in another really bad situation that we are going to have an event that is going to potentially eclipse the the impact of uh of 9/11 had on our society. Um that day is coming if we are not careful. If we do not take this topic seriously, it&#x27;s a matter of time before some state or non-state actor uh figures out a way to utilize technology um against us to weaponize it. And it doesn&#x27;t have to be necessarily drones, right? And if there&#x27;s an adversary out there that has managed to reverse engineer UAP technology, can you imagine that scenario, right? Imagine some rogue nation like I don&#x27;t know North Korea having the ability to to u exploit and and reverse engineer just even some of the capabilities that we see now associated with UAP. Um that&#x27;s a nightmare scenario that that that is that&#x27;s a threat that eclipses that of of the nuclear threat.</p>
<p>But again, all of this sounds nice what they&#x27;re saying, but they&#x27;re not talking about aliens. They&#x27;re talking about drones and national security. all these things that I do agree with, but again with the veil of aliens and they&#x27;ll be like, &quot;I never said aliens.&quot; Yeah, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re all here for. What are you talking about? That is what we&#x27;re talking about. And you know that we think that just more confusion, but I&#x27;ll be honest, starting to see the light.</p>
<p>Jim Seovan, your former To the Stars Academy colleague and former very senior executive in the CIA uh clandestine service went on my friend James Ian Dolly&#x27;s Engaging the Phenomenon show earlier this week and he gave a really interesting interview and he used a word that stuck in my mind when he was talking about the difficulties for the administration in making a decision about whether or not they should talk about what they really know about non-human intelligence. Jim said it was a truth that is indigestible that it&#x27;s so confronting, whatever that is. Uh, a lot of people just wouldn&#x27;t be able to deal with it. Uh, I know how put off has acknowledged that he was part of a team way back under the &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh, last Bush administration that looked at the issue of disclosure. You know, there was an assessment made as to whether [music] or not it was time to disclose.</p>
<p>And the group of wise heads that um Hull was put off also made a decision at that time not to disclose. Are we looking at that again? Is there something we don&#x27;t know, Lou, in the public arena that is influencing the decision to disclose or not to disclose? I mean, one of the questions in my mind, for example, is if there is a non-human intelligence and if we have agreements with them, is it part of our agreements with them that we not disclose? Or is the truth so utterly horrible and confronting for humans that we wouldn&#x27;t want to know about it? What&#x27;s going on? What&#x27;s Jim talking about? Why is the truth indigestible? &gt;&gt; Sure. Well, you&#x27;re right. if you have two parties &gt;&gt; that looked at the issue of disclosure, you know, there was an assessment made as to whether or not it was time to disclose and the group of wise heads that um Hull was put off also made a decision at that time not to disclose. Are we looking at that again? Is there something we don&#x27;t know, Lou, in the public arena that is influencing the decision to disclose or not to disclose? I mean, one of the questions in my mind, for example, is if there is a non-human intelligence and if we have agreements with them, is it part of our agreements with them that we not disclose? Or is the truth so utterly horrible and confronting for humans that we wouldn&#x27;t want to know about it? What&#x27;s going on? What&#x27;s Jim talking about? Why is the truth indigestible? [music] &gt;&gt; Sure.</p>
<p>Well, you&#x27;re right. If you have two parties that make an agreement, you can&#x27;t break that agreement without having both both parties agree, right? So, there was this, let&#x27;s say, an agreement with an NHI and it&#x27;s okay, we&#x27;re going to keep this quiet and you keep it quiet. Um, you really need both sides to agree that, hey, we&#x27;re going to go public with this. But there&#x27;s also the the the other aspect of truth itself. Um, everybody says they want they want to know the truth.</p>
<p>Uh, and I would agree that most people probably do, but when you look at it, there are some truths that are not very good truths. Uh, give you an example. Um, you go to the doctor and you feel great, blood pressure is great. Doctor says, &quot;Hey, man. I just got your blood results.</p>
<p>You want to know the results?&quot; Yeah, sure. Tell me what&#x27;s going on. You have stage four cancer, Lou, and uh, you have about 3 months to live. Oh, maybe that&#x27;s a truth I didn&#x27;t necessarily really want, right? or hey, uh, I&#x27;ve got this great new life partner. Um, we get along fantastic.</p>
<p>I think we&#x27;re going to take this to the next level. Maybe get a marriage and get married. What do you think? Uh, and of course your buddy says, &quot;You really want to know what I think?&quot; Yeah. Yeah. Tell me.</p>
<p>Tell me. Well, actually, I saw your life partner at the bar last night kissing somebody else. Oh, right. So, as humans, we want the truth and we say we want the truth, but the reality is there are some truths that [music] most people would probably not want to know. Um, and the real question is, is this one of those examples as a regard regard to [music] UAP? &gt;&gt; So, there&#x27;s a lot of things here to cover.</p>
<p>One, if Ross says nonhumans are real and we have an agreement with them, right? Again, that&#x27;s what all this is. It&#x27;s just one big if. This should be called the if community. And let&#x27;s move on to what Lu Alzando&#x27;s analogies for the truth, right? Uh, truths that we don&#x27;t want to know or can&#x27;t handle. Well, both analogies he gave, horrible analogies for this one.</p>
<p>Yes, if I have 3 months to live from stage whatever cancer, I want my doctor to tell me. It&#x27;s not a truth that I don&#x27;t want to hear. It&#x27;s an outcome that I don&#x27;t want, right? But I have to accept the truth of what it is so I can go live my life for 3 months. I don&#x27;t want him to tell me the day before or I&#x27;ll just drop dead one day, right? Again, horrible analogy. Same thing with the your life partner.</p>
<p>uh is caught kissing some other guy. Yes, you want to know that. You want to just keep living a lie and live with that person again. Is this what they think? Is this what they think? This is nonsense. And oh yeah, that interview that um Ross Coltart is talking about with James Ioni from Engaging the Phenomena, which by the way, great guy, great channel.</p>
<p>I highly recommend going to check out his channel. I&#x27;m going to put a link down below. Um, that video, that interview is from a year ago. It wasn&#x27;t last week. And even if this was filmed months ago, right? It&#x27;s still not even close.</p>
<p>So, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about. And maybe I have this wrong. I&#x27;m not sure. But this is the video that&#x27;s going around that everyone&#x27;s talking about with Jim Simean. I&#x27;ve had people who I know are in the know.</p>
<p>Um, and I I&#x27;ve mentioned this before. Um, and one of them told me, [music] &quot;The truth is indigestible. It&#x27;s not something that we could that we would be able to fully grasp or entertain and that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like, you know, it would be like telling somebody something that they can&#x27;t do anything about and they don&#x27;t know what the repercussions of that would be. It&#x27;s so great. It&#x27;s so worldchanging and transformational and maybe not in a good way, you know.</p>
<p>So, &gt;&gt; I mean, what what could be so so jarring? What could be so disruptive? I mean, bless you. Um, &gt;&gt; like like the idea that we&#x27;re being visited by another advanced intelligence that&#x27;s more advanced than us. I mean, do you think or is it something else? &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s much deeper. &gt;&gt; We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on. So we have a situation though, Lou, where clearly the acting national security adviser seems to believe that there are elements within the US government that have recovered technology from a non-human intelligence.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve reverse engineered it and they&#x27;ve let private military contractors take control of it. the the clear inference from what Marco Rubio says is that he believes the people who&#x27;ve told him that that&#x27;s an extraordinary situation where the national security adviser, the man who advises the president on national security, is essentially making a public admission in what is a very highly reputable documentary that he believes there is a non-human intelligence and that the United States has recovered non-human technology. The big question in my mind though is assuming the administration knows that at the moment publicly they&#x27;re not doing anything. So let&#x27;s explore why they&#x27;re not doing anything. Uh obviously you&#x27;ve raised the risk of foreign adversaries gaining some advantage if the US goes public.</p>
<p>Just explain that to me. Why would the US acknowledging just the basic fact that there is a non-human intelligence engaging with this planet in any way force the US&#x27;s hand on revealing technology that it now has possession of? I don&#x27;t &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think it would. I I don&#x27;t agree with that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, Raj, let me um let me give you a if I can a little scenario here.</p>
<p>Uh, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m the American people and let&#x27;s say you are, oh, I don&#x27;t know, the Secretary of the Air Force and I say to you, Ross, uh, Secretary of the Air Force, um, are UAP real, right? By you coming out and simply saying, yeah, they&#x27;re real. We&#x27;ve known about it. What&#x27;s the very next question I&#x27;m going to ask you? The next question is, what have we learned from it? Have we been able to replicate any of it? right now. All of a sudden, you find yourself in a trick bag because you&#x27;d have to admit that yes, maybe we&#x27;ve been able to exploit some of this technology and oh by the way, we&#x27;ve been doing it for decades in secret and oh by the way, we&#x27;ve been lying to Congress and told Congress nothing to see here and oh by the way been lying to president so nothing to see here and oh by the way we&#x27;ve used billions and billions and billions of dollars that were supposed to be used for project over here and instead we used it secretly for project over there with no oversight. That is a really really bad place to be in as a secretary of the air force.</p>
<p>Now, let&#x27;s put that same scenario and flip it on its head. If I say to you, um, Mr. Secretary of the Air Force, Ross, uh, do we as a nation possess very, very sophisticated technologies that would be considered beyond next generation? Now, it may seem like an innocent question, and of course, your response would be, &quot;Yes, Lou. Uh, we do. We spent a lot of money doing research and development.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got some really, really cool toys that we&#x27;re pretty sure our adversaries have no idea we have in our possession. What&#x27;s my very next question to that? Hm. Where did we learn that from? Where did we get that technology from? Right? And now you&#x27;re back to that same issue of well, from maybe our friends out of town. So either way, if you start going down that that thought process, no matter what, it it&#x27;s going to put somebody in the administration in a very very difficult situation that&#x27;s going to probably result in a cascading effect of inquiries and investigations and potentially lawsuits and and and even prosecution. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know if I accept that, Lof.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll be honest with you. I I I I think the I think in the same way that the administration refuses to release the details of how we build thermonuclear bombs, I think the general public would be extremely respectful and and and frankly understanding of the need to keep certain things confidential. I I I think &gt;&gt; well I would normally agree, Ross, but if you look at social media on any given day, you&#x27;ll see that&#x27;s not the case. &gt;&gt; Uh I&#x27;ve I get yelled at constantly. I&#x27;m always trying to, you know, navigate and and and thread that needle between being open and honest with the American people, but at the same time not not compromising my security clearance and it&#x27;s always used against me.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m always being told, Lou, you should just say everything you know, to hell with your security clearance, to hell with your non-disclosure agreement, to hell to your promise with the American government and just tell us everything you know. &gt;&gt; And then Lou Alzando goes to jail for the next 30 years. &gt;&gt; Right. And for the record, I do not look good in an orange jumpsuit and that&#x27;s not where I prefer to be. Um, so there are there are real consequences and I think there would be a lot of demand by people to to know everything and so it&#x27;s a very slippery slope.</p>
<p>Now personally I agree with you. I think America I&#x27;ve always said I think America uh can handle the truth. America deserves the truth um no matter what that means or no matter the consequences because at the end of the day we are a democracy and it is a government for the people and by the people or at least it&#x27;s supposed to be. And so I I do believe that that we can handle it. I just think we have to be it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s how we have this discussion that&#x27;s that&#x27;s probably more important um than u the disclosure itself because what we don&#x27;t want to do is tip our hands unnecessarily to a foreign adversary u and either prove to them that we are ahead of them or prove to them that maybe we&#x27;re behind them technologically speaking.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to take a lot of um a lot of big brains to to really try to figure this out and the second and third order uh causes and effects and and and consequences. &gt;&gt; Again, Lou really needs to work on his analogies because that&#x27;s not a good one, right? Again, we don&#x27;t want to reveal our hand, right? Lou&#x27;s basically saying tip tip off to our adversaries. Uh what what about all the movies and docu You just put out a documentary laying out the whole thing for our adversaries. I mean look what Dan Farah is saying on Joe Rogan. When people talk about the successful back engineering of these things what are they saying? Are they saying that they can fly around Earth? Are they saying they can go outside of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and go into deep space with these things? It&#x27;s like what what have they said we are currently able to do with these back engineered crafts that we&#x27;ve supposedly &gt;&gt; people that I can&#x27;t attribute the statement to that &gt;&gt; were very credible sources told me that some of the UA UAP activity in space specifically is reverse engineered technology.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. Does that mean in space in low Earth orbit or does that mean traveling through the solar system? the what was implied to me was traveling through the solar system. &gt;&gt; Jeez. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, are these &gt;&gt; here&#x27;s another thing someone that that same person said to me by the way.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, before I forget &gt;&gt; that their belief is [music] that the technology we have would not be pulled out even to stop a world war. It would not those cards would not be shown until moments before like a nuclear war situation. So they wouldn&#x27;t pull it out to stop like any of the wars we&#x27;ve experienced in the last, you know, since World War II. Um they wouldn&#x27;t, you know, regardless of how many &gt;&gt; It has to get to nine.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It has to get to a level where there&#x27;s no Yeah. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s no other option. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Could it show your cards? Now, when they say that they&#x27;ve traveled through the solar system, is this biological human beings or are these drone crafts? Like, what are they saying? &gt;&gt; I I I never got any of that. I never got any of that.</p>
<p>All I was told is there&#x27;s some of the some of the UAPs that are seen that have been seen by our astronauts on space missions are non-human intelligent life and some are reverse engineered craft. That&#x27;s what I was told. &gt;&gt; But we don&#x27;t know whether there&#x27;s a person inside of them. I I don&#x27;t &gt;&gt; if they are reverse engineered and they are ours and we figured out how to make our own &gt;&gt; that I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I need to know that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, [laughter] &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s kind of important. &gt;&gt; Is there some dude named Bob flying through space? Some Top Gun guy [laughter] that they&#x27;ve given the task of traveling to Venus real quick? &gt;&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me. &gt;&gt; We got reverse engineered spaceships for flying around. Is that not tipping our hat to the adversaries of what we have? Hello. If we wanted to m maintain strategic surprise, we gave that up a long time ago because we&#x27;re literally telling in public in books, documentaries, podcasts over and over and over and over again what we have as a government, what we&#x27;re hiding, the most secret technology, what we&#x27;re hiding, what it&#x27;s capable of.</p>
<p>Again, what are we talking about here? Finally, Lou, age of disclosure. I mean obviously you had a role in putting the people together who were prepared to speak in that movie &gt;&gt; allegedly. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s quite a it&#x27;s quite an extraordinary film. I mean to see somebody like James Clapper, a former DNI making the acknowledgements that he makes about a reality, an NHI reality. Is it pushing the needle? &gt;&gt; Certainly.</p>
<p>Everything pushes a needle. Um, I think it&#x27;s uh I think every bit helps. Every ore in the water helps push the needle forward. Do you think that there are people inside the Trump administration that are actually intellectually engaged with the disclosure issue as a possible policy issue the administration? &gt;&gt; This is my private personal perspective, but I think the answer is definitively yes. So when somebody anonymously at a senior level in Marco Rubio&#x27;s office says quote we&#x27;re headed towards massive disclosure, there is room for optimism.</p>
<p>There is &gt;&gt; every ore in the water helps push the needle forward. Okay, then I guess this video does too, right? I hope every ore in the water, right? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m just completely confused by age of disclosure, NHI. But again, let&#x27;s not tip our hat to the adversary. Strategic.</p>
<p>[music] Do you see how none of this makes sense and then they&#x27;re just hiding it behind drones. Hello. This is one of those things where they they present a cake, but it&#x27;s like a basketball and you don&#x27;t know what it is. You think it&#x27;s a basketball, they cut into it&#x27;s a cake. They even have a show on Netflix about it, right? Like, is this a cake or whatever the hell it is? That&#x27;s all this is, right? It&#x27;s an alien spaceship, but when you cut into it, it&#x27;s a cake.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a drone. It&#x27;s not It&#x27;s not what you think it is. and they know it, but they&#x27;re packaging it as NHI, aliens, this that again, we&#x27;re still if if this is true. There&#x27;s always plausible deniability. There&#x27;s always things left ambiguous and they can always change things retroactively.</p>
<p>No, no, no. We said this, right? They&#x27;re telling us right to our faces what they&#x27;re doing. But so many people already have an idea of what they want to believe. They fill in the gap themselves, right? It&#x27;s essentially that. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening.</p>
<p>So, all I recommend, head on a swivel, y&#x27;all. Head on a swivel. Lou Alzando, thank you so much for joining us here again on Reality Check. It&#x27;s always nice to get you back. Um, and uh, I sincerely hope that uh, some action is taken by President Trump on this memo that you wrote him in January this year.</p>
<p>Actually, no, it was January. Was it January 2024 or January last this year? &gt;&gt; Uh, I believe it was just last year. &gt;&gt; I actually wrote it back in 2024 when I &gt;&gt; You wrote it in 2024. I thought it was 2025. So, &gt;&gt; no, I wrote it in 2024.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. So, it was a year before when did the president&#x27;s [music] team actually get it, though? Was it at the time of the new administration coming? &gt;&gt; I would not be able to to tell you that. That&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s out of my wheelhouse. &gt;&gt; Okay, no worries. But essentially, at the moment, we&#x27;re waiting and seeing whether the president takes any action.</p>
<p>The pundits are speculating it might be before Christmas. I&#x27;m not so optimistic. Lzando, thank you so much, sir. &gt;&gt; All right, y&#x27;all. We&#x27;ll leave it there.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think in the comments. We&#x27;ll see you guys on the next one. Remember vetas, everyday is a gift, y&#x27;all. Peace. &gt;&gt; Pat, how you doing my friend? This is Chris in uh Dallas again.</p>
<p>Listen, man. That is some of the best work I&#x27;ve seen you do on that moon landing at BART. Dude, you blew this one out, dude. This was fantastic, Patrick. You You really did good work on this one, man.</p>
<p>You say you deserve it, Pat. You you actually deserve several pats, man. You completely exposed a lying jackass on television because the guy is just he&#x27;s no good, man. And I&#x27;m so glad that you exposed him to that degree. You did a very [music] good thing for all of us cuz I do believe we went to the moon and that guy&#x27;s full of But even apart from that, you just exposed somebody that&#x27;s very, [music] very crooked and just not a good person, man.</p>
<p>So, excellent work, [music] man. I&#x27;ll talk to you, Patrick. Bye.</p>
