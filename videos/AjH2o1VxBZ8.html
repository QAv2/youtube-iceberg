            <p>hi my name is eugene so today we want to continue our discussion about gravity specifically how do we shield against gravity in previous videos we discussed the nature of reality um as well as the nature of gravity um so in this video um i want to go over how we can shield against gravity so that will allow us to give us an anti-gravity effect where we can shield against the updraft of gravity particles and essentially have our anti-gravity device float on the optical particles so as described earlier right so the idea is um to have a craft and uh to pull the barrier around the graph and this barrier would essentially consist of gravity particles so the same particles so um if this is the planetary surface then we have a down round of gravity particles as explained in my previous previous videos so go ahead and take a look at those to get a better understanding but essentially we have a dandruff gravity particles towards the center of the planet and once they get to the center of the planet pressure builds up and then we have explosion of gravity particles essentially high energy explosion of gravity particles that rips for everything so one encounters matter it doesn&#x27;t um uh it essentially just you know flows right through the matter um so the way gravity works if you have matter then if matter is caught in this gravity field um the gravity particles filter through this object and essentially drags it along so it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a physical interaction of the gravity of the gravity particles with matter so the question is you know how do we build this barrier isn&#x27;t even possible what is the mechanism of building this barrier as i&#x27;ve stated earlier this barrier would consist of gravity particles so in other words these particles would essentially serve as obstacles for the down and moving all these particles um so essentially the downward draft would then bounce off the uh of these gravity particles so we&#x27;d have to build a really thick um or dense barrier on this craft so if we take a closer look at what that looks like so if we look at the let&#x27;s look at the so this is a representation of the hull of the shell of the craft so you&#x27;ll have some sort of uh metal right it has its molecules atoms whatever and as these gravity particles filter through this metal it interacts with you know at the atomic level um with the material itself and therefore cause a drag effect um in the direction of the uh the flow of the gravity particles so this flow doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to go you know it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be downwards um you know it just has to there just has to be a flow in any direction but typically close to a planet the direction would be uh towards the center of the planet so the idea then is to you know as this uh metal get charged with these gravity particles so as the gravity particles filter through this hole this um the skin of the crown essentially so as it folds through the ideas then to by some mechanism expel all these particles contained in this in the material expel it outwards so that they form a barrier on the outside of the skin um by doing so they impede the downward or the incoming uh gravity particles and cause the gravity particles to throw to flow around the skin of craft so the question now is how do we how do we do that okay um first of all let&#x27;s uh revisit what the gravity particle is so as explained before right we have the universal bubble and in this universal bubble we have a single particle and this single particle has it&#x27;s the only particle in the universal bubble so it has infinite velocity and essentially bounces off the boundaries of this universal bubble so in order to observe reality um we essentially have some sort of instrument that we are able to tune into certain frequencies and the frequency of or its vibration essentially means it&#x27;s on or off and typically or when it&#x27;s on and the particle is within the um within the region of the instrument the particle you know it becomes observable um and this instrument has a certain frequency um you know a very short short interval um so during that interval um you essentially observe you know where that particle is so whenever the particle um you know is within the instrument it registers structure so the more a particle is observed in the same position meaning it&#x27;s crossing that same position many times we observe more of the particles so the structure becomes more solid so if we had to observe one of these molecules or atoms um we&#x27;ll essentially would have to observe the particles traversing many times a small location and whenever it crosses that represents a particle so in this case in the center you know in the center of this in the center of this cloud of particles we&#x27;ll have a denser cluster so that represents the atomic nucleus and in its in the surrounding area of that nucleus we have part of cloud of various different particles so we know that if we if we start smashing atoms together or smashing particles together they always break into smaller and smaller particles um so the idea then is that you know the the protons and neutrons they are really a cluster of particles similarly the electron electrons around the nucleus they they also consist of the nuclear electron cloud around the nucleus also consists of many different particles so it depends on you know how many times that particle crosses in that location and also at what frequency crosses and so what this means is then if we have um gravity particles you know flowing through and you know we have several atoms and if these gravity particles flow through or falters through the the matter it encounters particles that are similar in nature to these gravity particles and what it when it does that so they they similar because they they have the same frequency um or they are rendered in the same in a similar fashion so when it counts as these particles it bounces around so it bounces off that particle and maybe it meets another particle advances again so in that respect in another particle uh another gravity part comes that comes down and also bounces off that particle so there&#x27;s like a filtering effect way or dragging effect where the gravity particles struggle to go through the material so in that respect because of the pressure of the other particles coming down it also drags the matter along with it so then the gravity this gravity field does this gravity flow the gravity particle flow then drags everything along you know in its path because of this interaction with particles within the atomic structure so we know that gravity affects um all observable matter essentially so that means this particular particle it interacts with is contained in all matter um so it even affects um you know the passage of light so if lighting calms the gravity field it is also bent by the gravity field we know this because if we um you know if we look at for instance in the uh around a black hole we essentially observe that you know light is trapped within the black black hole also we know that when we look at stars through a telescope then we can also you know see the light bend as well in that respect um so gravity does affect light particles as well though so even you know at that smallest level um the light particles has to has to consist of that same or similar particle you know as gravity particle so given that um my assumption then is that this gravity particle is very similar to magnetic particles we know that magnetic magnetic particles your own matter essentially contains these magnetic particles we also know that you know in various experiments throughout the years we&#x27;ve seen the relationship between magnetic particles electric fields and gravity we&#x27;ve also seen you know many reports of people doing experiments with strong magnetic fields retaining magnetic fields and they observe that it affects gravity so in that respect then these gravity particles represents magnetic particles right but they&#x27;re not really magnetic in the sense of a magnet and the reason that is because if you have a magnet as i described before right in the magnet we have we have these atoms and this atom or the electron field or cloud around this atom or a nucleus um has a certain frequency um meaning you know as it as pulses or vibrates um you know that that that is essentially its frequency i mean a little later on we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll get into why things vibrate um why everything in the universe has a certain frequency even at the atomic level but essentially um so in the case of um iron um these atoms have a certain frequency or certain vibration um and at a certain um you know as the particle vibrates it emits a magnetic particle and in unmagnetized metal or iron it emits this particle in random directions so it emits a particle and then if a particle is emitted from this atom it causes an imbalance or a vacuum or a lack of that particle so it typically gets it from or absorbs the particle from another atom so in this way the magnetic particle you know flows within flows within the metal itself so there&#x27;s no net magnetic flow so the the metal itself or the iron itself are magnetized um also if it is if if it cannot you know take on the particle of another atom then essentially this particle tries to fold the void and the closest void or inlet would be on the backside of that atom itself so when we magnetize um the ion we typically place it in an external field an external magnetic field and now we align these atoms pull point in the same direction okay okay so so this is the important distinction is that the the uh atoms they act like little pumps and they&#x27;re all focused in the same direction so in the magnitude of the north and south pole or inlet and an outlet so the magnet um magnetic particles you know flows out the one end and curves around and come back into the other end so the magnetic effect then is because of these tiny pumps or atomic pumps that pumps the particle in one direction so you have a very intense flow of magnetic particles you know close to the surface of the outlet or in it now in the case of gravity um you know as i&#x27;ve explained right when you have um your planet and you have uh you know these gravity particles or magnetic particles they just you know the whole universal bubble is filled with these particles so there&#x27;s like a sea of this particles and it it represents like the the background ether or medium that makes up the entire universe so when it when you have a piece of matter within the sea of particles okay so in this case we have a planet so this planet then represent a a an absence of this particle meaning there&#x27;s a vacuum of these particles because the the matter itself they take up space so they essentially displaces this particle so because there&#x27;s a vacuum these of these particles these particles try to fold this vacuum so you have pressure you know on this planetary on this planet and as these particles you you&#x27;ll have then a flow of these particles trying to you know fold the void so as they hit the boundary of this planet they start encountering resistance so they essentially get slowed down at the boundary so they&#x27;ll then there&#x27;s a buildup of these particles okay so close to the surface is a build up these particles so as it&#x27;s like a um the the magic particles get compressed towards the surface of the planet so the density of this particles become higher so that means when you&#x27;re closer to this planet you&#x27;ll experience a stronger gravity gravity drag effect when if you further away from the planet the drag is not that great and and that&#x27;s the reason why you have a stronger um gravity pull or gravity drag uh because of this um compression of gra of gravity slash magnetic particles so eventually these particles start to filter through the planetary body and as they reach the center of this um of the planted body there&#x27;s no way for them to go so they all you know start building up pressure they try to escape because of because of particle crowding they try to escape but they can&#x27;t so pressure keeps bowling until a certain point where it gives and we have a big explosion of these particles playing out and these are intense explosions so where where the incoming particles is a slower fare um where they you know they falter down at a at a much lesser speed um well the outburst of particles is at a high velocity and so instead of instead of bouncing off these um subatomic particles they essentially just you know rip right through them or push them out of the way so they since they have higher momentum they essentially just push these particles away and rips right through the matter so we only get a magnetic effect if if all these particles are flowing in the same direction now in the case of gravity they&#x27;re not really flowing the same direction i mean they are flowing towards the same location but not necessarily flowing in the coherent direction so you don&#x27;t have that magnetic effect okay and we discussed that if we had to build a craft so this crab then would have to shield from the dawn draft and also has to shield from the updraft and we can sort of balance you know balance um on top of this updraft and that would give us our anti-gravity effect because if if you in uh if you&#x27;re not a space right gravity there&#x27;s no real um the effect of gravity is you know as is at a great distance but the further away from your gravity or from any big planet you&#x27;ll experience less gravity flow so the gravity particles would be back to its neutral state um in other words there&#x27;s no net direction so you can shield yourself from these particles but how do you how do you navigate how do you move how do you go somewhere because you cannot really push off these particles all you can do is shield these particles but there&#x27;s there&#x27;s no flow but when you close the planet you can go up down or depending on how you are you are in the field right you can move in different directions because of the drama that you have around the planet but you know deep space there is no shots drama you may be able to find some gravity currents between a planet and its sun or your different planets and you can then you can ride that uh that current which is essentially just the flow of particles so we need to figure out then you know how we&#x27;re gonna um navigate you know once we off the planet but for the purposes of this series we we&#x27;re gonna attempt to just produce something that will give us an anti-gravity effect and then later on we can worry about that okay another thing we noticed that um when we have current flowing within a conductor um let&#x27;s let&#x27;s say these are the atoms and then when current flow typically we have electrons flowing right and as the electrons flow we notice that they the flowing current produces a magnetic field around the conductor itself so you have a spinning magnetic field around the conductor itself when the electrons flow so it&#x27;s almost like the conductor is inducing or producing or inducing the same effect as a magnet where this uh you know the iron metal um has a natural tendency to emit gravity particle magnetic particles and if they&#x27;re all aligned um we get the magnetic effect in this case the let&#x27;s twin say it&#x27;s copper so the copper you know has this in the neutral state where you cannot magnetize it in the same way as um iron it&#x27;s only when a car flows through it you observe a magnetic field and the field direction is in a circular pattern around the conductor itself so why is that so that also tells us that the magnet or the magnetic particles are closely tied you know to the electron cloud right so in the case of iron it it gets emitted by because of this uh the atomic structure has a certain uh vibration and then it emits the particle in this case the electron jumps from particle from atom to atom so it essentially then disrupts the copper or the conductor atomic structures which results in these atoms sorry which result in these magnetic particles being emitted right so let&#x27;s take a closer look at that so let&#x27;s say we have one of these conductor atoms and when an electron jumps to that atom and there&#x27;s essentially a lot of electrons this represents the current right and that is the atom so so when what happens then is that um this electron gets absorbed by that atom this atom frequency changes or its vibrational state changes so it emits a magnetic particle and then this particle because of the electron flow right we have a dense electron flow this particle gets expelled and it&#x27;s trying to find its way back into the metal uh or into the conductor bed typically we have the electrons flowing on the surface of the conductor so it cannot find its way into um you know back into the metal itself um so that gives that&#x27;s the reason why you know just rotates it on the metal because it&#x27;s trying to find its way into the metal itself another thing is when we have a capacitor being charged okay so if we if the current flows this direction right if you&#x27;re a flow of electrons this direction and so this becomes positive and this becomes negative so what happens is we have this when when this capacitor charges right we&#x27;ll have magnetic current or magnetic particles rotating around this conductor right so as it you know charges this plate um we see that um as it charges this plate we see that the um this charging effect induces a motion um of the capacity towards the positive side um if you look at the work done by uh you know thomson brown or the townsend brown effect where they observe that if you have you know two charged bodies you know one is negative and one is positive and they are connected positive and you rapidly charge when you have a when you pulse the charging of this capacitor you have movement towards the positive of the of the capacitor so what is the reason for that right so so let&#x27;s take a look at what happens when you have a charged particle what&#x27;s that what does that mean so if you have a negatively charged particle okay so we know that when electrons flow it causes the magnetic particle um to be expelled right and essentially it cannot find its way back into the conductor right that&#x27;s why that&#x27;s what&#x27;s giving it the its magnetic field so when you charge this particle the same thing happens where essentially pumping a whole bunch of electrons onto this particle similarly you&#x27;re also pumping a whole bunch of magnetic particles onto this particle so in that respect since you have an abundance of electrons and they typically they all push towards the surface of of this particle so what that means is then that you&#x27;ll have these uh magnetic particles being pushed out again because of the crowding effect because there&#x27;s abundance of particles abundance of magnetic particles as well as electrons so these particles get all pushed out and they try to find the way back essentially they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll orbit around this this negatively charged particle trying to find the way back so this area then represents a an area of high density of these particles relative to the background magnetic particles similarly if you have a positively charged particle what&#x27;s happening here is since it&#x27;s lacking electrons this represents a lack of magnetic particles so in other words you have from the surrounding sea of particles all trying to fold void it moves into this particle and when it and then it gets absorbed by um you know atomic structures within this particle so as they get absorbed they also get expelled since this charged particle essentially lacks excess electrons there&#x27;s an imbalance so as soon as it absorbs the particle the magnetic particles it also expels them now again the density of these particles is not even close to the magnetic particle or the in the case of a magnet um because you know it&#x27;s all spread out versus where you have a focused current essentially of these magnetic particles um so when you bring these the positive and the negative particles if you bring them close to each other these orbiting magnetic particles you know sees this uh positively charged uh particle um as an area of um uh an uh area of void in other words there&#x27;s a lack of these particles so since it cannot find its way back into um into the negative particle it takes the route all the way to that particle and then when this particle is expelled it finds its way back so there&#x27;s essentially a loop between these charged particles this also results that they start attracting each other um because these particles um creates a void essentially and it tries to fold the void so what happens then when um in the the bifid brown effect when you have a negative let&#x27;s say a negative sphere and a positive sphere and they are separated or they they attach um with some dielectric electric material so when these so when this capacitor is rapidly charged um so there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a sharp pulse um where where electrons are stripped from this sphere and added to the sphere um so if we look closely at what happens there um so suddenly so suddenly this guy loses a lot of electrons and they show up here and immediately you have this cloud of magnetic particles swirling around this negative sphere right so when this happens it immediately sees this as a area of attraction so it then rushes over into right area to full void and as it does so um there&#x27;s a sharp pulse of these magnetic particles into into this area or into this void um so when you whenever you have a pulse of these magnetic particles um they also induce motion in the surrounding the surrounding magnetic particles of gravity particles um so that means the gravity particles also start moving in that direction so in that respect this entire apparatus over the apparatus or capacitor gets dragged towards the positive or in the direction of the positive electrode so that&#x27;s essentially my understanding of the biofilm brown effect so what does that mean for us so this uh the baffle brown effect is um so represents the concept where we can essentially have some sort of artificial gravity so if we have you know sharp charging or pulses between these plates right and then anything in between these plates will also be dragged along because this cause a motion of the gravity particles towards the positive side of the plate of course there&#x27;s other geometries in terms of how you can structure this capacitor typically you have a small positive area and a larger negative area and this then creates different field effects typically for the best example of this we have the so-called lifters right where you have triangle shaped capacitor essentially but if you look at just you know one of the uh the side view of it right you have a big negative electrode and then you on top of that you have a wire and that&#x27;s charged positively and this one is charged negative um so if you look at the field created by that right this is a typical fail created by this configuration so what this also does it causes a so when you have sharp pulsing um during during the charging um it also causes a rush of these magnetic particles and they produce a number one motion of the of the device towards the positive electrode so the whole device lifts up and also because of the shape it causes a [Music] high concentration of particles below the craft in this area there&#x27;s lower density of these particles it also produces a corona wind as well downwards which also contributes to the left but there definitely is a electro gravity effect that happens there as well but we&#x27;ll get into that later on for now let&#x27;s focus on how do we get anti-gravity okay so i guess i digressed a little bit but i just want to give you more background in terms of um how um you know how gravity can be affected by these magnetic particles and in fact the the gravity particles are essentially magnetic particles and just to reiterate um the difference between the magnet particle or the magnets and gravity um if you have a magnet right the magnet is sitting in a in a sea of this gravity particles or magnetic particles so you can equate this to um having a device or a series of pumps or device with a series of pumps sitting maybe a mile under the ocean so you have enormous pressure onto this device and then if you turn on these pumps and no point in the same direction um the typical flow you know is not far from this device because of the pressure um so the water then would get sucked in from the ocean and as the water shoots out they don&#x27;t go far they slow down and then curve back and get sucked in along with the with the rest of the ocean so that that is how the magnet will also operate um within um you know within the background um sea of uh magnetic particles okay all right so in in the next video um we&#x27;ll go through the exact mechanism of how we&#x27;d um uh what is the mechanism of getting or expelling the magnetic particles from that metal so um hopefully it will be a shorter video</p>
