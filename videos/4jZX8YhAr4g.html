            <p>if you want to get early access to all of our daily videos please consider joining our patreon I&#x27;ll put a link below here it is on the screen again you get early access to all the daily videos ad free early before anyone else gets to see them have about it and you can help support the channel religious studies Professor Diana Pula recently went on a podcast and spoke about something she&#x27;s never publicly spoken about before and at least that&#x27;s the impression I got you&#x27;re going to have to tell me when you see the clip now let&#x27;s get to this interview so today&#x27;s Clips are referring to Jake Barber skywatcher and the idea of summoning craft right or connecting with craft there&#x27;s many terms people are using um psychically right the psionic assets that whole thing right telepathic communication with nhi non-human intelligence and their craft right and what Diana has to say about it I have to admit I agree with her but she tells a very disturbing story um about her time with Gary Nolan right before they went out to that secret crash site with Tim Taylor who was referred to as Tyler D in her book American Cosmic if you don&#x27;t know about that story it&#x27;s too much to get into here but I did make a video about it I&#x27;ll put a link in the description about that particular trip which is fascinating but it&#x27;s her comments about C5 right right Close Encounters of the fifth kind uh which is a term that kind of Steven Greer has coined in a sense um and he gets brought up too but um her comments about you know summoning craft if you will and making that connection is a warning in my opinion I want to tell you to stay tuned to the end because I have a correction for a video that I made yesterday also about Jake Barber that I want to make so stay to the end for that so let&#x27;s get to the first clip where Diana just responds to Jake Barber&#x27;s story in general he came forward in a pretty big way VIA news nation and he claimed he was part of you know a UFO retrieval program if folks haven&#x27;t seen that yet Perhaps you&#x27;re newer to the topic um he&#x27;s had some incredible experiences first then what were were your thoughts on Jake&#x27;s story itself okay so this is all right I I&#x27;d like to start by talking about it generally if that&#x27;s okay with you um so that program is something that in I&#x27;m not aware of that particular program but I&#x27;m aware of that that um framework for for accessing or driving ships okay craft whatever you want to call it um obviously it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been known because step Greer of course has his C5 protocols that he&#x27;s been utilizing um and in the UFO Community generally he&#x27;s controversial uh with respect to that um but in the historical record uh you do have uh people who in fact this is the reason why in 2012 aerospace engineers and and people associated with the space force were interested in my work because it in the historical record the Catholic historical record you do see instances where people um have inter face with things that are we would call UAP and not just that but there are a lot of things that surround that ability including a certain type of Lifestyle right so certain things in uh help uh help that process so okay so she doesn&#x27;t know too much about Jake but she understands the framework in which Jake Barber and his team at skywatcher um are using right um which is again this this what they&#x27;re calling psionic assets this psionic um ability right this connection right so we&#x27;ve established that now let&#x27;s get to where Diana starts talking just about that framework right of making a connection to right these non-human intelligence let&#x27;s just leave it at that basic framework because that&#x27;s what she&#x27;s going to respond to and again she&#x27;s pretty much putting out a warning the general idea then that this group would use psionics or some kind of te telepathy to summon a craft if you talk about that generally and you mentioned Steven Greer rightly to say controversial but there&#x27;s not a lot that isn&#x27;t controversial in this UFO conversation honestly yeah the idea that any group would summon a craft or be able to can you talk on that concept is that dangerous in the same way that people say don&#x27;t use a Ouija board because you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re summoning or you know what you&#x27;re opening up yeah so there are a few things I can say about that um first off when we call it a craft um I think that that&#x27;s a general term that people use but nobody really knows what it is okay so um of people that I&#x27;ve met who&#x27;ve talked about having access to looking at whatever this is uh they they are saying that there&#x27;s nothing that looks like technology there&#x27;s nothing that looks like you know this is where you turn this thing on okay that&#x27;s then that makes it makes more sense than to understand that there&#x27;s some type of human to object interface right which is something that to me seems much more likely if you look at the history of this phenomena um when people have these experiences just general people who don&#x27;t want these experiences say they just happen to be in this place at the right time right moment or if they don&#x27;t want the experience the wrong time wrong moment um it seems that in 80% of the cases they feel like there is some type of interface with it um I met a person who was a kid well I met actually a lot of grown-up Witnesses when they were uh you know as grown-ups but they talked about what happened to them as like 12 years old 11 years old 13 14 and they&#x27;ve had these experiences with these things that we&#x27;ll just call craft for you know because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re calling it and um they felt that it&#x27;s somehow hooked onto them or hooked into their their Consciousness and they felt like they were part you know they were communicating with it regardless of whether they wanted to or not all right so this is where the part all right so this next part is where it&#x27;s going to to get a little complicated right this is where Diana is again in my opinion from what my inter interpretations she&#x27;s going to reveal something she hadn&#x27;t revealed before in connection to this right something that made her so afraid of opening up that doorway to this connection right because as she just stated she was talking to people who felt like they were connected whether they wanted to or not I have met people who are very religious and live what we&#x27; call the sequestered type type of Life who um are known uh people to have had these experiences with with this uh they do call it something like they&#x27;re driving it okay so they do say it&#x27;s like a pilot situation all right so I I have heard that um now this is not to say that I I I believe it remember I teach religious studies which means that my method is agnostic I neither believe nor disbelieve I&#x27;m taking data in okay that doesn&#x27;t mean that I don&#x27;t have my personal opinion about it um right now it&#x27;s something completely you know when we we&#x27;re looking at it now it&#x27;s it&#x27;s being presented to us as something that the military is involved with and that&#x27;s pretty interesting right because the military would not recognize anything like that the US military is what I&#x27;m talking about um they would they wouldn&#x27;t recognize anything like that five years ago okay so this is like you&#x27;re right it&#x27;s just happened it&#x27;s happened in 2025 um so that&#x27;s a little bit of the context of what I could say another thing I&#x27;d like to say is that again this was something that I mentioned in American Cosmic when I&#x27;m going out into the desert with um I&#x27;ll call him Tyler D because he hasn&#x27;t said that I can call him his name yet okay I know a lot of people talk about that person um but I that situation um Gary Nolan has come out as Gary Nolan so I was there there with Gary Nolan and Tyler D and we&#x27;re going out to see what Tyler D calls a crash retrieval a place of Crash retrieval and what&#x27;s interesting is that the night before Gary shares some of his research with us and he has his computer and he shows us and he shows us photo after photo after photo of uh events what I call contact events events where people have interfaced with the this these craft and these are um and by the way I&#x27;ve never written this in any publication I do academic Publications and I&#x27;ve never written that that night I prayed but in this case I did because it was so disturbing to see that there were things that appeared to be um like Burns and damage and things like that and it looked like a dangerous activity and I didn&#x27;t know you know I still was not this is the beginning of the book by the way so I still was not a Believer but that definitely was pushing me in the direction of Gary is not making this up like this is exactly what I&#x27;m seeing these video I mean these uh photographs they&#x27;re not made up and they&#x27;re from all over the world so I can say that about this too so no I don&#x27;t think a person should engage in this personally that&#x27;s my personal opinion all right so let&#x27;s see if I can sum this up basically Diana is kind of alleging that this is you know a real phenomena which is why she gives the warning right she doesn&#x27;t recommend people partake in this particular action of communicating with non-human intelligence right with this sort of thing right because of some pictures she saw with Gary Nolan right before the night they went out into the desert for that you know to that crash site right and like she said she&#x27;d never publici publicized it before at least published it in one of her books that she prayed that night before they went out because she thought well Gary&#x27;s not showing me any BS this is these are these are real injuries right these are real physical effects that can happen to you when you make that connection and I totally understand her warning in fact I agree with it and I&#x27;ve brought it up on this channel multiple times and my biggest Point has been safety no one can guarantee your safety making this there are no safety protocols to put in place period for dealing with some this unknown there was quite literally nothing that could be done to ensure your safety right so it&#x27;s just one of those things oh yeah anybody can do this and that but they don&#x27;t talk about that aspect right if it&#x27;s a real thing really think about it logistically what you&#x27;re doing think about it you&#x27;re opening your mind to an unknown entity literally zero research zero effort put in to try to understand what you&#x27;re communicating with and what it could do to you now I&#x27;m not here to harp on people that you know participate in this particular action right C5 psionic connection whatever you want to call it um teach their own everyone do what they want but I&#x27;m not going to do it and I agree with Diana and what she&#x27;s saying to be honest with you now she&#x27;s coming from the standpoint she believes it&#x27;s real that&#x27;s why she doesn&#x27;t want to do it but I&#x27;m not necessarily there but I&#x27;m in the if it is real why would I do that right you know what I mean and I&#x27;ve honestly had this thought for a long long time in fact since I started and I first heard about it right um I&#x27;ve spoke about it on interviews I brought this up multiple times it&#x27;s not something I want to invite myself mentally right like I want to invite mentally into my brain um this sort of connection and you know I&#x27;ve been shamed for it I&#x27;ve been told well Patrick you just can&#x27;t let go of your ego it&#x27;s like has nothing to do with that again tell me what safety Protocols are in place zero so I don&#x27;t know but other people are claiming to do it you know all the marrier to them but I take Diana&#x27;s warning you know I like it I agree with what she&#x27;s saying right and I think it&#x27;s something to at least consider if you&#x27;re thinking about it so let me know what you guys think in the comments um about this now let&#x27;s get to this correction uh for a video that I made yesterday that I spoke about at the beginning of this video right so stay till the end so look I try to get everything as close to Accurate as I can right I&#x27;m not perfect and it seems I may have may I may have misinterpreted something Danny shean said in an interview that he did again for a video I made I&#x27;ll put a link in the description so you can check that out um and the gist of it is basically that he brought up alien reproduction vehicles and Jake Barber and all of this and I took it I interpreted that Jake Barber was you know retrieving because he was part of this crash retrieval that he was retrieving alien reproduction vehicles but I was reached out to by one of the people from the skywatcher team um Fred Baker I can&#x27;t reveal our communication because he wanted to keep that private and that&#x27;s fine um and again I&#x27;m actually trying to get um Fred on from skywatcher he did agree to do an interview later down the road when they start doing interviews so that&#x27;ll be really cool um but he just said hey take a look at the news Nation interview right and you may have misinterpreted that you know I realized there&#x27;s a lot going on and it was really cool he&#x27;s really nice really cordial to be honest with you and I just wanted to make a correction I&#x27;m not saying one thing&#x27;s real or not that has nothing to do with it it&#x27;s just that&#x27;s not what Jake said right so to be fair and I found a clip from that interview to kind of explain a little bit more about that so I still think a lot of it&#x27;s left up to interpretation but to just be fair um I&#x27;m going to play a clip here from that news Nation interview of Jake Barber talking um about that particular aspect of what exactly they were retrieving so as an a helicopter operator uh we provide a number of services to a number of departments within the military uh industrial complex um and that includes the department Department of the Interior as well as the DOI the department of the Interior has a number of other departments within it and we worked uh mostly in those for our Kus or within the continental United States those operations include things like firefighting uh long hul uh short Hall which is our external loads for helicopters uh working for the Bia Bureau of Indian fairs uh anything you could do to provide utility uh anything that you could do with the utility of a helicopter we were put to task on now at this stage there was no indication of any anomalous phenomena at all no when did you first start becoming aware of strange objects in the sky during your work well a lot of the work we did on was on what I call the range and the range is a particular geographical area where um the US government and its private Partners used to test all kinds of things uh uh weapons systems um and resilience to weapon systems of certain craft and so you see a lot of exciting things and I have to remind you that my particular role is very basic security and transportation it gets a little broad uh as you drill down but I&#x27;m a security and transportation expert and that&#x27;s the service we provided broadly provided to the to the government and its Partners so you start seeing at the range yes interesting objects well yeah it&#x27;s always interesting ing out there um you know my uh it was a process for me um getting to the point until we had our first experience with something that was obviously non-human in origin but uh up until that time there&#x27;s lots of interesting things in the sky I can tell you that um our our technology and by our I mean anything that lies within um the inventory of the United States government its private Partners is pretty spectacular there&#x27;s some cool things and from an observer standpoint on the ground it&#x27;s it&#x27;s hard to tell exactly what&#x27;s going on things come in and out of sight things disappear for a moment and reappear things to seem things seem to move very quickly things change color they change shape um and a good reference for this is I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all seen these uh drone shows like that could put on at the Super Bowl halftime or other places and uh I those are pretty amazing to see visually amazing but we all know that&#x27;s human Tech and we accept it but if you kind of think about that and think about perhaps what we might be doing uh privately um in the interest of National Security your imagination could fill in the blanks on what you might see uh on a test range that&#x27;s being used by the US government its Partners all right so I hope this helps clear some things up about what Jake said um you know it has nothing to do whether believing his claims or not but it&#x27;s definitely important to get what his claims even are right so if I made a mistake there my my apologies and here&#x27;s the correction for it um I&#x27;ll put a link in the description to that full interview with Jake Barbara if you want to hear more about it and you know what to be fair like there is hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of footage these people put out 4our thre hour interviews and then we&#x27;re supposed to take it all in and understand every little detail and it does become very hard to kind of keep things straight to be honest with you um for anybody right kind of following this even myself who&#x27;s in this all the time and again it&#x27;s not like I just follow Jake Barber and his claims there&#x27;s a bazillion people to cover and it&#x27;s just a lot so my apologies for getting that wrong I hope this helps correct the record again that Jake Barber didn&#x27;t necessarily only get alien reprodu vehicle right like there&#x27;s a lot more to the story so watch the uh hopefully that clip helps dispel some things if you want more context and information go check out that full interview on news Nation all right y&#x27;all we&#x27;ll see you on the next one remember everyday is a gift y&#x27;all peace [Music]</p>
