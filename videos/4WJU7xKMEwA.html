            <p>[music] What&#x27;s up humans and welcome to Anusivo. Happy Friday everybody. It&#x27;s January the 2nd. I do want to tell you guys that I want to thank you for the kind words you had for me as I was going through a rough time. I still am a little bit, but uh everything you guys said to me, I really really appreciate it and it&#x27;s not going unnoticed.</p>
<p>Much love to everyone. Thank you. But the show needs to go on and I do have probably some of the most important news in mainstream media as it relates to the UFO topic that I&#x27;ve heard in years. Because uh everybody keeps complaining about this. I do too.</p>
<p>That the mainstream media does not cover the UFO topic or doesn&#x27;t do it justice as it should. The fact of the matter is that many mainstream media outlets, especially with the written press, have covered the UFO topic for decades, the LA Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, many more. uh the Wall Street Journal um the Wall Street Journal last year released a a thorough uh article or investigation that was very one-sided about the topic. It it was almost as if uh people at Arrow directed the ones who wrote that article. That&#x27;s just the reality of it.</p>
<p>And I know that there are people that have been reached out by the Wall Street Journal according to Matt Ford from the Good Trouble Show. He reported on that and I tried to verify and yeah there are um many from the UFO topic people from uh the nuclear connection to UFOs like Robert Sales and uh Mario Woods, Robert Hastings. Uh a lot of those people have been reached by reached out by the two journalists who wrote that piece and apparently they&#x27;re writing a new one. Um, so the mainstream media has been covering UFOs. The thing is, it hasn&#x27;t been fair coverage.</p>
<p>Really, it has been very one-sided, very stigmatized, and it kind of seems like something is about to change in one of the biggest networks there are. I&#x27;m talking about CBS News. So, something happened over the last couple of days that I I think we need to talk about, and it it involves CBS News completely. We know that over the last couple of months there&#x27;s been uh a change of ownership in the CBS company and uh currently CBS News is run by Barry Weiss and it&#x27;s kind of veering even politically towards a less restrictive type of uh material and hopefully they don&#x27;t get too politicized. they don&#x27;t go too far right because they were very leftwinged and I think that there needs to be more like a center type of media when it comes to mainstream news and CBS has a unique opportunity to do this and I hope they do.</p>
<p>But thank you to Joe Meria and to Omni Talk Radio for bringing this to my attention because I got to show you this one. It&#x27;s really interesting. So here it is. This is uh uh CBS news from the evening show back in 2017 covering the New York Times article where Lu Alzando was known to the public. His name is Tony Dopal and this is what he said back then.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Alzando refused to tell us how many cases his former group investigated saying that information was sensitive. From 1947 to 1969, an Air Force program called Project Blue Book looked into more than 12,000 UFO sightings, and about 700 of them remain unidentified. &gt;&gt; Interesting how they buried this in the budget under this sort of blurry name, Advanced Aviation Threat Identification. &gt;&gt; They call it Black Money for a reason. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. I&#x27;ve never seen one, but I believe when I was a little kid, there was a movie where it shows aliens giving you a needle in the back of your neck and it changed your changed your personality. terrified [music] me for years. Still terrifies me. So I believe in that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I do too. &gt;&gt; I do too, he said. So this same guy, Tony the Copel did this recently, just yesterday I think. And this is what called my attention and Joe Mergia&#x27;s attention and the Omnitac radio people&#x27;s attention because Joe reposted the following video that I&#x27;m about to show you where Tony Dopal addresses the people and he talks about the new type of orientation that CBS News is going to bring to the table. And I just want to show you how this went down and let&#x27;s talk about it afterwards because there&#x27;s already movement going on in terms of UFO coverage from CBS News that surprised me and we need to talk about it.</p>
<p>So here is Tony the Copel addressing the CBS News uh viewership. &gt;&gt; A lot has changed since the first person sat in this chair, but for me the biggest difference is people do not trust us like they used to. And it&#x27;s not just us. It&#x27;s all of Legacy Media. And I get it.</p>
<p>I get it because I&#x27;ve been hearing about it from just about everybody for more than 20 years as I&#x27;ve traveled America on this assignment or that. My mom&#x27;s neighbors in West Virginia, my own neighbors in New York City, thousands and thousands of conversations in between. Sometimes people want to talk to me about our coverage of NAFTA or the Iraq war. Other times, it&#x27;s all about Hillary Clinton&#x27;s emails or Russia gate, or more recently, COVID lockdowns, Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop, or the president&#x27;s fitness for office. The point is on too many stories, the press has missed the story.</p>
<p>Because we&#x27;ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites and not enough on you. And I know this because at certain points I have been you. I have felt this way too. I felt like what I was seeing and hearing on the news didn&#x27;t reflect what I was seeing and hearing in my own life and that the most urgent questions simply weren&#x27;t being asked. So here&#x27;s my promise to you today and every time you see me in this chair.</p>
<p>You come first. not advertisers, not politicians, not corporate interests. And yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS. I report for you, which means I tell you what I know, when I know it, and how I know it. And when I get it wrong, I&#x27;ll tell you that, too.</p>
<p>It also means I&#x27;m going to talk to everybody and hold everyone in public life to the very same standard. After all, I became a journalist to talk to people. I love talking to people about what works in this country, what doesn&#x27;t, and not only what should change, but the good ideas that should never change. I think telling the truth is one of them. I&#x27;m Tony Dopal, the anchor of the CBS Evening News.</p>
<p>Hold me to it. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, that happened. Um, and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a really strange thing to see and witness because historically, uh, most of the media mainstream media companies that are considered that were considered left-wing, they were always very dishonest in many ways. They spin things to their benefit, to their agenda. The same thing happens to the right-wing media.</p>
<p>But I think that because the Democrats were more in power, they became more powerful as well. CBS, ABC, CNN, all of these media outlets, and they lost the trust of the people completely. And when it comes to UFOs, um this is what Joe Mia um highlighted. He was like, &quot;Yeah, okay, that&#x27;s cool, but I hope we can get to see more UFO coverage. That is fair.&quot; And it appears like they already started trying to do something about it.</p>
<p>So what happened was that again Matt Ford from the good trouble show reported that uh they have been approaching people like him and others to ask them if they wanted to engage in a debate about UFOs with Mick West. So uh somebody chimed in that I wasn&#x27;t expecting to chime in and that somebody is Dr. Gary Nolan. So this is what he said. He said they asked me and I said no I am no in no uncertain terms I would not debate a garage experimenttor who doesn&#x27;t know the difference between hypothesis data evidence and opinion and who changes the subject when he&#x27;s cornered and especially not someone who promotes an organization that deceptively edits people&#x27;s Wikipedia bios based on personal bias.</p>
<p>That kind of unethical and unprofessional behavior is not worth lending any credence to on a respectable show like 48 Hours, which is the show that wanted them to debate on CBS News. And then Gary continues, I said, and I quote, look, I am happy to have a conversation with another real scientist like me is skeptical of many of the interpretations of alleged exotic phenomena. End quote. I would want that conversation to be with someone who is an experimentalist, pushes in peer-reviewed journals, etc. We would take turns, we could take turns playing devil&#x27;s advocate, skeptics for and against various propositions.</p>
<p>I never heard back from the show organizer after that. So, they&#x27;ve been reaching at people over the last few days. Um, Dr. Gary Nolan is one of them. He said no to them because MC West was part of it.</p>
<p>Uh, if I&#x27;m honest with you, I Jesse Michaels already did this. I think it was a wonderful idea. Maric Bon Renfamp had a debate with MC West on Jesse&#x27;s channel and I think it went relatively well. Mick is always going to descent with this because he seems to be on that side of the coin. Um, nothing against him really.</p>
<p>He has a website called Metabunk which debunks stuff and nothing wrong with debunking either. I just got to tell you when there&#x27;s something that needs debunking I applaud that because that helps out clear all the noise around what really matters which is the real raw data. So there needs to be a lot of debunking in this space. I completely agree with that. Uh however there is just debunking and there is bad faith debunking um and deniialism which is very different to just trying to debunk something that uh deserves a debunk or trying to push uh disinformation by saying that it is a debunk.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a difference between both. So this is where we are in CBS news. Something is happening. There&#x27;s a shift happening and to me that is very positive. The reaction from for example Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan to say no to Mick. Um I think that he missed an opportunity because yeah maybe he feels like Mick is not on his level. Uh shocker but I think that Mick is one of the most involved people on the other side of this conversation. Everybody pays attention to him. Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan has taken swipes at him constantly. Uh Merrick von Brandenov remains in a constant debate with Mick. So you&#x27;re saying no to him, but you&#x27;re also engaging him constantly and not giving him the time of day for a debate. Why don&#x27;t you? I mean, it&#x27;s not really a bad idea. I think that Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan would completely own Mick and that would leave very little room for him to just continue doing what he does. And saying no to Mick, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s uh the best look because yeah, it just makes you look like you feel like you&#x27;re above him maybe. And I don&#x27;t know, uh it just seems that way. But yeah, I think that debating MC West uh from anybody in the UFO community on one of the biggest networks in the US is not such a bad idea to be honest with you. Especially if you can like just own Mick on a debate and uh make everybody understand that the data is sound and that well Mick is one of the biggest debunkers on the UFO topic.</p>
<p>And to me he&#x27;s like a really curious guy. He&#x27;s always been a gentleman to a lot of people that I know. to me even uh when he tried to criticize some of my work. All he said was that I was not reliable, but he never insulted me. He didn&#x27;t get into ad hominemm attacks like it happens constantly on UFO Twitter.</p>
<p>So, I would think that it was a great idea. And I don&#x27;t know why people from the disclosure side of things are against an unexperienced news network in the UFO topic to start like this. I think it was a great idea to get one of the biggest debunkers, most known to get one of the biggest names on the other side and make them debate UFOs. I would like to see that. So, I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>This reaction seems a little over the top just saying no like that instead of engaging in actual debate. So I don&#x27;t know what you guys think about this. I think it&#x27;s a huge news that CBS News through this guy Tony seemingly are finally taking this seriously. And I haven&#x27;t seen Tony recently talking about covering UFOs, but this uh these approaches from the 48 hours show uh they show that at least they&#x27;re doing something in good faith. And just saying no like that outright, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s okay.</p>
<p>I think that if the mainstream media finally wants to get involved in this conversation, I think they have some of the biggest megaphones in the world. So, it might not be such a bad idea to give them the benefit of the doubt maybe and make this happen. If it&#x27;s not Dr. Nolan, maybe somebody else, maybe Merrick can step in. Marrick and Mick did a wonderful job with Jesse.</p>
<p>So, seeing round two of that on CBS News, that would be great. And yeah, uh maybe Dr. Nolan probably is uh above Mick in this. It certainly seemed that he thinks that way, but I don&#x27;t know. I I would really pay money even to see Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan debating Neil deGrasse Tyson. It&#x27;s long overdue, guys. And I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know what you guys think about that one. I would pay money to see that.</p>
<p>It would be really cool to see both of them just engage in this debate about UFOs and see what comes out on the other side. Let me know what you think about this. What do you think about this anchor man that is now uh openly saying that he wants to be more transparent unlike his predecessors at the organization? What do you think about them approaching people from the UFO world both on the debunking side on the other side asking them to engage in a debate? Do you think it&#x27;s a good idea? Who would you like to see debate on CBS News or on the 48 hour show about the topic? Leave me your verses in the comment section down below. I&#x27;ll be reading everything. Personally, and I&#x27;m going to be just completely honest here.</p>
<p>Uh I would love to see celebrity death match comeback. A good friend of uh mine, Alex, a long time ago did this because yeah, a celebrity death match in the UFO world would be a wonderful idea. And with AI now how it is, maybe doing that would be cool. If any of those creative minds that do wonderful AI work um have the capability to do this, I would really like it if any of you would. But if a celebrity dead match like uh event happens, uh Euphology edition, I would like these two to call the playbyplay.</p>
<p>What do you think? Art Bell and Joe Rogan officiating celebrity dead match euphology edition. What do you guys think? Thank you, Alex, for the image. But yeah, the debates, I think it&#x27;s a good idea, especially if it&#x27;s from a mainstream media outlet that is willing to do this. I would really love that to happen. And I don&#x27;t know, uh maybe Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan can get somebody on his level probably. And who would you like for Mick West to debate in this? I&#x27;d say Merrick, uh for round two, but who would you pick? Let me know in the comment section down below.
