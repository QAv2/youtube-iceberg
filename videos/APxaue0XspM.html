            <p>all right how is everybody doing out there today welcome to my channel this channel is for the purposes of educating the public on all kinds of uh different theories of everything in depth and um you know things that uh either ancient or modern have uh affected my life in positive ways uh helping me to um you know redo my Paradigm and to uh have a holistic source to call upon uh in all situations and um uh to be inspired by people who did things uh just because they believed in them and not because they were going to get paid or because they were going to get Prestige and today is our 365th video on dwey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory and um Mr Larson lived in the 20th century and died in 1990 he um was a mining engineer living out in Portland and he uh was working on a problem chemistry problem trying to make a small contribution to the field and stumbled across something that was much more all-encompassing and uh he answered the call and spent 30 years of his life you know kind of trying to work out the details eventually he uh proposed his two fundamental postulates in the late 1950s and from them he derived through a process of deduction a theoretical Universe about How the Universe would look if he was right about his postulat and I&#x27;ve done about 15 videos on that uh deduction uh way back many months ago 10 10 or 11 months ago and that is called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system it goes over all like 165 different steps that he took uh to go from his postulates all the way out to um you know into the weeds and um from those from that theoretical Universe then Larson wrote his books and he wrote books on chemistry and physics and astronomy and astrophysics and also economics and metaphysics um and he kind of compared his findings with the findings of the scientists uh particularly their observations and measurements made in the laboratory and uh Larson&#x27;s findings uh they look look pretty you know they stand up pretty well I&#x27;ll just say that okay now um the basic idea behind um fundamental postulates the first postulate is that uh the universe this is paraphrasing and as I said yesterday LaRon um he uh revised the postulate several times in the uh last 30 years of his life and minor minor revisions but uh so it&#x27;s difficult to actually quote the postulates because they did change a few different times but uh the universe is composed uh entirely of one component motion and that motion exists in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and then the second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magn ites are absolute and its geometry is ukian now that second postulate is somewhat of a throwaway um as some of Larson&#x27;s followers especially Dr Bruce pet have uh disputed the second postulate in particular the ukian geometry and um commutative mathematics primary magnitudes and um I think there&#x27;s something to that um pet wanted to replace the ukian geometry with projective geometry which is a u more inclusive kind of geometry uh of which ukian geometry is a subset but the first postulate is kind of uh far more important and over looking at is a universe made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are basically uh two components of a fraction um with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator but they can come in multiple Dimensions uh just think of speed speed is space over time the bike is moving 12 miles hour that is 12 miles of space and one hour of time and uh if space over time and if you decide to double the speed you can then say the bike is now moving 24 mph doubling the space or you can say the bike is now moving 12 miles per half hour they are equivalent statements uh one is obtained by multiplying the space the other is obtained by dividing the time that is what the reciprocal looks like and uh but you also can have other forms of motion in that same fractional format uh energy being time over space it took me 3 hours to push that thing half a mile 3 hours of time half a mile of space and um acceleration I dropped the rock out of the window and it fell at 32 ft per second per second 32 ft of Space 1 second per second of of time space over time to the second power and uh all of our uh scientific quantities can be expressed exclusively through space and time in a fraction and uh probably the most important thing for me about the motion is that uh Larson&#x27;s concept of motion is not exactly the same as um what most scientists uh think of motion in terms of velocity they normally think of speed or velocity as being um you know a certain magnitude and then with velocity that velocity is also implying a Direction you know the bicycle was moving 12 miles an hour north uh the kind of motion that Larson&#x27;s talking about isn&#x27;t like that uh it&#x27;s what Larson calls a scaler motion this is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction um and you can think of this in terms of a clock uh in terms of time the clock is always getting later and later and later it&#x27;s getting later always but it is not getting later in any specific Direction on the space front you could think of it by envisioning a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other and they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction each dot is moving away from each other Dot and even the spaces between the dots are moving away from each one of the other locations on the surface of that balloon um and that is a scalar motion the space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and this was also observed by scientists through their telescopes all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other they tell us but uh in spite of telling us this they haven&#x27;t investigated it whatsoever to determine what&#x27;s going on with this certain kind of motion they&#x27;ve just kind of uh now I could be wrong I haven&#x27;t kept up with the literature or anything maybe they&#x27;re looking at it now but uh this was a complaint that Larsson made back in the day that you know the scientists didn&#x27;t know anything about scaler motion they kind of assigned it to an anomalous uh kind of motion and they weren&#x27;t very curious about investigating the properties of scalar motion um so we have a scalar motion Larson uses the terms clock time and clock space and then we also have coordinate time and coordinate space these are are three dimensions XYZ coordinates in space and Larson gets here by observing space and uh as most of us has have observed uh we can break down our space into two three dimensions XYZ coordinates volume and um one characteristic of a reciprocal is that uh whatever qualities adhere to one of the reciprocals they also adhere to the other so Larsson also posits the idea of coordinate time three dimensions of time and um then we also have what Larson calls the discrete unit postulate that space and time and motion only come in discrete units you have to have a full unit of space or time before you have anything and that full unit um is very small but it is significant and um if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have what Larson calls the speed of light or unit speed one over one equals 1 and at unit speed um this is really the zero point of the reciprocal system lson calls it the null point the state of rest the reference point the uh progression of the natural reference system in a universe of motion the speed of light outward in all directions is the state of rest or the origin or The Ether uh the neutral point half the universe is moving faster than that half the universe is moving slower than that uh which is something that the Legacy science has trouble with um Einstein said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe and uh in a certain way it is because if you go into what lson calls the cosmic sector the faster than the speed of light um Realm uh it is uh you could say that it&#x27;s faster than the speed of light but really once it crosses that boundary it moves into the realm of energy not speed speed and energy are reciprocals of one another so instead of saying that the speed is faster than light you would actually say that the energy is slower than light or the energy is less than than light so I guess it could be a matter of semantics there anyway that uh is just kind of a summary of the um postulates now let&#x27;s get into uh going over this paper a little bit more uh this is a paper called dimensional thinking that was written by Dr Bruce paret and this is his ninth of his nine different uh tutorial articles on rs2 rs2 being the reevaluation of the reciprocal system Dr parad along with Dr kvk Neu uh did a lot of work trying to uh work out some of the Kinks of Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system uh some of the things that uh created sticking points or didn&#x27;t really work very well or needed to be updated new due to new findings or or due to kind of methods that Larson wasn&#x27;t as familiar with such as non ukian geometries uh computer Imaging um Dost uh philosophy and many other things like that okay now we have uh we started this paper two days ago so if you want to uh come in from the start you want to go back to episodes and start from there uh right now we are kind of in the middle here uh we were just talking about querian and that pet wants to P try to use querian to describe um matter in the reciprocal system lson uses the ultra highe speed range primarily in the discussion of astronomical objects where such motion can be observed as a general concept it works but when applied to specific equations it fails for the same reasons Hamilton ran into but Hamilton solution Works uh somehow I just completely lost my place here um but Hamilton&#x27;s solution works just as well in the reciprocal system lson does omit unit speed from his concept of units of motion which should not have been omitted because he does assign unit speed values to many motions however if we apply Hamilton&#x27;s criterian structure to larsson&#x27;s unit of motion we need four units instead of three but the resulting structure does explain a lot remembering Hamilton Bridge scrolling U I2 = J2 = k 2 equal i. J.K = -1 examine the structure first off we eliminate the second scalar dimension of motion as unnecessary now recall uh or learned for the first time that there is a difference between uh between spatial dimensions and scalar Dimensions it takes three spatial Dimensions to Define just one scalar Dimension so scalar scalar Dimensions we really only are able to see one of them at a time there are three scalar Dimensions but we really only can see one of them at at a time and if we are looking at the second or third scalar Dimensions we&#x27;re doing so through a lens that only allows us to see a fraction of what&#x27;s going on so uh here he&#x27;s talking about scalar Dimensions if we first off we eliminate the second scalar dimension of motion as unnecessary assigning all four units of motion to a single scalar Dimension this has the added bonus of making all three scalar Dimensions homogeneous with larsson&#x27;s approach the second dimension B is split in half different from the first and the third now generally you have um you have your split between uh speed and energy and each scalar Dimension uh basically is a spectrum from zero speed all the way up to Zero Energy with one at the middle and one is the boundary uh you know the speed of light boundary or you know the unit speed boundary the um uh zero point boundary and um that comprises one scalar Dimension but that is really two dimensions of speed you know all the way from minus one or one unit of speed and then also one unit of energy then once you blow out that second unit of energy then you move into a second scalar Dimension and um this all kind of uh becomes more relevant when you&#x27;re talking about astronomical phenomena uh those that are subject to qu uh to uh explosions massive explosions that create what um what are called compact astronomical compact objects such as white dwarfs and quazars and pulsars we&#x27;ll get into that at some point um okay um the first unit is outward speed a real magnitude that is the progression of the natural reference system underlying all motion the second unit 1 - x is onedimensional I dot or 1 do I and imaginary expressing energy as an electric notation um I&#x27;m sorry an electric rotation the third unit 2 - x is two-dimensional I uh 1. i.j and imaginary expressing energy as a magnetic rotation the last unit 3 - x is back to a one-dimensional real magnitude of opposite direction to the first unit an inward speed I sorry I keep saying I 1 i.j. k equal -1 um now I&#x27;m not totally clear why he would be saying that that is onedimensional because it does go it is a negative one and it goes backward against the first unit but it&#x27;s involving all three of the imaginary operators and the unit speed progression so as a querian rather than a 2d triplet motion can express itself in four symmetric forms two of them being linear um outward and inward speed and two being rotational 1D electric and 2D magnetic energy and now we have a clear concept of why 3 - x motion is inward speed AKA gravity it is the direct consequence of 3D rotation in a three-dimensional Universe of motion now that&#x27;s pretty interesting he&#x27;s he&#x27;s saying that the 3 - x motion is gravity which is the negative of the progression the gravity you could think of that as being the uh sucking in the balloon all of the dots are moving toward each other um it&#x27;s only the fields the gravitational field just like the electric and magnetic fields are just a fiction they are the result of assigning a reference point to one of the dots uh one of the locations um whereby you are saying arbitrarily that this particular dot is motionless and then you can then you can start using vectorial motion you can start determining Direction and that&#x27;s where you get a field from but gravity itself doesn&#x27;t have any Fields the Motions there&#x27;s not a there&#x27;s not a pulling of one um location toward another location they&#x27;re all moving toward each other um so uh now in PRI in larsson&#x27;s work the 3 to x three minus X motion is usually um he uses this for quazars and pulsars that this is a motion into the ultra highspeed range that is beyond uh twice the speed of light and uh it carries with it some different uh linear quality ities but pet has kind of turned it around and turned it into gravity so that&#x27;s something that I would have to consider uh this I&#x27;m sorry if this is extremely difficult uh paret has kind of gotten out into the weeds here and is talking about stuff that um is probably not appropriate for an introduction but uh I think he&#x27;s he&#x27;s trying to flesh out um his you know rs2 reciprocal system re-evaluation um kind of uh format I think we actually are just going to stop right there and uh let that marinate now again don&#x27;t necessarily think I&#x27;m lost or I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about or this is confusing or this is or you know anything like that just uh let it wash over you and um don&#x27;t accept it or reject it just let it kind of marinate in your head and you know you&#x27;ll be given some more clues it it it that&#x27;s really what it is it&#x27;s kind of like a puzzle and you have to get you know each time you listen you get a few more clues and you&#x27;re able to hash out certain things um that&#x27;s just the nature of Paradigm changes you know you&#x27;re you&#x27;re not going to be able to uh you know very rarely do you have like these aha moments where everything changes all at once the changes are usually pretty gradual and they require a lot of ambivalence you have to be able to kind of hold opposite uh you know opposite theories in your head at the same time and kind of weigh them out and see you know which makes sense you know usually part of one makes sense part of another uh until you get a bigger picture you know um the L larsson&#x27;s Body of work is immense and especially when you throw in like some of the other players and um you just can&#x27;t get a sense of it all from you know One Source you have to really look at a number of his different books before you really have a good idea of what he&#x27;s talking about so um you know just hang in there and uh we&#x27;ll get back to this tomorrow thanks for tuning in today have a great day</p>
