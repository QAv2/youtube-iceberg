            <p>RIGHT. WE&#x27;RE GOING TO DISSECT A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT INTERVIEW I JUST DID WITH UEFA WHISTLEBLOWER DAVID GRUSH LAWMAKERS, AS WE&#x27;VE SAID, HAVE WATER DOWN RULES IN THE DEFENSE BILL THAT WOULD HAVE RELEASED INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT GOVERNMENT, PROJECTS GRUSH IS VOWING TO PRESS ON WITH HIS CAMPAIGN TO GET MORE SECRETS OUT TO THE PUBLIC. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAYS HE DOES HAVE FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOVERNMENT, A UEFA PROGRAM. SO JOINING US NOW IS NEWSNATION SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT ROSS CALLED PARTY WAS THE FIRST INTERVIEW DAVID AND BROUGHT THE WORLD ALL OF HIS REVELATIONS. ROSS, WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE FIRSTHAND? THIS FIRSTHAND INFORMATION THAT HE HAS, HE SAYS HE&#x27;S RIGHT WRITING AND GOOD ABOUT WEEK OR SO.</p>
<p>SOME SORT OP ED WITH NEW FIRSTHAND INFORMATION TO KNOW WHAT HE&#x27;S TALKING ABOUT. I DO. YEAH, GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OR ELIZABETH AND HELLO ONCE AGAIN. I&#x27;M ACTUALLY VERY EXCITED THAT YOU&#x27;VE MANAGED TO PULL IT OUT OF IT BECAUSE SOME I THING WAITING FOR A WHILE FOR HIM TO PROVIDE A REJOINDER TO THE CRITICS WHO CONSTANTLY ACISION THAT THERE IS NO FIRST-HAND EVIDENCE. I I COME TALK WITH ANY SPECIFICITY BECAUSE FRANKLY DON&#x27;T NOT.</p>
<p>I SUSPECTED SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHY THE PHOTOGRAPHIC COOL VIDEO MATERIAL THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SAYING. I&#x27;M ONLY SPEAKING. I JUST WANT EMPHASIZE AS WELL FOR THE PEOPLE USE IT, THAT THERE IS NO FIRST-HAND EVIDENCE INVOLVING DAVID GRUSH. THEY MISSED THE SIGNIFICANCE TIME AND TIME AGAIN OF THE FINDING BY BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF WHEN HE RECEIVED FOOD DIET AGGRESSIONS, META TO CONGRESS FOR INVESTIGATION THAT MISTER BRUSHES WITH A GUY LIKE ASIANS WITH CREDIBLE AND URGENT. HE BASED NOT JUST ON MISTER BRUSHES ALLEGATIONS, BUT ON THE FIRST HAND, EVIDENCE OF MULTIPLE WITNESSES.</p>
<p>IN FACT, DOZENS OF WITNESSES WHO HAVE SINCE COME FORWARD OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS TO GIVE EVIDENCE TO CONGRESS. SO THERE IS A MULTIPLE NUMBER OF WITNESSES THAT HAVE COME FORWARD TO CONGRESS AND THE MADDENING FRUSTRATING THING IS THAT WHEN OUT OF HINDERED BY VIRTUE OF PUT ISRAEL ON THIS LEGISLATION, THERE IS NO LONGER GOING TO BE THIS PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS REVIEW PANEL THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THIS INFORMATION SLOWLY DECLASSIFIED LIKE TO DO NOW. ROSS, ANYBODY CAN JUST SAY UP THAT THAT VIOLATES NATIONAL SECURTY. TAKE THAT ONE. NOW WE CAN&#x27;T.</p>
<p>I MEAN IT. YOU KNOW ROSS. IT COMES BACK TO DELIBERATELY READ THAT QUOTE FROM CONGRESSMAN MOSCOWITZ FLORIDA TODAY, THE GRASS BECAUSE HE WASN&#x27;T AT FIRST A BELIEVER NURSE. HE THOUGHT IT WAS ALL LIKE NONSENSE. BUT WEDNESDAY HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THERE&#x27;S SOMETHING THERE BECAUSE EVERY TIME ASKED QUESTIONS AND STARTED, HE SAID, PULLING A THREAD, WE GOT STONEWALLED.</p>
<p>IN OTHER WORDS, THIS ENORMOUS EFFORT TO SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN SEEMS TO HAVE ACTUALLY HAD THE UNINTENDED EFFECT CREATING A FEW MORE BELIEVERS. THERE ARE 2 POINTS TO MAKE FROM OF SIS. LEE, AS YOU POINTED OUT IN YOUR INTERVIEW WITH DAVID, IF THERE&#x27;S NOTHING TO HIDE, WHY DID THEY FOUGHT SO TO STOP LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED TRANSPARENCY AND THE SECOND ISSUE IS, FRANKLY, THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE NOT HAVE THE COMING FORWARD OF PEOPLE WHO THE GOVERNMENT CAN&#x27;T CONTROL. HE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRESIDENT AND FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE, ENSURING THAT PROBABLY THE BIGGEST STORY IN HUMAN HISTORY IS PROPERLY TOLD AND GIVEN PROPER CUSTODY AND SHIP BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, WHICH AFTER FRANKLY ALL BLACK AND WHITE HAS PRESIDED OVER A COVER UP FOR MUCH OF THE LAST 70 TO 80 YEARS.</p>
<p>AND HE WAS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FROM VERY SENIOR PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CONGRESS TO GET LEGISLATION THAT WOULD AVE ALLOWED TO CONTROLLED DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SCIENCE, VERY NAIVE IDEA. BUT I CAN TELL I SPOKE TO SENATORS. I SPOKE TO CONGRESSMAN CONGRESSWOMAN AND THERE WAS A REAL WILLINGNESS TO SEE THE TIES INTO THE OPEN. I THINK WHAT&#x27;S HAPPENED IS THE SECTIONS OF THE DEFENSE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY, BUT FRANKLY DON&#x27;T WANT TO HAVE TO DISCLOSE WHAT THEY KNOW BECAUSE THEY FRANKLY WORRIED ABOUT GETTING INTO TROUBLE.</p>
<p>ROSS CALLED HURT. SO INTERESTING. WE&#x27;LL HAVE MUCH MORE WITH DAVID TOMORROW WHEN HE&#x27;LL TALK. TAKE ON THOSE CRITICS WHO ATTACKED HIM AND MORE ON THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS THAT WERE LEAKED IN AN EFFORT TO IMPUGN HIS GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. ROSS, THANK YOU.</p>
<p>IT&#x27;T&#x27;S A REALLEASURE. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. COMING</p>
