            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>the advanced aerospace threat identification program also known as atip ran from 2007 to 2012. now despite the fact it was not a classified program atip only became known to the public in 2017 when former program director louise elizondo resigned from the program and he released several super hornet fleer videos now informally known as the tic tac videos alex dietrich was the wing super hornet pilot in the flight that took that tic tac flir footage and she says at the time her squadron mates stayed quiet about the incident because they were afraid of being labeled what she called kooky now she&#x27;s in her early 40s she says she feels a duty to speak up about her close encounter with the uap unidentified aerial phenomenon which is the new term for what we used to call ufos because she sees it as a vital matter of national security she said i do feel a duty and obligation i was in a taxpayer-funded aircraft doing my job as a military officer but she also admits there was hesitancy at the time and she said over beers we&#x27;ve said hey man if i saw this solo i don&#x27;t know that i would have come back and said anything because it sounds so crazy when i say it now last year alex tweeted couldn&#x27;t get anyone to listen to 2004 now everyone wants to talk about it what changed as she intimates with that tweet what changed is she and her flight lead who was also the squadron skipper commander dave fraver went on 60 minutes and talked about it and as a function of the buzz created by that episode of 60 minutes congress demanded that the pentagon release a report but it was only a nine page summary here are the high points there are probably multiple types of uap again that means unidentified aerial phenomenon requiring different explanations based on the range of appearances and behaviors described in the available reporting second bullet uap clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to u.s national security third bullet and by the way the little u in parentheses means it&#x27;s unclassified consistent consolidation of reports from across the federal government standardized reporting increased collection of analysis and a streamlined process for screening all such reports against a broad range of relevant government data will allow for a more sophisticated analysis of uap that is likely to deepen our understanding now at the same time that elizondo went public with the existence of atip the united states bureau of the british tabloid the sun filed a freedom of information act request for any and all documents related to the program it took four years so on april 5th 2022 a couple weeks ago the u.s defense intelligence agency also known as dia honored the request and released more than 1500 pages to the sun this foia release contains some amazing insights one is a report titled anomalous acute and subacute field effects on human and biological tissues which is dated march of 2010 so this report describes alleged injuries to quote human observers by anomalous advanced aerospace systems end quote and it characterizes some of these as quote a threat to the united states interest in quote in this report there are 42 cases for medical files and 300 unpublished cases where humans sustain injuries after alleged encounters with anomalous vehicles which include ufos in some cases humans showed burn injuries or other conditions related to electromagnetic radiation some of them appearing to have been inflicted by quote energy related to propulsion systems the report also notes cases of brain damage nerve damage heart palpitations and headaches related to anomalous vehicle encounters so elizondo spoke to this in an interview with gq a couple years ago he said i&#x27;ve got to be careful i can&#x27;t speak too specifically but one might imagine that you get a report from a pilot says lou it&#x27;s really weird i was flying and i got close to this thing and i came back home and it&#x27;s like i got a sunburn i was red for four days and then in another case a pilot might say if he had gotten a little closer lou i&#x27;m in the hospital i&#x27;ve got symptoms that are indicative of microwave damage meaning internal injuries and even in my brain there&#x27;s some morphology there and then you might get somebody who gets really close and says you know lou it&#x27;s really bizarre i felt like i was there for only four or five minutes but when i looked at my watch 30 minutes went by but i only used five minutes worth of fuel how&#x27;s that possible well there&#x27;s a reason for that we believe and it probably has to do with the warping of space-time so the study also argues that it&#x27;s possible to use this medical information to quote reverse engineer ufos from unknown providence that may be a threat to united states interests appendix a of the report outlines what is termed the shustler catalog of ufo-related human physiological effects and this lists the frequency of things like abductions perceived time loss swelling of tissues levitation there are five sexual encounters five deaths four hair loss episodes and three claimed implants there is also one unaccounted for pregnancy another interesting part of the document categorizes this anomalous behavior with different ratings first are the ma ratings which describes behavior of a ufo ma1 is a ufo has been observed which travels a discontinuous trajectory ma2 is ma1 plus any physical effects caused by the ufo ma3 is one plus entities observed on board and may 4 is maneuvers accompanied by a sense of reality transformation for the observer and ma5 is a maneuver that results in a permanent injury or death of the witness then there is what is called flyby ratings fly by one a simple sighting of a ufo traveling in a straight line fly by two is one accompanied by physical evidence fly by three is a flyby where the entities are observed on board and it says in parentheses that&#x27;s rare flyby four is fly by where the witness experienced a transformation of reality into the object or its occupants and then fly by five is a flyby which the witness would suffer permanent injuries or even death and then there&#x27;s the close encounter rating we talked about this in a previous episode when we were talking about the heinek close encounter ratings close encounter one is the ufo comes within 500 feet of the witness but without after effects suffered by the witness or the surrounding area close encounter two is one that leaves landing traces or injuries to the witness close encounter three entities observed on the ufo four is the witness is abducted and five is like the other fives results in permanent psychological injuries or death and then there&#x27;s the a n rating and rating classifies anomalous behavior one is anomalies which have no lasting physical effects two anomalies which do have lasting physical effects three anomalies with associated entities ghosts yeti spirits elves and other mythical legendary entities four is witness interaction with the am3 entities five is anomalous reports of injuries and deaths for instance spontaneous human combustion sounds like the drummers in spinal tap unexplained wounds as well as permanent healing that results from a paranormal experience so even as the sun&#x27;s foia was just honored by dod the pentagon has announced they&#x27;ve created a new dedicated unit that will explore ufos called the anomaly surveillance and resolution office their mission is to probe whether or not the strange craft that have been reportedly buzzing the us military are unknown technology from russia and china or potentially something more alien now as regular viewers of the channel know we&#x27;ve talked about ufos before and generally they fall into two categories one is like what we talked about in the area 51 episode which is there is a perfectly logical and reasonable explanation for ufo sightings in the case of area 51 it was the u2 and a12 programs and the second category is what we dealt with in the super hornet sightings episode and as we heard from alex dietrich these are things that cannot be explained by rational people so in terms of that category of sightings the unexplained ones as the pentagon announced the existence of the anomaly surveillance and resolution office they stated quote classified information exists that is highly pertinent to the subject and only a small part of that classified literature has been released end quote that&#x27;s awfully cryptic and sounds like there&#x27;s more to follow here so stay tuned all right that&#x27;s going to do it for this episode if you haven&#x27;t already please subscribe to my channel so you
