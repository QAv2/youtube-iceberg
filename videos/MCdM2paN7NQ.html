            <p>you will find that most of electromagnetic textbooks when they get to that point How does the energy flow in the circuit they actually do a very simple example or two show some simple calculations and then never say anything about it again now the pointing energy flow which is what it&#x27;s called is of course very well applied in things that radiate off into space but it has been very poorly applied in electric circuits and in fact for over 100 years there has been a continuing argument basically a gentlemanly argument amongst the electrodynamicist as to exactly what and how to apply for example they confuse different vectors the slepian vector the pointing vector and they&#x27;re still arguing over just exactly what energy flow in circuits are so I would just want to point out that the actual energy flow in a circuit is not well accounted for at all or well understood even today [Music]</p>
