            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>got an update for you guys revolving involving Trump&#x27;s disclosure date. The date has now supposedly been moved up to May 1st. And at the same time, we have more information coming. Well, not more information, more of a cover up coming out regarding the El Paso airport shutdown. So, what we have playing here is just some more of what&#x27;s common these days.</p>
<p>UAP footage being just released by random people online encounters all the time. This one, you know, when it&#x27;s got so this is actually a common one. This actually is you when you start to look at these videos, you know, years after years or having encounters with these things like I used to have, you f you find that there&#x27;s similarities and often times there some of the similarities are actually because it&#x27;s like the same people faking the same one or like one person made a fake AI video and it did so well that they they make them. But, you know, when you&#x27;ve actually experienced these things, you I&#x27;m not trying to talk from any like, you know, arrogant point or anything, but like when you&#x27;ve experienced them, when you&#x27;ve looked at them for so many years, you notice that there&#x27;s trends and then you can even kind of get a sense for when these things are legitimate. This one here was just posted online recently.</p>
<p>And it looks like it could be, it kind of looks like lanterns, but uh it also, this is something, this is a common one where you can see it diving like back and forth, zooming back and forth. So, it&#x27;s not lanterns. They&#x27;re not just floating, you know, off into the sky and disappearing or anything. They&#x27;re zigzagging back and forth. Literally, my first video I ever made on YouTube, which now is not on my channel, but uh maybe I&#x27;ll upload it to my Patreon.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s not good at all really. But one of the videos in it was this a very similar one to this years and years and years ago where it&#x27;s in the sky. It&#x27;s zigzagging back zigzagging back and forth. This is another one of the common sightings. Most commonly the most legit ones people see are the orbs.</p>
<p>But this is another one too. This was taken in Florida and Homestead Florida. Uh two Oh, sorry. This was 2023. I thought this one was recent.</p>
<p>But this is a common one that has been seen for years and years between 3 and 4:00 a.m. No surprise. That&#x27;s a lot of spiritual warfare going on at that time. And um yeah, so no surprise. Interesting stuff.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re getting more of this stuff time and time again. Uh this is just becoming more common now that people are seeing these all the time. Thanks, God&#x27;s child. God bless you, man. All glory to God.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m glad that you enjoy listening. I appreciate that. Yeah, they do feel different. And the real ones, they like they they have this like weird another another piece of, you know, just the evidence that we have connecting these things to the spiritual deceptions that they are is that it&#x27;s really like people are drawn to it when you see it. And when you see it, you&#x27;re almost like not mesmerized, but you&#x27;re just like, you know, it&#x27;s not supposed to be there.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s strange. If it was just a a a an advanced plane from a a different planet, you wouldn&#x27;t look up at this thing and know like you&#x27;re looking at something that like is like why is it there? It&#x27;s not normal. There&#x27;s something else to it. You can sense it. It really is.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s the same the same thing about how people start to you know gain these relationships with them where they summon them and it&#x27;s a common thing. So, we&#x27;ll get into some of the stuff now regarding the uh um you know, this is showing that this is a spiritual phenomenon, massive deception playing potentially into where we&#x27;re about to be where if Donald Trump really does reveal this thing on May 1st, we&#x27;ll see how he how he actually does. We&#x27;ll get into that here. But first, a little update on the whole um El Paso airport being shut down for 10 days because they shot down a weather a party balloon. I mean, come on.</p>
<p>No one&#x27;s buying that story. probably why they opened they reopened it. But as we&#x27;ll see, there&#x27;s even a section of airspace near El Paso that is still shut down for 10 days. So here, politician Senator Martin Henrik talking about this whole El Paso airport thing. Sorry, the audio kind of sucks, but it&#x27;s only 30 seconds.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I can tell you, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; is that at no time was El Paso under threat. the airport under threat and at no point was there a need to shut down the airport. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but like Pentagon now has lasers to take out drones. Like last I heard Pentagon didn&#x27;t know what they were &gt;&gt; at least over Langley. &gt;&gt; I I Yeah, I told you what I can tell you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That has been more of a development that we&#x27;ve gotten recently. Pentagon and Pentagon admits that we have advanced direct energy weapons. They&#x27;ve been using them, building them, and now advancing them, scaling them. And supposedly that&#x27;s what was used over El Paso because there was a party balloon. And instead of just investigating it, looking at radar, something like that, reports are coming out that the Pentagon decided to use one of their advanced laser weapons to shoot down the party balloon.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not even sure what they mean by party balloon. Is that like from a you know like a happy 3 years old party balloon? What exactly is that? Exact uh you know exactly it doesn&#x27;t make sense. Why are they using advanced extremely advanced energy weapons to take out balloons? There&#x27;s really something not adding up to this story and this post on X really adds more to that. So it says obviously talking about the FAA shutting down the airspace over a major airport. Not only that military base shut down for 10 days and the El Paso airport shut down for 10 days.</p>
<p>While the media media is talking about that and the argument between the FAA and the DoD, they completely ignore the second emergency restriction that went up on the same exact day when the El Paso airport restriction was lifted. This one was not. February 10th and 11th, FAA issued a shock national defense airspace alert grounding everything for 10 days. Chaos ensues supposedly. It sounds like this was kind of written by chat GPT a little bit.</p>
<p>Not all of it, but parts of it like that. The excuse, the first is that it was special security re reasons. The attorney general, Pam Bondi, claims it&#x27;s cartel drones. That&#x27;s what they said happened. We had that footage that I posted in my last video of it of what looked to be drones or lights near the airport.</p>
<p>Supposedly, they say that&#x27;s what eventually first shut it down. then leaked CBS an AP report saying that it was actually a party balloon that got zapped down by a laser during a secret DoD test. So the the Department of Defense is doing secret laser advanced military tests over airports and over cities like El Paso, Texas. That&#x27;s not adding up either causing an argument between the FAA and the Pentagon. The resolution they claimed was the threat was neutralized and lifted the ban on the city airspace.</p>
<p>They li they lifted the 10-day ban on the city airspace after 8 hours. Does it make sense to you that they would shut down a massive commercial corridor and ground military flights at Fort Bliss for 10 days because of a mylar balloon? No. You only have to ground the military if you don&#x27;t want them seeing something or if there is a risk of a midair collision with something. [clears throat] While everyone was looking at the airport, the FAA quietly issued a TFR 6-2234 just to the west. The status is still active as of February 12th, 2026.</p>
<p>The end date is February 21st, 2026. Matches the original 10day security window. There are the coordinates if you want to see for yourself. Target area, the East Portillo Mountains, Santa Teresa, New Mexico. This is not air uh airport airspace [laughter] airport airspace.</p>
<p>This is a specific block of airspace over the east Cordurillo Mountains, a rugged desolate area west of El Paso. The airport reopened, but this box remains sealed off. This is interesting if this is true. That airspace is still blocked for 10 days in this area of a rugged, you know, rugged mountain range. We can see a glimpse of it here.</p>
<p>Maybe they shot something down and it crashed over there. So they said, &quot;Okay, we can lift the ban over here in in the uh you know, the ban over here at the airport, but but this one here, they&#x27;re going to keep, you know, locked down because whatever they shot down crash landed over there. They don&#x27;t want people flying over seeing exactly what&#x27;s going on.&quot; Kind of like they don&#x27;t want you going to, you know, Antarctica and live streaming. Why? Well, because they&#x27;re covering something up. That&#x27;s the only reason you&#x27;re not allowed to look into things.</p>
<p>Cover up. Same exact reason why they came out recently and a couple months ago and said you got all the files there&#x27;s no more files files don&#x27;t exist. Oh here&#x27;s just a 3 million few documents we found cover up. So now we&#x27;re going to get into some of some of so here&#x27;s just a few other stories in regards to kind of all this stuff you know as as I watch for a disclosure because I believe there&#x27;s a massive deception associated with it. These things are evil.</p>
<p>Which is exactly why when you look at this thing here, what does it look like? It looks evil. This isn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t look like something God evolved on some other planet. I mean, look at every single pretty much every single animal on the earth besides the ones in the very bottom of the ocean. Like the babies of them, they&#x27;re all cute and they&#x27;re nice to look at. You look at this demon looking thing, it&#x27;s evil.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s cuz they are evil. So here&#x27;s what George Knapp is saying could be happening with some something in March in relation to disclosure. &gt;&gt; Bob driving around they age regress him I suppose and suddenly it it over time it morphed into a film and I know there have been a couple of times when it was announced it was going to be released and it looks like what March now it&#x27;s coming out. &gt;&gt; Yeah I&#x27;m not exactly sure. I mean you look you&#x27;re in the film.</p>
<p>I remember we went &gt;&gt; Bob driving around they age regress him I suppose. So UFO Mania is posting on X that they&#x27;re going to release more information of the Bob Lazar story confirming that it&#x27;s real. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re I think speculating that Trump is going to release in part of the disclosure that he&#x27;s going to do. Yeah, Brian, I was thinking the same thing about it was like is this like what&#x27;s this party balloon? Is it a spy balloon? Is it some sort of, you know, weaponized balloon or something like that? Like what exactly is a party balloon? And why are they using direct energy weapons over, you know, American cities to shoot this thing down? Not adding up. And again, the response of shutting down an airport for 10 days, that is just really not adding up.</p>
<p>So, I just wanted to play this video here before we look into some of the Trump new disclosure predictions that&#x27;s coming out and the news regarding that. This is from ProPixel Video Analysis and Research. Just they&#x27;re calling this a new class of UAP of a new type of UAP that is being spotted. They&#x27;re calling it an intercept class. Funny how just we start to give all these things um you know names and like the Galactic Federation and the Nordics and all this stuff when really we have no idea.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just it&#x27;s evil. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening. Um, so yeah, more of this all the time though. People are seeing these things, manifestations in the sky, people looking up to the heavens for answers. One day we&#x27;ll be looking up with fearful expectations of the things coming upon the earth.</p>
<p>Jesus told us that. It&#x27;s literally happening right now. Um, yeah, the Bible 100% real, 100% truth. Um, yeah, 10,00 couldn&#x27;t be more obvious. If you could study the scriptures and the prophecies proven in the Bible and still think it&#x27;s not true, you just cannot comprehend reality.</p>
<p>And I pray that anybody who is in that state that their eyes and their hearts their eyes would be clear, their hearts would be softened to the truth because I mean it&#x27;s just wow could not be more obvious. Nothing else in the world has proven prophecies like the Bible. Nothing else. Okay, so now here we have Trump&#x27;s UFO disclosure speech is ready to go. Press conference on May 1st in Washington will provide more information.</p>
<p>This is guy&#x27;s name is the king of UFOs or UFO Mark Christopher Lee. He was been posting about this. He was one of the guys who came out and said he had inside sources that Trump&#x27;s going to come out July 8th. I believe the day was to disclose UFOs. Now they&#x27;re saying this is the new day.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a little more information on it from Skywatch Signal on X. And whenever I whenever I read these tweets, this is not endorsements of these people&#x27;s pages. I probably disagree with all of them. Uh because a lot of them think these things are just evolved on other planets and flew here. But this is I&#x27;m just shouting out the people who actually posted the information.</p>
<p>So he he makes this post breaking Trump disclosure speech May 1st date confirmed. Press conference confirming details of the disclosure speech will take place on May 1st. The source will present the details. Lee told the Daily Mail that an adviser to the Trump administration told me that president has been given authority by the other major world leaders to make this announcement. Here&#x27;s this article here.</p>
<p>Uh this is on Joe Co. Donald Trump has groundbreaking UFO speech ready to go. insiders claim. He says that they uh the address would expose the truth of decades of evidence concerning unexplained aerial phenomenon materials recovered from alleged crash sites and military eyewitness accounts. Lee stated that Trump will confirm that forensic analysis of recovered off-world vehicles and non-human biologics has established their extraterrestrial origin.</p>
<p>and he has described the speech as the first official acknowledgement of this reality by any world leader. It makes you wonder, it really makes you wonder this phenomenon is not happening only in the United States. This type of thing is happening everywhere around the world. Many nations who do not have the same respectability that the United States have, why are they not coming out and giving us information? We just saw unweaponized Jeremy Corbel and George Knaps saying that they got some or have found or it&#x27;s been released UFO files in relation to Russia that has now been released. I&#x27;m sure China has information.</p>
<p>Why are none of these countries releasing the information and now the United States has the to be the first one. I don&#x27;t think they understand what&#x27;s going on. I don&#x27;t think they know. We see all these UFO hearings saying we have crashed crafts, non-human biologics, we have the aircrafts, but no information, no leaks, no other country saying that. You think at least one human being on the earth at this point would have gotten some sort of evidence, some sort of picture of a crash craft.</p>
<p>one of these beings on the earth. Harvard studies saying that these things live among us which now we&#x27;re starting to get into the reality which is that it&#x27;s most well that it&#x27;s some sort of spiritual evil that is in other realms coming into our realm. So on and so forth. It&#x27;s not things from other planets that are coming here. If that was the case, we&#x27;d have some more information.</p>
<p>The government would be m way more involved. They would be planning attacks. They&#x27;d be planning defenses. They wouldn&#x27;t be worrying about all the things they&#x27;re worrying about. They&#x27;d be worrying about literally a potential planet devast planet attack, planet destroying attack from an off-world civilization, which no one is doing.</p>
<p>There&#x27;d be more evidence of it. They don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on. And it&#x27;s because the restrainer hasn&#x27;t been lifted yet. When the restrainer is lifted, when the false prophet and the antichrist come on the scene and their deceptions that are associated with it, again, people looking to the heavens and fearful sights expectations, then these things will start to make a lot more sense to people. I fully believe that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen.</p>
<p>And this is a just a massive deception moving in this direction. So, supposedly Trump is going to be making this speech now on May 1st, not July 8th. We&#x27;ll see if that&#x27;s the truth. And if he does, we will have to heavily listen to that and see if Trump is just going to re release something like I&#x27;ve said before where he&#x27;s just makes it sound like the tech is ours. We know what&#x27;s going on just to try to scare these other nations cuz for sure they know what&#x27;s happening too there.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re seeing it in their tests. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re encountering it in their air in their military jet flight testing. It&#x27;s not just the United States that&#x27;s experiencing this. So Trump could literally just come out and say, &quot;This is ours. We know what&#x27;s going on.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s our tech. Don&#x27;t mess with us. Wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be a bad idea unless they have a more advanced tech than us and they want to challenge it or they start hitting these things, which they have been shooting Hellfire missiles and other missiles at these things for years and years. So, we&#x27;ll have to see exactly what Trump does when he says this, the type of information that comes out, and if we&#x27;ll actually get a true disclosure, which true disclosure would actually also identify these things as evil spiritual forces involving in different dimensions coming in and out and somehow playing into geopolitics and into the future and just also messing with just politics, with humanity, with deceiving. And then maybe even potentially one of them probably the false prophet because we know we know the antichrist will be a man.</p>
<p>The mark of the beast is associated with his number or with his name, the name of a man. But the false prophet or the forces behind it could be some off-world alien thing. Really a spiritual deception by Satan that is just manifested on the earth as a restrainer is lifted. That&#x27;s what I believe is going on here. We&#x27;ll have to see.</p>
<p>So this is the rumor. Jesus, lead us into all discernment. Give us the truth. You are the truth. This the truth sets us free.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t need degrees. You don&#x27;t need an insane amount of knowledge to understand this stuff. Jesus isn&#x27;t going to make it to where only people with the highest of IQ&#x27;s and 10 degrees understand what&#x27;s going on. It will be clear to the body of Christ worldwide. And so that&#x27;s why spiritual discernment is the most important thing here.</p>
<p>Not like we&#x27;ve studied all the books and looked at all the videos or something. Spiritual discernment. And I pray Jesus will give that all to us through his Holy Spirit, through God and through Jesus.</p>
