            <p>whoa whoa whoa is this actually right if Pi 4 + Pi 5 = e 6 then there must be a triangle with a hypotenuse of e to the 3r and two legs of pi to the 2 and pi to 2.5 and just so we&#x27;re clear these are actual numbers we&#x27;re dealing with pi is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle circumference to its diameter whereas e is an irrational number ul&#x27;s number and it&#x27;s actually the base of natural logarithms first let me review what I said before which is that based on this equation there is some right triangle with a hypotenuse of e to the 3r and two legs of pi to the 2 and pi to 2.5 but why am I saying that this isn&#x27;t the Pythagorean theorem after all the Pythagorean theorem is in the format of a^2 + b^2 = c^2 but our exponents are four 5 and six so how do these relate well we can actually rewrite pi to 4th as pk^ 2 to the 2 because a BX is equal to a b all to the X the same logic will apply for our PI to 5 and E to 6 so I guess we&#x27;re all clear now this is definitely a triangle right well actually no it&#x27;s not but it&#x27;s incredibly close</p>
