            <p>I like the sort of beings from the future hypothesis for a few reasons so there&#x27;s actually a concept in evolutionary biology called neotony where your distant Offspring looks like your kids currently and if you think about a lot of these sort of Close Encounters of the Third Kind they often are described as you know the beings are sort of childlike in nature if you think about how we&#x27;re actually evolving as a species our bodies are becoming somewhat vestigial you know we have an abundant amount of resources that are being distributed to us we don&#x27;t need them our apologies are going to change just wither away a little bit and then our brains are becoming actually more important decision making is becoming more important if we have any sort of latent intuitive Powers that&#x27;s going to be more important and these things are supposedly a little more telepathic their eyes are sort of slits you&#x27;re gonna you know have more screen time going forward and so it does feel like that&#x27;s kind of the way that we&#x27;re evolving</p>
