            <p>I mean actually just last night I was doing some calculations about how much energy it would take to create a one ton Tic Tac out of energy and it&#x27;s something like 10 to the 18 billion uh you know Hiroshima bombs is the amount of energy it would it would require to do that so if if they are creating it to them energy is a non-expendable uh so I mean Kevin n has shown I think quite convincingly that the objects that if they&#x27;re one ton and they&#x27;re moving from point A to point B at the acceleration and deceleration that they accomplish then you&#x27;re talking there about you know 1100 gaw of uh of energy um to do that I mean again that&#x27;s like the entire energy output of the planet for a year um so okay again to them energy seems a meaningless concept</p>
