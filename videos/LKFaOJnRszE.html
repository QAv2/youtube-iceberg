            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Hey guys, tonight we step into a world of swirling fog, cryptic ruins, and whispers that never made it into your school history books. You&#x27;re going to walk in boots too big for your feet, your fingers freezing, your breath, a ghost in the cold. Night air. World War II is ending. Or so the world believes.</p>
<p>But in the forests of Sicia, something impossible is still humming in the darkness. Something shaped like a bell. This isn&#x27;t your usual battlefield tale. No tanks, no generals, just a trail of strange disappearances, vanishing convoys, and a mysterious object code named Diglock the Bell. Some say it was a weapon.</p>
<p>Others think it was a time machine. Whatever it was, the Nazis wanted it badly. And tonight, so do you. Dot. Quick warning.</p>
<p>You probably won&#x27;t survive this. Not physically, anyway. your perception of history. Yeah, that&#x27;s going to get rattled. So, before you get comfortable, take a moment to like the video and subscribe, but only if you genuinely enjoy what I do here.</p>
<p>And hey, tell me in the comments where you&#x27;re watching from and what time it is. I love seeing the global bedtime crew check in down now. Dim the lights. Maybe turn on a fan for that soft background hum. And let&#x27;s ease into tonight&#x27;s journey together.</p>
<p>It begins with mist. You&#x27;re walking through a forest in lower CIA. The trees here are tall and thin like they&#x27;ve seen too much. Your boots squaltch through leaf mulched ground. Every step sinking a little deeper into the past.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re here, just that something drew you to this place. A whisper, a rumor. Maybe it was the broken down Jeep you found abandoned on the side of the road. Its tires slashed and its dash marked with an SS Eagle. Keys still in the ignition.</p>
<p>You move slowly. The wind carries the faint smell of ozone and wet metal. Then you hear it, a low hum. Dot. It vibrates in your ribs more than your ears like standing too close to a high voltage fence.</p>
<p>You pause by an ancient stone marker half swallowed by moss. There&#x27;s writing etched into it, but not in any language you recognize. Slavic Latin may be older, just ahead, nestled in the brush. A shape barely visible. You crouch, part the leaves.</p>
<p>A man he slumped against a tree, uniform torn, eyes wide open, but not seeing you. Blood crusts along his temple. A broken compass hangs from his neck. He&#x27;s still breathing, barely. You kneel beside him, unsure what to say, until he croaks a word.</p>
<p>Glock. Then another, less a word than a warning. Don&#x27;t touch it. And finally, they went inside. None came out.</p>
<p>Then he dies. Your breath clouds in the air. Something shifts behind you. A flicker, a pulse. You spin around, heart punching against your ribs.</p>
<p>Nothing but the humming grows louder. You keep walking. Something deep and irrational tells you not to turn back. There&#x27;s a path now, barely visible, etched by time or tires, or both. The trees begin to thin, and ahead you see a crumbling structure of concrete and rebar poking through like bones.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve reached Dice, the giant, one of Nazi Germany&#x27;s most secretive militaryindustrial complexes, buried in the Owl Mountains near the Czech border. Officially, it was an unfinished bunker network. Unofficially? Well, that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re here. The air is colder now, sharper, as if the forest knows. This place is wrong.</p>
<p>You duck beneath a rusted archway and enter what looks like a machine shop or did 80 years ago. Now it&#x27;s a skeleton of rusted bolts, cracked gauges, and a desk littered with waterlogged blueprints. You pick one up. Most of it smeared with mold, but in the corner, two words still linger in Gothic script. Chronotechnic girth.</p>
<p>Chrono tech. You keep going. At the back of the room is a hatch tilted at an odd angle like the ground beneath it shifted. A staircase spirals down. Of course it does.</p>
<p>You descend. Each step echoes longer than it should. Down here, time feels different. There&#x27;s no light except your flickering torch, and the air smells sterile like old antiseptic and battery acid. You pass old power cables lining the walls, coils of copper thicker than your wrist.</p>
<p>This wasn&#x27;t just a bomb shelter. This was a lab. A few doors in find a chamber with scorch marks on the walls and a metal rail built into the floor. In a perfect circle, a track, a containment ring in the center, something once stood. Something heavy that the humming is loud now, but not constant.</p>
<p>It pulses like breathing. You freeze. There&#x27;s someone else here. You spot movement, a silhouette darting past the far door. You chase it.</p>
<p>Heart racing, boots thuing over cracked tile. But when you round the corner, there&#x27;s nothing. Just an open chamber with ancient machinery lining the walls. All dead except one switch. It&#x27;s flipped on.</p>
<p>A single console still blinks with a dim red glow. And in the center of the room, what looks like a support cradle, empty but shaped like a massive bell. You sit on the edge of the cradle, suddenly tired. The silence presses in now. The hum is gone.</p>
<p>You try to piece things together. Historians have debated the final months of the war in Cisia for decades. Everyone agrees the Germans were hiding something in these mountains, but no one agrees on what Allied pilots reported strange lights above the forests. Locals talked of unnatural vibrations that made animals flee. American recon photos showed rail lines leading to nowhere.</p>
<p>Some believe it was just paranoia. Some say it was diglock. The Bell, a top secret Nazi experiment involving exotic energy sources, magnetic fields, and depending who you ask, either anti-gravity or time travel, or both. You know one thing. You&#x27;ve found the place.</p>
<p>This is where it happened. And that hum. You&#x27;re not imagining it. Not even now. Your torch flickers.</p>
<p>You glance up. There&#x27;s writing on the ceiling, faded, barely visible under years of soot and grime. You step up on the cradle and wipe it off with your sleeve. More gothic script. Norzite is dye grins.</p>
<p>Only time is the boundary. Well, that&#x27;s comforting. You hop back down. Suddenly, you notice a metal panel under your boot. You pry it open.</p>
<p>Dot. Inside a small object, cold, smooth, and oddly heavy for its size. It&#x27;s a piece of the bell&#x27;s casing. You know it instantly. engraved with arcane symbols, not swastikas, not runes, something older.</p>
<p>Holding it makes your vision blur for half a second. You drop it. Footsteps. Real this time. You freeze.</p>
<p>A man steps into the doorway. Tall, thin, wearing a uniform that hasn&#x27;t been issued since 1945. SS Black. You blink and he&#x27;s gone. You stagger out of the chamber, up the stairs, into the forest, clutching the artifact.</p>
<p>You look back. The bunker entrance is gone. You spin in circles, heart pounding. But there&#x27;s nothing behind you now. Just trees, just mist, as if Dreeze never existed.</p>
<p>Or you slipped somewhere else. The artifact in your hand hums quietly. Still warm, still alive. You think of the soldier&#x27;s final words. They went inside.</p>
<p>None came out. You&#x27;re not sure where you are anymore, but it&#x27;s too late to go back. And you&#x27;re only just beginning. You don&#x27;t remember falling asleep. But now you&#x27;re awake, curled beneath a tree you don&#x27;t recognize.</p>
<p>Your coat damp from dew. The forest looks the same, but different, quieter. Your breath comes out and puffs like little clouds trying to float away before they see too much. The artifact digs shard is still clenched in your fist. It hums like an insect trying not to get noticed.</p>
<p>You check your watch. It&#x27;s not moving. That&#x27;s probably fine. Dot. Not at all disturbing.</p>
<p>You push yourself to your feet and squint through the treeine. There&#x27;s a structure in the distance. A squat. Angular building partially buried in the earth. You recognize the style instantly.</p>
<p>Nazi bunkers always had that same miserable charm. Harsh lines, no windows, zero curb appeal. You make your way toward it. Boots sinking slightly into the muddy earth with each step. Inside it&#x27;s dry, musty filing cabinets line the walls like coffins for secrets.</p>
<p>One drawer caks open, revealing documents sealed in wax and marked Reich&#x27;s ministerium. Farbby Wuanong undemunition. You can&#x27;t read most of the German, but the drawings catch your eye. Dot schematics dot of weapons that never existed. Rockets, discs, something that looks suspiciously like a Tesla coil married a flying saucer in the margins.</p>
<p>Scribbled notes. Project Kronisree Lantraetan rotation inner a mantle. That last one. Chrono rotation of the inner shell. A chill climbs your spine.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not just looking at weapons. You&#x27;re looking at time machines. It&#x27;s 1943 now. You don&#x27;t know how you know, but you do. And while you&#x27;re mentally doing back flips over that little twist, we&#x27;re going to take a pause and rewind a little.</p>
<p>Not time travel. Don&#x27;t worry. Leave that to the suspiciously glowing hardware. Let&#x27;s talk about Nazi science. No, seriously, let&#x27;s talk about the absolute madness of what was going on behind the scenes in Germany during the war.</p>
<p>Yes, we all know about the V2 rockets, the jet aircraft, even the beginnings of missile guidance systems. Those were real, tangible. Wernern von Braonn&#x27;s work alone pushed the world decades forward in rocket propulsion. But beneath all that, something darker, something stranger. The Nazis weren&#x27;t just trying to win a war.</p>
<p>They were trying to rewrite the rules of reality itself. Between 1939 and 1945, an entire secret branch of the SS known as the Anenabas, tasked with researching ancient knowledge, fringe physics, and occult symbols they believed were the key to super weapons. This wasn&#x27;t a side project, had its own budget, staff, and Himmler&#x27;s direct obsession. They weren&#x27;t satisfied with bullets and bombs. They wanted gravity, time, life.</p>
<p>You leave the bunker with your arms full of dusty files, some featuring diagrams so complex they look like the nervous system of a very anxious robot. Others just lists of names. Many are crossed out. A few have the word vers such person next to them. Test subject.</p>
<p>As you walk, it all starts making sense. Well, sort of. See, the Nazi fascination with wonder miracle weapons was more than desperation. It was ambition wrapped in madness. Take the Vil society for instance.</p>
<p>They believed a hidden energy source. Vril flowed through the universe and could be harnessed by the mind. Yes, that&#x27;s right. Mindpowered spacecraft. It sounds like a bad comic book plot, but some historians believe this was the philosophical route of Diglock.</p>
<p>You shake your head, still not convinced. Then you remember the buzzing chunk of bell metal in your pocket. And yeah, maybe comic books were on to something. You hike further uphill now. The terrain feels purposeful, like it was carved into the side of the owl mountains with secrets in mind.</p>
<p>Eventually, you reach a viewing platform overgrown with weeds. Below you can just make out a massive circular formation perfectly symmetrical concrete pillars radiating outward like a stone crown. You&#x27;re looking at the henge and no not the British one. This is Poland&#x27;s henge. Locals call it the fly trap and for good reason.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s one of the last standing pieces of the diglock puzzle. Historians argue about what it was used for. Some say a cooling tower. Others claim a test stand for vertical lift engines. And then there are the weirdos who say it was a landing pad.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re going to love this. It might have been all of the above. You climb down through the trees until you&#x27;re standing under its concrete ribs. Up close, it feels like standing beneath the skeleton of some enormous long deadad creature. Birds, avoid it.</p>
<p>Your compass spins. The metal in your pocket starts to buzz harder. So, of course, you stay there longer than you should because curiosity. Yeah, it&#x27;s your fatal flaw. Suddenly, a voice dot you spin.</p>
<p>No one, just trees and a soft click like a real torial recorder starting up. You glance to your right. There sitting on a mossy stump is an old tape recorder. You don&#x27;t question it. You hit play.</p>
<p>A German voice crackles to lifecom clinical. The kind of tone you use when pretending human test subjects aren&#x27;t people. Test for subject exposure to high frequency oscillation. Duration 32 seconds. Result: cellular disintegration.</p>
<p>Within threshold, subject remains conscious for full duration. Further study required. You press stop. You regret pressing play because remains conscious should never be in the same sentence as disintegration. You step back from the recorder, your foot catching on something half buried in the dirt.</p>
<p>A toolbox dot known, not a toolbox, a liel lined case. Inside delicate instruments, a radiation dosimter, a pair of cracked goggles, a notebook with notes in three different handwritings, and a simple drawing of a bell hovering in midair. The caption below it says, &quot;Phase shift unstable. Anchors failed. Partial dissolution observed.&quot; You&#x27;re beginning to understand why this thing was buried and why they kept trying.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s zoom out for a moment. Mainstream historians do acknowledge the Diglock rumor, but most dismiss it as a cold war fever dream. The only documented mention came from Polish journalist Igor Vitkowski, who claimed to have seen secret SS transcripts detailing the bell&#x27;s experiments. He described it as a device encased in a ceramic shell 5 m high filled with two counterrotating cylinders and a mysterious purple fluid called zerum 525. According to the files, it was tested underground.</p>
<p>It killed birds, blackened plants, made time do weird things, and yes, some say it caused people to vanish. So yeah, just your average weather balloon. Right back to you. You move toward the center of the hench, standing exactly where the bell would have hovered if it was here. And if it did hover, you close your eyes.</p>
<p>The humming returns dot low, constant. This time it&#x27;s inside your head. You open your eyes and you&#x27;re no longer under the henge. You&#x27;re inside. A lab got clean, bright, cold.</p>
<p>You can feel the static tingle of electricity in the air. Men in lab coats bustle around you. An officer shouts something in clipped German. There at the center of the room die gl doted spinning suspended between steel arms glowing softly. Your breath catches.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s beautiful and horrifying like a cathedral and a weapon had a baby. You take one step forward and the world snaps back. You&#x27;re in the forest again. Your legs buckle. You fall.</p>
<p>The shard in your pocket is silent now. Dead or sleeping. You crawl to your feet and stagger away from the henge. Your shaking not from cold, but from the creeping suspicion that this isn&#x27;t just a story anymore. That dialock isn&#x27;t a relic.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s an echo, a ripple still moving forward. You remember something else you read in those documents. Nicked and fascination. Do not touch during active rotation. Yeah.</p>
<p>Noted. As you walk, the forest changes again. Same trees, different feeling. You pass an old road with tire ruts worn deep into the mud in the distance. The sound of a truck engine and boots marching.</p>
<p>The year you realize might not be 1943 anymore. Or maybe it still is. Either way, you&#x27;ve just walked straight into the past and history. She&#x27;s wide awake. You drop flat behind a tree just before they spot you.</p>
<p>Marching boots, clanking metal, and an unmistakable shout, &quot;Halt!&quot; You&#x27;re not exactly dressed for the 1940s. The waterproof zipper on your jacket probably hasn&#x27;t been invented yet, so yeah, blending in isn&#x27;t an option. You hold your breath as a German officer with a clipboard walks by, followed by two soldiers escorting someone in handcuffs. A scientist maybe the man&#x27;s coat is too clean. His glasses fogged.</p>
<p>His expression absolutely not here for it. You hear another voice commer deeper. Warner von Braonn dot. Yes, that von Braun dot. The man who dreamed of moon landings while building weapons of war.</p>
<p>The man whose work would power the Apollo missions, but only after helping build V2 rockets that killed thousands. He&#x27;s not wearing an SS uniform. Not exactly, but he&#x27;s in the middle of all this. His tone clinical, bored, precise. You creep closer, hard hammering until you&#x27;re near enough to hear his words.</p>
<p>We are not chasing the war effort. We are chasing physics. Let them worry about bombs that tracks. Dot. Von Brown always insisted he was just an engineer.</p>
<p>Even while working for the most terrifying regime in modern history, the convoy moves off toward a cluster of camouflaged buildings tucked into the slope of the hill. You follow at a distance, weaving through trees and ducking beneath netting that hangs from rusted poles like torn spiderwebs. You slip inside one of the buildings, a lab immediately regret it. The room reeks of formaldahhide and scorched copper specimen jars line the walls. Some of the contents might once have been animals.</p>
<p>Some of them might not dot in the center of the lab is a prototype of something familiar. Die Glock&#x27;s outer shell. A polished ceramic skin. Seamless. No rivets.</p>
<p>No obvious seams. Not even a hatch. How did anyone get inside? Did they? Let&#x27;s talk about von Brown for a second. Wernern Magnus Maximleian Fryhair. Von Brown, say that five times fast, was born in 1912.</p>
<p>A brilliant young mind who got into rocket science by strapping fireworks to toy cars. Not even kidding. His obsession with propulsion led him to the German army&#x27;s rocket program in the 1930s. Dot. By the time World War II started, von Braonn was already the technical director of Pinamoon, Germany&#x27;s secret research facility for ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s where the infamous V2 rocket was developed. The world&#x27;s first long range guided ballistic missile. It also happened to be the same place where thousands of forced laborers died building those rockets. Von Braonn joined the S in 1940. Later, when captured by American forces, he said it was just for show.</p>
<p>Historians still argue whether von Braonn was a prisoner of circumstance, a brilliant opportunist, or fully complicit. One thing is clear, without him, the Nazis would never have made the technological leaps they did. And without those leaps, you wouldn&#x27;t be watching rockets launch from Cape Canaveral today. Fun, right? Back to the lab. You step closer to the ceramic shell.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s something wrong with it. The surface almost shimmers like heat waves on a summer road. You blink. For a second, you&#x27;re not looking at a bell anymore. You&#x27;re looking at an hourglass.</p>
<p>Then it snaps back. Just a trick of the light. Maybe you hear a ticking sound. Not from the bell, from the wall. A geer counter.</p>
<p>The needle is dancing softly at first, then harder. You back away fast. A voice interrupts the quiet. You shouldn&#x27;t be in here. You turn.</p>
<p>A man stands at the doorway tall. Balding glasses glinting in the low light. He&#x27;s wearing a lab coat with the name Dr. Kurt Deuce stitched onto the front. Another name from history.</p>
<p>Another mind caught between science and the war machine. Debus was Von Braonn&#x27;s right hand. Later he&#x27;d help run NASA&#x27;s launch operations, but right now he&#x27;s pointing at you. I&#x27;ve never seen you. Who sent you? You stammer something about a transfer order.</p>
<p>Experimental oversight. Code clearance every lie you can string together in three panicked seconds. Debus narrows his eyes. Then you know what this is. He points to the bell.</p>
<p>You nod. Then you lie again. I worked on the Zurich test array. He pauses. nods dot just slightly.</p>
<p>Then he turns and walks away. Either he believed you or you&#x27;ve just been flagged. You leave the lab as fast as you can without running. Back outside. Trucks roll past, loaded with metal crates and barrels marked with a strange symbol.</p>
<p>Two overlapping rings surrounding a triangle. You recognize it from your earlier visions. It&#x27;s the symbol used in those alleged transcripts discovered by Vitkosski. Historians argue about its origin. Some say it was real SS iconography.</p>
<p>Others believe it was invented later, a mashup of vill and esoteric alchemical symbols. Still, there it is. Dot real tangible painted in thick black lines on crates of something marked X525, the rumored fuel for Diglock. What was Zerum 525? No one knows. According to legend, it was a glowing violet substance stored in lead containers, highly radioactive, unstable, and crucial to die.</p>
<p>Glock&#x27;s function. Some believe it was a modified isotope of mercury. Others think it involved thorium or red mercury. A cold war boogeyman so mysterious it might not exist at all. What&#x27;s undeniable is that something was placed inside the bell.</p>
<p>something that made metal corrode. Animals drop dead and time behave weirdly. You sneak closer to one of the crates. It&#x27;s cold to the touch despite the summer air. You lean in.</p>
<p>The humming is back. Faint, hypnotic. Your fingers twitch. You almost open the crate. Almost suddenly, alarms shouting, a siren, tears through the air like a buzzsaw.</p>
<p>Soldiers scatter. Scientists grab notebooks and sprint. You duck behind a halftrack as search lights flick on. You catch a word sabotage and another test compromised. Smoke billows from a tower nearby.</p>
<p>Through the chaos, you spot a figure running toward the woods. Hands bound lab coat flapping. It&#x27;s the scientist from earlier. The prisoner you follow because of course you do. You catch up to him just before he collapses in a dry creek bed.</p>
<p>You help him up. He stares at you like a drowning man who hasn&#x27;t decided if you&#x27;re a rope or a rock. Did you come through it? You hesitate. Through what? His eyes widen. The bell.</p>
<p>It showed me. I think it showed me you. So that&#x27;s comforting. His name is Elias. He&#x27;s Austrian.</p>
<p>A physicist drafted to work under Deuce. claims he was part of the inner chamber team. Only five scientists were allowed access. He pulls something from his kod torn page equations, diagrams, and a note that reads, &quot;Temporal displacement detected. Coordinates shifting.</p>
<p>You ask him what it means.&quot; He laughs softly. Sadly, it means we didn&#x27;t build a weapon. We built an escape hatch. Then he passes out. You&#x27;re left holding the page and staring back at a facility unraveling behind you.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s recap. You&#x27;ve now met Von Braonn Deoose and Aliasa, possibly time-sensitive Austrian physicist. You&#x27;ve handled the artifact, hallucinated the bell, and learned that its mysterious fuel source is likely radioactive enough to cause permanent hair loss and a new religion. Oh, and according to Elias, Diglock may have been designed not to win the war, but to abandon it. What would that even mean? To run from time to eject yourself from history.</p>
<p>And where do you go when you do that? Those questions echo in your skull as you sit beneath the trees. Elias unconscious beside you, clutching a page of calculations that might just be the blueprint to a machine that folds the universe. One thing&#x27;s clear. You&#x27;re in this now. Whether you walked in or were pulled and whatever Dlock was meant to do, it may not be finished.</p>
<p>Not yet. You wake to bird song. Dot not cheerful. Disney princess bird song. This is the suspicious kind.</p>
<p>The kind that sounds too rehearsed, too loud, like it&#x27;s trying to convince you this forest is normal. Elias is gone. Of course he is. In his place, a shallow impression in the dirt. a few broken twigs and the torn page of calculations you found last night.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s been folded into a paper dart and aimed at your chest. That&#x27;s either a message or a prank, and honestly, you&#x27;re not sure which you&#x27;d prefer. You stand, stretch, and squint toward the horizon. In the daylight, the owl mountains look peaceful, almost postcardw worthy rolling green hills, lazy pine shadows, soft summer haze. But you know better now because beneath this picturesque landscape lies one of the darkest and weirdest layers of World War II.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Wesless mine complex.org as the locals called it. Disease the giant. This isn&#x27;t a regular mine. This place was never about coal. It was about concealment.</p>
<p>The Germans told locals it was a mine. They even bust in miners for show, but they were mining secrecy. What they were really doing was building an underground labyrinth. Massive reinforced tunnels bored into granite full of sealed chambers, power conduits, and if the rumors are true, a lot of things that weren&#x27;t supposed to survive above ground. You make your way toward one of the access shafts.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s partially collapsed. Metal girders twisted like licorice sticks. You cidle through a gap just wide enough for a regretful adult and descend by t o r c h l i g ht dot. It&#x27;s colder down here, wetter to dot the walls sweat, which is not unsettling at all. Let&#x27;s take a second to appreciate how committed the Nazis were to this secrecy game.</p>
<p>By late 1944, Allied bombers had turned large swads of Germany into gravel. So the Reichkes started burying everything they didn&#x27;t want bombed. Entire weapons programs were moved underground aircraft assembly lines, rocket research facilities, even synthetic fuel plants. But dur was something else. No records survived.</p>
<p>Even the Soviet troops who stumbled on it postwar didn&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;d found on. In fact, modern historians still argue about it. Some say it was a decoy overbuilt, underused, more psychological than practical. Others believe it was the central node for the SS&#x27;s most secret research, including a project so sensitive that everyone involved was either executed or vanished. Guess which side of the debate you&#x27;re on now.</p>
<p>You reach a sealed door deep underground. It&#x27;s scorched, dented, and covered in faded chalk markings. You recognize some of the symbols, the same ones etched into the bell fragment you&#x27;re still carrying, which by the way is getting warmer. That&#x27;s new. With a grunt, you force the door open and step into a chamber that feels wrong.</p>
<p>Not dangerous, just off like someone made a room based on a dream they couldn&#x27;t quite remember. It&#x27;s round two round. No seams, no corners, just smooth metal and soft humming lights embedded in the floor like stars trapped beneath glass. And at the center, the cradle, the real one this time. It&#x27;s here, empty, but unmistakable.</p>
<p>This is where Diglock lived. You step closer. The air grows heavier, as if history itself is pushing back. A faint crackle of electricity dances across your fingertips. Your breath fogs despite the warmth.</p>
<p>Then behind you colon footsteps dot slow measured dot U-turn expecting Elias. It&#x27;s not Elias, it&#x27;s someone else, it&#x27;s someone else. An officer SS uniform pressed and spotless but old way to old. His face pale, gaunt, his eyes sharp. Something about him is off modal, like a bad copy of a real person.</p>
<p>His voice is dry paper. You&#x27;re not supposed to be here. You say nothing because honestly, what would you even say? He takes a step closer. The bell chose when to move, not where. You blink.</p>
<p>You blink again. He&#x27;s gone. Because apparently that&#x27;s just something people do down here. Now you sit on the cradle. Why not? You&#x27;ve seen hallucinations, documents, impossible flashbacks, glowing fuel rods, and now an elderly Nazi hologram, or maybe ghost.</p>
<p>Who even knows? You need a minute. You remember what Elias said that Diglock wasn&#x27;t a weapon. It was an escape hatch. That the bell might not have been designed to fight the war, but to abandon it. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine why.</p>
<p>By 1944, the Nazis were losing badly. The allies were pushing from the west, the Soviets from the east. Germany was being squeezed like an overripe fruit. But if you were in the inner circle, one of the favored few, maybe you didn&#x27;t plan to stick around for the collapse. Maybe you planned to skip town or time.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s bring in a weird historical footnote. Dot. Near the end of the war, there were reports of a secret convoy leaving the lower SIA region in the dead of night. No lights, heavy escort, headed toward the Alps. It was never found.</p>
<p>Witnesses say it vanished into a snowstorm. Some say it was carrying dialogue. Others claim the bell was already gone. No trucks needed. And then there&#x27;s the matter of the Kronos protocol.</p>
<p>Supposedly, an emergency plan drafted by SS scientists in case of catastrophic failure on the front lines. A one-way operation. Destination unknown. If true, it implies the bell wasn&#x27;t just built, it was used. You run your hands over the cradle&#x27;s edge.</p>
<p>There are scratch marks. Someone struggled here. Not against the machine, but against leaving. Back in the hallway, you hear whispers, echoes, nothing you can track. A door slams somewhere.</p>
<p>In the distance, you follow the sound deeper into the mine into a room marked for Such&#x27;s camber test chamber. The doors rusted half shut, but you wedge it open. Dot. Inside photographs dot taped to the walls, dozens of them, black and white, faded, all of the same subject. The bell, sometimes standing still, sometimes glowing, sometimes blurred, moving faster than the shutter speed, and always hovering dot below each photo.</p>
<p>a date. Some from 1944, some from 1945, and then at the bottom, one from 1952. That&#x27;s impossible unless it&#x27;s not. You leave through nearby notebooks. These aren&#x27;t official logs.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re personal notes scrolled by someone who clearly didn&#x27;t sleep much. One entry catches your eye. It didn&#x27;t stop when the test ended. It shifted. Every time we power it, it shifts further.</p>
<p>The rats don&#x27;t come back. The plants return aged. Another page almost torn. Du says we can&#x27;t stabilize the field. Von Braonn wants to scrap it.</p>
<p>Himmler wants to ride it into the stars. God help us. And then a final scribble. We left it running last night. This morning the cradle was empty.</p>
<p>We didn&#x27;t turn it off. You shiver because that&#x27;s not just a glitch in the schedule. That&#x27;s a departure. You hear footsteps again. This time you don&#x27;t turn.</p>
<p>You know better now. They&#x27;ll be gone when you look. Instead, you walk calmly toward the far door. It leads to a freight elevator. You hit the button.</p>
<p>Dot. It groans. Dot. Descends. Dot.</p>
<p>Slowly. This thing hasn&#x27;t moved in decades, but somehow it knows you&#x27;re here. At the bottom, a final chamber bigger than the others, lit by ancient bulbs, still glowing faintly. Their wires hum with power, fed by generators no one remembers to turn off. And at the center, a second cradle dot empty newer dot untouched waiting.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t sit in this one. Not yet. You reach into your coat and pull out the shard. Still warm, still humming. It fits perfectly into a small socket near the base.</p>
<p>The machine reacts instantly, a soft light, a hum that resonates deep in your bones. The air feels thinner or thicker or elsewhere. You realize something then you haven&#x27;t been following. Diglock. You&#x27;ve been reinstalling it, reconnecting it, maybe even reactivating it.</p>
<p>The bell isn&#x27;t gone. It&#x27;s waiting. And now, so are you. You stay very, very still. The chamber breathes.</p>
<p>Not literally, of course, but it feels alive now, like you woke something up. The shard glows faintly inside the socket, pulsing with a rhythm that&#x27;s almost a heartbeat. The cradle&#x27;s edge vibrates beneath your fingers, and for the briefest moment, you think you hear music. Or maybe it&#x27;s just electricity whining in its cage. Either way, you&#x27;ve activated something.</p>
<p>And now you have a choice. Step into the cradle and see where this goes or leave. But you already know the answer because you&#x27;ve come too far for half dash truths and you&#x27;ve got too many questions. Questions like who built the bell really? Where did Elias go? What was the Kronos Protocol&#x27;s actual destination? And why does this entire underground facility feel like it was waiting for you? You step in and the cradle accepts you. The hum intensifies.</p>
<p>Lights flicker somewhere deep in the walls. Gears shift. You can&#x27;t see them, but you feel them the same way you feel a train coming before you hear it. A low vibration crawling up your spine, rattling your mers like a warning from the future. And then snap dot like someone slammed shut 100 filing cabinets at once.</p>
<p>Everything stops. No sound, no breath, no heartbeat. You blink and you&#x27;re not underground anymore. You&#x27;re standing in a white room, ceiling less. Endless a endless a soft horizon that curves gently up and around like you&#x27;re inside the world&#x27;s most pretentious art installation.</p>
<p>Your body feels weightless, like a dream just before waking then a voice.com.familiar. You arrived later than expected. You spin. Dot. It&#x27;s Elias, but not the same Elias.</p>
<p>This version is calm, clean, collected, hair combed, lab coat spotless. He looks dot dot dot older. Not in years, but in wisdom, like he&#x27;s finished a puzzle. You&#x27;re just beginning. Don&#x27;t panic.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re in a transition state. You ask him where here is. Nowhere and everywhere. This is the interstitial. Okay, that clears nothing up.</p>
<p>Thanks, Elias. He gestures to a nearby platform and with a wave conjures a table made of light. Blueprints appear rotating, shifting, displaying impossible machinery and star maps that rewrite themselves in real time. The bell is almost like stepping through a doorway. In the center of the clearing stands a weathered stone monument, half swallowed by creeping moss and tangled vines.</p>
<p>Its surface is rough and pitted, etched with cryptic symbols that send a shiver down your spine. You can&#x27;t fully decipher the strange glyphs, but some are familiar. Nazi runes mixed with obscure mathematical equations, brushes past them. You kneel and brush away frost to trace your fingers over the cold stone, feeling the rough texture beneath your skin. There&#x27;s a weight to this monument and eerie gravitas born of forgotten rituals and dark knowledge.</p>
<p>Your mind flickers back to all those whispered theories about the Nazi regime&#x27;s obsession with occultism. How some believed their technological advances were fueled by rituals that transcended science. Scholars argue endlessly about the extent of this mysticism. Was it mere propaganda to intimidate enemies? Or was there something darker, real, and dangerous lurking beneath? Sorcery blurs. Some suggest Diglock was not just a machine, but a convergence point where technology and occult rituals intertwined, designed to harness powers beyond the physical world.</p>
<p>The thought sends a chill down your spine. Could this cold clearing be a nexus where those ambitions reached their peak? Your eyes wander to the snow-covered ground, and you notice faint footprints circling the monument boots, unlike any standard military pattern. They form a pattern that feels almost ritualistic, deliberate, as if some secret society or a cult group had gathered here to perform ceremonies long erased from official history. You kneel and trace the prince, the snow crisp and untouched, except for this solitary mark. Your curiosity deepens.</p>
<p>Were the Bells scientists dabbling in forbidden knowledge? Did they believe that science alone wasn&#x27;t enough to control the terrifying power of time? A low rumble builds in the distance clouds rolling in. Thick and heavy, blotting out the weak winter sun. Snowflakes begin to drift lazily downward, frosting the landscape a new. Can&#x27;t see, but feel nonetheless. The ticking in your pendant quickens.</p>
<p>A warning or encouragement. It&#x27;s impossible to tell. One thing is clear. The path ahead is fraught with mystery, danger, and revelations that could shatter everything. You thought you knew about the war, science, and time itself.</p>
<p>You inhale deeply, the cold air filling your lungs, sharp and invigorating. A strange calm settles over you even as the forest seems to close in tighter. Shadows gathering like whispers on the edge of hearing. Somewhere out there, hidden beneath layers of snow and secrecy, the next piece of this impossible puzzle waits as you stand. The wind picks up again, scattering frostbitten leaves and stirring the low branches above.</p>
<p>You pull your coat tighter, feeling the steady warmth of the ticking pendant against your chest, a lifeline in a world unmed from time, your footsteps resume, slow and deliberate, into the deepening shadows of the forest, carrying you toward the heart of a secret too dangerous to ignore. You push further into the dense forest, each step muffled by the thick blanket of fresh snow. The trees tower like silent sentinels, their branches heavy with frost, dripping tiny icicles that glisten in the muted light. The air is sharp and crisp, filling your lungs with a biting cold that makes your cheeks sting pleasantly. Despite the chill, there&#x27;s an odd warmth growing in your chest.</p>
<p>A mixture of anticipation and unease. This place steeped in silence and mystery feels like the crossroads of time itself. Your pendant pulses softly against your skin. A quiet rhythm that seems to synchronize with the whisper of the wind through the pines. It&#x27;s as if the bell&#x27;s lingering energy still hums in the air, guiding you deeper into its tangled past.</p>
<p>You remind yourself of the rumors that swirled during the war tales of Nazi scientists who weren&#x27;t just engineers, but seekers of forbidden knowledge, blending cuttingedge physics with ancient arcane practices. Historians still debate how seriously the Nazi leadership took these occult experiments. Some claim it was all elaborate deception designed to distract and intimidate. Others believe that underneath the propaganda was a genuine obsession with harnessing supernatural power to win the war. Here, amid these forgotten woods, the boundary between myth and reality feels blurred, almost tangible.</p>
<p>As you navigate a narrow ridge, your boots slipping occasionally on ice hidden beneath the snow. You catch sight of something unusual, a small, almost invisible doorway carved into the rock face, partially concealed by creeping ivy and snowdrifts. The entrance is narrow and dark, framed by strange symbols carved deep into the stone. You hesitate, heartpounding, wondering what secrets lie beyond that threshold. You recall stories of secret underground facilities, hidden labs, and tunnels carved beneath the mountains.</p>
<p>Places where the bell&#x27;s experiments were said to have taken place. These were sites that never appeared on any map, erased from official records, existing only in whispers and halftruths. Could this be one of them? You reach out, brushing aside the snow and ivy to expose the cold stone surface. The symbols here seem to pulse faintly under your touch. A subtle glow that you didn&#x27;t notice before.</p>
<p>The pendant at your throat quickens its rhythm, almost urging you to step inside. Taking a deep breath, you push open the heavy door. It groans on ancient hinges, revealing a dark passage leading down into the mountains cold, silent heart. The air inside is stale, but carries the faint metallic scent of forgotten machinery and oil. Your footsteps echo softly as you descend.</p>
<p>Each step stirring the dust of decadesl long abandonment. Deeper and deeper you go until the passage opens into a vast chamber walls lined with pipes and control panels, rusted yet eerily intact. Faint blue lights flicker on cracked screens, casting ghostly glows on the machinery that once hummed with terrifying power. Here at the core of Project Kronos, you feel the weight of countless secrets pressing down on you. You trace your fingers over a control panel, cold and lifeless now, but still etched with indecipherable codes and numbers.</p>
<p>You wonder about the scientists who stood here, their minds racing with dreams of controlling time, of bending reality to their will. What drove them? Was it ambition, desperation, madness, or something darker still? The silence is broken only by the steady ticking of your pendant. A small beacon of life in this forgotten tomb. You realize that you&#x27;ve stepped into a place where science and legend collid place where history&#x27;s fragile thread was pulled dangerously taught. Dot.</p>
<p>You move further into the chamber, eyes adjusting to the dim light. There&#x27;s a heavy metallic scent-like iron mixed with the sharp temps of ozone lingering in the cold air. Machines loom over you, hulking giants of brass and steel, their purposes inscrable, but clearly powerful. Some are dented and warped. Others look as if they might roar back to life at any moment.</p>
<p>You spot a large cylindrical device dominating the center of the room, probably the heart of Diglock itself. Its surface is covered in strange markings, and you can almost feel the hum of energy that once coursed through it. Theories abound. Some say it was designed to generate intense electromagnetic fields strong enough to warp space and time. Others believe it was a generator for something far more sinister.</p>
<p>Perhaps even a gateway to alternate realities. As you circle the chamber, you find a rusted locker hanging open, revealing faded notebooks and yellowed documents. You carefully pick up one, its brittle pages filled with scrolled formulas, diagrams, and notes in German. The handwriting is hurried but precise. A scientist&#x27;s desperate attempt to capture fleeting breakthroughs before they slipped away.</p>
<p>One passage catches your eye. a warning about temporal instability and reality distortions that could have catastrophic effects if the machine were operated improperly. The author hints at strange occurrences, time loops, sudden disappearances, even hallucinations experienced by the staff. Was this a machine or something far more dangerous? A tool that could fracture the very flow of time? Historians argue whether any of these claims hold water. with many dismissing them as wartime propaganda or the ravings of overworked scientists.</p>
<p>Yet here you stand, surrounded by evidence that feels far too real to ignore. The boundary between myth and fact blurs in the flickering light of this forgotten lab. A sudden clatter echoes through the chamber, making you start. You glance around only shadows and silence greet you. Your heart hammers, but the pendant ticks steadily anchoring you.</p>
<p>Whatever this place is, it&#x27;s alive with memories, waiting for you to listen. You settle on a rusted bench and allow yourself a moment to absorb the weight of it all. The cold seeps into your clothes, but your mind races faster than ever. Each discovery here twists history&#x27;s narrative, revealing layers hidden beneath decades of carefully crafted stories. the war, the bell, the obsession with time.</p>
<p>There all threads woven into a tapestry more complex than you ever imagined. And you&#x27;re right in the middle of it, you rise, stealing yourself and prepare to delve even deeper into this labyrinth of secrets, ready to confront whatever truths lie, buried beneath layers of dust and deception. You climb slowly, one foot in front of the other, up the winding catwalks of Camera 12. The rails are slick with condensation, your gloves damp, your arms aching. The hum of the broken bell behind you has softened to a near silent thrum, like a distant tuning fork still vibrating in a forgotten room.</p>
<p>And though it&#x27;s behind you now, you feel it watching more, a presence than a machine, the pendant, that quiet companion through all of this ticks again. Not urgently, not erratically, a soft, steady beat, rhythmic, almost calm. It&#x27;s the sound of something finishing, not beginning. When you finally step through the upper hatch of the chamber, back into the corridors above, your boots echo across the concrete like someone else&#x27;s footsteps. It&#x27;s quiet now, too quiet.</p>
<p>No wind through the tunnels, no pipes clanging, no machinery whining in the walls, just silence. The kind you only find in places where time has stopped bothering to move forward. You glance once over your shoulder. Everything below feels like it&#x27;s already fading into myth. This facility, it&#x27;s no longer a place.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a scar in the mountain and in you. You retrace your steps through the base, noticing small shifts. A door that used to be open is now welded shut. A corridor that was collapsed is cleared. A clipboard you left on the floor earlier now sits neatly on a hook.</p>
<p>Subtle, small, but enough to tell you you&#x27;re not in quite the same timeline anymore. The universe apparently has its own sense of humor. You push through the final airlock, blinking into daylight. It&#x27;s late afternoon. Cloud-filtered sun drapes the treetops below in gold.</p>
<p>The wind rises to greet you with a low sympathetic howl. The air tastes different, cleaner, lighter. Or maybe it&#x27;s just that your lungs are no longer filled with recycled air and lowgrade fear. You stand at the cliffside, looking down over the dense German forest, stretching in every direction like a green ocean. This was once a hiding place for the darkest secrets of the war.</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s peaceful, beautiful, even. But you know better. You reach into your coat and pull out the pendant, still silent, just a piece of glass and wire again. You close your hand around it, thumb brushing its surface. You wonderly cautiously if this little object ever truly measured time or if it measured something else.</p>
<p>Proximity to distortion, divergence, echoes, the passage of a self through alternate frames of reality. You stop asking. Some answers come with a cost. You tuck it away. Take one final look behind you at the hidden hatchway halfcovered in pine needles and stone and walk down the slope.</p>
<p>You came here for knowledge. You&#x27;re leaving with weight, not just from what you&#x27;ve seen, but what you now carry. The burden of knowing that the line between science and mythology is thinner than anyone dares admit that dialock was real. Worse it worked. And yet no one believed it.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the real horror, isn&#x27;t it? Not that the Nazis built something unnatural, but that we chose to forget. The war ended. The world moved on. But this place, it kept spinning in silence, alone in its timeline, waiting for someone like you to open the door again. You did.</p>
<p>And now you know it&#x27;s not over. It never was. asterisk. You&#x27;re back home now, lying in your bed. The covers are pulled up around your shoulders, and the familiar hum of your fan spins softly beside you, casting a gentle breeze across your face.</p>
<p>The darkness in your room feels safer than the one you left behind in the mountain. It cradles you instead of creeping toward you. You listen to your breathing for a moment, slow, steady, real, not looped or echoed or distorted by the whims of a broken machine. The images still flicker behind your closed eyes, don&#x27;t they? The fractured bell, the screaming reflections, the empty chair in the mirror room, a timeline split, a history erased, rewritten, folded in on itself like origami until even the scientists couldn&#x27;t remember who they were or when. But you remember not all the details, not every moment, just the feeling, the strange weight of standing in a place, where time itself forgot which direction it was supposed to flow, where echoes spoke louder than the present, where shadows were more honest than reflections.</p>
<p>But those moments are behind you now. You made it out. You&#x27;re still you, as far as you can tell. The floor beneath your bed isn&#x27;t humming. The air isn&#x27;t pulsing.</p>
<p>The light from the hallway doesn&#x27;t flicker when you move. All signs point to normal, familiar, safe dot. So you let yourself relax bit by bit. Let the tension drain from your shoulders. The stories slide from your thoughts like fog from a mirror.</p>
<p>Let your heartbeat settle into a slower rhythm. And feel the world come back into focus. Not the world of secret chambers and shattered timelines, but the one outside your window.</p>
